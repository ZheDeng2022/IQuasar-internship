    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how to better support fathers and their families after&#xD;
      incarceration. It will test an intervention that promotes healthy development for children of&#xD;
      previously incarcerated fathers and the caregivers of their children for empirical promise&#xD;
      through a pilot feasibility trial. The aims of the pilot are to demonstrate: a) client&#xD;
      acceptance of the treatment (e.g., retention), b) ability to recruit sufficient numbers of&#xD;
      participants, and c) feasibility of delivery with the clients and therapists in the&#xD;
      designated treatment settings. About 15 families (15 fathers, 15 caregivers, and 15-20&#xD;
      children, totaling 45-50 participants) will be in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the overall study, Promoting Healthy Development among Children of Fathers&#xD;
      with Antisocial Behavior, is to build and test a preventive family-focused intervention in a&#xD;
      feasibility study that promotes healthy development for children of previously incarcerated&#xD;
      fathers and the caregivers of their children. The study has three specific aims, two of which&#xD;
      have already been completed. The first was to conduct secondary data analyses to explore a&#xD;
      series of questions that explored topics including fathers' history of antisocial behavior&#xD;
      and criminality, children's psycho-social and behavioral health outcomes, father engagement&#xD;
      and parenting behavior, maternal parenting practices, quality of parental relationship, and&#xD;
      extended family involvement. The second aim included conducting semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with fathers, mothers, and relatives to improve understanding of the barriers to father&#xD;
      engagement and challenges that families face as fathers return to the community following&#xD;
      incarceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To that end, this protocol situates itself within the third and final aim, that of specifying&#xD;
      treatment procedures (e.g., develop manuals, select measures, specify therapist training and&#xD;
      adherence procedures) and establishing feasibility of the intervention (e.g., recruitment,&#xD;
      enrollment, fidelity, adherence, retention, and safety). Specifically, this protocol is in&#xD;
      regard to the feasibility of the intervention. The purpose is to test the intervention for&#xD;
      empirical promise through a pilot feasibility trial. The aims of the pilot are to&#xD;
      demonstrate: a) client acceptance of the treatment (e.g., retention), b) ability to recruit&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of participants, and c) feasibility of delivery with the clients and&#xD;
      therapists in the designated treatment settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family intervention is based in a family systems model that includes all members of the&#xD;
      family. Multiple family groups are used because previous research has found they are&#xD;
      efficient forms of service delivery, build social support among participants, and improve&#xD;
      parent-child interactions. Feasibility of the pilot must include all participants anticipated&#xD;
      in the program model to test strategies, logistics, and measures. Drawing from the framework&#xD;
      of dissemination and implementation science, another central purpose of the pilot is to&#xD;
      refine the operational methods that will facilitate translation and implementation in the&#xD;
      future should the intervention be found efficacious and effective. This pilot will answer&#xD;
      questions that are pertinent to intervention development, as well as the success of&#xD;
      dissemination and implementation in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathways for Parents after Incarceration (P4P) is a community-based program that seeks to&#xD;
      equip fathers with the skills both for positive father engagement and reentry success. It&#xD;
      uses a manualized curriculum that is adapted from a prison-based program, Parenting Inside&#xD;
      Out (PIO). PIO is an evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral parent management skills training&#xD;
      program created for incarcerated parents through a six-year collaboration of scientists,&#xD;
      policy makers, practitioners, and instructional designers. Both the information in the&#xD;
      program and the way that information is presented were informed by knowledge derived from&#xD;
      research and practice. Extracted from the full 90-hour version, the Pathways for Parents&#xD;
      after Incarceration program uses eight key lessons from the original version that have been&#xD;
      identified by the research team and those with lived experience as being most beneficial to&#xD;
      them. These include topics on effective listening, speaking, and problem-solving skills,&#xD;
      lessons on emotion regulation, and issues surrounding family engagement. The course is led by&#xD;
      2 parent coaches who will be interviewed by program leaders and formally trained to deliver&#xD;
      PIO by the PIO parent organization, The Pathfinder Network. The classroom-based PIO sessions&#xD;
      will be delivered over 8 weeks in two-hour sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the classroom component that PIO provides, the program will offer a&#xD;
      therapeutic component. Weekly, those receiving services from Pathways for Parents after&#xD;
      Incarceration will be invited to take part in a peer support group-style group session led by&#xD;
      an esteemed provider within the community, Anesis Family Therapy. This component of the&#xD;
      program is rooted in systems therapy and uses narrative therapy, trauma focused cognitive&#xD;
      therapy, and motivational interviewing techniques. This aspect promotes fathers' and&#xD;
      caregivers' ability to identify their values and skills so they can effectively confront the&#xD;
      challenges (both instrumental and relational) that they face during their reentry period and&#xD;
      as family members working to support the fathers. These sessions run for 45 minutes following&#xD;
      the classroom portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program (both classroom and therapeutic peer support) will be offered weekly on a weekday&#xD;
      evening for 8 continuous weeks (the 9th week will be a class graduation/celebration). The&#xD;
      sessions will be offered virtually to accommodate safety protocols related to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
