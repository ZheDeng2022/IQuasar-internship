    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional cohort study with an estimated&#xD;
      enrollment of 600 patients with acute DILI. According to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the RUCAM scale and/or expert evaluation, patients with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute DILI will be included in the study to establish a multi-center, prospective DILI&#xD;
      cohort. Depending on the presence or absence of associated chronic liver disease, the&#xD;
      patients will be divided into the basic DILI group with chronic liver disease and basic DILI&#xD;
      group without chronic liver disease. All enrolled patients should complete at least six&#xD;
      months of follow-up.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional cohort study with an estimated&#xD;
      enrollment of 600 patients with acute DILI. According to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the RUCAM scale and/or expert evaluation, patients with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute DILI will be included in the study to establish a multi-center, prospective DILI&#xD;
      cohort. Depending on the presence or absence of associated chronic liver disease, the&#xD;

      group without chronic liver disease. All enrolled patients should complete at least six&#xD;
      months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will propose a new or optimized DILI diagnostic scheme based on the analysis of&#xD;
      the problems existing in the practice of RUCAM scale, the clinical characteristics and&#xD;
      prognosis of DILI, the exploration of biomarkers, and all the comprehensive information of&#xD;
      big data from Hepatox platform, and establish a big data-based diagnosis model or auxiliary&#xD;
      diagnosis decision system.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No restriction on age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients need to meet one of the following biochemical thresholds for acute liver&#xD;
             injury recommended by the international consensus:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ALT &lt; 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ALP &lt; 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. ALT 3 ULN and TBIL 2 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The duration of liver biochemical abnormalities does not exceed 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the clinical diagnosis of acute drug-induced liver injury, the RUCAM scale â‰¥ 6&#xD;
             points is required. However, if the RUCAM scale score is 3-5 points, the opinions of 3&#xD;
             experts are needed to confirm the diagnosis of DILI, and the patients can only be&#xD;
             enrolled after the experts agree to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient signs the informed consent form after fully understanding the nature of&#xD;
             the study, the nature of his/her disease, related treatment methods, and the potential&#xD;
             risks associated with participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-drug induced liver injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An inability to complete the visits prescribed by the study&#xD;
