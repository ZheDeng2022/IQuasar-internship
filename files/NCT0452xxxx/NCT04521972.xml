  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today it remains a challenge to successfully both halt and induce labor progression.&#xD;
      Induction of labor is a common obstetric intervention that 1 in 4 women will experience. The&#xD;
      goal of induction of labor is to achieve a vaginal birth, however in almost 40% of first-time&#xD;
      mothers it fails. Failed labor inductions require a caesarean delivery, which is associated&#xD;
      with a vast range of adverse effects for both the mother and her baby. In this application we&#xD;
      propose that a simple manipulation of room light will increase the success of vaginal birth&#xD;
      through the use of optimal room light settings (halting labor=lights ON, promoting&#xD;
      labor=reduced room light/red room light).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sparse literature has shown that the hormone melatonin might be an important hormone to&#xD;
      consider during late pregnancy and labor. Pineal melatonin release is only released in&#xD;
      darkness at night, where nocturnal light such as room light, suppress pineal melatonin&#xD;
      release, reducing uterine contractions (Olcese et al 2013,&#xD;
      https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22556015/, Rahman et al 2019,&#xD;
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6453747/). Melatonin receptor become upregulated&#xD;
      in the pregnant myometrium (uterine smooth muscle), and a small study in women having preterm&#xD;
      birth, showed a high expression of melatonin receptor, at a gestational week where women not&#xD;
      having preterm uterine contractions, had low levels of melatonin receptor, suggesting that&#xD;
      premature increase in myometrium melatonin receptor might in some women be associated with&#xD;
      preterm labor and birth (Olcese et al 2013, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22556015/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address how room light impacts melatonin release and uterine contractions in&#xD;
      healthy pregnant women.&#xD;

      Overview of study layout&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indicated prenatal visit weeks are approximate time points. The prenatal visit only needs&#xD;
      to occur prior to the sample collection time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 1 (First interaction with patient). First trimester of pregnancy. Recruiting&#xD;
      patients who have an Ob/Gyn appointment to start prenatal care. During this visit we will&#xD;
      recruit women with confirmed pregnancy into the study. During the meeting with the Ob/Gyn,&#xD;
      the study goals and layout of study will be explained to the patient. The patient will not be&#xD;
      informed about the expected outcome of nocturnal light on uterine contractions and labor&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be provided with the consent forms and given time to read and ask questions&#xD;
      about the forms prior to signing. If the patient desires to read the consent form at home,&#xD;
      and enroll later, that is also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolling in the study, the patient will be given the below information to complete&#xD;
      during week 11 of pregnancy in their home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep, activity and saliva sample questionnaires (printout).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tubes and cooler to collect two saliva samples at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sample 1 is collected 0-3h after sunset&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sample 2 is collected 0-3h after sunset in darkness&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sample 3 is collected 0-3h after sunset with lights ON&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Note: Questionnaires are filled on the day of saliva collection. Patients will return&#xD;
           the frozen saliva samples and questionnaires at their next in person Ob/Gyn visit or&#xD;
           when they come to the Hoffmann laboratory in the third trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 2. Week 20-22 of pregnancy, in person Ob/Gyn prenatal care visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During visit with Ob/Gyn the patient will be given the below information to complete during&#xD;
      week 20-22 of pregnancy in their home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep, activity and saliva sample questionnaires (printout).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tubes and cooler to collect two saliva samples at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sample 1 is collected 0-3h after sunset&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sample 2 is collected 0-3h after sunset in darkness&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sample 3 is collected 0-3h after sunset with lights ON&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Note: Questionnaires are filled in the day of saliva collection. Patients will return&#xD;
           the frozen saliva samples and questionnaires at their next in person Ob/Gyn visit or&#xD;
           when they come to the Hoffmann laboratory in the third trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 3. Week 28 of pregnancy-assigning patients into study groups. During the prenatal&#xD;
      visit around week 28, the desired birth plan will be discussed with the patient. During this&#xD;
      meeting, the patient will not know what group they are assigned, nor how we expect the light&#xD;
      conditions to impact labor progression. The primary goal of this discussion is to determine&#xD;
      if the patient is anticipating a planned C-section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five study groups patients are assigned to are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Natural non-augmented labor with room lights ON. This is what is currently done in&#xD;
      the hospital, and thus does not change any current medical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Augmented labor with room lights ON. This group will be a subgroup of Group 1, as&#xD;
      labor-augmentation cannot be planned for until the patient is in labor or labor needs to be&#xD;
      augmented for medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Natural non-augmented labor with reduced or red room lights. Group 4: Augmented&#xD;
      labor with reduced or red room lights. This group will be a subgroup of Group 3, as augmented&#xD;
      labor cannot be planned for until the patient is in labor or labor needs to be augmented for&#xD;
      medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5: C-section. Scheduled and emergency C-sections. Uterine samples will be collected in&#xD;
      this group for ex vivo studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignments will be achieved through randomization as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women anticipating a C-section are assigned to group 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women anticipating a vaginal birth are randomly assigned to Group 1 and Group 3. This&#xD;
           will allow to have ½ women going through labor with lights ON, and ½ the women going&#xD;
           through labor with reduced room lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note On a monthly basis, we will evaluate the number of women who have given birth in Groups&#xD;
      1-5. Based on this we will readjust group assignments of women entering the study, to assure&#xD;
      comparable group sizes in groups 1-5 to the greatest degree possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 4. Third trimester: Weeks 32-34 of pregnancy We will schedule 2 appointments&#xD;
      during weeks 32-34 of pregnancy where the women are able to come to the Hoffmann laboratory&#xD;
      at MSU. One appointment will take place around sunset and be of a duration of 2-3h, starting&#xD;
      around 7-8PM. The second appointment will take place in the morning between 8AM and 12PM.&#xD;
      This appointment will be of ~ 90 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of these visits at the Hoffmann laboratory the study participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Be placed in the study room with a specific room light condition (bright white light or&#xD;
           dim red light).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study participants will fill out the sleep, activity and saliva sample questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study participants will have their uterine contractions measured for 60 min at the&#xD;
           morning appointment and for 120-150 min at the evening appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For details of this visit see Annex 1 (last page of this document)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 5. Third trimester: Weeks 38-40 We will schedule 2 appointments during weeks 38-40&#xD;
      of pregnancy where the women are able to come to the Hoffmann laboratory at MSU. One&#xD;
      appointment will take place around sunset and be of a duration of 2-3h, starting around&#xD;
      7-8PM. The second appointment will take place in the morning between 8AM and 12PM. This&#xD;
      appointment will be of ~ 90 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of these visits at the Hoffmann laboratory the study participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Be placed in the study room with a specific room light condition (bright white light or&#xD;
           dim red light).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study participants will fill out the sleep, activity and saliva sample questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study participants will have their uterine contractions measured for 60 min at the&#xD;
           morning appointment and for 120-150 min at the evening appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For details of this visit see Annex 1 (last page of this document)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 6. Evaluate labor progression and duration in rooms with lights ON and reduced&#xD;
      light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study participant is admitted to the hospital in labor, the following steps will be&#xD;
      done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Room light will be adapted as indicated in patient chart, and room light-intensity&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuously record uterine contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect saliva sample at admission, and every 2 h thereafter until 6h after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional steps for women having a C-section When a woman is scheduled to have a C-section&#xD;
      (planned or emergency), Dr. Hoffmann is notified by phone or text to 858 344 8389 at the time&#xD;
      of C-section scheduling. After delivery of the infant by C-section and removal of the&#xD;
      placenta, a full-thickness myometrial sample is removed from the superior edge of the&#xD;
      transverse uterine incision. The wedge-shaped sample, obtained by sharp dissection with a&#xD;
      curved Mayo scissors, is approximately 1 cm wide and 5 cm long. The samples will immediately&#xD;
      be placed in sterile containers and collected by a Hoffmann laboratory member for transport&#xD;
      to MSU where they will be stored in the -80C freezer and used for uterine contraction&#xD;
      analysis The myometrium sample is placed in a deidentified numbered tube and handed over to&#xD;
      experimenter to allow processing. Dr. Hoffmann or a participating Hoffmann laboratory member&#xD;
      will come to the hospital to collect the myometrium sample within 90 min after C-section&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In home delivery In the scenario of home delivery, all data points prior to delivery will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Home delivery will only impact the last study time point, as all data&#xD;
      collections prior to delivery are the same for all the study groups.&#xD;
