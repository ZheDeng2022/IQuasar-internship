  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluoroscopy is performed when placing a lead during a sacral neuromodulation procedure.&#xD;
      During lead placement, subjects will receive either conventional or experimental fluoroscopic&#xD;
      settings. The radiation exposure will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for lead implantation during sacral neuromodulation in the operating room&#xD;
      and consent will be included in this study. Placement of the lead in the operating room with&#xD;
      fluoroscopy is the standard of care in this procedure. Fluoroscopy is performed with a C-arm&#xD;
      and there are settings that change the radiation exposure. Patients scheduled to undergo lead&#xD;
      placement will be randomized to: a) the investigational (reduced radiation with fluoroscopic&#xD;
      settings) or b. the control (conventional fluoroscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon can change fluoroscopy radiation exposure by changing C-arm settings from the&#xD;
      reduced radiation to conventional fluoroscopic options. During the surgery, the surgeon may&#xD;
      change the settings from reduced radiation (intervention) to conventional fluoroscopy&#xD;
      (control) to safely place lead. The surgeon will use their judgment to optimally place lead&#xD;
      and maintain safety during placement. Any deviation from randomization will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm is defined: Reduced radiation fluoroscopy technique is performed by the&#xD;
      C-arm set at 1 pulses-per-second and reduction of current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm is defined: The standard of care in the conventional fluoroscopy, the C-arm&#xD;
      is set at 30 pulses-per-second and the current set at the default.&#xD;
