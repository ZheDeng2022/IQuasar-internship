  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves evaluating pediatric patients with central lines to determine differences&#xD;
      in line complications and quality of life in those with a novel central line securement&#xD;
      device (wrap) as compared to those who use a traditional securement device (dressing).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with central lines experience line breaks, line dislodgment's and line infections as&#xD;
      a result of traditional securement techniques (dressings). These issues lead to the patients'&#xD;
      increased health care utilization and possibly to restriction of movement and delayed&#xD;
      development as the children are restricted in their home environment. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if a wearable central line securement device, can decrease the number&#xD;
      of line breaks, line dislodgment and line infections as compared to traditional securement&#xD;
      techniques. The hypothesis is that the use of this wearable central line securement device&#xD;
      can reduce line breaks, line dislodgment and line infections as compared to the traditional&#xD;
      adhesive dressing. A secondary outcome for evaluation will be quality of life. Children are&#xD;
      naturally active, however their activity is restricted by the parents given the delicate&#xD;
      nature of their line. This study looks to see if quality of life can be improved a more&#xD;
      secure wearable attachment device, as compared to traditional securement techniques.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with central lines ages 0-18 years old who have never worn a wearable central line securement device (vest) will be eligible for the study. Half of the participants will be randomized to the device arm while the other half of participants will be randomized to the non-device arm. They will be block randomized based on age upon enrollment. Those in the device arm will be given two wearable central line securement devices and the investigators will encourage continuous wear. The study will follow participants prospectively for approximately one year (2020 - 2021).</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a central line ages 0-18 years old who have never worn a wearable&#xD;
             central line securement device (vest) will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those children who currently wear a central line securement device (vest)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with central lines who are 19 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those females with central lines and Tanner 2 breast or greater breast development as&#xD;
             a wearable central line securement device (vest) will not fit properly to secure the&#xD;
             central line and may increase the risk of the central line complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient does develop breast during the time of the study then the patient will&#xD;
             no longer wear the wrap and will go back to securing their device in the traditional&#xD;
             way. The investgators will still collect data on that patient and they will be&#xD;
             evaluated in the device arm consistent with the intention to treat principle.&#xD;
