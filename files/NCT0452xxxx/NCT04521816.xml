  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Implement a Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model that identifies and proactively&#xD;
      manages Veterans at the highest risk for hospital admission and death while the patient is&#xD;
      still in the ambulatory care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce emergency department and urgent care utilization, hospitalization, and mortality&#xD;
           in complex, high risk patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve Veteran and staff satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain the patient in the home setting as much as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secure appropriate home environment to facilitate health and well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utilize comprehensive team-based care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Engage appropriate Veteran Health Administration (VHA) programs to provide&#xD;
           interdisciplinary, coordinated, and timely management of complex medical issues&#xD;
