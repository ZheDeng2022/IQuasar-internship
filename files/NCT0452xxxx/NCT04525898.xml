    <textblock>
      Pain following surgery continues to be an important adverse outcome that may impact&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. Opioids like fentanyl and hydromorphone are the primary medications&#xD;
      used to provide analgesia, but paradoxically, may actually worsen pain when administered in&#xD;
      the operating room. Methadone is a unique opioid which has N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)&#xD;
      receptor blocking properties, which may prevent the development of opioid-induced tolerance&#xD;
      and hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain induced by a drug). Studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that methadone reduces the need for analgesic medications and decreases pain after surgery.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the addition of methadone to a standard anesthetic has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      increase patient satisfaction with pain management and reduce the need for opioid analgesic&#xD;
      medications during the first month after surgery. Some investigators have described methadone&#xD;
      as a &quot;opioid-sparing opioid&quot; and recommended its use as part of a multimodal pain management&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing interest in reducing the use of traditional opioids in the operating room.&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare pain scores and analgesic requirements in two&#xD;
      groups of patients; one group will be randomized to receive a small dose of methadone at the&#xD;
      start of surgery. The other group will be randomized to receive an equal volume of saline&#xD;
      (salt water-control group) at the start of surgery. We hypothesize that patients randomized&#xD;
      to be administered methadone at the start of surgery will have less postoperative pain and&#xD;
      may require lower doses of pain medications than those given saline-control..&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the development of a number of treatment strategies for pain after surgery, many&#xD;
      patients continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain in the early postoperative period.&#xD;
      Traditionally, opioids are the primary method of providing analgesia in the operating room,&#xD;
      postanesthesia care unit (PACU), intensive care unit, and surgical wards. However, a number&#xD;
      of potentially life-threatening complications can develop following opioid administration&#xD;
      including severe respiratory depression. In addition, studies have demonstrated an&#xD;
      association between the dose of opioid used in the operating room and the intensity of pain&#xD;
      after following surgery; paradoxically, the greater the dose of opioid administered, the&#xD;
      higher the reported pain scores are in the early recovery period. This is likely secondary to&#xD;
      two interrelated phenomena: tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Tolerance, a&#xD;
      pharmacologic concept, can develop acutely after a single dose of opioid in the operating&#xD;
      room. This can result in increased requirements for postoperative pain medications.&#xD;
      Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), a clinical concept, involves enhancement of existent pain&#xD;
      stimuli (normally minimally painful incisions may feel much worse) and facilitation of&#xD;
      chronic pain development. Therefore, it may be beneficial to use lower doses of&#xD;
      intraoperative opioids on all surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a multimodal approach to pain management has been demonstrated to reduce the&#xD;
      requirements for postoperative analgesic agents and improve pain scores. A number of&#xD;
      different agents have been investigated including gabapentinoids, lidocaine, steroids, and&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although it is an opioid, another medication that may&#xD;
      be considered as part of a multimodal treatment of pain is methadone. Methadone has several&#xD;
      unique properties that may beneficially impact the recovery of the surgical patient. It has&#xD;
      been extensively studied as an agent to provide prolonged postoperative analgesia. When&#xD;
      larger doses of methadone have been administered intravenously at induction of anesthesia, a&#xD;
      median duration of analgesia lasting more than 25 hours has been reported. In patients&#xD;
      undergoing abdominal, orthopedic, or gynecologic surgery, the use of a single dose of&#xD;
      methadone (20 mg or 0.2-0.3 mg/kg) before surgical incision resulted in improved analgesia&#xD;
      for the first 24-48 hours after surgery, when compared to other intraoperative opioids. In&#xD;
      these investigations, patients in the methadone groups required significantly less&#xD;
      postoperative pain medication and reported lower pain scores during the first or second&#xD;
      postoperative days. However, other investigations have demonstrated significant analgesic&#xD;
      effects of smaller doses of methadone (0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg). Furthermore, reductions in pain&#xD;
      scores and need for oral opioid medications for the first 30 postoperative days have been&#xD;
      observed in surgical patients administered 0.15 mg/kg of methadone. In addition to a long&#xD;
      plasma half-life, methadone has other properties which may be advantageous in surgical&#xD;
      patients. Recent evidence has demonstrated that methadone has the ability to block&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA receptors have been implicated in the development&#xD;
      of postoperative hyperalgesia (amplification of pain stimuli), and techniques which block&#xD;
      NMBA receptors reduce pain. Therefore, methadone may attenuate postoperative pain via this&#xD;
      additional mechanism. NMDA receptor stimulation is also thought to play an important role in&#xD;
      the development of chronic pain. Although unproven, it has been hypothesized that methadone&#xD;
      may reduce the risk of development of chronic postsurgical pain via inhibition of NMDA&#xD;
      receptors. No adverse events directly attributable to methadone have been reported in any of&#xD;
      the published clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized clinical investigation is to assess two cohorts of patients; one&#xD;
      group will receive a dose of methadone at induction of anesthesia (0.15 mg/kg ideal body&#xD;
      weight (IBW)-methadone group)). The other group will be randomized to be administered an&#xD;
      equal volume of saline in an identical appearing syringe (control group).. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be pain scores 24 hours after surgery. Secondary endpoints will include pain&#xD;
      scores on arrival and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and at 2, 6, 24,&#xD;
      48, and 72 hours (if the patient remains in the hospital) after surgery. Analgesic&#xD;
      requirements in the PACU and surgical wards will be assessed. In addition, the incidence of&#xD;
      potential methadone-related side effects will be measured (delayed emergence, nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, respiratory depression)). Furthermore, methadone has been documented to potentially&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain. A survey with a self-addressed stamped&#xD;
      envelope will be provided to patients at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery to complete to&#xD;
      assess the effect of methadone on this important outcome variable.&#xD;
