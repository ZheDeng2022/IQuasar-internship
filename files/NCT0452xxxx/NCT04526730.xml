    <description>Neoadjuvant Phase: (3 x 4-week cycles, total 12 weeks): At every cycle, intratumoral tavo-EP will be administered (on Days 1 and 8) concurrently with 480 mg nivolumab IV infusion on Day 8 of each cycle (tavo-EP will be administered prior to nivolumab infusion).&#xD;
Definitive Surgery Phase: Surgery may be scheduled about 2-4 weeks after the last dose of nivolumab following radiologic and clinical assessment at that point. Pathologic response will be determined by institutional pathologist.&#xD;
Adjuvant Phase: Adjuvant therapy with nivolumab monotherapy will begin approximately 2-4 weeks following definitive surgery; recovery from surgery is required (Day 1 of Cycle 4 will be determined by the treating investigator once the subject is cleared to initiate systemic therapy). Nivolumab (480 mg IV infusion on Day 1 of each 4-week cycle) will be administered for up to 9 cycles during the Adjuvant phase.</description>

    <description>The OMS (OncoSec Medical Electroporation Therapy System), a medical EP device system, consists of 3 components: 1. an Electroporation Generator that generates electric pulses, 2. a sterile Applicator Tip containing needle array, and 3. an Applicator Handle that connects to the Electroporation Generator at the proximal end and connects to the Applicator Tip at the distal end.&#xD;
Upon user activation of the attached Foot Switch, the OMS Electroporation Generator delivers controlled electrical pulses in a square wave pulse pattern yielding optimal transmembrane potential for electroporation to occur. EP pulses occur between 6 hexagonal opposing needle electrodes. After the first pulse, the polarity between the opposing needle electrode pairs is reversed and the needle pair is pulsed again. After the initial paired pulse, the pulse delivery is rotated clockwise to the next opposing needle pairs until a total of 6 pulses are delivered to complete the EP sequence.</description>
