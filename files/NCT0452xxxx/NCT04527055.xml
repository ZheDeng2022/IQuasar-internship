  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the major cause of gastritis, peptic ulcer&#xD;
      disease, and gastric cancer in adults. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended by a&#xD;
      recent review to be the first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication, replacing&#xD;
      clarithromycin-based triple therapy. It is because the eradication rates of triple therapy in&#xD;
      adults have declined due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. The best regimen for H.&#xD;
      pylori eradication should be the one which succeeds on the first attempt. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness and the optimal duration of bismuth-based quadruple therapy for first-line H.&#xD;
      pylori eradication in adults are unknown. Moreover, the impacts on gut microbiota after H.&#xD;
      pylori eradication should be concerned; for example, bismuth-based quadruple therapy&#xD;
      decreases F. prausnitzii richness. The transient perturbation of the gut microbiota after H.&#xD;
      pylori eradication were restored at 8 weeks and one year in subjects receiving&#xD;
      clarithromycin-based triple therapy but not fully recovered in those receiving bismuth-based&#xD;
      quadruple therapy. Therefore, the important issues are that the short-term and long-term gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis and the recovery of gut F. prausnitzii depletion in H. pylori-infected adult&#xD;
      patients after bismuth-based quadruple therapy. It is also uncertain the role of irreversible&#xD;
      gut dysbiosis even though H. pylori is eradicated in gastric persist inflammation and&#xD;
      progress to cancer, and whether probiotics could be helpful in recovering gut dysbiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic strategy to eradicate H. pylori infection is based on antibiotics; however,&#xD;
      this strategy not only increases drug resistant rates of the pathogen but also shapes the gut&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that bismuth-based quadruple therapy could be an optimal&#xD;
      regimen for first-line H. pylori eradication in the era of increasing clarithromycin&#xD;
      resistance; moreover, gut dysbiosis could be reversed after bismuth-based quadruple therapy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the efficacy of the10-day course is not inferior to that of the 14-day course in&#xD;
      H. pylori eradication. The investigators also hypothesize that probiotics could restore&#xD;
      gastric or gut dysbiosis, especially gut F. prausnitzii depletion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bismuth-based quadruple therapy is recommended by a recent review to be the first-line&#xD;
      treatment for H. pylori eradication, replacing clarithromycin-based triple therapy. It is&#xD;
      because the eradication rates of triple therapy in adults and clarithromycin-contained&#xD;
      sequential therapy in children have declined due to increasing clarithromycin resistance in&#xD;
      both adults and children. The best regimen for H. pylori eradication should be the one which&#xD;
      succeeds on the first attempt. However, the effectiveness and the optimal duration of&#xD;
      bismuth-based quadruple therapy for first-line H. pylori eradication in children and adults,&#xD;
      respectively, are unknown. Moreover, the impacts on gut microbiota after H. pylori&#xD;
      eradication should be concerned; nevertheless, the results are controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotic supplements are beneficial to gut health through modulation of the gut microbiota&#xD;
      and metabolomics. Our previous studies also reported that the efficacy of H. pylori&#xD;
      eradication is improved and relevant immune response could be modified by&#xD;
      probiotics-containing yogurt ingestion. Our preliminary data have shown that gut F.&#xD;
      prausnitzii depletion in H. pylori-infected children could be reversed after triple&#xD;
      eradication therapy with probiotics-containing yogurt ingestion. However, it is uncertain&#xD;
      whether the recovery of gut F. prausnitzii by probiotics could restore gut dysbiosis or&#xD;
      improve systemic inflammation, and the role of gut F. prausnitzii or metabolites in the H.&#xD;
      pylori-microbiota-host metabolism axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that bismuth-based quadruple therapy could be an optimal&#xD;
      regimen for first-line H. pylori eradication in the era of increasing clarithromycin&#xD;
      resistance; moreover, gut dysbiosis could be reversed after bismuth-based quadruple therapy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the efficacy of the10-day course is not inferior to that of the 14-day course in&#xD;
      H. pylori eradication. Among the H. pylori-infected patients, they are randomized to the&#xD;
      14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy group and the 10-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy&#xD;
      group to receive a 14-day and 10-day course, respectively, of the bismuth-based quadruple&#xD;
      therapy, including esomeprazole (Nexium 40 mg) 1 tab twice a day, dibismuth trioxide (KCB&#xD;
      F.C. 120 mg) 1 tab four times a day, metronidazole (Flagyl 250 mg) 2 tab thrice a day, and&#xD;
      tetracycline (250 mg) 2 tab four times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators also hypothesize that probiotics could restore gastric or gut&#xD;
      dysbiosis, especially gut F. prausnitzii depletion. The patients who still have depletion of&#xD;
      gut F. prausnitzii 12 months after H. pylori eradication are enrolled into the probiotic&#xD;
      supplement trial. They are randomized to the probiotic therapy group ingesting probiotic&#xD;
      powder twice daily for 24 weeks and the non-probiotic control group, respectively. The&#xD;
      probiotic powder is named as &quot;President AB powder&quot;, which contains an approximately equal&#xD;
      mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 at a concentration of &gt;=&#xD;
      10E9 CFU/mL (President Corp., Tainan, Taiwan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment: The investigators propose that the eradication rates in the 14-day&#xD;
      group and the 10-day group are 99% and 95%, respectively. The case ratio of the two groups is&#xD;
      1:1. If there is a true difference in favor of the 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy of&#xD;
      4% (99% vs 95%), then a total of 198 patients are required to be 80% (power) sure that the&#xD;
      upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided&#xD;
      confidence interval) will exclude a difference in favor of the 14-day bismuth-based quadruple&#xD;
      therapy group of more than 10% [Sealed Envelope Ltd. 2012. Power calculator for binary&#xD;
      outcome non-inferiority trial. [Online] Available from:&#xD;
      https://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/binary-noninferior/ [Accessed Sun Feb 14 2021]. Assuming&#xD;
      a surveying failure rate of 10%, at least 220 patients are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators propose that the rates of gut F. prausnitzii depletion before&#xD;
      and after probiotic therapy are 50% and 25%, respectively. With a two-side alpha value of&#xD;
      0.05 and power of 80% (β=0.20), the number of patients required is 92 in such a paired&#xD;
      sample. Assuming a surveying failure rate of 10%, at least 103 subjects are needed in the&#xD;
      probiotic therapy group. Moreover, according to case ratio of the probiotic therapy group and&#xD;
      the non-probiotic control group as 7:3, and the number required is 46 in the non-probiotic&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis is performed with SPSS software (SPSS 17,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). The Student's t-test, Pearson's χ2 test, and Mann-Whitney U test are&#xD;
      conducted to identify the statistical differences between the two comparison groups. One-way&#xD;
      ANOVA with Tukey's least significant difference, Pearson's χ2 test, and Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      one-way ANOVA by ranks and post hoc comparison by Mann-Whitney U test are used to identify&#xD;
      the statistical differences between the three or more comparison groups. Paired t-test,&#xD;
      McNemar, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test are conducted to identify the statistical differences&#xD;
      between the pair data. All of the tests are two-tailed with the statistical significance&#xD;
      defined as P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
