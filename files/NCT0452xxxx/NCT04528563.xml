      In children and adolescents (older than 6 years in age) who arrive in the pediatric emergency&#xD;
      department because they have been having 5 days or less of abdominal pain (possible&#xD;
      appendicitis), will patients who are treated with ketorolac get just as much pain relief as&#xD;
      those patients treated with morphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer this research question, we will need a large number of patients in a study. To&#xD;
      ensure we have enough patients, we must include many hospitals in different cities and&#xD;
      provinces in the same study. Before doing this, though, we must first test a smaller version&#xD;
      of the study in our center at McMaster Children's hosptial. The goal of doing this at&#xD;
      McMaster first is to make sure or understand:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We can enroll enough people in our study over 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We can make sure that all the information we collect from patients is complete and&#xD;
           nothing is missing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reasons behind why people don't want to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How satisfied patients and their caregivers were with the study&#xD;

      Background/Rationale: Appendicitis is the most common emergent surgical diagnosis among&#xD;
      children between 5-17 years in age and accounts for 8000 admissions annually. Diagnosing&#xD;
      appendicitis is time consuming (4-6 hours) as it requires laboratory tests and&#xD;
      ultrasonography. This occurs while patients experience significant abdominal pain secondary&#xD;
      to infection and localized or generalized peritonitis. Opioids have been the most prescribed&#xD;
      analgesic for patients with suspected appendicitis, despite an ongoing opioid crisis. Our&#xD;
      research shows that 60% of physicians use morphine or other opioids, while 40% will use&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or other non-opioids. Even though ketorolac&#xD;
      (NSAID) is commonly used in the Emergency Department (ED) for renal colic, abdominal pain and&#xD;
      migraine headaches, and has a safer side effect profile than morphine, all such uses in&#xD;
      children are &quot;off label&quot; as there are virtually no controlled trials for children to inform&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if it is feasible to conduct a large multi-centre randomized non&#xD;
      inferiority trial comparing ketorolac to morphine for treating moderate to severe abdominal&#xD;
      pain, in children 6 years in age or older, with clinically suspected appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that it will be feasible to conduct a large trial based on a&#xD;
      recruitment rate of ≥40% of eligible patients approached for consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Our trial is a single-centre, block randomized, non-inferiority, double-dummy,&#xD;
      doubleblind, feasibility pilot trial. Patients ≥ 6 years in age, who have ≤ 5 days of&#xD;
      moderate-severe pain as defined by our validated 11-point verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS)&#xD;
      ≥ 5 and are being investigated for suspected appendicitis with intravenous (IV) access in&#xD;
      situ or ordered, will be randomized to either: (1) IV ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg up to 30 mg&#xD;
      (intervention) + IV morphine placebo, or (2) IV morphine 0.1 mg/kg up to 5 mg (active&#xD;
      control) + IV ketorolac placebo. The total sample size is 100 participants. The study drugs&#xD;
      will be identical in appearance, consistency and smell. The double-dummy design will ensure&#xD;
      blinding is maintained for bedside clinical staff, research personnel and patients. Our study&#xD;
      prioritized patient comfort and will largely mimic standard care. Pharmacologic&#xD;
      co-interventions will be allowed but limited to acetaminophen (commonly used as first-line&#xD;
      therapy). Participants in both groups will be allowed rescue therapy (morphine 0.5 mg/kg)&#xD;
      within 60 minutes of our intervention. We will screen the ED daily for eligible patients as&#xD;
      well as include all eligible patients for the New Investigator Fund (NIF)-funded quality&#xD;
      improvement pathway we employed to streamline care for all ED appendicitis patients. We have&#xD;
      a robust research program in the ED that includes students, a full-time research coordinator&#xD;
      and several paid research assistants who screen eligible patients and approach them for&#xD;
      consent and enrollment. Our entire project can be completed with NIF support within an&#xD;
      18-month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Feasibility of our study design is the primary outcome of this pilot trial.&#xD;
      Primary feasibility outcomes include: (1) proportion of patients consented from total&#xD;
      eligible patients approached; (2) proportion of patients who completed clinical outcome&#xD;
      assessment; and, (3) proportion of missing items on individual data collection forms. Our&#xD;
      feasibility threshold is to recruit at least 40% of eligible patients who were approached to&#xD;
      consent. Other thresholds include recruiting ≥8 participants/month on average and having at&#xD;
      least 90% of participants complete all the outcome assessments at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Acute pain in children and youth is an area that is understudied and affects&#xD;
      thousands of Canadian children. Despite short -and long-term adverse effects including&#xD;
      dependence, and well designed comparative effectiveness trials, opioids continue to be&#xD;
      overused in surgical patients. Ketorolac is a promising well-established NSAID that is&#xD;
      available for IV, has a better short-term side effect profile and is not known as a substance&#xD;
      of misuse. Our pilot will provide valuable feasibility data for a larger, future multicenter&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 6.0 years to &lt;18 years: Children aged &lt; 6 years of age at low risk for&#xD;
             appendicitis and often present atypically.46,47&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Duration of abdominal pain ≤ 5 days: Children with longer durations of acute abdominal&#xD;
             pain are less likely to have appendicitis.18,48&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A clinical decision to investigate for appendicitis as a possible etiology by the ED&#xD;
             MD or RN. The physician or bedside nurse are suspicious of a diagnosis of appendicitis&#xD;
             as a cause for the abdominal pain as reflected by the initiation of the appendicitis&#xD;
             medical directive (an advanced nursing directive that allows nurses to order tests for&#xD;
             patients with suspected appendicitis) and order laboratory tests and/or advanced&#xD;
             imaging or directly consult pediatric surgery to rule out appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has an IV cannula in situ or ordered to be placed: we will not include&#xD;
             patients without an IV ordered or established in order to ensure the study&#xD;

             or respond to study questions&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Chronic pain requiring daily analgesic use for other indications (e.g. naproxen for&#xD;
             juvenile idiopathic arthritis): confounding&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic or duodenal ulcer disease or inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease, coagulation disorders, prior cerebrovascular bleeding, known&#xD;
             arterio-vascular malformations: Bleeding risk&#xD;

             infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of chronic and active hepatocellular disease (excludes biliary stones,&#xD;
             cholangitis or biliary duct pathology), as ketorolac is metabolized in the liver.&#xD;
