  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death in the Western Society.&#xD;
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or dysglycemia have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing CVD. Furthermore, T2DM have an increased risk of developing heart failure,&#xD;
      especially non-systolic, whether or not this is correlated to stepwise abnormal glycemic&#xD;
      status is not fully investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to investigate association between 1) Coronary plaque burden and&#xD;
      morphology to glycemic status (normal glucose tolerance (NGT), dysglycemia (impaired fasting&#xD;
      glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)) and diabetic oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      (OGTT) in participants without known T2DM), 2) Coronary plaque burden and morphology to&#xD;
      diastolic and systolic function of the left ventricle including 2D speckle-tracking&#xD;
      assessments, 3) Glycemic status to diastolic and systolic function of the left ventricle&#xD;
      including 2D speckle-tracking assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this descriptive study, 500-800 asymptomatic men aged 65-75 without known diabetes will be&#xD;
      included and divided into three subpopulations according to glycemic status. Blood sample,&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), echocardiography and Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) will&#xD;
      be performed at inclusion&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      death in the Western Society. Despite extensive research, risk estimation based on&#xD;
      traditional risk factors predicts risk in the general population but may not give an adequate&#xD;
      individual risk, and can thereby under- or overestimate the risk of future cardiovascular&#xD;
      event and therefore lead to either over- or undertreatment of a not ignorable part of the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2DM/dysglycemia and atherosclerosis: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is&#xD;
      rising rapidly. Furthermore, one study has reported that the prevalence of dysglycemia or&#xD;
      undiagnosed diabetes were as high as 43.8% among 60-year-old men. T2DM is known to be&#xD;
      strongly associated with an increased risk of CVD, but also dysglycemia has been associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of CVD. Thus, it is possible that there is a linear relationship&#xD;
      between stepwise dysregulated glycemic status and increased coronary plaque burden, but the&#xD;
      relationship has not been fully explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCTA: Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) can be performed with or without contrast. Contrast&#xD;
      enhanced CCTA has been found to be a valid and reproducible method of evaluation of both&#xD;
      extent and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques. Motoyama et al. reported spotty&#xD;
      calcification, positive remodeling, and LAP (non-calcified plaque) to be associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of development of AMI, especially when two or more patterns were co-localized&#xD;
      in the plaques. Thus, it might be possible that this type of plaque morphology is associated&#xD;
      with vulnerable plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography and T2DM/Dysglycemia: T2DM is correlated to a higher incidence of diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, which is thought to predispose to diabetic cardiomyopathy. In addition, subtle&#xD;
      left ventricular systolic dysfunction assessed by 2D speckle-tracking (also termed impaired&#xD;
      strain) was found in patients with diabetes and normal systolic function. To our knowledge&#xD;
      only few studies have investigated diastolic dysfunction and 2D speckle-tracking in patients&#xD;
      with dysglycemia and their results were mostly diverging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge no studies have investigated coronary artery plaque burden and morphology in&#xD;
      asymptomatic men aged 65-75 years with focus on the influence of glycemic status in&#xD;
      individuals without known T2DM. Due to the expectance of increasing number of patients with&#xD;
      T2DM and dysglycemia the coming years, it must be foreseen that the number of patients with&#xD;
      CVD will increase in this group of patients. It is mandatory that we increase our knowledge,&#xD;
      especially about the development of coronary atherosclerosis and left ventricular function.&#xD;
      We expect that this study will bring further light on these important aspects of dysglycemia&#xD;
      and hopefully give information to improve treatment and prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We plan to recruit 500-800 participants from the DANCAVAS study. More&#xD;
      detailed description of the Study population can bee read in &quot;Eligibility&quot;. Based on one oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) per participant, this population will be divided into three&#xD;
      groups; normal glucose tolerance (NGT), dysglycemia (impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)) and diabetic OGTT without known T2DM. We use the WHO&#xD;
      definitions in dividing the participants into the mentioned three groups of different&#xD;
      glycemic status. To date the use of OGTT in diagnosing T2DM, demands two measurements at two&#xD;
      separate days. Because of the measurement of only one OGTT in this study, the participants&#xD;
      with diabetic OGTT does not per se fulfil the criteria for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OGTT: Patients will be instructed in 8-12 hours fasting before the OGTT. Fasting plasma&#xD;
           glucose (FPG) will be measured. Thereafter, 75 gram glucose will be ingested over five&#xD;
           minutes. 120 minutes later plasma glucose (120-PG) will be measured and patients will be&#xD;
           categorized according to mentioned definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Echocardiography: Echocardiography standard measurements of left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
           systolic and diastolic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LV and left atrial volumes will be estimated using Simpson's biplane method of&#xD;
                discs in the 4 and 2-chamber views, and LV ejection fraction will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The mitral inflow pattern will be estimated in the apical 4-chamber view, and the&#xD;
                peak early (E) and peak atrial(A) velocities will be measured. Peak early mitral&#xD;
                annular velocities (e') will be estimated using tissue Doppler imaging. The&#xD;
                E/e´ratio will be obtained by dividing E by average value of e´.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Global left ventricular longitudinal strain (GLS):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Longitudinal systolic strain will be measured using 2D speckle tracking&#xD;
                echocardiography. This measurement will be obtained from views with an optimized&#xD;
                focus on the LV and a frame rate of about 60-80 frames/sec. Subsequently LV will be&#xD;
                divided into 18 segments. GLS will be calculated by the software as the mean value&#xD;
                of the peak systolic longitudinal strain of the 18 segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CCTA: The CCTA scan GE revolution will be used. CAC score will be evaluated using non&#xD;
           contrast scans from the DANCAVAS study. In our study, contrast enhanced scans using&#xD;
           256-slice, ECG-gated, will be performed. In order to regain optimal results, patients&#xD;
           with pulse &gt;60 beat/min will be given intravenous Beta-blockers and sublingual&#xD;
           Nitroglycerin spray just before the examination if not contraindicated. Depending on&#xD;
           BMI, tube voltage will be 120 or 100 kV and tube current 350-650 mAs. The collimation is&#xD;
           256×0,23mm with a gantry rotation time of 280 ms with 16 centimeters axial coverage per&#xD;
           rotation. The estimated total radiation dose for one contrast enhanced CCTA is 1-6 mS.&#xD;
           To reduce risk of contrast related affection of the kidney function a recent eGFR must&#xD;
           be obtained before scanning and patients will be sufficiently hydrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CCTA analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plaque burden The major proximal coronary segments; 1,2,3-5,6,7-11,12,13 are analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Per vessel analysis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent atheroma volume (PAV):(Total vessel volume-total lumen volume/total vessel&#xD;
                volume×100%)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total atheroma volume (TAV):(Total vessel volume-total lumen volume)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Normalized atheroma volume (NAV):(Total vessel volume-total lumen volume/mean&#xD;
                segment length)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plaque morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
           Per plaque analysis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LAP: defined as a non-calcified plaque (HU&lt;150) with a lipid core of &lt;30 HU.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Remolding indices (RI): calculated by lesion diameter/reference diameter, where the&#xD;
                reference diameter is from a normal appearing proximal segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Spotty calcifications (SC): defined as small calcified nodules &lt;3mm in length and&#xD;
                &lt;=90 degrees of the coronary arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Degree of stenosis: a significant stenosis is defining as &gt;70% of the luminal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All CTTA scans will be assessed by an observer blinded to patient characteristics. Semi&#xD;
           quantitative method using dedicated plaque software (QAngioCT Research Edition version&#xD;
           2.0, Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, Holland) will be used to assess the plaque&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Population characteristics: Baseline data will be collected from journal system and&#xD;
           questionnaires and includes demographic, former CVD disease, presence of T2DM and&#xD;
           information regarding the traditional risk factors (e.g. hypertension,&#xD;
           hypercholesterolemia, obesity and smoking).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blood sample: Blood sample includes e.g.cholesterol profile, HbA1c, Creatinine,&#xD;
           C-Peptide, Insulin etc. Additionally, totally 30 ml blood will be collected to form a&#xD;
           biobank for future research on the influence of inflammatory markers on atherosclerosis&#xD;
           and glycemic status.&#xD;
