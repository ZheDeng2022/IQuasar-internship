  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary atresia (BA) is the most frequent cause of chronic cholestasis in neonates,&#xD;
      accounting for at least 50% of pediatric liver transplantation. BA incidence is estimated to&#xD;
      range from 1:5000 to 1:19000 live births. All patients will die due to complications of liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis if the operation is not performed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#xD;
      transplantation has been found as a promising therapy for liver cirrhosis in adults. Bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived stem cell transplantation was also performed successfully for children with&#xD;
      BA. Compared to MSC isolation from bone marrow, isolating MSCs from umbilical cord (UC)&#xD;
      tissue is a less invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, UC-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis in adults and different pediatric diseases, including liver cirrhosis due to&#xD;
      primary biliary cirrhosis. The investigators will compare the outcomes of 17 Kasai operated&#xD;
      BA patients who receive UC-MSC transplantation to 17 BA patients who only undergo Kasai&#xD;
      operation. Two transplantations of UC - MSCs will be performed via the hepatic artery: the&#xD;
      first transplant will be performed at baseline, and the second one will be performed 6 months&#xD;
      later with a dosage of 1 million MSCs per kg of body weight. The frequency and severity of&#xD;
      the adverse events or serious adverse events associated with UC-MSC injection at 72 hours&#xD;
      post-injection will be used to assess the safety. The efficacy of the therapy will be&#xD;
      measured using Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score, liver function, and liver&#xD;
      biopsy. This study would open a novel cell therapy to improve outcomes of patients with BA.&#xD;

      The study protocol was approved by the Vinmec International Hospital Ethics Committee, and&#xD;
      National Ethics Committees. The stem cell products are conducted in accordance with (GMP)&#xD;
      requirements and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). All patients and primary caregivers will&#xD;
      receive a written consent form, a cover letter and a clear explanation of the safety issues,&#xD;
      potential risks and benefits, and the procedure involved. Moreover, patients will be provided&#xD;
      the updated results related to disease and the study during conducting the study and will be&#xD;
      fully funded by the project.&#xD;
