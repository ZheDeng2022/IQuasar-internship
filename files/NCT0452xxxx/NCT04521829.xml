      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of manipulating the optic flow speed in&#xD;
      the virtual environment on the gait pattern during virtual reality (VR) - enhanced treadmill&#xD;
      walking in people post-stroke. Furthermore, the study will also investigate if the level of&#xD;
      immersion has an effect on the rehabilitation outcomes by manipulating the optic flow speed&#xD;
      in two different VR devices: the semi-immersive GRAIL system and the fully-immersive 'Oculus&#xD;
      Rift S' HMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To properly understand the results of the people with a stroke, we will also investigate the&#xD;
      effect of manipulating the optic flow speed and the level of immersion on the gait pattern in&#xD;
      healthy people. That way, we can investigate whether virtual reality has a different&#xD;
      influence on the gait pattern of people with a stroke than in healthy people.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an experimental, 2-group, multicenter trial in which people post-stroke and&#xD;
      healthy people will perform 2 different sessions of treadmill walking. The 2 sessions will be&#xD;
      carried out on 2 separate days within 10 days. Both sessions will be identical, only the VR&#xD;
      system used to manipulate the optic flow speed will differ. The order of the 2 sessions and&#xD;
      the optic flow speed manipulation will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRAIL system: The Gait Real-time Interactive Lab (GRAIL) is an integrative motion capture&#xD;
      system consisting of 10 optical motion cameras (Vicon Inc., Oxford, UK), a dual belt&#xD;
      treadmill with integrated force plates, a 180-degree cylindrical projection screen system,&#xD;
      and D-Flow software (Motekforce Link, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The treadmill of the GRAIL&#xD;
      system has two modes: fixed walking speed or self-paced. For this study, the treadmill will&#xD;
      be self-paced, meaning that the patient is in control and can choose the walking speed. The&#xD;
      treadmill will follow the walking speed of the patient, which allow the patient to start,&#xD;
      stop and change speed at will. The projection screen of the GRAIL system will assure a&#xD;
      semi-immersive virtual environment. The GRAIL system is located in the Smart Space lab (UZ&#xD;
      Gent) and will be made available at the researchers of the VUB/UZ Brussel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head-mounted display (HMD): The HMD VR system 'Oculus Rift S' (Oculus, LLS, US) is a low-cost&#xD;
      HMD that fully integrates the user into the virtual environment by blocking out perception of&#xD;
      the real-world. The &quot;Oculus Rift S&quot; will assure a fully immersive virtual environment. The&#xD;
      researchers of the VUB/UZ Brussel have the HMD 'Oculus Rift S' in their possession and will&#xD;
      make it available for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both sessions will be carried out in the Smart Space lab at the University Hospital of Ghent&#xD;
      (Corneel Heymanslaan 10, 9000 Gent) where the GRAIL system is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of both sessions, some preparations will have to be done with regard to&#xD;
      the outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire (the Simulator Sickness&#xD;
           Questionnaire-Pre).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electrodes will be placed bilateral on the M. rectus femoris, M. vastus&#xD;
           lateralis, M. biceps femoris, M. tibialis anterior, M. gastrocnemius medialis, M.&#xD;
           deltoideus anterior part, M. deltoideus posterior part, M. latissimus dorsi. Electrode&#xD;
           placement will follow the SENIAM guidelines. The skin underlying the electrode will be&#xD;
           shaved and cleaned with alcohol to improve electrode-skin contact and reduce impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflective markers will be placed on fixed points of the lower and upper limbs of the&#xD;
           patient. Marker placement will follow the Plug-in Gait full body model (VICON). For this&#xD;
           model, the investigator will have to measure the following things in advance: body&#xD;
           length, body weight, leg length, knee width, ankle width, shoulder offset, elbow width,&#xD;
           wrist width, hand thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these preparations, patients will start to walk on the self-paced treadmill of the&#xD;
      GRAIL system. For safety only, patients will walk with the safety harness. Patients will&#xD;
      first be habituated to walking on the self-paced treadmill for 8 minutes without any form of&#xD;
      VR. Patients need this habituation trial in order to get used to the self-paced treadmill&#xD;
      system. After these 8 minutes, the treadmill will be stopped and patients will be seated for&#xD;
      a 5-minute rest period. During the rest period, patients will be asked to fill in two short&#xD;
      questionnaires (the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-1, the VAS scales).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRAIL session: After the 5-minute rest period, patients will walk for another 3 times 8&#xD;
      minutes with the VR. Patients are now walking while looking at a virtual environment that is&#xD;
      projected onto the projection screen of the GRAIL device (semi-immersive). The optic flow&#xD;
      will be different during each 8-minute walk. Between each walk, patients will rest for 5&#xD;
      minutes and during each rest period, patients will be asked to fill in a short questionnaire&#xD;
      (the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-2,-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HMD session: After the 5-minute rest period, patients will walk for another 3 times 8 minutes&#xD;
      with the VR. Patients are now walking while wearing the HMD 'Oculus Rift' and are being fully&#xD;
      immersed in a virtual environment (fully-immersive). The optic flow will be different during&#xD;
      each 8-minute walk. Between each walk, patients will rest for 5 minutes and during each rest&#xD;
      period, patients will be asked to fill in the a short questionnaire (the Simulator Sickness&#xD;
      Questionnaire-2,-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To end both sessions, participants will be asked to fill in 3 questionnaires (the Simulator&#xD;
      Sickness Questionnaire-Post, the VAS scales and the Igroup Presence Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the type of session will be randomized with 2 possible options: GRAIL - HMD or HMD -&#xD;
      GRAIL. Second, the optic flow speed manipulation (matched, slow, fast) within the session&#xD;
      will be randomized. The order of the manipulation will be the same in both sessions. The&#xD;
      first 8 minutes in each session will always be the one without VR. Thereafter, the optic flow&#xD;
      speed will be manipulated. There are 6 possible options for the randomization of the optic&#xD;
      flow speed manipulation: matched - slow - fast / matched - fast - slow / slow - fast -&#xD;
      matched / slow - matched - fast / fast - slow - matched / fast - matched - slow. The&#xD;
      randomizations will be done through block randomization in Microsoft Excel®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate (1) the effect of manipulating the optic flow speed and (2) the&#xD;
      effect of the level of immersion (semi-immersive GRAIL system with full-immersive HMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect optic flow speed has on the spatiotemporal gait parameters, kinematics, kinetics&#xD;
      and muscle activity will be compared with walking without VR. In a first stage, the data will&#xD;
      be visualized using LO(W)ESS smoothing (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) to explore&#xD;
      the observed effects over time (per condition and outcome), allowing for flexibility using&#xD;
      this quasi-nonparametric approach. Next, relevant values expressing onset, magnitude and&#xD;
      duration of the effect will be extracted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset: time point(s) at which the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is&#xD;
           exceeded. In case MCID is unknown, a 10% threshold will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnitude: magnitude of the maximum (or maxima) and time point(s) at which the maximum&#xD;
           is reached&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration: time between the onset and the time point at which the MCID (or 10% threshold)&#xD;
           is no longer exceeded&#xD;
&#xD;
      These values will be compared between conditions in a two-way repeated measures ANOVA (optic&#xD;
      flow speed * device). If relevant (based on the exploratory analyses), additional in-depth&#xD;
      statistics, such as functional data analysis, will be performed under the guidance of the&#xD;
      Department of Statistics and Data Analysis of our university.&#xD;
