      Background:- The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends postpartum family planning as a&#xD;
      critical component of health care that has the potential to meet women's desire for&#xD;
      contraception and save millions of maternal and infant lives in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries. Family planning is known to avert a higher number of maternal deaths and child&#xD;
      mortality. Closely spaced pregnancies within the first year postpartum are the riskiest for&#xD;
      the mother and baby, resulting in increased risks for adverse outcomes, such as preterm, low&#xD;
      birth weight, and small for gestational age. Adding the existing body of evidence use of&#xD;
      intervention strategies that promote and increase postpartum family planning in the&#xD;
      developing world is important. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of the use&#xD;
      of pamphlet supported by counseling during child immunization in improving the overall and&#xD;
      average time of initiation of postpartum family planning utilization in the first nine months&#xD;
      after delivery and assess its socio-demographic predictors in selected health centers of&#xD;
      Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Methods:- The study will use implementation science with a randomized&#xD;
      control trial study design. The study will involve mothers coming for vaccination of their&#xD;
      newborn child to selected three health centers that are under the catchment area of Tikur&#xD;
      Anbessa Teaching Hospital, in Addis Ababa. Eligible mothers will be randomly assigned into&#xD;
      intervention and non-intervention arms using computerized assignments assisted by an&#xD;
      envelope. Mothers assigned to the interventional arm will be given a pamphlet that advises&#xD;
      mothers about postpartum family planning followed by counseling service while women in the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm will take the routine immunization service given in the health services.&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed until the 9th month after the birth of the child. In the 9th&#xD;
      month after the birth of the child, during child vaccination for measles, women will be asked&#xD;
      for the starting date the first family planning service. A comparison of family planning&#xD;
      service will be made between the groups using logistic regression, using bivariate and&#xD;
      multivariable analysis. The study also will use Kaplan Meier and Cox-regression to compare&#xD;
      the median time of postpartum family planning and its correlation using SPSS for windows&#xD;
      version 26. The research will undertake from Dec 2019 to June 2021.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence shows that family planning is a cost-effective public health intervention with the&#xD;
      potential to reduce both maternal and child mortality. However, around 222 million women have&#xD;
      an unmet need for family planning, with the majority of these women living in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries. There were 213 million pregnancies in 2012, most of which ended in&#xD;
      birth. This number will certainly increase as the global population continues to grow, and a&#xD;
      large proportion of youth enter their childbearing years. Regardless of whether the growing&#xD;
      number of births are intended or unintended, they indicate an immense opportunity to reach&#xD;
      postpartum women with family planning for spacing subsequent pregnancies. Citing the&#xD;
      prospective definition of unmet need for family planning, which uses a postpartum woman's&#xD;
      fertility preferences looking forward at the time of the survey, as many as 50%-90% of women&#xD;
      from 17 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) report an unmet need for postpartum family&#xD;
      planning (PPFP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women frequently return to fertility and sex before initiating contraception after delivery&#xD;
      and do not necessarily understand the risk of pregnancy before the return of menses. For&#xD;
      instance, a report on Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data showing that in Bangladesh,&#xD;
      33% of women resumed sexual activity within 3 months postpartum, but only 7.2% were using&#xD;
      contraception. In Rwanda, these proportions are 73.6% and 1.7%, respectively. In all 17&#xD;
      countries analyzed, women were more likely to use contraception after menses returned than it&#xD;
      was before. Therefore, family planning is critical for saving the lives of women and children&#xD;
      in the developing world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends postpartum family planning as a critical&#xD;
      component of health care that has the potential to meet women's desire for contraception and&#xD;
      save millions of maternal and infant lives in low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This review aims to answer the research question: what recent interventions in LMIC have led&#xD;
      to improvements in postpartum family planning outcomes? Therefore, the purpose of this review&#xD;
      is to add to the existing body of evidence by casting a wide net in an attempt to capture the&#xD;
      recent intervention strategies that present the most promise for decreasing the unmet need&#xD;
      for contraception among postpartum women living in low- and middle-income countries (those&#xD;
      defined as &quot;developing&quot; by the World Bank). The postpartum period is defined here as the 12&#xD;
      months after delivery. The study will assess the effectiveness of postpartum family planning&#xD;
      (PPFP) interventions on clients' contraceptive knowledge, intention, and postpartum family&#xD;
      planning use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the promotion of family planning to delay conception after a recent birth&#xD;
      is a best practice that can lead to optimal maternal and child health outcomes. Despite the&#xD;
      above fact uptake of postpartum family planning remains low in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the study through the use of an intervention having thorough counseling&#xD;
      supplemented by pamphlets that will improve the awareness of women on modern use of family&#xD;
      planning methods will improve their unmet need for family planning during postpartum time as&#xD;
      a potential to contribute to achieving the Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan and&#xD;
      the Sustainable Development Goals. This study will help to understand the potential barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators of PPFP uptake and the findings will be useful in modifying practice among&#xD;
      the health care workers providing care at the maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH)&#xD;
      clinics. This will create as an opportunity for the health providers and policymakers to&#xD;
      learn to address the health needs of a community (they are working in) through a scholarly&#xD;
      activity which is one of the family planning competencies and could be directly involved in&#xD;
      the intervention plan to improve the gaps identified by working closer to the community.&#xD;
