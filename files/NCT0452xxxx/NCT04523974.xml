  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through multi-center randomized controlled trial studies on preemptive surgical intervention&#xD;
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) - secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), to&#xD;
      precisely evaluate the safety and effectiveness during perioperative period, and the&#xD;
      long-term outcomes by 1-year follow-up. The follow-ups include the evaluation of the overall&#xD;
      quality of life, calcium and phosphorus metabolism, hyperparathyroidism level, vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolism, bone mineral density, soft tissue and vascular calcification.&#xD;
