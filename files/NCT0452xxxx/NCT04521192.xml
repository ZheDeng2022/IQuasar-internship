    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of two different&#xD;
      specification of reference preparation capsules (10 mg/capsule, 40 mg/capsule and 100&#xD;
      mg/capsule, 1 capsule each) and test preparations capsules (50 mg/capsule×3). Two different&#xD;
      specifications of fluzoparib was provided by Jiangsu HengRui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of test preparations and&#xD;
      reference preparation fluzoparib capsules of different specifications in healthy subjects.&#xD;
