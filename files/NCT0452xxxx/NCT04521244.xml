  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the immediate effects of thrust versus non-thrust&#xD;
      lumbar manipulation in individuals with lumbar hypo-mobility on lumbar range of motion and&#xD;
      springing force tolerance. A randomized control trial was conducted at Max Rehab and Physical&#xD;
      Therapy Centre, Islamabad. The sample size was 18 calculated through open-epi tool but I&#xD;
      recruited 60. The participants were divided into two interventional groups each having 30&#xD;
      participants. The study duration was six months. Sampling technique applied was Purposive&#xD;
      sampling for recruitment and group randomization using flip coin method. Only 20 to 35 years&#xD;
      participants with grade one or two hypo-mobility at lumbar region were included in the study.&#xD;
      Tools used in this study are Goniometer, Inclinometers (lumbar Inclinometry using dual&#xD;
      inclinometer method),Digital Algometer, Self structured Questionnaire. Data was collected&#xD;
      before and immediately after the application of interventions. Data analyzed through SPSS&#xD;
      version 23.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A systematic and evidence based search of relevant literature was performed by utilizing&#xD;
      PubMed and Google Scholar as search engines and the key words used were lumbar manipulation,&#xD;
      hypo-mobility, spinal stiffness, non-thrust manipulation, lumbar mobilizations,&#xD;
      segmentalstiffness.The purpose of the literature review is to find out the pre-existing&#xD;
      literature regarding the Lumbar mobilizations and TJM interventions for Lumbar Hypomobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019 a systematic review conducted by Aoyagi et al on effectiveness of spinal mobilization&#xD;
      stated that there is a moderate to high quality evidence on Spinal mobilizations as effective&#xD;
      intervention in low back pain as it decreases pain and improve Range of motion In 2019,a&#xD;
      systematic review conducted by Hofstetter et al on Instrumented measurement of spinal&#xD;
      stiffness stated that mechanical devices revealed excellent reliability tool to measure&#xD;
      Spinal stiffness especially in prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by a chi Ngai Lo et al on Spinal&#xD;
      manipulation stated that HVLAT is highly effective as an treatment protocol then no&#xD;
      intervention or sham manipulation because it improves muscle strength in healthy population&#xD;

    <measure>Stanley Paris Grading (Self-Structured Questionnaire and Screening Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>It is 0-6 PIVM Grading system for manual grading of Rotatoric Movement.From 0-2 grades considered as Hypo-mobility. Grade 1 is considerable decreased movement and grade 2 is slight decreased movement at the lumbar region.As per my inclusion criteria, participants with grade 1 &amp; 2 hypo-mobility were included.On the basis of screening questionnaire, lumbar hypo-mobility was diagnosed by Stanley Paris grading system and after taking demographics in self-structured questionnaire, pre and post intervention values were mentioned in the Questionnaire.0 grade is no movement (ankylosis or fused) while 6 grade is complete instability.</description>
