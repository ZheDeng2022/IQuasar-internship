      Irisin is a myokine induced by exercise, that converts white fat tissue to brown fat tissue,&#xD;
      thereby increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure. The aim of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the relationships between serum irisin levels and glucose and lipid parameters in obese&#xD;
      children with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A total of 60 pubertal&#xD;
      obese children (age range: 11-18 years) will be included in the study. 30 of these patients&#xD;
      will be had NAFLD. The control group consisted of 28 healthy children who will be similar in&#xD;
      age and sex to the obese group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and related complications (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM)) have become an important public health problem. Their prevalence continues to&#xD;
      increase worldwide in children. Therefore, estimating potential biomarkers that can cause&#xD;
      obesity and related complications can be important in their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irisin, a myokine, first described by Boström et al. (5) in 2012, is released into the&#xD;
      circulation as a product of Fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) gene activated&#xD;
      by increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ɣ coactivator-1'&#xD;
      (PGC1)-α in the muscle cell along with exercise. The circulating irisin increases the&#xD;
      expression of UCP1 mRNA in WAT cells. As a result, WAT cells are converted into BAT cells.&#xD;
      Thus, irisin is involved in termogenesis and energy consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicting results have been reported in studies investigating the relationship between&#xD;
      irisin level and obesity and related complications. Irisin was thought to play a role in the&#xD;
      development of obesity. It has been suggested that it may be an alternative treatment agent&#xD;
      for obesity and glucose tolerance. In some studies, irisin levels were found to be higher in&#xD;
      obese children and adults than in healthy controls, low in some, and not different in others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data in the relevant literature about the relationships between childhood&#xD;
      obesity and irisin, as well as between NAFLD and irisin. In our study, we aimed to determine&#xD;
      whether serum irisin levels are related to anthropometric measurements and metabolic and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters in obese children with and without NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty obese pubertal patients (31 girls, 29 boys), aged between 11-18 years, admitted to the&#xD;
      pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic of our hospital wiil be included in the study.&#xD;
      These patients will be divided into two groups with and without NAFLD. Patients with another&#xD;
      disease or any drug use will be not included in the study. The control group consisted of 28&#xD;
      healthy children (14 girls, 14 boys) who will be similar in age and sex to the obese group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination will be done in all children. Body weight (BW) and height will be&#xD;
      measured. Body mass index (BMI) values will be compared with BMI curves according to age and&#xD;
      gender. BMI≥95.p will be considered as obese. Subcutaneous fat thickness will be measured&#xD;
      from the triceps and biceps regions by using a caliper. Waist circumference will be measured&#xD;
      in the horizontal plane midway between lowest rib and the iliac crest. Hip circumference will&#xD;
      be measured over the widest area of the hips. Waist-to-hip ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one night fasting, two venous serum samples will be taken for irisin levels and&#xD;
      biochemical analysis. Glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), ALT, AST, GGT&#xD;
      levels, insulin levels will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous serum samples for the irisin levels will be stored at -80°C until the analysis. Serum&#xD;
      irisin levels will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated using the&#xD;
      following formula: fasting insulin level (uIU/ml) x fasting glucose (mg/dl) / 405. A HOMA-IR&#xD;
      value &gt;5.22 in males and &gt;3.82 in females will be considered having IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatobiliary ultrasound (US) will performed for NAFLD&#xD;
