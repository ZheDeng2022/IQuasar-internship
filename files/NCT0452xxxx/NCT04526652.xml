  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there have been no studies done relating serum cortisol levels and intranasal&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine sedation. However, there was a behavioral study done on pediatric patients&#xD;
      confirming reduction serum cortisol levels with perioperative dialogue intervention.There&#xD;
      have been a number of studies done on adult patients indicating that dexmedetomidine was&#xD;
      indeed capable of reducing level of anxiety with evidence of lower serum cortisol levels.&#xD;
      Hence, we postulated that intranasal dexmedetomidine administration in pediatric patients&#xD;
      will lower the serum cortisol levels but we need to evaluate the extent of reduction.&#xD;

      Justification of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increase in number of pediatric patients undergoing surgery, efforts need to be placed&#xD;
      on improving quality of perioperative care and patient comfort Intranasal administration of&#xD;
      sedative agents will be far more comfortable and create a better environment for patients as&#xD;
      most children have a fear of needles and may resist intravenous drug administration&#xD;
      Intranasal administration is also a far simpler and less time-consuming technique with good&#xD;
      bioavailability of administered drugs Reduction in postoperative analgesia requirement will&#xD;
      result in early return to daily life activities, early discharge and overall reduced length&#xD;
      of stay and hospital costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and intraoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      All perioperative data will be collected by an investigator who is blinded to the patient's&#xD;
      allocation. Once the caregiver has agreed and consented to participate in this study, upon&#xD;
      admission (1 day prior to scheduled surgery) a baseline serum cortisol level will be taken&#xD;
      concurrent with IV line setting and blood investigations. The fasting time for all patients&#xD;
      will be at least 6 hours prior to surgery with clear fluids being allowed up to 2 hours prior&#xD;
      to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, the patient and caregiver will be called upon 1 hour prior to&#xD;
      operating time and baseline hemodynamic parameters will be recorded (blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and pulse oximetry SpO2). Baseline Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS)&#xD;
      will be used as an assessment tool for measuring level of preoperative anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety scale (m-YPAS) is an established and recognized&#xD;
      tool for assessment of pediatric anxiety levels preoperatively. It is an observational&#xD;
      checklist each consisting of four to six distinct behavioral descriptions. Four categories of&#xD;
      behavior are assessed: activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, and state of apparent&#xD;
      arousal. Partial weights are used to calculate a total score ranging from 23 (low anxiety) to&#xD;
      100 (high anxiety). Previous research has shown good to excellent inter and intra-observer&#xD;
      reliability and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the baseline parameters have been recorded, patient will receive the medication&#xD;
      previously assigned via randomization delivered via mucosal atomizer device (MAD). Drugs will&#xD;
      be administered by anesthetist or anesthetic medical officer only in safe setting with drugs&#xD;
      for resuscitation and monitoring equipment available. They will be briefed on the workflow&#xD;
      and timing of drug administration accordingly. The person responsible for delivering the&#xD;
      medication will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters will be charted at 10 minutes intervals after the study medications&#xD;
      have been served. Rescue drugs IV atropine 10 - 20mcg/kg will be given if the patient&#xD;
      develops bradycardia (less than 2SDs for age) and fluid boluses if blood pressure drops to&#xD;
      more than 20% of baseline or below 2SD of blood pressure for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) will be assessed 10 minutes after&#xD;
      delivering the study medications. This is followed by sedation score after 30 minutes and&#xD;
      3rd. m-YPAS if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation and behavior score is a simplified scoring system that is based on observational&#xD;
      charting. It comprises of 2 domains ranging from alert, awake, crying and resisting to asleep&#xD;
      and not responding to mild prodding or shaking while being calm and cooperative. Higher&#xD;
      scores indicate a higher level of sedation and are more favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has arrived in the operation theatre, the SpO2 monitoring probe will be&#xD;
      attached and intravenous induction is carried out with IV Propofol 4 - 5mg/kg. This is&#xD;
      followed by applying other standard monitoring appliances such as blood pressure cuff and ECG&#xD;
      electrodes. IV fentanyl 1-2mcg/kg to obtund the laryngeal reflex and paralysis with IV&#xD;
      esmeron 0.6-1mg/kg. Appropriate size endotracheal tubes (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA)&#xD;
      will be inserted accordingly to secure the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd sample of serum cortisol level will be taken within 10 minutes of induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane aiming at 1.0 minimum alveolar&#xD;
      concentration (MAC). Intravenous fluid will be replaced according to (Holiday Segar Formula)&#xD;
      using either HM solution or sterofundin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV paracetamol 15mg/kg will be given pre-emptively, followed by IV morphine 0.1mg/kg. IV&#xD;
      Fentanyl boluses 0.5-1mcg/kg will be served if required based on the hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively patient will be monitored in recovery room for 30 minutes and pain will be&#xD;
      assessed using Wong Baker Faces pain rating scale/FLACC for smaller children. Rescue&#xD;
      analgesic IV Fentanyl 0.5-1mcg/kg will be given if required. The total requirement of IV&#xD;
      Fentanyl and the discharge time will be recorded for reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wong Baker Faces scale is tool created with children to help them communicate their pain. Now&#xD;
      the scale is used around the world with people ages 3 and older, facilitating communication&#xD;
      and improving assessment so pain management can be addressed accordingly. There are 6 faces&#xD;
      with each face representing a person who has no pain (hurt), or some, or a lot of pain. The&#xD;
      patient chooses the face that best depicts the pain they are experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FLACC scale or Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale is a measurement used to&#xD;
      assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals that are&#xD;
      unable to communicate their pain. It is an observational based scale. The scale is scored in&#xD;
      a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain. The scale has five criteria, which are each&#xD;
      assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. Higher scores indicate higher pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0. The&#xD;
      data will be manually entered into the software before the cleaning process takes place. The&#xD;
      cleaning process is crucial to prevent any errors that may skew the results. After that, the&#xD;
      actual analysis process will be carried out. In this study, descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      employed for selected variables. The findings will be presented based on the types of data&#xD;
      and their distribution. Categorical Data, will be presented as frequencies and percentage.&#xD;
      Numerical Data will be presented as means and standard deviations if normally distributed,&#xD;
      and if not, as medians and interquartile ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of Numerical Data between two independent groups that are normally distributed&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the Independent t-test, while Mann-Whitney test will be used if the&#xD;
      data for two independent groups are not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters measurement (objective 3) will be analyzed using repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA while Friedman test will be used if the Numerical Data are not normally distributed.&#xD;
      All probability values are two-sided, and a level of significance of less than 0.05 (p-value&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05) will be considered as statistically significant&#xD;
