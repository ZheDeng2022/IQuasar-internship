    <textblock>
      Single-center, Prospective, Open Label, with Before-After Study Design. Up to 25 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled to the study to provide at least 20 evaluable subjects. Subjects will be&#xD;
      examined to determine the severity and extent of actinic keratoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo 1-3 treatments (determined by their clinical improvement), 3-4&#xD;
      weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits after the last treatment visit: 4 weeks (±7 days), 12 weeks (±7 days), 52&#xD;
      weeks (±14 days) - the last follow up visit is a voluntary one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria would be mild to moderate thickness confluent actinic keratoses&#xD;
      located to scalp and/or face.&#xD;
