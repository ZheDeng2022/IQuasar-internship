      The study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Multiple Target Kinase&#xD;

      We will recruit four types of advanced thyroid cancer patients. Arm A will enroll the&#xD;
      radioactive Iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer(RAIR-DTC). Arm B will recruit the&#xD;
      advanced medullary thyroid cancer(MTC). Arm C will include the advanced anaplastic thyroid&#xD;
      cancer(ATC). Arm D will include the differentiated thyroid cancer that unsuitable for 131I&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For arm A, the first stage needs 8 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire remission,&#xD;
      the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 16 patients to achieve a total&#xD;
      number of 24 participants enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For arm B, the first stage needs 8 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire remission,&#xD;
      the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 16 patients to achieve a total&#xD;
      number of 24 participants enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For arm C, the first stage needs 13 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire&#xD;
      remission, the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 30 patients to&#xD;
      achieve a total number of 43 participants enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For arm D, the first stage needs 8 participants, if 4 or more participants acquire remission,&#xD;
      the study will move on to the second stage and enroll another 16 patients to achieve a total&#xD;
      number of 24 participants enrolled.&#xD;
