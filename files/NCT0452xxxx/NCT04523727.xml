&#xD;
          -  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring chronic dialysis (i.e., hemodialysis or&#xD;
             peritoneal dialysis), or CKD not on dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate (eGFR) &lt;30 milliliters per minute (ml/min)/1.73 meters squared (m^2) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of CKD-related hyperphosphatemia of/secondary to CKD, with at least&#xD;
             1 of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum phosphorus level at Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  6 to &lt;13 years: &gt;5.8 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  13 to &lt;18 years: &gt;4.5 mg/dl, and/or:&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current use of phosphate binders for treatment of hyperphosphatemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;50% at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum ferritin &lt;500 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/legal guardian must be willing and able to give written informed consent, and&#xD;
             child (participant) willing and able to give age-appropriate assent according to local&#xD;
             regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential, defined as post menarche and not&#xD;
             surgically sterile, must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active significant gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, including overt GI bleeding or&#xD;
             active inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             [ALT]) &gt;3× the upper limit of normal at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow pills, or tube feeding required (Note: If participant requires tube&#xD;
             feeding, ferric citrate must be taken orally and not administered via feeding tube.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-renal cause of hyperphosphatemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol dependence or abuse (excluding tobacco use or medicinal&#xD;
             marijuana) within the 12 months prior to Screening or evidence of such abuse (in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy, except for participants who have been disease-free for at least 2 years&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A known allergy or intolerance to ferric citrate or any of its constituents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding, if female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, renders the&#xD;
             participant unable to or unlikely to complete the trial or that would interfere with&#xD;
             optimal participation in the trial or produce significant risk to the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to the&#xD;
             requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any investigational drug within 4 weeks before Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hemochromatosis or iron overload syndrome (e.g., hereditary sideroblastic&#xD;
             anemia, thalassemia)&#xD;
