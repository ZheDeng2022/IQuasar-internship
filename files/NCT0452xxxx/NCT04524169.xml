  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic pain is the most common clinical symptom in elderly patients. The course of pain&#xD;
      is prolonged and the effect of clinical treatment is limited. This study will observe the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of thymosin alpha 1 on elderly patient with osteoporotic pain and explore&#xD;
      its immunotherapy mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 70% of the elderly patients suffered osteoporotic pain, mainly involving the limbs and&#xD;
      low back. The pain prolonged and varies from mild to severe, and the effect of the clinical&#xD;
      treatment is poor which has become a serious social problem. Recent studies have put forward&#xD;
      a new point of &quot;bone Immunology&quot;, which suggests that immune system, especially CD4+ T cell&#xD;
      system, are involved in the regulation of bone formation, bone resorption and bone&#xD;
      remodeling. So, in this study, the investigators will observe the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      thymosin alpha 1 on osteoporotic pain in elderly by observing the improvement of VAS score&#xD;
      before and after the treatment, as well as the changes of proportion of peripheral blood CD4+&#xD;
      T lymphocyte subsets, bone mineral density, serum bone biochemical index, neuropeptides,&#xD;
      RANKL and other cytokines levels will be evaluated. The clinical safety of thymosin alpha 1&#xD;
      in elderly patients with osteoporotic pain will also be observed.&#xD;

    <description>The VAS (visual analogue scale) is a scale used to determine the pain intensity experienced by individuals. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain&quot;, &quot;0&quot; means no pain, &quot;10&quot; means severe worst pain. In our study VAS score will be record before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change of BMD value</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>A bone mineral density (BMD) test is an easy, reliable test that measures the thickness of the bones and the response to osteoporosis treatment. We perform the BMD test by X-rays and record participants' BMD values before and after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>
