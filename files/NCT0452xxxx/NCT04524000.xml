  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of alpelisib plus fulvestrant&#xD;
      in men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced breast cancer harboring a PIK3CA mutation in Japan, whose&#xD;
      disease has progressed on or after aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment regardless of prior&#xD;
      CDK4/6 inhibitor use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open-label, 2-Part, multi-center study in Japan. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two parts: Part 1 (Cohort 1) includes participants regardless of prior CDK4/6&#xD;
      inhibitor use and is designed to determine the recommended dose (RD), evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant. Part 2 consists of 2&#xD;
      cohorts (the CDK4/6 inhibitor naive participants are in Cohort 2 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor&#xD;
      pre-treated participants are in Cohort 3) which are designed to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant, will start once the RD of alpelisib is&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason and will be followed for&#xD;
      survival regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if consent is withdrawn or&#xD;
      participant is lost to follow up).&#xD;
