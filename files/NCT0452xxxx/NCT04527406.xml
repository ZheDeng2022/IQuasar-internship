  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early treatment of congenital hemivertebrae is very important. The investigators design this&#xD;
      study to figure out how early hemivertebrae resection be apply to children. Children aged 3-5&#xD;
      years old diagnosed as congenital hemivertebrae will be randomly divided into early operation&#xD;
      group and control group. The early operation group will undergo posterior hemivertebra&#xD;
      resection. The control group received brace plaster fixation to reduce the progression of&#xD;
      scoliosis, and then will undergo operation after 5 years old. Primary Outcome Measure is the&#xD;
      length of spine surgery.&#xD;

      Early diagnosis and early effective treatment of congenital hemivertebrae can correct the&#xD;
      deformities.Therefore, traditionally, children with a clear diagnosis should be fixed with a&#xD;
      brace to delay the aggravation of scoliosis and then undergo surgery after 5 years of age.&#xD;
      The design of this study is to conduct a single-center randomized controlled study. Children&#xD;
      aged 3-5 years old diagnosed as congenital hemivertebrae will be randomly divided into the&#xD;
      early operation group and the control group. The early operation group will undergo posterior&#xD;
      hemivertebra resection. The control group received brace plaster fixation to reduce the&#xD;
      progression of scoliosis, and posterior scoliosis correction will be performed after the age&#xD;
      was over 5 years old. The primary outcome measures are the length of spine surgery for the&#xD;
      two groups of children. The secondary outcome measures are change of scoliosis cobb angle, by&#xD;
      comparing preoperative and postoperative cobb angle changes. It is expected that the early&#xD;
      treatment group will shorten the length of surgery due to the smaller degree of scoliosis.&#xD;
      Our research is expected to broaden the age-adaptation of classic spinal surgery in the field&#xD;
      of pediatric spine.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects in early surgical group are arranged to be admitted to for surgical treatment very soon. The operation choice is posterior hemivertebrae resection + posterior pedicle screw placement + scoliosis correction. During operation pedicle screws are placed in the adjacent vertebrae of the head and tail of the Hemivertebra. Wedge resection of the hemivertebrae is performed afterward. Finally, two rods are placed between the pedicle screws. Intraoperative fluoroscopy confirms that the internal fixation position is good.</description>

    <description>In traditional surgical group, subjects received conservative treatment firstly with custom-made braces to delay the progression of scoliosis. It is planned to use the classic posterior hemivertebrae resection + posterior pedicle screw placement + scoliosis correction to complete the correction around the age of 5. The operation choice is identical with early surgical group. During operation pedicle screws are placed in the adjacent vertebrae of the head and tail of the Hemivertebra. Wedge resection of the hemivertebrae is performed afterward. Finally, two rods are placed between the pedicle screws. Intraoperative fluoroscopy confirms that the internal fixation position is good.</description>
