  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RESOLVE study is a multicenter comparative effectiveness trial of cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) delivered via two telehealth modalities: 1) web-based&#xD;
      application and 2) live, coach-led, virtual sessions (telephone and/or video conference).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aims Aim #1: Determine the effectiveness of a web-based CBT-CP program and virtual&#xD;
      coach-led (telephonic/video) CBT-CP on achieving clinically meaningful improvements in&#xD;
      patients' pain severity (pain intensity + pain-related interference) relative to those&#xD;
      receiving usual care at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Examine the impact of the active interventions on secondary pain outcomes and related&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes (social role functioning, physical functioning, and patient global&#xD;
      impression of change); as well as exploratory outcomes, which include long-term opioid use;&#xD;
      comorbid symptomology (depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance); and high impact chronic&#xD;
      pain and graded chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. Conduct subgroup analyses to determine the impact of the active interventions on specific&#xD;
      populations and explore for potential heterogeneity of treatment effects by sex;&#xD;
      rural/medically underserved residency; multiple pain conditions; mental health mood&#xD;
      disorders; and negative social determinants of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1c. Examine the role of theory-based mediators, pain catastrophizing, pain-related&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and perceived support, on pain-severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Assess the cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of the web-based and virtual&#xD;
      coach-led CBT-CP interventions compared to each other and usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Conduct a qualitative evaluation to understand: 1) patient experiences of the&#xD;
      interventions, including how they relate to treatment response, variability by site, and&#xD;
      rural/medically underserved residency status; and 2) health system issues, including&#xD;
      adaptations and contextual factors at the site and external levels, barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      to intervention success and potential for adoption, sustainability and dissemination.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Primary and secondary outcome assessors will be masked to treatment assignment. It is not feasible for participants to be masked to treatment arm assignment due to the type of intervention. The PI and select Co-Investigators and study staff who are involved in the oversight and delivery of the interventions will also be aware of treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <measure>Achieving minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in pain severity at 3 months (yes/no)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in pain severity is defined as a 30% decrease in score on modified 11-item version of the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) from baseline (consistent with Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) guidelines) (binary). Range: 0 to 10. Higher score = worse pain severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Patient health care utilization costs from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health care utilization and intervention costs will be assessed.&#xD;
Using the framework of cost-effectiveness, we will estimate the incremental cost per additional patient with a MCID in pain severity (30% reduction from baseline), at 12 months, and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained-utilities will be estimated using the EQ-5D-5L.</description>
