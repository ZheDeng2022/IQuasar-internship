  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the randomised controlled study (RCT) is to identify novel strategies that can&#xD;
      improve the luteal phase endocrinology after ovarian stimulation, with the aim of using less&#xD;
      or no luteal support in IVF while making the endometrium thinner and more receptive to embryo&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high estradiol levels generated in IVF by multiple dominant follicles at the&#xD;
      follicular-luteal phase transition generate powerful negative feedback at the pituitary&#xD;
      gland, effectively switching off gonadotropin production. Without stimulation by endogenous&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH), the corpora lutea undergo involution and menstruation follows,&#xD;
      preventing the establishment of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these detrimental effects of ovarian stimulation, the investigators will do a RCT&#xD;
      with the use of aromatase inhibitors, which suppress the conversion of androgens to estrogens&#xD;
      to ameliorate the unwanted effects of high estrogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that preventing supra-physiological estrogen&#xD;
      levels during ovarian stimulation restricts pituitary suppression sufficiently to allow LH&#xD;
      levels to rise and support the corpora lutea, leading to a normal post-ovulatory luteal&#xD;
      phase, evidenced by a normal duration and luteal phase endocrine profile. To test this,&#xD;
      consenting oocyte donors will be randomized to receive co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      or no co-treatment during ovarian stimulation. Following oocyte retrieval, no luteal support&#xD;
      will be provided to donors in both Groups.&#xD;
