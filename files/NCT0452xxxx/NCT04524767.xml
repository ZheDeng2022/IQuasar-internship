  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to employ Community Health Workers (CHWs) to screen for&#xD;
      depression in 30 Black churches and compare the effectiveness of Screening, Brief&#xD;
      Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) (Intervention arm) to Referral As Usual&#xD;
      (Control arm) on treatment engagement for depression. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      patient-level outcomes (Mental-Health Related Quality of Life and depressive symptoms) at 3-&#xD;
      and 6-months post-screening and conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess&#xD;
      multi-level facilitators and barriers of screening uptake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African American adults (AAs), compared to White adults, are half as likely to be screened&#xD;
      for depression in primary care settings. Disparities in depression screening contribute to&#xD;
      poor clinical outcomes, as AAs with depression are more disabled, sicker longer, and less&#xD;
      likely to seek treatment compared to Whites. Black churches are trusted settings that provide&#xD;
      &quot;de facto&quot; mental health services for depression. Indeed, in the first study of its kind, the&#xD;
      study team found that 20% of adults in Black churches screened positive for depression using&#xD;
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). However, no subjects with a positive screen&#xD;
      (PHQ-9 ≥10) accepted a treatment referral when offered by research coordinators onsite for&#xD;
      each screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are trusted para-professionals from the target&#xD;
      community, may bridge the gap between depression screening and treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      have trained and certified 102 CHWs from 42 Black churches in Harlem, New York to deliver an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention called Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment&#xD;
      (SBIRT), which is centered on culturally tailored Motivational Interviewing (MI). Thus, the&#xD;
      scientific premise of this study is that employing CHWs to implement depression screening in&#xD;
      Black churches will bridge the gap between church-based depression-screening and engagement&#xD;
      with clinical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation design, the investigators propose a 2-arm,&#xD;
      mixed-methods Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial within 30 Black churches our CHWs currently&#xD;
      attend. Based on our pilot data, the investigators expect 20% of adults (n=600) to have a&#xD;
      positive depression screen. Adults will be randomized based on church study site to either&#xD;
      SBIRT (n=15 churches) or Referral As Usual (RAU, n=15 churches). The investigators will then&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of SBIRT (Intervention arm) to RAU (Usual Care arm) on treatment&#xD;
      engagement (primary outcome), defined as attending a depression-related clinical visit for&#xD;
      which the subject reported receiving information, referral, counseling, or medication for&#xD;
      depression (Aim 1). The investigators will then compare changes in Mental Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) at 3- and 6-months&#xD;
      post-screening (Aim 2). Finally, the investigators will conduct a concurrent, mixed-methods&#xD;
      (qualitative-quantitative) process evaluation to assess contextual facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      of screening and referral (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <description>Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an evidence-based approach designed to provide screening, brief intervention, and referral to more intensive treatment for people at risk of developing mental disorders, including depression. SBIRT is composed of three core components: screening with a validated instrument, brief intervention, referral to treatment. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is the brief intervention most commonly used in SBIRT. MI is an empirically tested, person-centered, behavior change intervention designed to guide, elicit, and strengthen motivation for change. Subjects enrolled in the experimental SBIRT arm will receive up to a maximum of six sessions of MI.</description>
