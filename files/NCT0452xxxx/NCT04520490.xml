  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity and related long-term effects are serious public health problems, but not&#xD;
      all children with obesity do well in treatment. This study will test a new combination of&#xD;
      family-based behavioral treatment (FBT) with a drug intervention using a glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) exenatide once weekly extended-release (ExQW, Bydureon®)&#xD;
      in order to improve obesity intervention outcomes in 10-12-year-old children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using functional and structural magnetic resonance neuroimaging, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      brain factors which could undermine treatment responses and long-term obesity intervention&#xD;
      outcomes. Specific Aim 1 will test the effect of adding ExQW to FBT on change in BMI z-score&#xD;
      over a total GLP-1RA treatment duration of 24 weeks and a subsequent 1-year observational&#xD;
      follow-up period after treatment cessation. To provide mechanistic insight, Specific Aim 2&#xD;
      will test whether adding GLP-1RA intervention to FBT impacts neural activation by food cues.&#xD;
      Finally, the proposed research will investigate the role of a cellular inflammatory process&#xD;
      in the mediobasal hypothalamus-called gliosis-which might contribute to impaired hypothalamic&#xD;
      function, attenuated satiety responsiveness, and potentially to worse weight management&#xD;
      outcomes. Specific Aim 3 will test if hypothalamic gliosis is modified by FBT and/or FBT plus&#xD;
      GLP-1RA in children and if its extent is related to immediate and/or long-term intervention&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled research study uses fMRI to&#xD;
      characterize neural responses to a test meal before and at the end of FBT intervention, with&#xD;
      vs. without additional GLP-1RA intervention. In addition, it uses structural MRI (sMRI) to&#xD;
      test if MBH gliosis is reversible and/or associated with intervention outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Children with obesity accompanied by at least one parent or caregiver will attend 24 weekly sessions. Most sessions will be held via video-conference and include 25-30 min. meetings between an interventionist and each child/parent pair to individualize treatment, followed by separate child and parent group meetings lasting 40 - 45 min. A select few sessions will be held in-person between an interventionist and each child/parent pair with no group session. Parents will serve as primary agents of change for their child and for themselves. Training will focus on food and physical activity education, parenting around food and physical activity, and use of behavioral skills (e.g., self-monitoring, environmental control, contingency management). Intervention groups of 8-12 children/families will be initiated every 3-6 mos. in study yrs. 2-3.</description>
