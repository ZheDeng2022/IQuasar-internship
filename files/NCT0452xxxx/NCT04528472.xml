      This project optimizes the TCM Symptoms and Symptoms Scale. A curative effect evaluation&#xD;
      system of acupuncture in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is formed to provide clinical&#xD;
      evidence by the following indexes: neurological impairment, motor dysfunction, TCM Symptoms&#xD;
      and Symptoms Scale, combined with the patients' head MRI, Plasma BDNF, MMP-9 and other&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Based on the previous work, this project optimizes the TCM Symptoms and Symptoms Scale.&#xD;
      Through the cohort study method, 194 patients with acute ischemic stroke were evaluated for&#xD;
      neurological impairment, motor dysfunction, TCM Symptoms and Symptoms Scale, combined with&#xD;
      the patients' head MRI. , Plasma BDNF, MMP-9 and other biomarkers, screen TCM syndromes&#xD;
      related to stroke outcome indicators, and adopt targeted comprehensive acupuncture and&#xD;
      moxibustion program intervention and follow-up to establish a stroke-specific intervention&#xD;
      outcome prediction model with TCM characteristics. A curative effect evaluation system of&#xD;
      acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is formed to provide&#xD;
      clinical evidence.&#xD;

    <measure>NIHSS SCALE</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NIHSS was created by the National Institutes of Health and has good reliability and validity. It has been widely used to evaluate the severity and prognosis of stroke. The scale consists of consciousness, gaze, vision, facial paralysis, movement, sensation, mutual aid, language, neglect and other items, with a maximum score of 33 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Scale of Traditional Chinese Medicine, SSTCM</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SSTCM mainly includes two parts: TCM symptoms and tongue and pulse conditions. There are a total of 24 symptoms of TCM symptoms. According to their severity and impact on daily life, each item is scored into 4 grades, with 0 points for normal, 1 point for mild, 2 points for moderate, and 3 points for severe. Tongue and pulse conditions are only recorded and not scored. The total score is the sum of the scores of TCM symptoms in Part 1. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms and the greater the impact on life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>modified Barthel Index, mBI</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mBI scale is mainly used to evaluate the self-care ability of patients in daily life. It can be summarized as the patients' independent activities in an indoor environment, such as eating, dressing, and toileting, with a total of ten items. The score of each item is divided into 5 levels, the lowest is 1 and the highest is 5. The higher the level, the greater the independence, and the total score is 100 points.</description>
