  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, &quot;PrEP Intervention for people who Inject Substances and Use Methamphetamine&quot;&#xD;
      (PRIME), we propose to assess if using video directly observed therapy with real-time&#xD;
      contingency management (VDOT-CM) may help cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) who&#xD;
      inject methamphetamine adhere to FTC/TAF (Descovy) PrEP. We will randomize 140 adults who&#xD;
      inject substances and use methamphetamine, are HIV-negative, and have recently engaged in a&#xD;
      sexual HIV risk behavior to VDOT-CM or counseling alone for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are to (1) determine the efficacy of VDOT-CM compared to counseling alone for&#xD;
      PrEP adherence, (2) evaluate the acceptability of PrEP and adherence support strategies among&#xD;
      the cohort, and (3) compare injection and sexual HIV risk behavior before and during PrEP&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that participants randomized to VDOT-CM will have superior adherence to PrEP.&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that participants will describe barriers to and facilitators of PrEP&#xD;
      adherence, and those who are randomized to VDOT-CM will consider it an acceptable PrEP&#xD;
      adherence support strategy. Finally, we do not expect to find increased injection or sexual&#xD;
      risk behaviors for HIV among study participants after they begin taking PrEP.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New HIV infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) are increasing in the United States&#xD;
      and San Francisco. Methamphetamine is a driving force in the transmission of HIV. Multiple&#xD;
      studies across diverse populations have found methamphetamine use to be independently&#xD;
      associated with both injection and sexual risk behaviors for HIV acquisition. Men who have&#xD;
      sex with men (MSM) who inject methamphetamine are at particularly elevated risk for HIV from&#xD;
      both injection and sexual risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is safe and highly effective for HIV prevention&#xD;
      when taken consistently. The Centers for Disease Control and other health agencies recommend&#xD;
      PrEP for PWID. Despite this recommendation and increasing PrEP use in the US, almost no PrEP&#xD;
      studies or demonstration projects have focused on PWID. The small number of studies that have&#xD;
      evaluated PrEP use among MSM who inject methamphetamine have shown slow PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRIME study will randomize 140 MSM who inject substances and use methamphetamine, are&#xD;
      HIV-negative, and have recently engaged in an HIV sexual risk behavior to video directly&#xD;
      observed therapy with contingency management (VDOT-CM) and counseling or counseling alone for&#xD;
      24 weeks. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if VDOT-CM helps MSM who inject&#xD;
      substances and use methamphetamine adhere to daily PrEP for HIV prevention. Participants will&#xD;
      be MSM, age 18 years or older, who have injected substances and used methamphetamine within&#xD;
      the past 30 days, are HIV negative and interested in initiating PrEP, and report condomless&#xD;
      sero-unknown/discordant sex with a man in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete the following study visits: screening, enrollment, follow-up&#xD;
      visits 6, 12, and 18 weeks from enrollment, and a final follow-up visit at 24 weeks. At&#xD;
      screening, enrollment, and all follow-up visits, laboratory testing for HIV, gonorrhea,&#xD;
      chlamydia, and methamphetamine metabolites will be done. Syphilis and creatinine testing will&#xD;
      be done at screening, week 12, and week 24. Syphilis testing will also be done at enrollment.&#xD;
      In addition, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) and antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C&#xD;
      antibody (HCV) testing will be done at the screening visit. HCV testing will also be done at&#xD;
      the week 24 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening a medical history and physical exam will be performed; during enrollment and&#xD;
      follow-up a symptom-directed exam will be performed at all visits, and under clinician&#xD;
      discretion, a medical history and full exam will be done if needed. AEs will be assessed&#xD;
      starting at enrollment and throughout follow-up. Vital signs and weight will be checked at&#xD;
      all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receiving only Integrated Next Step&#xD;
      Counseling (iNSC) or iNSC and video directly-observed therapy (VDOT) with contingency&#xD;
      management (CM). All participants will receive iNSC throughout their participation to support&#xD;
      PrEP adherence and help their reduce risk for HIV. Dried blood spots (DBS) will be collected&#xD;
      for FTC/TAF drug level testing at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      VDOT-CM arm will be asked to record taking their daily PrEP dose on VDOT every day from&#xD;
      enrollment through week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be conducted with at least 36 participants (18/arm) and participants&#xD;
      who discontinue PrEP early or become infected with HIV during the study.&#xD;
