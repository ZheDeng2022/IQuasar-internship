  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) is a commonly used orthodontic treatment in patients with&#xD;
      maxillary constriction to provide skeletal expansion, correct posterior crossbite and resolve&#xD;
      naso-respiratory problems by reducing oral respiration.The aim of this randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial was to evaluate the effects of tooth-borne, tooth tissue-borne and bone-borne RME&#xD;
      appliances on sleep quality with polygraphy. The null hypothesis was that there is no&#xD;
      difference for the sleep quality between the appliances.&#xD;

      Introduction. The aim of this 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of tooth tissue-borne (KBME), tooth-borne (Hyrax), and bone-borne (MIDME) rapid&#xD;
      maxillary expansion (RME) appliances on sleep quality with polygraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This study was designed in parallel with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. 46 patients&#xD;
      with narrow maxilla and OSAS were included in this study and randomly assigned to three&#xD;
      groups: tooth tissue-borne, tooth-borne and bone-borne expanders. Participants were&#xD;
      congregated from the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Izmir Katip Celebi&#xD;
      University, Turkey. In all groups, the expansion appliance was activated one-quarter turn&#xD;
      twice a day until the desired suture opening was achieved. The primary outcome of this study&#xD;
      was the correction of posterior crossbite. Secondary outcomes included polygraphic assessment&#xD;
      of sleep parameters. Each subject participated in 1 overnight sleep test with polygraphy&#xD;
      before the expansion (T0) and after a 3-month retention phase of treatment (T1). According to&#xD;
      the results of polygraphy, 7 parameters; (apnea hypopnea index (AHI), number of apnea and&#xD;
      hypopnea, desaturation index, lowest desaturation, average saturation, supin AHI) were&#xD;
      examined to evaluate the changes in sleep scores. Kruskal-Wallis analysis and Dunn-Bonferroni&#xD;
      test were used for inter-group comparisons and Wilcoxon analysis was used for intra-group&#xD;
      evalaution. P&lt;0.05 was accepted statistically significant. Computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      was used with group allocation concealed using opaque, sealed envelopes. The outcome assessor&#xD;
      was blinded to group assignment. The outcome assessor was blinded; however, it was not&#xD;
      feasible to blind either operator or patients.&#xD;

    <description>The patients were treated with KBME, Hyrax and MIDME maxillary expansion appliances, respectively. All expansion appliances containing a Hyrax expansion screw positioned parallel to the second premolars and were used to correct the posterior crossbite. In the MIDME group, two mini-screws with a diameter of 1.6 mm and a length of 10 mm are located on the right and left sides between the roots of the 2nd premolar and 1st molar teeth with 60-70Â° angle. KBME and Hyrax expansion appliances were cemented with glass ionomer cement and MIDME was cemented with using the light-cured composite. Same protocol was applied to all patients during RME treatment. Expansion screws in all groups were activated by two turns a day.</description>
