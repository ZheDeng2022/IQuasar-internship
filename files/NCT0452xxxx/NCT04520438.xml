      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Leucocyte and Platelet-Rich Fibrin (L-PRF) has shown to promote regenerative&#xD;
      processes, even reporting antibacterial effect. The aim of this split-mouth clinical trial&#xD;
      was to evaluate the effect of L-PRF as an adjuvant to scaling and root planing (SRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 13 patients with chronic periodontitis and at least 1 bilateral periodontal pocket ≥&#xD;
      6 mm were recruited. The sites were randomly treated with SRP + L-PRF (test group) or SRP&#xD;
      alone (control group). The following parameters were evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 and&#xD;
      6 months after treatment: Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL),&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP); gingival recession (GR), and root sensitivity (RS). Additionally,&#xD;
      the concentrations of Porphyromona gingivalis (P.g), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans&#xD;
      (A.a), Prevotella intermedia (P.i) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n) in the gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid (GCF) were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months after treatment.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods Study design and Patient Selection A split-mouth, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial enrolling 13 patients (8 males and 5 females, mean age 52.3 ± 9.4 years) was&#xD;
      set-up. The patients were informed about the benefits and risks of the study and each&#xD;
      participant signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical periodontal treatment A single periodontist (L.C.) performed all periodontal&#xD;
      treatments. NSPT consisted of two sessions of scaling and root planing (SRP) within 48 hours&#xD;
      under local anesthesia using ultrasonic and hand instrumentation. Additionally, the sites&#xD;
      associated with PPD ≥ 6 mm in the quadrant assigned to the test group were irrigated with&#xD;
      L-PRF exudate and filled with longitudinal pieces of L-PRF membrane. The patients received&#xD;
      instructions about soft diet, a carefully and soft mouth rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12%, and&#xD;
      no toothbrushing during 7 days in order to avoid the L-PRF removal. After this period, the&#xD;
      following instructions were given: modified Bass brushing technique, dental floss, and&#xD;
      interdental brushes, and chlorhexidine 0.12% mouth rinse for an extra 7 days. Strict hygiene&#xD;
      control by the clinician was also performed in each appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-PRF membrane preparation Two samples of venous blood were collected in 2 vacutainer tubes&#xD;
      (red cup) of 10 ml without anticoagulant. They were centrifuged at 408 g for 12 minutes using&#xD;
      a table centrifuge (IntraSpinTM, Intralock®, Florida, USA) according to the protocol&#xD;
      described by Temmerman et al.18 The L-PRF clots were removed from the tube, separated from&#xD;
      the red cells and placed in the Xpression box (IntraSpinTM, Intralock®, Florida, USA) to&#xD;
      gently compress them in membranes. The membranes were chopped in longitudinal pieces to fill&#xD;
      the periodontal pockets ≥ 6mm. The exudate, released during the compression, called L-PRF&#xD;
      exudate was aspirated to rinse the treated pockets. (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measurements All clinical measurements were performed by a single trained and&#xD;
      calibrated examiner (N.J.) who was masked for the treatment assigned, using a basic&#xD;
      examination instrument kit and a University of North Carolina no. 15 color-coded periodontal&#xD;
      probe. The following clinical parameters were measured at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 months and&#xD;
      6 months after treatment: probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL),&#xD;
      gingival recession (GR), bleeding on probing (BOP), and O´Leary plaque index (PI).19&#xD;
      Additionally, the root sensitivity (RS) was evaluated using a 100-mm visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (0 indicating no pain, 50 indicating average, and 100 indicating an unbearable pain) at&#xD;
      24 hrs., 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment. The change in PPD, CAL, GR, BOP,&#xD;
      PI, and RS (difference between baseline measures and at 1, 3, and 6 months) were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF collection GCF samples were collected from the deepest pocket from each quadrant before&#xD;
      recording the clinical measurement (baseline, and 6 weeks and, 3 months after treatment) in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the concentration of Porphyromona gingivalis (P.g), Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans (A.a), Prevotella intermedia (P.i) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n).&#xD;
      The sample area was isolated with cotton rolls, and contamination with saliva was avoided&#xD;
      using an appropriate suction and air spray. Then, an endodontic #35 paper-point was inserted&#xD;
      until a slight resistance was felt and it was held for 30 seconds. The paper-points were&#xD;
      immediately inserted in an Eppendorf tube and stored at -80ºC for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological processing After defrosting the samples, 1ml of phosphate-buffered saline&#xD;
      (PBS) was added and homogenized. Then, 400 μl of each sample was centrifuged at 13200 rpm for&#xD;
      3 minutes. The obtained pellet was dispersed in 200 μl InstaGene. DNA was extracted with&#xD;
      InstaGene matrix (Bio-Rad Life Science Research, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the&#xD;
      instructions of the manufacturer. Five microliters of the purified DNA were used for the&#xD;
      quantification of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,&#xD;
      Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (qPCR) assay was performed with a CFX96 Real-Time System (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) using&#xD;
      the Taqman 5' nuclease assay PCR method for detection and quantification of bacterial DNA.&#xD;
      Taqman reaction contained 12.5 μl Mastermix (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 4.5 μl sterile&#xD;
      distilled water, 1 μl of both species-specific primers and probe (Table 1) and 5 μl template&#xD;
      DNA. Assay conditions for all primer/probe set consisted of an initial 2 min at 50°C,&#xD;
      followed by a denaturation step for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec&#xD;
      and 60°C for 60 sec. Quantification was based on a plasmid standard curve. The delta for&#xD;
      bacterial concentration at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months (difference between baseline measures and&#xD;
      at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months) were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, allocation concealment and calibration A coin toss method was used to assign&#xD;
      the patients' quadrants into two treatment groups: (SRP + L-PRF) or control (SRP alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the study, two recordings of the following parameters were done: PPD, GR,&#xD;
      and CAL in five patients, with a 24-hour interval between first and second records in order&#xD;
      to validate the intra-examiner accuracy. All teeth, excluding third molars, were measured by&#xD;
      periodontal probing at 6 sites (mesiobuccal, mediobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual/palatal,&#xD;
      mediolingual/palatal, and distolingual/palatal). Calibration was accepted if the measurements&#xD;
      at baseline and after 24 hours were within 1 mm at the 95% level (correlation coefficients&#xD;
      between duplicate measurements; r = 0.95).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis To detect a mean difference in PPD of 1.2 mm with a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 1.0 at an α level of 0.05 and a β level of 0.10 (power = 0.9), a sample size of 10&#xD;
      patients was required. Despite the results but to anticipate potential drop outs during the&#xD;
      study, a sample size of n = 16 patients was considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial counts were log-transformed. A linear mixed model was applied with the variable&#xD;
      patient, as a random factor and time and treatment as two crossed fixed factors. Smoking and&#xD;
      PI were considered as covariables. Contrasts were set up to calculated the change from&#xD;
      baseline for the different time points between the treatments and for each treatment apart. A&#xD;
      correction for simultaneous hypothesis testing according to Sidak was applied. A normal&#xD;
      quantile plot and residual dot plot of the residual values were created showing that the&#xD;
      assumptions underlying the statistical model could be made.&#xD;
