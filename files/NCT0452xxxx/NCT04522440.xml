  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the use of Virtual Reality devices or somatosensory technology in various&#xD;
      fields of teaching or sports has gradually matured. It is even possible to see that libraries&#xD;
      or museums use virtual reality to promote reading or art. The trend of cross-border&#xD;
      application has been born. The use of horticultural therapy in the current service of&#xD;
      dementia or hospice patients is more common than in the past. The research team of the Taiwan&#xD;
      Normal University has developed the first 3D Virtual Reality horticultural therapy course in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Therefore, this study attempts to use natural virtual reality as an auxiliary care&#xD;
      method to see if it can relieve the pain of hospitalized patients in the hospice ward, or&#xD;
      relieve the stress of the caregiver (such as the patient's family or ward medical staff)!&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use natural virtual reality as an auxiliary care mode to relieve the painful condition&#xD;
           of inpatients in the hospice ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use natural virtual reality to relieve the psychological pressure of caregivers (family,&#xD;
           medical colleagues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of the study were: inpatients in the hospice ward of the hospital, caregivers of&#xD;
      inpatients in the hospice ward, and medical staff of the hospice team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use virtual reality head-mounted equipment to watch the natural landscape for 10 minutes&#xD;
           each time. The patient and caregiver watched three times a week during hospitalization.&#xD;
           The medical staff watched eight times a day on weekdays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaire: The patient used the pain scale and the Distress Thermometer (DT) scale&#xD;
           as the pre-test questionnaire. The caregiver and the medical staff use the DT scale and&#xD;
           the &quot;Profile of Mood States (POMS)&quot; as the pre-test questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The patient is expected to reduce the pain and enhance the quality of life&#xD;
      by viewing the virtual natural landscape. It is expected that caregivers and medical&#xD;
      colleagues can relieve stress and enhance the quality of life by watching virtual natural&#xD;
      landscapes.&#xD;
