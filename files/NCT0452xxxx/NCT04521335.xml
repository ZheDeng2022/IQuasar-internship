  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label trial of disulfiram in combination with copper gluconate in&#xD;
      patients with treatment-refractory multiple myeloma. The trial is designed to assess the&#xD;
      Phase 2 Recommended Dose (RP2D) of disulfiram and copper gluconate in combination. The trial&#xD;
      will open with dose escalation, followed to an expansion cohort to further characterize the&#xD;
      safety and tolerance of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will utilize a standard 3+3 design and will test up to five dose levels. Dose&#xD;
      levels will be separated into two sequential parts defined by the fixed dose of copper as&#xD;
      copper gluconate administered with ascending doses of disulfiram. Part 1 of dose escalation&#xD;
      will consist of dose levels 0 and 1 with the option to reduce to Dose Level -1 if Dose Level&#xD;
      0 is deemed intolerable. Part 2 will test dose levels 2 and 3. The Dose Level deemed to be&#xD;
      the RP2D will be used in dose expansion.&#xD;
