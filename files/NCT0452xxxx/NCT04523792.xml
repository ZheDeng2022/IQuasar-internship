  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to test the feasibility of an alternative treatment for patients with&#xD;
      opioid use disorder who present to the emergency department seeking treatment or with opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal, which includes FDA approved long-acting medication for opioid misuse (SUBLOCADE)&#xD;
      and rapid transfer of care to outpatient substance abuse treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proof of concept study will provide feasibility data on whether rapid initiation of&#xD;
      SUBLOCADE® (buprenorphine extended-release) injection for subcutaneous use CIII in the ED,&#xD;
      Clinical Decision Unit, or inpatient unit and after administration of a test dose of&#xD;
      SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual film, for sublingual or buccal use CIII&#xD;
      among treatment-seeking adults with moderate or severe OUD increases subsequent outpatient&#xD;
      treatment engagement as compared to a historical control cohort and concurrent controls who&#xD;
      decline treatment participation. The study will also assess whether rapid initiation of&#xD;
      SUBLOCADE® reduces subsequent ED visits for any reason. As a exploratory aim we will examine&#xD;
      whether rapid initiation of Sublocade in this patient group reduces opioid overdose events&#xD;
      compared to historical controls and patients who decline Sublocade.&#xD;
