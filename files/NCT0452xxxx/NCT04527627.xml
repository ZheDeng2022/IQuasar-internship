  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), are common among critical disease survivors. Interventions aimed to decrease&#xD;
      ICU impact on patient mental well-being are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: The study will evaluate an educational nursing intervention addressed to ease&#xD;
      the transition during ICU discharge by empowering the patient. A quantitative design will be&#xD;
      used to measure the effectiveness of the nursing intervention through an experimental&#xD;
      pre-test/post-test with control group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consist of patients from three critical care units from three different&#xD;
      hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained from Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be&#xD;
      analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study will help to develop and implement an intervention to help patients&#xD;
      lessen anxiety and depression associated to their transition from ICU to the general ward.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Method An experimental pre-test-post-test design will be used. Setting and participants The&#xD;
      study will be carried out in the ICU of three university hospitals which have 151 level 3 ICU&#xD;
      beds and where the nurse/patient ratio is 1:2. The three ICUs admit approximately 2000&#xD;
      patients per year. Participants who meet the following inclusion criteria will be included:&#xD;
      age &gt; 18 years; ICU stay &gt; 48h; speaker of one of the two official languages of the region&#xD;
      and carrying out a personal interview, Glasgow Coma Score of 15, Confusion Assessment Method&#xD;
      for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) negative, and provision of signed informed consent.&#xD;
      Patients with a pre-admission diagnosis of mental illness will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected by simple random probabilistic sampling. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      through the ICU admission list and randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) and the&#xD;
      control group (CG). To calculate the sample number needed, on the basis of a statistical&#xD;
      power of 80% and a level of confidence of 95% in a unilateral analysis, and estimating the&#xD;
      percentage of patients who have high anxiety at ICU discharge at 50% (between 30% and 75%&#xD;
      according to reports), a sample of 86 patients per group will be needed (assuming 15% losses&#xD;
      per group) to detect a difference of &gt;20% as statistically significant (expected to be 0.5&#xD;
      for the CG and 0.28 for the EG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing empowerment intervention The intervention will be carried out during the ICU&#xD;
      discharge planning. A &quot;Patient Information Guide for Intensive Care Unit patients&quot; will be&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guide will be based on the findings obtained in a previous qualitative study and on&#xD;
      previous studies on patient empowerment and education. The guide structure will take into&#xD;
      account the dimensions of empowerment: bio-physiological, functional, social, experience,&#xD;
      ethics and the financial aspect. The guide will be reviewed by experts in the development of&#xD;
      information guides for patients and family members and will be evaluated by the participating&#xD;
      ICUs before use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EG patients will receive the intervention verbally and in booklet format from the study&#xD;
      nurses at each ICU. CG patients will receive the usual nursing treatment provided during ICU&#xD;
      discharge, which usually consists of verbal information about the time and place of&#xD;
      destination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Independent variable: Nursing empowerment intervention administered to the patient&#xD;
           during ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dependent variable: Level of anxiety and depression (HADS scale) pre-post ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sociodemographic variables: sex (male/female), age (in years), educational level (none,&#xD;
           primary, secondary, higher), profession, family situation (lives alone, with family or&#xD;
           friends) and marital status (single, married or cohabiting, widower, divorced).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical variables: severity level (APACHE II), reason for ICU admission and days of&#xD;
           stay in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected using a first contact with the patient in the ICU, and the study&#xD;
      objectives and informed consent will be explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will administer the HADS scale to the EG and CG groups before ICU discharge&#xD;
      and after ICU discharge (in the destination ward).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Glasgow Coma Score: The Glasgow scale is designed to assess the level of consciousness,&#xD;
           and includes the assessment of the ocular, verbal and motor response. It is simple,&#xD;
           objective and easily reproducible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) adapted and&#xD;
           translated to Spanish by Tobar et al. (2010), which is recommended and validated in the&#xD;
           detection of delirium. The four criteria that characterize delirium are evaluated using&#xD;
           four questions for each area (change in mental status, inattention, altered&#xD;
           consciousness and disorganized thinking).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): Adapted and validated in Spanish by&#xD;
           Tejero, Guimera, Farré and Peri (1986) it comprises two subscales of 7 items each, one&#xD;
           for anxiety and one for depression. The intensity/frequency of symptoms is evaluated on&#xD;
           a four-point Likert scale. For each subscale, the score ranges from 0 to 21, with the&#xD;
           following cut-off points: 0-7 Normal; 8-10 Doubtful/possible clinical problem; &gt;10&#xD;
           Likely clinical problem. The HADs measures the current status during the last week.&#xD;
           Designed to be administered to subjects with organic diseases, the physical aspects that&#xD;
           may accompany anxiety or depression have been eliminated, leaving the emotional aspects&#xD;
           ones. In addition to the quantitative evaluation, it may be stratified into non-anxious&#xD;
           or non-depressed if the HADS scores are &lt; 8; possible or doubtful between 8 and 10, and&#xD;
           likely or affirmative if they are ≥ 11. The authors consider that, for research&#xD;
           purposes, if a low proportion of false positives are to be obtained, the upper limit&#xD;
           with values of 10 or 11 should be used, while values of 8 or 9 would prevent false&#xD;
           negatives. For this study, a value of 10 was decided on as a cut-off point between the&#xD;
           presence or absence of anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II: To measure and evaluate the&#xD;
           severity of the critically ill, Knaus produced in 1981 the first version, comprising 34&#xD;
           items, which were reduced reducing to 14 in the second version in 1985. APACHE II&#xD;
           classifies disease severity using 12 usual physiological measures, the previous health&#xD;
           status and age, with a score ranging from 0 to 71 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The data will be analysed using the SPSS v23 statistical package. A descriptive&#xD;
      analysis of the study variables will be made (means and standard deviation and medians and&#xD;
      25-75 percentiles (IQR) for quantitative variables according to the normality of&#xD;
      distribution, and frequencies and percentages for qualitative variables). The possible&#xD;
      relationship between sociodemographic and clinical variables and the level of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression will be analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, the Student's t test and&#xD;
      ANOVA or their nonparametric equivalents based on the type of variable and its distribution&#xD;
      and the number of subgroups compared. The chi square test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      variation in categorical variables between the EG and CG. The Mann-Whitney test or the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test will be used to compare the mean anxiety scale score between EG and CG.&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be established as p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
