      t-cell receptor alpha beta+(TCRαβ+) T cell and cluster of differentiation 19+ beta (CD19+ B)&#xD;
      cell depletion of unrelated donor (URD) grafts using the CliniMACS device in patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta thalassemia major (BTM).&#xD;

      This is a single arm pilot study of peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) with ex vivo&#xD;
      TCRαβ+ T cell and CD19+ B cell depletion of URD grafts using the CliniMACS device in patients&#xD;
      with SCD and BTM. Apart from CliniMACS-based cell processing, PSCT will be performed&#xD;
      according to current standards of care in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Cell&#xD;
      Therapy and Transplant Section, including the use of a standard chemotherapy conditioning&#xD;
      regimen and standard follow-up laboratory assessments. The study will determine efficacy of&#xD;
      this strategy in terms of engraftment, rates of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease&#xD;
      (GvHD), and one-year overall and event-free survival.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe Sickle Cell Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genotype: Hemoglobin SS, Hemoglobin SC, Hemoglobin SD, SOArab, or Hemoglobin SBeta&#xD;
             thalassemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have at least one of the following disease manifestations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically symptomatic neurologic event (stroke) or any neurologic deficit lasting&#xD;
             greater than 24 hours at any time prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of two or more episodes of vaso-occlusive events (VOE) per year in the 2 years&#xD;
             preceding enrolment. Patients must be refractory to hydroxyurea, defined as developing&#xD;
             VOE despite receiving hydroxyurea for at least 6 months. Patients who are intolerant&#xD;
             of hydroxyurea may also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vaso-occlusive events include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute chest syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain episodes requiring intravenous pain management and/or hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Priapism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Splenic sequestration (defined as a 2 g/dL drop in hemoglobin in the setting of an&#xD;

             to the research)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy, defined as&#xD;

             cell-related complications of any kind per treating hematologist's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Beta Thalassemia Major&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genotype: Confirmed Beta Thalassemia genotype by molecular genetic testing (May&#xD;
             include E/Beta0 and Beta0/Beta+ genotypes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet clinical diagnosis of transfusion-dependent thalassemia, defined as need for&#xD;
             ≥ 8 RBC transfusions per year in the two years preceding study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not meet disease, organ or infectious criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with no suitable unrelated donor available. Patients with suitable fully&#xD;
             matched related donor are also not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females. All females of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial in which the patient receives an investigational&#xD;
             drug must be discontinued prior to the time of initiation of transplant therapy.&#xD;
             Specifically transplant chemotherapy should not begin until at least 3 half-lives&#xD;
             after last use of the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe RBC alloimmunization, defined as inability to receive packed RBC transfusion&#xD;
             therapy due to anti-RBC antibodies. Patients with high titer anti-donor human&#xD;
             leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies detected on screening may be enrolled if they are&#xD;
             willing to undergo HLA antibody desensitization therapy.&#xD;
