      The main objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model that predicts&#xD;
      postoperative respiratory failure within 7 postoperative day using a real-world, local&#xD;
      preoperative and intraoperative electronic health records, not administrative codes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications are known to increase the length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      healthcare cost. One of the most serious form of these complications is postoperative&#xD;
      respiratory failure, which is also associated with morbidity and mortality. A lot of risk&#xD;
      stratification models have been developed for identifying patients at increased risk of&#xD;
      postoperative respiratory failure. However, these models were built by using a traditional&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis. A logistic regression analysis had disadvantages of assuming&#xD;
      the relationship between dependent and independent variables as linear. Recent advances in&#xD;
      artificial intelligence make it possible to manage and analyze big data. Prediction model&#xD;
      using a machine learning technique and large-scale data can improve the accuracy of&#xD;
      prediction performance than those of previous models using traditional statistics.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a machine learning technique may be a useful adjuvant tool in making clinical&#xD;
      decisions or real-time prediction if it is integrated into the healthcare system. However, to&#xD;
      our knowledge, there was no study investigating the predictive factors of postoperative&#xD;
      respiratory failure using a machine-learning approach. Therefore, the main objective of this&#xD;
      study is to develop a machine learning model that predicts postoperative respiratory failure&#xD;
      within 7 postoperative day using a real-world, local preoperative and intraoperative&#xD;
      electronic health records, not administrative codes and evaluate its performance&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;
