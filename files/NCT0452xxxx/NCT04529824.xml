  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to understand the glucose characteristics of the general&#xD;
      population (normal glucose, pre-diabetes, and diabetes). Glucose risk will be measured with&#xD;
      laboratory HbA1c and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) derived metrics. Physical activity will&#xD;
      also be measured using a Fitbit activity tracker. The study will inform future programs that&#xD;
      use CGM and activity tracking to identify people at risk for diabetes in the population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, observational study that will enroll a maximum of 550&#xD;
      subjects. All potential study subjects will be current or former employees or dependents&#xD;
      eligible to enroll for Employer's group health plan and will demonstrate interest in response&#xD;
      to recruitment materials placed in the near site clinic and/or the surrounding community.&#xD;
      Participation interest will be demonstrated by calling the study number. Potential subjects&#xD;
      will then undergo a screening call performed by study staff and, if still interested and&#xD;
      likely eligible will be scheduled for Visit 1 and potential Visit 2. If a potential subject&#xD;
      is not interested in continuing they will be given the option to anonymously complete a&#xD;
      survey as to why they declined participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential subjects at Visit 1 will be required to provide written or electronic informed&#xD;
      consent to participate. Once informed consent is obtained, study staff will confirm if there&#xD;
      is a recent A1C available . If subject has a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes&#xD;
      and an A1C result within the last 8-weeks or does not have diabetes or pre-diabetes and has&#xD;
      an A1C within the last 6-months no A1C will be drawn. If the subject does not have a recent&#xD;
      A1C a POC A1C will be taken at Visit 2. Study staff or subject will deploy the CGM system at&#xD;
      Visit 1. Study staff will verify that the CGM is successfully blinded and subject has been&#xD;
      trained on wearing CGM before subject completes Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be offered to wear an optional activity tracker and if chosen will also be&#xD;
      required to download the activity tracker mobile application onto their personal smartphone.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be trained on how to synchronize and charge their study activity tracker.&#xD;
      To complete Visit 1 activities subjects will be asked to complete up to three surveys&#xD;
      regarding their health status, reason for participation, diabetes risk, and if they decline&#xD;
      to wear the activity tracker and why. Subjects upon leaving Visit 1 will confirm their return&#xD;
      Visit 2 and remuneration will be processed at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 10-day wear period subjects will have access to study staff in-person at the&#xD;
      clinic and have Dexcom Technical Support available through a dedicated phone line Monday&#xD;
      through Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, study staff will assist subjects with removing the CGM and if wearing an activity&#xD;
      tracker will also have it removed. Study staff will confirm the activity tracker has been&#xD;
      synced with the subject's mobile application before deletion from the smartphone. Study staff&#xD;
      will collect and record adverse events, serious adverse events, or unanticipated problems.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete a user experience survey and have their mailing address&#xD;
      confirmed for delivery of the final summary report and completion survey. A POC A1C will be&#xD;
      obtained (unless a recent A1C and shared with subjects). Unless previously diagnosed with&#xD;
      diabetes, subjects will be classified as normal glucose levels, prediabetes or diabetes based&#xD;
      on their overall data. Subjects who are newly diagnosed with diabetes (POC A1C ≥ 6.5%) may be&#xD;
      referred to their primary care physician. Remuneration will be processed at this time. Safety&#xD;
      data will not be obtained for any subject after Visit 2 unless an ongoing AE is considered&#xD;
      not resolved or ongoing and not stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5 days after Visit 2, study staff will mail a final summary report of CGM and&#xD;
      activity metrics along with a user experience survey together with a pre-addressed return&#xD;
      envelope. The survey will provide the option for subjects to be called for follow-up&#xD;
      interview by a study research staff trained in user-experience research for an interview&#xD;
      about their experience. In addition, a subject data summary report may be provided to their&#xD;
      primary care physician and/or endocrinologist. A majority of the subjects will be considered&#xD;
      exited from the study after the interview or the interview was declined, and/or the user&#xD;
      experience survey has been received. A select group of subjects (up to 50) will receive a new&#xD;
      version of the data summary report based on the feedback collected from the initial group of&#xD;
      completed data summary report surveys. Trained research staff will follow-up and discuss the&#xD;
      changes with these subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 months of retrospective and 24 months ± 1 month of prospective concurrent medical claims&#xD;
      and cost data will be collected for each subject after the subject has been exited from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
