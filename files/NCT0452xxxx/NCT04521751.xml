    <textblock>
      This study is a proof of concept study to demonstrate that EMP16-02, a fixed dose combination&#xD;
      (FDC) of orlistat and acarbose in an oral multiple-unit modified release (MR) formulation&#xD;
      leads to a clinically relevant decrease in body weight. The study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of treatment with two different doses of EMP16 02 (120 mg&#xD;
      orlistat/40 mg acarbose and 150 mg orlistat/50 mg acarbose) for 26 weeks on reducing body&#xD;
      weight in obese patients.&#xD;

      This study is a proof of concept study to demonstrate that EMP16-02, a fixed dose combination&#xD;
      (FDC) of orlistat and acarbose in an oral multiple-unit modified release (MR) formulation&#xD;
      leads to a clinically relevant decrease in body weight. The study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of treatment with two different doses of EMP16 02 (120 mg&#xD;
      orlistat/40 mg acarbose and 150 mg orlistat/50 mg acarbose) for 26 weeks on reducing body&#xD;
      weight in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMP16-02 will be given to obese patients with an initial BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 28 kg/m² in the&#xD;
      presence of other risk factors (e.g., hypertension, glucose dysregulation such as impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or dyslipidaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 6 visits to the research clinic, including screening and follow-up.&#xD;
      There will be no overnight stays at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening (Visit 1) will take place from Day -28 to Day -1. Visit 2: Eligible and&#xD;
      consenting patients will arrive at the research clinic in the morning of the first dosing day&#xD;
      (Day 1, Visit 2) after at least 8 hours overnight fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A re-check of eligibility including a brief physical examination, vital signs and assessment&#xD;
      of body weight will be conducted. The patients will be randomised to either of two doses of&#xD;
      EMP16-02 or placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EMP16-02 120 mg O/40 mg A&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EMP16-02 150 mg O/50 mg A&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Placebo (identical capsules) Blood sampling (fasting), and anthropometric measurements&#xD;
           will be performed. Patients will receive electronic diary instructions and will be asked&#xD;
           to fill in a satiety and craving questionnaire before breakfast (at the clinic), and&#xD;
           then once every hour for 4 hours until before lunch (at home). A standardised breakfast&#xD;
           will be served at the clinic. Halfway through breakfast at Visit 2, all patients will&#xD;
           receive a placebo capsule independent of the treatment arm to which the patients have&#xD;
           been randomised, to provide patients with the opportunity to train on self administering&#xD;
           the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) under supervision of clinic staff. The&#xD;
           patients will also receive instructions for filling in more questionnaires regarding&#xD;
           health and quality of life, meal pattern, activity and sleep, and gastrointestinal&#xD;
           symptoms (gastrointestinal rating scale [GSRS]). The patients will be instructed to take&#xD;
           EMP16-02 or placebo halfway through each meal, together with approximately 100-200 mL&#xD;
           water (or other drink) on all subsequent treatment days. Once IMP has been handed out,&#xD;
           the patients are free to leave the clinic. The first randomised IMP dose will be taken&#xD;
           during lunch (or the next meal) at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between visit 2 and 3: Patients randomised to EMP16-02 will start with a run-in period of 6&#xD;
      weeks during which the dose is sequentially increased. From week 7, all patients will have&#xD;
      reached their final intended dose and a 20 week treatment and observation period will start.&#xD;
      The run-in phase will start at a dose of 60 mg O and 20 mg A TID, which will sequentially be&#xD;
      increased with 30 mg O/10 mg A every two weeks until the target doses of 120 mg O/40 mg A TID&#xD;
      (for the lower dose group) and 150 mg O/50 mg A TID (for the higher dose group) are reached.&#xD;
      Placebo treatment consists of matching oral capsules. Placebo and EMP16-02 capsules need to&#xD;
      be taken TID together with three daily meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3-5: Patients will come to the clinic at Visit 3 (week 7), Visit 4 (week 14) and Visit&#xD;
      5 (week 26) for safety assessments and assessments of weight and anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
      Patients will arrive in the morning after at least 8 hours overnight fasting. All visits will&#xD;
      start with a brief physical examination followed by blood sampling (fasting) and assessment&#xD;
      of body weight and body composition. A standardised breakfast will be served during which the&#xD;
      patient will take the IMP. All or a selection of the questionnaires, including the satiety&#xD;
      and craving questionnaire, will be filled in in a similar way as during Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New IMP will be handed out to the patients at Visit 2, 3 and 4. At Visit 5 (week 26), the&#xD;
      patients will take the last dose during breakfast at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 18 and 22 weeks of treatment (Day 123 ± 3 days and Day 151 ± 3 days, respectively),&#xD;
      patients will be asked to answer questions about IMP compliance, occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) and use of concomitant medication using an electronic diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6: A follow up safety visit.&#xD;

          1. T2DM treated with medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the&#xD;
             study, or influence the results or the patient's ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first administration of IMP, at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
