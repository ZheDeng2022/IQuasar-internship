  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing whether a 6 week skills-based telehealth intervention can help ovarian&#xD;
      cancer patients experiencing PARP inhibitor-related fatigue reduce the impact of fatigue on&#xD;
      their daily life and activities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, multicenter pilot randomized controlled trial to compare the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of REVITALIZE, a 6-week Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) telehealth intervention vs. enhanced usual care (EUC) in fatigued patients with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer on maintenance PARPi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is called REVITALIZE, and it is a structured, skills-based intervention for&#xD;
      providing support, knowledge, and skills for coping with fatigue. This type of intervention&#xD;
      has been used in other studies to treat symptoms such as pain, migraines, or worry. This&#xD;
      research is being done to develop this program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, and to get patient feedback on the&#xD;
      telehealth intervention to improve it for a future study. The study is also making a&#xD;
      preliminary determinations as to whether REVITALIZE does improve psychological flexibility&#xD;
      and fatigue-related interference and reduce fatigue, psychological distress, and fear of&#xD;
      cancer recurrence, while improving overall quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will pre-pilot the REVITALIZE intervention in up to 5 patients at the Dana-Farber&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (DFCI). This run-in phase serves to test and refine the newly developed&#xD;
      6-week ACT intervention in a smaller sample size prior to initiating the randomized control&#xD;
      trial (RCT) portion of the study. After the ACT intervention has been tested and refined, the&#xD;
      study will enroll and randomize 40 fatigued patients with advanced ovarian cancer on&#xD;
      maintenance PARPi at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Abramson Cancer Center at the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive either a 6-week ACT intervention or enhanced usual&#xD;
      care (educational materials). The study anticipates enrolling approximately 20 patients at&#xD;
      each site, and 20 patients will be enrolled to each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected participants will remain in the study for the duration of the intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments, which is approximately 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Funding Organization for this study is the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)&#xD;
      and the Research Funding Provider is AstraZeneca.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale, a 7-item measure assessing anxiety severity on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all, to 3 = nearly every day). GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate more moderate to severe anxiety.</description>

Each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 ('not at all' or 'never) to 4 ('a great deal' or 'all the time'). A total score can be obtained for each subscale, and for the total scale by summing item ratings. Higher scores indicate higher levels of FCR.</description>
