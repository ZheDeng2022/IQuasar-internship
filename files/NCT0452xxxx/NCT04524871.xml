  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study in participants&#xD;
      with advanced liver cancers. The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment&#xD;
      arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate&#xD;
      minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, modify the participant population, or&#xD;
      introduce additional cohorts of participants with other types of advanced primary liver&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will enroll participants with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for their disease. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will initially be randomly assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1).&#xD;
      Participants who experience loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1&#xD;
      may be eligible to receive treatment with a different treatment combination (Stage 2). When a&#xD;
      Stage 2 treatment combination is available, this will be introduced by amending the protocol.&#xD;
