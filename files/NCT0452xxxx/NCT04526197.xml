  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study designed to determine&#xD;
      the effect of ALXN1840 on the metabolism of celecoxib, a sensitive cytochrome P450 2C9&#xD;
      (CYP2C9) substrate, in healthy male and female participants. The safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ALXN1840 were determined along with ALXN1840 pharmacokinetics (PK) in plasma as measured via&#xD;
      total molybdenum with the coadministration of celecoxib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, cross-over study to determine&#xD;
      the effect of a single dose of ALXN1840 (perpetrator) on the single-dose celecoxib (victim)&#xD;
      kinetics in healthy male and female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study had a Screening period (Day -28 to Day -2), two 11-day study periods (Day 1 to Day&#xD;
      11) with a minimum of 14 days between doses of celecoxib, and an End of Study Visit (Day 15 ±&#xD;
      2 days) after Period 2 dosing. Participants only reported to the clinical research unit (CRU)&#xD;
      on the day prior to the first dose because they were kept in the CRU during the wash-out&#xD;
      period due to coronavirus disease 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants received a single dose of celecoxib alone (Treatment A) and celecoxib&#xD;
      coadministered with ALXN1840 (Treatment B) during the study, 1 in each treatment period.&#xD;
      Based on randomization, participants were administered either Treatments A-B or Treatments&#xD;
      B-A in each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK profile of ALXN1840 and celecoxib was determined by blood sampling following&#xD;
      single-dose administration. In addition to PK sampling, safety and tolerability were assessed&#xD;
      by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, physical examinations,&#xD;
      and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
