  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of&#xD;
      the central nervous system. Its main feature is progressive demyelination, which ultimately&#xD;
      leads to axon damage and neuron loss. MR is the main imaging technique in the current&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria of MS. The conventional MR sequence recommended in this diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria has high sensitivity for detecting demyelination and axon damage, but has poor&#xD;
      specificity, which makes disease modification therapy (DMT) blind, and it is also difficult&#xD;
      to accurately determine the long-term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET is a non-invasive molecular imaging technology that can quantitatively monitor&#xD;
      physiological or pathological processes in vivo. 18F-labeled thioflavin derivative probe&#xD;
      (18F-florbetapir) can bind to myelin basic protein in the white matter, providing&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of myelin content. Our preliminary studies have confirmed that the&#xD;
      uptake of 18F-florbetapir in MS lesions is significantly related to the myelin content&#xD;
      measured by histological staining. Therefore, 18F-florbetapir PET may be a very effective&#xD;
      myelin imaging technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced MR sequence such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can evaluate axonal damage&#xD;
      by analyzing neuronal activity marker N-acetyl aspartate (NAA). The new whole-brain fast 3D&#xD;
      MRS sequence breaks through the bottleneck of low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial&#xD;
      resolution of the current MRS sequence, and provides a reliable method for obtaining neuronal&#xD;
      activity markers in the three-dimensional space of MS sporadic lesions in the whole brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated PET/MR makes PET detector implant in the MR magnet, which realizes the&#xD;
      simultaneous acquisition of PET and MR in one scan, ensuring the high consistency of the two&#xD;
      modes. This makes it possible to simultaneously analyze PET and MRS quantitative parameters&#xD;
      in multiple and different sizes of MS lesions, that is, to obtain two different pathological&#xD;
      features of demyelination and neuronal damage. Separating these two pathological changes will&#xD;
      help to more accurately and quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of DMT, program selection&#xD;
      and prognostic judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project intends to recruit 30 MS patients between 18-65 years old, and 30 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with matched age and sex as normal controls. PET/MR imaging, serological&#xD;
      examination and cerebrospinal fluid testing and scale evaluation will be performed. The aim&#xD;
      of this project is to planned to establish a new imaging evaluation technology for accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of MS.&#xD;
