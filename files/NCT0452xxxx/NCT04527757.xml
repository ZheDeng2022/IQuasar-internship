  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous anaesthesia induction is nowadays considered as gold standard, mainly because of&#xD;
      the possibility of the rapid therapeutic intervention while having secured i.v. line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the paediatric patients, apart from intravenous induction, it is also possible to use in&#xD;
      the specific situations inhalation anaesthesia induction with sevoflurane (in the mixture&#xD;
      with O2 + air, or O2 + N2O) and secure the i.v. line afterwards in the inhalation&#xD;
      anaesthesia. This method is in the paediatric population currently preferred, mainly because&#xD;
      of possible fear of the painful venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhalation anaesthesia induction is possible only in patients without the risk of&#xD;
      aspiration/regurgitation of stomach content and in patients without predicted difficult&#xD;
      airway. Even if sedative premedication is used, during the inhalation induction excitation&#xD;
      stage of the general anaesthesia variably appears, during which hemodynamic sympathoadrenal&#xD;
      response and involuntary limbs movement might occur. When deepening inhalation anaesthesia,&#xD;
      progression to surgical stage and automatic breathing onset appears. This subsequently&#xD;
      facilitates to secure the venous access, without which is is not possible to secure the&#xD;
      airway (in exception of the emergency situations - resuscitation).&#xD;

      The aim of this prospective observational trial is to compare the duration of inhalation and&#xD;
      intravenous anaesthesia induction in paediatric patients, who undergo elective surgical or&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures. After the approval of the study by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University hospital Brno and registration of the protocol at clinicaltrials.gov, the duration&#xD;
      of inhalation and intravenous anaesthesia induction in the patients undergoing general&#xD;
      anaesthesia in the Departement of paediatric anaesthesia and intensive care unit, University&#xD;
      Hospital Brno in the term from 1.9.2020 until 30.6.2021 will be measured. Measurement will be&#xD;
      done in all patients in the given time period, who will undergo elective surgical or&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure. The measurement will begin after the patient's arrival at the operating&#xD;
      theatre, after the control of the documentation and beginning of the vital signs monitoring.&#xD;
      The measurement will be terminated at the occurence of the first end-tidal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (ETCO2) wave, after securing the airway with laryngeal mask or orotracheal intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the inhalation induction sevoflurane will be used (in the mixture with O2 + air, or O2 +&#xD;
      N2O), for the intravenous induction, commonly used induction anaesthetics will be used&#xD;
      (propofol, etomidate, ketamine, midazolam).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type and the dose of the induction anaesthetic agent will be recorded (in the case of&#xD;
      inhalation induction the dose of inhalation anaesthetic set on the vaporizer, in the case of&#xD;
      intravenous induction the dose in mg/kg body weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type and dose of the sedative premedication will be recorded, the number of attempts&#xD;
      needed to secure i.v. line, success rate of securing the i.v. line while using Eutectic&#xD;
      Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) patch and/or Buzzy (vibration device for patient&#xD;
      distraction), the number of attempts needed to secure the airway, incidence of adverse events&#xD;
      which might occur during anaesthesia induction (tachycardia, bradycardia, bronchospasm,&#xD;
      laryngospasm).&#xD;
