  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement (THR) is being considered as one of the most effective medical&#xD;
      procedures. Since its introduction, there was a worldwide debate over proper implant&#xD;
      selection in terms of size, bearing type and shape. The diameter of used femoral heads&#xD;
      components grew throughout the years - from 22 mm in the 1960s to 32 mm in the 2000s, which&#xD;
      is the most commonly used size nowadays. In recent years there was a visible use of large&#xD;
      femoral heads (&gt;=36mm) in several registers. In the USA there was a significant grow in use&#xD;
      of this heads rising from 1% in early 200s to even 58% in 2009. There is a strong evidence&#xD;
      data and many researchers concerning range of movement, risk of dislocation, functional&#xD;
      results, pain and prosthesis wear depending of femoral head size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of gait characteristics there are several deviations reported concerning both&#xD;
      patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and following THR. There is a lack of literature&#xD;
      concerning influence of used implants on gait parameters and whether this goal of the surgery&#xD;
      can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to assess potential differences of lower limb biomechanics during&#xD;
      gait in patients following total hip replacement surgery depending on femoral head diameter&#xD;
      and compare them to the normal gait of healthy volunteers. As a secondary outcome authors&#xD;
      wanted to inspect correlation between gait parameters and patient-reported outcome.&#xD;

      Total hip replacement (THR) is being considered as one of the most effective medical&#xD;
      procedures. Since its introduction, there was a worldwide debate over proper implant&#xD;
      selection in terms of size, bearing type and shape. The diameter of used femoral heads&#xD;
      components grew throughout the years - from 22 mm in the 1960s to 32 mm in the 2000s, which&#xD;
      is the most commonly used size nowadays. In recent years there was a visible use of large&#xD;
      femoral heads (&gt;=36mm) in several registers. In the USA there was a significant grow in use&#xD;
      of this heads rising from 1% in early 200s to even 58% in 2009. There is a strong evidence&#xD;
      data and many researchers concerning range of movement, risk of dislocation, functional&#xD;
      results, pain and prosthesis wear depending of femoral head size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of gait characteristics there are several deviations reported concerning both&#xD;
      patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and following THR. It is well-proven that those with&#xD;
      hip OA have reduced stride length and reduced cadence, reduced gait velocity, and reduced&#xD;
      joint excursion. Patients after THR walk with lower hip-abduction moments, sagittal-plane&#xD;
      range of motion. It is believed that it might be a consequence of pain-avoidance mechanism&#xD;
      developed as an adaptation for joint disease, which is still present after the surgery. What&#xD;
      is more, there are publications, which underline that lower limb biomechanics during gait do&#xD;
      not return to normal following THR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However there is a lack of literature concerning influence of used implants on gait&#xD;
      parameters and whether this goal of the surgery can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to authors best knowledge this study is the first to ever describe potential&#xD;
      differences in gait parameters between THR performed with standard femoral heads (28-32mm)&#xD;
      and large ones (&gt;=36mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of this study was to assess potential differences of lower limb&#xD;
      biomechanics during gait in patients following total hip replacement surgery depending on&#xD;
      femoral head diameter and compare them to the normal gait of healthy volunteers. As a&#xD;
      secondary outcome authors wanted to inspect correlation between gait parameters and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome.&#xD;
