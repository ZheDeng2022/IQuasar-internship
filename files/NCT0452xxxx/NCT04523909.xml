  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational prospective pilot study to analyze the trajectory of neuroinflammatory protein&#xD;
      expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in relation to systemic compartment in patients&#xD;
      undergoing thoracic aortic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify and unravel the biochemical (neuroinflammatory) pathways&#xD;
      involved in postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient undergoing thoracic aortic surgery will have an external lumbar drain (ELD) in situ&#xD;
      on the day before surgery. This ELD remains in place during and three days after surgery to&#xD;
      reduce the risk on periprocedural spinal cord ischemia. Paired measurements of CSF and blood&#xD;
      will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major (cardiovascular) surgery is frequently associated with cerebral dysfunction&#xD;
      postoperatively. Major surgical procedures account for substantial systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      activation. Interestingly, animal models have shown that surgery rather than anaesthetics&#xD;
      trigger a neurocognitive decline. An increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of&#xD;
      immune cells mediate this post operative cognitive decline. There is growing support that&#xD;
      systemic inflammation can activate the innate immune system of the brain leading to&#xD;
      inflammation in the brain ('neuroinflammation'). This neuroinflammation is suggested to play&#xD;
      a pivotal role in postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive decline due to&#xD;
      surgery-related systemic inflammation. However little evidence is available on the extend of&#xD;
      the neuroinflammation and which biochemical pathways are dysregulated in the brain after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic aortic surgery offers the unique opportunity to study the trajectory of protein&#xD;
      expression in CSF prior to and after surgery in a non-invasive matter. It is standard of care&#xD;
      that an external lumbar drain (ELD) is placed the day prior to surgery and this ELD will&#xD;
      remain in place during three postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To advance the understanding of the impact of major surgery to the brain, the investigators&#xD;
      wish to study the trajectory of protein expression prior to and after thoracic aortic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
