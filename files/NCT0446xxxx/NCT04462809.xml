  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant mesothelioma is an invasive neoplasm that arises from mesothelium that lines&#xD;
      several organs. Common primary sites of origin of mesotheliomas are the pleura (malignant&#xD;
      pleural mesothelioma: 85%) and peritoneum (malignant peritoneal mesothelioma 15%), and rarely&#xD;
      the pericardium and tunica vaginalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care recommended for malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM) is palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy based on a doublet of platinum salt and an anti-folate. The median survival of&#xD;
      patients with pleural MPM is around 8 months with best supportive care only, 12 to 19 months&#xD;
      when systemic chemotherapy is used with or without anti-angiogenic agents or targeted&#xD;
      therapy. There is an unmet need for innovative approaches in pleural mesotheliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is an aggressive neoplasm that arises from the lining&#xD;
      mesothelial cells of the peritoneum and spreads extensively within the confines of the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intraoperative&#xD;
      peritoneal perfusion with chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the standard curative approach when it is&#xD;
      possible, with respect to peritoneal carcinomatosis extend. When the cytoreductive surgery is&#xD;
      impossible, the common strategy is to prescribe systemic chemotherapy, with the objective of&#xD;
      downsizing tumor lesions for potential subsequent CRS. The standard strategy based on&#xD;
      cisplatin - pemetrexed combination regimen has been extrapolated from pleural mesothelioma&#xD;
      management principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic landscape of mesotheliomas is now well described. Pleural and peritoneal malignant&#xD;
      mesotheliomas harbor closed genomic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies based on maintenance-based treatments with Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)&#xD;
      inhibitors, especially olaparib, niraparib and talazoparib, have been shown effective in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients, thereby leading to their approvals. The benefit has been mainly&#xD;
      observed in patients with homologous recombination deficiencies (HRD), but also in all-comers&#xD;
      patients in a lesser extent. It is thought that HRD induces addiction of cancer cells to&#xD;
      PARP, thereby leading to cell death in the presence of PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, given the prevalence of HRD, through BAP-1 mainly, in mesotheliomas,&#xD;
      maintenance treatment with PARP-inhibitor in malignant mesothelioma patients without any&#xD;
      progressive disease after 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy may be associated with&#xD;
      increased progression free survival, as it was shown in ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TALAMESO aims to evaluate the efficacy of talazoparib maintenance treatment given for maximum&#xD;
      2 years following 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based first line chemotherapy in terms of&#xD;
      proportion of patients progression free 6 months after starting the maintenance, and&#xD;
      progression-free survival, in patients with advanced malignant pleural (cohort A) or&#xD;
      peritoneal (cohorts B1 and B2) mesotheliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts B1 and B2 are meant to confirm that talazoparib can increase progression free&#xD;
      survival in both patient populations with non-resected or incompletely resected disease&#xD;
      (cohort B1) or with completely resected disease (cohort B2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TALAMESO is an open-label phase II trial with 3 independent cohorts (Fleming's single-stage)&#xD;
      including patients with advanced malignant pleural (cohort A) or peritoneal (cohort B1 and&#xD;
      B2) mesotheliomas without any sign of disease progression after 4 to 6 cycles of&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy (including minimum 1 cycle of pemetrexed).&#xD;
