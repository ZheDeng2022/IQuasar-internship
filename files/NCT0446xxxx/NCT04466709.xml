    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a common figure associated with liver cirrhosis. The main component of&#xD;
      malnutrition in liver cirrhosis is represented by sarcopenia, a condition of a progressive&#xD;
      and generalized loss of muscle mass and strength. Many studies have reported that sarcopenia&#xD;
      is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, cirrhotic patients may develop simultaneous loss of skeletal muscle and gain of&#xD;
      adipose tissue, culminating in a condition of &quot;sarcopenic obesity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As highlighted by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [Van Vgut 2017] all the&#xD;
      studies on the impact of sarcopenia/sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis in cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      are retrospective studies, mostly involving non-consecutive patients on the list for liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Moreover, most of the studies were produced by non-European centers&#xD;
      (Canadians,Americans, and Japanese) that published more papers on the same patient series.&#xD;
      All these factors have led to a possible selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the methods used to evaluate sarcopenia and myosteatosis were not homogeneous&#xD;
      (the entire muscle area, or area of the psoas or psoas diameter) as well as the cut-offs&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, we propose a multicentric observational prospective study aimed at&#xD;
      analyzing the impact of sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis in cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      not listed for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluation of the impact of sarcopenia on the mortality of cirrhotic patients not on the&#xD;
      waiting list for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the impact of sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis on the mortality of&#xD;
           cirrhotic patients not on the waiting list for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the impact of sarcopenia/sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis on the&#xD;
           development of complications (hepatic encephalopathy, bacterial infections, ascites, GI&#xD;
           bleeding) in cirrhotic patients not on the waiting list for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the impact of sarcopenia/sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis on the number&#xD;
           of admissions and the days of hospitalization for such complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the subcutaneous fat impact on mortality and morbidity of cirrhotic&#xD;
           patients not on the waiting list for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concordance analysis of the various methods used (different cut-off/area psoas vs. area&#xD;
           of all muscles) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia through the analysis of CT scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a common figure associated with liver cirrhosis with an incidence ranging&#xD;
      from 5% to 99% of patients depending on the population studied and diagnostic tools used for&#xD;
      the diagnosis [Amodio Hepatology 2013; Merli ESPEN; Merli 2013]. Several factors are involved&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of malnutrition in the patient with liver cirrhosis as an inadequate&#xD;
      dietary intake, altered nutrient uptake and alterations in the use of the substrate due to&#xD;
      liver disease [Tandon P 2017, Plauth M 2002]. Furthermore, a variety of acute events and&#xD;
      complications can reduce then patient's ability to take care of their food intake [Plauth&#xD;
      M2002]. Malnutrition is associated with an increased risk of mortality, higher prevalence of&#xD;
      portal hypertension-related complications and infections, as well as longer in hospital stay&#xD;
      [Merli 1996, Merli 2010, Merli 2013, Tandon P Liver Transplant 2012, Montano-Loza 2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main component of malnutrition in liver cirrhosis is represented by sarcopenia, a&#xD;
      condition of a progressive and generalized loss of muscle mass and strength [Dasarathy S&#xD;
      2012, Montano-Loza AJ 2012, Cruz-jentoft AJ 2010]. Many studies have reported that sarcopenia&#xD;
      is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients [Merli 2013,&#xD;
      Tandon P Liver Transplant 2012, Montano-Loza 2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, while overweight and obesity are endemic in Western countries, these conditions&#xD;
      have been associated with the development of chronic liver disease, worsening of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis and progression to cirrhosis [Everhart JE 2009; Raynard B 2002]; furthermore, the&#xD;
      body mass index(BMI) has been considered an independent risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      decompensation among cirrhotic patients of all causes [Berzigotti A 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhotic patients may develop simultaneous loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose&#xD;
      tissue, culminating in a condition of &quot;sarcopenic obesity&quot; [Montano-Loza AJ 2016]. This&#xD;
      observation is relevant because, despite its important role in the prognosis of cirrhosis,&#xD;
      sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients is frequently overlooked as body composition assessments can&#xD;
      be challenging in cirrhotic patients with fluid retention or who are overweight or frankly&#xD;
      obese [O'Brein 2008]. In addition, muscle depletion is characterized by both a reduction in&#xD;
      muscle size and an increased proportion of intermuscular and intramuscular fat denominated&#xD;
      'myosteatosis' [Montano-Loza AJ 2016]. Myosteatosis increases with age and adiposity and it&#xD;
      is associated with metabolic abnormalities, decreased strength and mobility [Montano-Loza AJ&#xD;
      2016, Correa-de-Araujo R 2017].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montano-Loza and colleagues showed that cirrhotic patients with sarcopenic obesity or&#xD;
      myosteatosis had worse median survival compared to those patients with normal body&#xD;
      composition [Montano- Loza A J 2016]. In previous work, Kabori et al. demonstrated an&#xD;
      association between myosteatosis and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients&#xD;
      undergoing hepatocellular carcinoma resection [Kaibori M 2015].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of sarcopenia and myosteatosis The European Consensus Statement has identified&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard for the detection of muscle wasting in clinical&#xD;
      trials [Cruz-Jentoft 2010] nevertheless in clinical practice, the execution of CT and MRI is&#xD;
      difficult to be justified only for quantifying muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, most cirrhotic patients have imaging for surveillance of focal liver lesions,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, vascular disease and pre-transplant evaluation [Dasarathy 2016]. CT&#xD;
      is more commonly used as some software enables specific tissue demarcation using precise HU&#xD;
      thresholds [Mitsiopoulos 1998]. There is excellent reliability between different software&#xD;
      systems, with a good reproducibility between the software package [Irving 2007]. Although&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the literature also exists about the abdominal muscles measured (psoas or&#xD;
      total abdominal wall) and the site of measurements (third or fourth lumbar vertebra) [Carey&#xD;
      2017], the measurement of the abdominal muscle area at L3-L4 is considered the gold standard&#xD;
      due to the relative independence from the activity level and water retention [Montano-Loza&#xD;
      2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT images have been also the most utilized as a research tool to investigate myosteatosis. It&#xD;
      is basically assessed indirectly using muscle attenuation calculated, leading to a close&#xD;
      correlation with direct measurements of muscle lipid content [Machann et al., 2003;&#xD;
      Larson-Meyer et al., 2006].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle radiation attenuation is a radiological characteristic that can be measured with&#xD;
      Hounsfield units (HU) [Goodpaster et al., 2000; Goodpaster, 2002]. When muscle&#xD;
      cross-sectional area and attenuation are reported, the most common practice is to use&#xD;
      pre-established HU ranges to define intermuscular fat (usually -190 to -30 HU) and muscle&#xD;
      tissue (usually -29 HU to 150 HU) [Aubrey et al., 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      As highlighted by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [Van Vgut 2017] all the&#xD;
      abovementioned studies on the impact of sarcopenia/sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis in&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients are retrospective studies, mostly involving non-consecutive patients on&#xD;
      the list for liver transplantation. Moreover, most of the studies were produced by&#xD;
      non-European centers (Canadians,Americans, and Japanese) that published more papers on the&#xD;
      same patient series. All these factors have led to a possible selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the methods used to evaluate sarcopenia and myosteatosis were not homogeneous&#xD;
      (the entire muscle area, or area of the psoas or psoas diameter) as well as the cut-offs&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS and ENDPOINT For these reasons, we propose a multicentric observational prospective&#xD;
      study aimed at analyzing the impact of sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis in&#xD;

        The sample size has been planned using results from an analogous retrospective study, where&#xD;
        the HR for sarcopenia was estimated as 2.2, the 1-y event rate was 30%, and 40% of the&#xD;
        sample had sarcopenia. We therefore conservatively assume a sHR equal to 2, 20% 1-y&#xD;
        cause-specific event rate, 40% baseline sarcopenia. According to these data, a total of 68&#xD;
        cause-specific events are needed to guarantee the power of at least 80% with a type I error&#xD;
        rate of 5%. Since we assume a 20% event rate, with a follow-up of 1y as planned 340&#xD;
        patients (68/0.2) will be enrolled. Considering a possible 10% drop-out, a total of 374&#xD;
        patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
