      European Nutrition in Glaucoma Management (ENIGMA) trial will evaluate the effect of 18-month&#xD;
      supplementation with lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin on macular pigment (MP) levels,&#xD;
      vision, cognition and serum biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in glaucoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study comprises a randomised, placebo controlled and double masked clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to establish MP response to supplementation with lutein, zeaxanthin and&#xD;
      meso-zeaxanthin over an 18-month period. The study will also investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between macular pigment, cognitive function, oxidative stress and inflammation, and determine&#xD;
      the impact of dietary supplementation on vision, retinal structure, quality of life and&#xD;
      cognitive function among glaucoma subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study looking at the effects of dietary MP supplementation in glaucoma&#xD;
      patients. Glaucoma can cause irreversible visual impairment. Current treatment modalities&#xD;
      only halt disease progression and do not improve visual function. It is important to&#xD;
      understand that poor visual function can have major consequences to an individual's&#xD;
      day-to-day tasks such as increased risk of falls and automobile accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disability glare is commonly experienced by eye disease patients, including those with&#xD;
      glaucoma, and has been shown to be present even in those who are mildly affected by the&#xD;
      disease. MP is a blue-light filter that plays an important role in visual performance&#xD;
      including glare sensitivity. Moreover, MP is a potent antioxidant, and it is widely known&#xD;
      that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, both at the level of&#xD;
      retinal ganglion cells and trabecular meshwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma and cognitive decline are both neurodegenerative processes that share several&#xD;
      antecedents. The clustering of degenerative disorders towards the end of life is thought to&#xD;
      be the result of cumulative and lifelong oxidative injury, and is consistent with the free&#xD;
      radical theory of aging. Observational studies have revealed links between the two&#xD;
      conditions. The commonalities between glaucoma and cognitive decline, including their shared&#xD;
      risk factor profile and pathophysiological pathways, suggest a role for exploring common&#xD;
      mechanisms and perhaps even a shared therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of dietary MP supplementation on MP&#xD;
      levels, serum biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, vision, retinal structure and&#xD;
      cognition in glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design 64 glaucoma participants Treatment arm: 10 mg Lutein, 2 mg zeaxanthin, 10 mg&#xD;
      meso-zeaxanthin - 2/3 Placebo arm: Identical capsule containing no active ingredients - 1/3&#xD;
      Duration of intervention: 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, all glaucoma participants undergo detailed vision assessments including visual&#xD;
      acuity, microperimetry, measurement of macular pigment optical density (MPOD) with&#xD;
      dual-wavelength fundus autofluorescence technique, optical coherence tomography scans,&#xD;
      contrast sensitivity testing with and without glare, photostress recovery time, pupil&#xD;
      reaction assessment, lens fluorescence measurement and fill out vision-related and dietary&#xD;
      questionnaires. Patients also undergo detailed cognitive assessment including the flanker&#xD;
      task, sound-induced flash illusions task, verbal fluency (FAS and animal fluency tests), SKT&#xD;
      (short cognitive assessment) and MMSE (mini-mental state examination) tests which provide&#xD;
      measures of reaction time, short-term memory, multisensory integration and attention. A blood&#xD;
      sample is also collected for analysis of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline assessments, glaucoma participants are randomised (2:1) to receive a&#xD;
      dietary MP supplementation or placebo for 6 months. Each daily dose of the supplement&#xD;
      contains 10mg Lutein, 10mg meso-Zeaxanthin and 2mg Zeaxanthin in a softgel capsule. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of a daily oral consumption of one softgel capsule (recommended to be&#xD;
      consumed with food) for a period of 18 months, with patients compliance checks and re-supply&#xD;
      of supplement every 6 months. The placebo looks identical to the active supplement in its&#xD;
      preparation size, colour, smell and taste. It contains no active ingredients.&#xD;

    <description>This is a lutein (10mg), zeaxanthin (2mg) and meso-zeaxanthin (10mg) one-a-day food supplement which combines all three macular carotenoids.&#xD;
These three nutrients are found at the back of the eye, at the macula, where they form the macular pigment (yellow colour). Meso-zeaxanthin is particularly concentrated at the centre of this pigment.&#xD;
Lutein and zeaxanthin can be found in fruits and dark green leafy vegetables and meso-zeaxanthin is present in some species of fish and seafood.</description>
