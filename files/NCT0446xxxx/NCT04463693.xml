  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to establish pharmacokinetic curves for the etonogestrel&#xD;
      contraceptive implant with scapular subdermal insertion. By obtaining this pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data, the investigators can compare this data to already published pharmacokinetic data with&#xD;
      conventional implant insertion. This comparison can provide some reassurance that the&#xD;
      absorption and distribution of etonogestrel from the contraceptive implant with scapular&#xD;
      insertion is similar to that found with conventional insertion. With similar pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties, the investigators would expect scapular insertion of the implant to maintain&#xD;
      similar contraceptive efficacy for the populations of women that may benefit from this&#xD;
      alternative insertion site. Preliminary safety data will also enrich the understanding of any&#xD;
      potential insertion site side effects with subdermal scapular implant insertion, as the&#xD;
      investigators currently only have a single case report with side effect outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators can then use this pilot data to support future larger investigations on&#xD;
      subdermal scapular implant insertion given its complete avoidance of the neurovascular&#xD;
      complications associated with arm insertion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etonogestrel contraceptive implant (NexplanonÂ®) remains the most effective hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptive method available in the U.S. The contraceptive implant is routinely inserted&#xD;
      just beneath the skin on the inner-side of the non-dominant arm, but insertion at this site&#xD;
      has resulted in rare, yet potentially morbid complications. These complications are due to&#xD;
      the close proximity of major neurovascular structures (e.g. basilic vein, ulnar nerve) in the&#xD;
      sulcus between the biceps and triceps muscles. Insertion of the implant deep in the arm has&#xD;
      resulted in severe complications including migration of the implant into the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature and neurological injury at the time of implant removal. Though these&#xD;
      complications are rare, their report directly led to changes in the manufacturer's mandatory&#xD;
      insertion training to move the implant insertion site inferiorly, though it is unlikely that&#xD;
      this change will completely remove the risk of these rare insertion complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the rare complications of deep implant insertion in the arm, patients with&#xD;
      specific medical conditions are also not ideal candidates for this standard insertion site.&#xD;
      Patients with psychotic illnesses or development delays often require reliable contraception,&#xD;
      but the arm insertion site for the implant is easily accessible and injuries can result from&#xD;
      self-removal attempts among these patients. Furthermore, patients with muscular dystrophy&#xD;
      disorders may not have adequate tissue in this region of the arm to buffer the implant from&#xD;
      the underlying neurovascular structures. In order to address the needs of these patient&#xD;
      populations, insertion of the contraceptive implant at an alternative subdermal scapular site&#xD;
      has been reported in the literature. This insertion just beneath the skin overlying the&#xD;
      inferior edge of the scapula represents an ideal alternative location for the contraceptive&#xD;
      implant due to its location far from danger zones of neurovascular structures,&#xD;
      inaccessibility to patients with mental illnesses, and underlying bony structure preventing&#xD;
      unintentional deep insertion. However, more data are needed regarding the rate of drug&#xD;
      absorption and overall safety with etonogestrel implant insertion at this alternative site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will address this knowledge gap by piloting contraceptive implant insertion at this&#xD;
      alternative scapular site among five healthy, reproductive aged women. The investigators will&#xD;
      insert contraceptive implants at this alternative scapular site and conduct serial&#xD;
      measurements of the amount of drug (etonogestrel) circulating in each participant's system&#xD;
      over the course of one year. These measurements will allow us to compare the amount of&#xD;
      circulating drug from the contraceptive implant between this alternative insertion site and&#xD;
      the already published amounts found with standard insertion in the arm. The investigators&#xD;
      will also ask participants about any insertion site related side effects and also general&#xD;
      implant-related side effects (e.g. abnormal bleeding, headaches, weight gain) during the&#xD;
      course of the study. This will provide preliminary side effect data to help us better&#xD;
      understand patient experience with this alternative insertion site. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that this study will provide reassuring data that can support&#xD;
      future larger investigations on this alternative scapular insertion site for the implant.&#xD;
      This alternative insertion site may allow patients who otherwise are not currently candidates&#xD;
      for the most effective hormonal contraceptive method to uptake contraceptive implants in a&#xD;
      safe manner. This research will also allow healthcare providers to discuss an alternative&#xD;
      site for the contraceptive implant for those patients concerned about the potential risks of&#xD;
      deep arm insertion, thus improving patient-centered options for contraceptive implant&#xD;
      provision.&#xD;
