  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to promote research in the field of Physiotherapy, focusing on a&#xD;
      health problem of maximum relevance, such as patellofemoral pain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these treatments seem to be based on theoretical reasoning, the evidence for the&#xD;
      efficacy of these interventions is not well established. Therefore, we select from among all&#xD;
      the therapeutic tools available in physiotherapy, a procedure of therapeutic physical&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To know the efficacy of a therapeutic physical exercise protocol in the reduction of pain and&#xD;
      the improvement of functional disability in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome&#xD;
      (PFPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify the reduction of pain in the anterior aspect of the knee in patients with&#xD;
           patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), after treatment with monopolar capacitive diathermy&#xD;
           by radiofrequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the improvement of functional disability in patients with patellofemoral&#xD;
           pain syndrome (PFPS), after treatment with monopolar capacitive diathermy by&#xD;
           radiofrequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) with a therapeutic physical exercise&#xD;
      protocol produces statistically significant changes in the reduction of pain and functional&#xD;
      disability and the normalization of the anthropometric values of the joint balance of the&#xD;
      knee&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At first, a meeting will be held with the patients under study where they will be informed&#xD;
      and any doubts that may arise in relation to the investigation will be resolved. In addition,&#xD;
      the correct adaptation of these to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of our study will be&#xD;
      verified. Subsequently, they will be given individually the informed consent prepared&#xD;
      expressly for the present study, the doubts arising with respect to this one will be resolved&#xD;
      and their signature will proceed. At this time, and individually again, we will proceed to&#xD;
      the development of the Clinical History of Physiotherapy where only the information necessary&#xD;
      for our study will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To emphasize in this point that the participants will grant their consent for the treatment&#xD;
      of the data obtained for scientific purposes, according to the legal norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: control group and experimental&#xD;
      group. The randomization of the sample was done through the EPIDAR software in version 3.1&#xD;
      between the Experimental Group and the Control Group Subsequently, the evaluations and&#xD;
      measurements of the study variables will be carried out by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL GROUP: You will be provided exclusively therapeutic exercises protocol to develop&#xD;
      supervised by Physical Therapist that you must perform following a daily activity for three&#xD;
      weeks. They will be evaluated at the end of that period and six moths later in order to have&#xD;
      at least three timepoints to evaluate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL GROUP: After the initial evaluation, the first 10 treatment sessions will be&#xD;
      developed at the rate of five daily sessions in the first week, three sessions on alternate&#xD;
      days in the second week and two sessions on alternate days in the third week (3 weeks in&#xD;
      total), applying the monopolar capacitive diathermy with radiofrequency in the anterior&#xD;
      aspect of the knee, in dynamic application in one of the members: affect or randomized (uni&#xD;
      or bilateral pathology, respectively). This diathermy will be combined with a therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise program supervised by a Physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is administered with a Diathermy equipment and inductive electrodes of 100 W&#xD;
      peak power, with a frequency of application of twice daily with a dose submitis (grade I),&#xD;
      for 10 min, with a frequency of repetition of the impulses of 46 Hz and a pulse duration of&#xD;
      0.2 ms&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the tenth treatment session all the measurements will be repeated following the same&#xD;
      environmental conditions as at the beginning and by the evaluators themselves to the&#xD;
      components of both groups.Those measurements will be evaluated at the end of that three weeks&#xD;
      period and six moths later in order to have at least three timepoints to evaluate.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral PFPS will be divided into two groups, randomly selected (experimental group and control group), of 45 subjects each.&#xD;
Allocation was concealed and it was done by central randomisation by computer (EPIDARcomputer program).&#xD;
The subjects of the experimental group will undergo a program of supervised physical therapeutic exercise. And the subjects of the control group will follow the medical-pharmacological treatment and the ergonomic recommendations according to the established protocol.&#xD;
The target population will be all patients diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) unilaterally or bilaterally, from the health area of La Rinconada while the eligible population will be composed of all those patients residing in or around Seville who can and wish to be part of it. of the study and that they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria</intervention_model_description>
