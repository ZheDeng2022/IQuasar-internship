  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suboxone treated patients present a unique challenge to providers during the perioperative&#xD;
      period in terms of pain control. If the patient is taken off their prescribed suboxone 48&#xD;
      hours prior to the procedure, the opioid pain medication will function but the patient is&#xD;
      exposed to the very medications originally responsible for their substance addiction. The&#xD;
      discontinuation of suboxone can potentially lead to opioid addiction relapse in this&#xD;
      situation (Anderson et al., 2017). If the patient remains on their suboxone, opioid pain&#xD;
      medications can be ineffective or require very large dosages to control pain but the&#xD;
      patient's risk of relapse may be lower (Anderson et al., 2017). Classic opioid pain&#xD;
      medications prescribed by providers for post-operative pain control such as hydromorphone,&#xD;
      morphine and fentanyl have lower affinity for the Mu 1 and 2 receptors when compared to&#xD;
      buprenorphine. These medications are less effective or ineffective when given to a patient&#xD;
      treated with Suboxone due to their inability to bind to the Mu receptor in the presence of&#xD;
      buprenorphine. The only clinically used full agonist opioid with stronger affinity for the MU&#xD;
      1 and 2 receptors is sufentanil. In theory, sufentanil would be able to displace&#xD;
      buprenorphine from the receptor and stimulate the receptor as a full agonist leading to&#xD;
      predictable pain control. Through the Kappa receptor antagonism, buprenorphine may improve&#xD;
      the treatment of opioid-induced hyperalgesia (Koppert W et al., 2005). Additional benefits&#xD;
      may include buprenorphine's Kappa receptor antagonism may help in treating forms of&#xD;
      depression and depression (Lalanne et al., 2014). At our institution, orthopedic trauma&#xD;
      patients have a high incidence of suboxone use and make an ideal study population as they are&#xD;
      often otherwise healthy. Our study compares opioid consumption in the perioperative period in&#xD;
      patients taking suboxone on presentation to the operating room. The patients will randomized&#xD;
      to receive conventional opioid based regimen versus buprenorphine and sufentanil based opioid&#xD;
      regimen. The goal of the study is to determine if the combination of buprenorphine and&#xD;
      sufentanil based pain control is superior to classic opioid treatment strategies in patients&#xD;
      taking suboxone while presenting for orthopedic trauma surgery.&#xD;

      Primary Null Hypothesis A combination sufentanil and buprenorphine based pain control regimen&#xD;
      will not result in lower morphine equivalent requirements for pain control when compared to a&#xD;
      classic fentanyl and hydromorphone based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Working Hypothesis Patient satisfaction survey mean satisfaction scores will be&#xD;
      higher in the buprenorphine and sufentanil treated group when compared to the classic&#xD;
      fentanyl and hydropmorphone treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Null Hypothesis Patient satisfaction surveys mean scores will not be significantly&#xD;
      different in the buprenorphine and sufentanil treated group when compared to the classic&#xD;
      fentanyl and hydropmorphone treated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Working Hypothesis Patients will have significantly lower rates of relapse as&#xD;
      defined by follow up with their home suboxone clinic at 2 and 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Null Hypothesis Patients have equivalent rates of relapse as defined by follow up&#xD;
      with their home suboxone cliic at 2 and 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma Protocol Arm Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Orthopaedic trauma patient with history of suboxone use for greater than 30 days. Trauma&#xD;
           must involve major long bone fracture(s) (femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, radius, ulna)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Must have taken suboxone in the last 24 hours and have participated in addiction&#xD;
           treatment for greater than one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age 18-65&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ASA I-III&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Willing to participate in post-operative psychiatric care&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Glascow Coma Scale 15 Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Severe renal disease (Creatinine clearance &lt; 30) 2. Severe liver disease (AST/ALT greater&#xD;
      than 3 times normal, bilirubin and INR WNL) 3. Acute Ethanol Intoxication (serum ethanol &gt;&#xD;
      0.080) 4. Severe distracting injury that is close to pain levels expected from the orthopedic&#xD;
      trauma (Ex surgical abdominal process, neurosurgical process, massive soft tissue trauma) 5.&#xD;
      Pregnancy Design- After determining the patient qualifies for the study using the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria outlined above, the patient would then be taken through the informed&#xD;
      consent process by one of the co-investigators. The orthopedics group at West Virginia&#xD;
      University will be responsible for the informed consent process. The co-investigator would&#xD;
      then use a block randomization table to assign the patient to standard (control) treatment&#xD;
      versus IV buprenorphine plus IV sufentanil treatment group. The appropriate order set would&#xD;
      then be selected in EPIC by the anesthesia department depending on the results of the&#xD;
      randomization. Induction of anesthesia, anxiolysis and hypnosis would be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the assigned anesthesiologist. Ketamine would be excluded as an option for maintenance of&#xD;
      general anesthesia due to its profound analgesic properties. The control group would receive&#xD;
      fentanyl 0.5mcg/kg q10 minute PRN, ketorolac 0.5mg/kg up to 30mg max IV, and acetaminophen&#xD;
      1000mg IV for pain control intraoperatively. The patient would then be treated with&#xD;
      hydromorphone 0.005mg/kg q10 minutes (max single dose 1mg) in the post-anesthesia recovery&#xD;
      unit (PACU) until their pain was described as manageable or the patient reported they were&#xD;
      comfortable. The patient would then receive hydromorphone 0.005 mg/kg (max single dose 1mg)&#xD;
      q1hr PRN, 1 gram acetaminophen IV scheduled q6hr, and methocarbamol 750mg QID following&#xD;
      discharge from the PACU and transfer to the hospital floor. The patient would then be&#xD;
      converted to oxymorphone 10mg (Roxicodone) q4hr PRN and 975 mg PO APAP scheduled for pain&#xD;
      control on hospital day number 2. The patients would receive their home dose of suboxone on&#xD;
      hospital day number 2. On hospital day number 3, patients would be transitioned to an&#xD;
      increased dose of their Suboxone for pain control in preparation for discharge. At any time&#xD;
      during admission the patient feels as if their pain is uncontrolled and comfort could not be&#xD;
      achieved, the anesthesia pain service would evaluate the patient and order sufentanil PCA&#xD;
      while discontinuing other opioid therapy. This treatment would be considered a rescue therapy&#xD;
      and the patient would be removed from the study arm. The buprenorphine-sufentanil group would&#xD;
      receive sufentanil 0.01 mcg/kg q10 min PRN, IV ketorolac 0.5mg/kg up to 30mg max and IV&#xD;
      acetaminophen 15mg/kg up to 1000mg for pain control intraoperatively. In the PACU, IV&#xD;
      buprenorphine 0.3mg IV q30 minutes would be given as the first line choice for pain control&#xD;
      for 3 doses. IV PCA sufentanil would be used as a second line therapy if patient comfort is&#xD;
      not achieved by IV buprenorphine alone. The patient would then receive 0.3 mg buprenorphine&#xD;
      IV Q6hr PRN, scheduled IV acetaminophen 1 gram for 24 hours and methocarbamol 750mg QID after&#xD;
      discharge from the PACU and transfer to the hospital floor on hospital day 1. The patient&#xD;
      would then be converted to buprenorphine 2mg q6hr PRN and 975 gram PO APAP scheduled for pain&#xD;
      control on hospital day number 2. The patient would receive their home dose of suboxone&#xD;
      starting on hospital day number 2. On hospital day number 3, patients would be transitioned&#xD;
      to an increased dose of their suboxone for pain control as determined by psychiatry in&#xD;
      preparation for discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively both groups would receive psychiatric consult and PT/OT consult. Data on&#xD;
      opioid consumption for the intra-operative period and post-operative period as well as&#xD;
      post-operative pain scores will be recorded and analyzed for comparison. Morphine equivalents&#xD;
      used per hour and per 24 hours would be analyzed as a primary endpoint. A patient pain&#xD;
      satisfaction survey would be distributed and collected from both groups on hospital day #3. A&#xD;
      copy of the survey is attached. Data on length of stay, pain scores, and ED readmission for&#xD;
      pain control would also be recorded and analyzed. Patients would be discharged on increased&#xD;
      dose suboxone for 2 weeks for post-operative pain control. The patients would then transition&#xD;
      back to their normal suboxone maintenance dose. A follow up phone call would be made at 2 and&#xD;
      4 weeks to the home clinic to assess patient follow up and potential relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the control or treatment group, with equal allocation using block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use univariate statistics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile&#xD;
      range) to summarize the collected data. Balance between the two groups for key patient&#xD;
      variables will be assessed using a two-sided two-sample t-test using unequal variances and&#xD;
      the Welch modification to the degrees of freedom. For categorical variables, the Chi-square&#xD;
      test will be used. If non-parametric tests or exact methods are required, we will use the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test and the Fisher exact test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary comparison of total opioid consumption between the two groups will be assessed&#xD;
      using Student's t-test. Statistical significance will be assessed using a two-sided test with&#xD;
      an alpha-level of 0.05. All statistical analysis will be performed using the R software&#xD;
      environment for statistical computing and graphics.(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning a study of a continuous response variable from independent control and&#xD;
      experimental subjects with 1 control per experimental subject. In a previous study the&#xD;
      response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 135.5.&#xD;
      (2) If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 90.3, we will need to&#xD;
      study 48 experimental subjects and 48 control subjects (total = 96) to be able to reject the&#xD;
      null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal&#xD;
      with probability (power) 0.9.&#xD;
