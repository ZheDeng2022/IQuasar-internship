  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our project is to better understand the characteristics of the young patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease presenting for cardiac catheterization at our institution and to&#xD;
      put forth a program to optimize their risk factors with a focus on gender differences. We&#xD;
      will assess traditional and non-traditional risk factors, as well as genetics and&#xD;
      environment. These characteristics will be compared by gender to determine unique factors&#xD;
      related to women that could subsequently be targeted. The program will begin with universal&#xD;
      education about the process of atherosclerosis, risk factors contributing to the disease and&#xD;
      specific risk factor goals for each patient for the 6 month program. The patients will then&#xD;
      be part of a bimonthly 6 month cardiovascular risk reduction program that will offer both a&#xD;
      nutritional program with teaching kitchen component, and exercise instruction lead by an&#xD;
      exercise physiologist. Psychological support will be provided to address stress that impairs&#xD;
      quality of life, depression or anxiety to fully optimize the lifestyle component. These&#xD;
      sessions will be done virtually in order to comply with social distancing until in person&#xD;
      sessions can resume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational endpoints of this program will include a variety of CVD risk factors,&#xD;
      biomarkers, lifestyle behaviors, quality of life and guideline-based medical regimen. At the&#xD;
      end of this phase, we aim to both better understand differences in risk factors and the&#xD;
      interventions with the biggest impact in terms of risk factor optimization in men vs. women.&#xD;
