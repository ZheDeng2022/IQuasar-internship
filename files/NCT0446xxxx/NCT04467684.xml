  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      to assess the PK, safety, tolerability and PD of CB-0406 in healthy participants. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted as a 2-part study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a 2-part study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is designed as single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study investigating 5 dose&#xD;
      levels. Each cohort will consist of participants (N=8) to be randomly assigned to receive a&#xD;
      blinded oral dose of CB-0406 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). Dose levels of CB-0406 in the sequential&#xD;
      cohorts will be 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg or 1000 mg to be administered once on each&#xD;
      cohorts study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is designed as multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study investigating up to 5&#xD;
      dose levels as determined by the SAD cohort. Doses will be determined following completion&#xD;
      and review of the safety and PK findings for Cohorts 1 to Cohort 5 in Part 1.&#xD;
