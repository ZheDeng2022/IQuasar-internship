  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research was planned to determine the effect of different blood groups on the 90-day&#xD;
      survival of intensive care patients who were treated and maintained for the first time in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a retrospective descriptive research. For the first time in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit aged 18 and over, between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019, of a state and a&#xD;
      university hospital in the Western Black Sea Region, in intensive care units (both medical&#xD;
      and surgical patients), All the patients, who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      for at least 24 hours, were discharged from the intensive care unit for 90 days and less, and&#xD;
      all the information in the Patient Information Form can be accessed from the automation&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted between 01.04.2020-01.07.2020 by collecting the necessary data&#xD;
      within the 'Patient Information Form' of the patients from the information processing unit of&#xD;
      the hospitals where the research will be conducted.&#xD;

      Intensive care units; They are units where advanced technological tools and equipment are&#xD;
      used to provide the highest level of benefit to life-threatened patients, and physicians and&#xD;
      nurses specializing in the treatment and care of patients are involved. Intensive care&#xD;
      patients; '' To prevent patients who are at risk due to physiological decompensation and&#xD;
      patients who are physically physiologically fluctuating, need a treatment to be carried out&#xD;
      with the harmony between physician and nurse to ensure survival, the application of this&#xD;
      treatment without showing waves, especially details and care, and unexpected adverse events.&#xD;
      and patients who require continuous monitoring to provide immediate intervention by the&#xD;
      intensive care team. Intensive care patients, as can be understood from the definition, are&#xD;
      the patients whose general conditions change rapidly due to the presence of a&#xD;
      life-threatening condition, due to the impact of several systems that require close&#xD;
      monitoring and control vital functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, etc. Many conditions, such as chronic diseases,&#xD;
      genetic, individual and environmental factors, of patients who are in danger of life due to&#xD;
      many important health problems can affect the prognosis of the patients. In addition to these&#xD;
      factors, although there is insufficient evidence, blood groups are reported to be effective&#xD;
      in the survival of intensive care patients. Whatever the underlying situation is, the most&#xD;
      important thing is undoubtedly the blood for the maintenance of a healthy life. It is known&#xD;
      to affect human health in many cases, from the amount of blood circulating in the vein to the&#xD;
      structure of blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was found for the first time in the years of 1899 and 1900 that human blood differs from&#xD;
      individual to individual due to some physiological features. These different blood groups&#xD;
      discovered are A, B and AB. Later, with the discovery of the Rh factor along with the O&#xD;
      (zero) blood group, studies on the effects and differences of blood groups on humans have&#xD;
      increased rapidly. Today, studies on the relationship between blood groups and diseases are&#xD;
      ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of some studies; It has been determined that the AB blood group plays a role as a&#xD;
      risk factor in both venous thromboembolism and coronary artery disease. The risk of both&#xD;
      arterial and venous thrombotic events in the AB blood group There is evidence that it has&#xD;
      high levels of vonWillebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII. Depending on the limitation of&#xD;
      mobilization in intensive care patients, it may increase the negative effect of the blood&#xD;
      group on the patient compared to the patients hospitalized in other clinics. However, in&#xD;
      patient groups with a high risk of bleeding, this may provide additional benefit for patients&#xD;
      with AB blood group with higher levels of vonWillebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII. In&#xD;
      their research, Franchini et al. Reported that bleeding rate increased significantly in&#xD;
      patients with O blood group, especially in surgical procedures with high risk of blood loss.&#xD;
      Therefore, it has been observed that patients with AB blood group are more likely to survive&#xD;
      after major heart surgery and this situation is explained in relation to the decrease in the&#xD;
      number of blood transfusions. The results of metaanalysis study of Dentali et al. Also&#xD;
      pointed out that having an O blood group in terms of bleeding may be an important genetic&#xD;
      factor. It is important that the intensive care nurse includes this information in patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study conducted to determine the link between ABO blood group, lipid profiles and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and to determine the effect size of the link, patients in the A blood&#xD;
      group were found to have higher total cholesterol rates while lower LDL rates. Jiang et al;&#xD;
      They found that ABO blood groups were not associated with age, gender, and blood pressure in&#xD;
      stable coronary artery patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, but blood&#xD;
      groups were associated with 2-year cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is known that genetic diversity affecting the prognosis of patients is a factor&#xD;
      in determining survival after being taken into intensive care, it can be difficult and costly&#xD;
      to evaluate in a short time in clinical practice. Also, to predict the prognosis of critical&#xD;
      patients in intensive care units today. it is still very difficult. In this context,&#xD;
      individualized medicine; It can provide a better understanding of patients' risks arising&#xD;
      from genetic, environmental and social factors and better planning of the results of&#xD;
      treatment. At the onset of critical illness, knowing all possible risk factors to effectively&#xD;
      manage patients creates a chance to achieve more successful treatment and care outcomes. more&#xD;
      difficult to determine the effect on survival of genetic diversity, although there is nothing&#xD;
      for a long time consuming and costly, ABO blood group of the survival effect according to the&#xD;
      risk classification system, the addition of both easier, additional benefits to the patient&#xD;
      to be quickly and cost-free by the Ministry of Health in sağlayabilir. Türkiye APACHE II&#xD;
      (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) is the most commonly used scale to calculate&#xD;
      the expected mortality rate according to the severity of the disease that is approved and&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between patients' blood groups and mortality is thought to exist as a result&#xD;
      of research. In the research of Slade et al; After the patients were admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, the relationship between blood groups and mortality was evaluated in the&#xD;
      90-day period; It has been determined that patients with intensive care with AB blood group&#xD;
      have a higher 90-day survival time compared to other blood group patients. In line with this&#xD;
      result, there is a need for studies for the risk assessment scales and the addition of the&#xD;
      blood group factor for intensive care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality nursing care is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients. It is&#xD;
      predicted that the application of individualized patient care will positively affect the&#xD;
      physiological, psychological and social health of the patient. Nurses are healthcare&#xD;
      professionals who are in key condition next to the patient in any case in intensive care&#xD;
      units. Higher quality care of nurses at the center of many interventions in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit has been associated with improved patient outcomes, including mortality. In line&#xD;
      with this information, the research was planned to determine the effect of different blood&#xD;
      groups on the 90-day survival of intensive care patients who were treated and maintained for&#xD;
      the first time in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
