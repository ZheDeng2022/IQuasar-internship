      Background. Large burns are the cause of extensive skeletal muscle devastation. The&#xD;
      possibilities of rehabilitation of such patients are very limited, which contributes to the&#xD;
      risk of metabolic failure and long-term musculoskeletal disorders. Illusory movements are a&#xD;
      relatively new method of physiotherapy, which through functional proprioceptive stimulation&#xD;
      enables the integration and networking of muscle units and has a neurotrophic effect on the&#xD;
      cerebral cortex. In our pilot study, we demonstrated that illusory movements significantly&#xD;
      increased basal energy expenditure in extensively burned patients in a catabolic state and&#xD;
      with healing impairment in the later stage of burn disease. However, the metabolic effects of&#xD;
      illusory movements have not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested hypotheses. 1. The use of illusory movements is suitable for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      patients with burns on 20% or more of the total body surface area (TBSA) in the early phase&#xD;
      of the burn disease. 2. The use of illusory movements in these patients attenuates the extent&#xD;
      of muscle catabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. Pragmatic crossover study. Twenty patients with burns on 20% or more of the body&#xD;
      surface area will be divided into two groups. They will be rehabilitated early or delayed by&#xD;
      illusory movements for 14 days. Among other things, the following metabolic parameters will&#xD;
      be monitored: nitrogen balance, basal and resting energy expenditure (BMR, REE), insulin&#xD;
      resistance (IR), myokinins levels, muscle mitochondrial function and their morphology, and&#xD;
      ultrasound cross-sectional diameter of the rectus femoris muscle. The control group will&#xD;
      consist of ten healthy volunteers, in whom resting energy expenditure before and after using&#xD;
      illusory movements exercise will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to find out whether illusory movements are suitable for patients&#xD;
      in the early phase of burn disease, and how they influence patients' metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are going to test these hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of illusory movements is suitable for patients with burns of 20 % TBSA and more&#xD;
           in the early acute phase of the burn disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of illusory movements reduces the extent of muscle catabolism in patients with&#xD;
           large burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Way of solution This is a pragmatic cross-over study in patients with burns of 20 % TBSA or&#xD;
      more in the early acute phase of the burn disease, who are expected to be hospitalized for 35&#xD;
      days or more. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be divided into two groups, A (n =&#xD;
      10) and B (n = 10). Group C will consist of healthy volunteers (n = 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start after patient's basic cardiopulmonary stabilization, which usually&#xD;
      corresponds to days 3-5 after the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Early illusory movements Phase 1: A patient enrolled in group A will have standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation according to the instructions of the attending surgeon and performed by an&#xD;
      independent physiotherapist from the start of the study (Day 1), and also FPS performed by a&#xD;
      study nurse will take place for 30 minutes twice a day, 2 hours or more after the end of&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation, for 14 days (Day 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: From Day 16 onwards, the patient will undergo standard rehabilitation only according&#xD;
      to the instructions of the attending surgeon and performed by an independent physiotherapist&#xD;
      for 14 days (Day 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Deferred illusory movements Phase 1: A patient enrolled in group B will have&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation according to the instructions of the attending surgeon and performed&#xD;
      by an independent physiotherapist, from the start of the study (Day 1) for 14 days (Day 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Then, from Day 16 onwards, in addition to standard physiotherapy, FPS performed by a&#xD;
      study nurse will take place for 30 minutes twice a day, 2 hours or more after the end of&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation, for 14 days (Day 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Illusory movements in healthy individuals This group will consist of 10 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers in whom REE will be measured before and after 30 minutes of FPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c) Medical, social and economic rationale of this study Large burns are often the cause of&#xD;
      neuromyopathy and disability of the injured [30]. Hypercatabolism and enormous muscle loss&#xD;
      increase the morbidity and mortality of patients, prolong treatment and greatly increase the&#xD;
      overall cost of medical care [31]. Early rehabilitation using illusory movements could reduce&#xD;
      the extent of muscle devastation in otherwise immobile patients and improve the effect of&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation by maintaining functional brain maps. This should lead to an earlier&#xD;
      return of the injured to their normal activities a improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, if the positive effects of illusory movements are proved, there are many&#xD;
      critically ill patients outside the burns who could benefit from this form of physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d) Methodology Nutrition support will be provided in accordance with European Society of&#xD;
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the following parameters will be measured, and the following examinations&#xD;
      will be performed in addition to standard biochemical, haematological and imaging&#xD;
      examinations of Group A and B:&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Functional Proprioceptive Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Functional Proprioceptive Stimulations (FPS) are applied on the musculo-tendinous junction. FPS mechanically stimulate the muscle spindles, mimicking the sensory signals - Ia fibers of functional movements. This neurosensory trick activates related sensory-motor areas allowing patients to feel natural movements. Because sensory &amp; motor systems are interdependent, the central nervous system then reacts by initiating corresponding movements.</description>
