      This is a single group, multicenter, open-label study with a study population of patients who&#xD;
      meet International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-III) criteria for&#xD;
      migraine with or without aura and have 4 to 20 migraine days per month. This is a&#xD;
      single-group supportive care study with one arm and no masking. A maximum of 54 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled to study intervention. All participants in this single-group study will&#xD;
      complete a 4-week run-in period. After the run-in period, eligible participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled to study intervention and enter a 12-week treatment period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Treatment Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Migraine Functional Impact Questionnaire (MFIQ) is a 26-item self-report questionnaire. It is designed to measure the impact of migraine on physical, social, and emotional functioning over 5 domains: Physical Function (PF), Usual Activities (UA), Overall impact on Usual Activities, Social Function (SF), and Emotional Function (EF). Final transformed scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating more impact on the participant. For this endpoint we will be measuring changes in participant's response on the single MFIQ Global Item Overall Impact on Usual Activities (item # 16). The item's transformed score can range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating more impact on the participant. Change = (Treatment Month 3 Score - Baseline Score)</description>
