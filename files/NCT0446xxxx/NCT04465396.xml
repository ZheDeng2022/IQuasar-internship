    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioavailability of teduglutide administered as a&#xD;
      single subcutaneous (SC) fixed dose (depending upon participant weightband assignment)&#xD;
      delivered by a syringe injection and the same fixed dose delivered by the pen injector in&#xD;
      healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-period crossover study and consists of two cohorts. Cohort 1 consists of&#xD;
      participant's with greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 40.0 kilogram (kg) to lesser than or equal&#xD;
      to (&lt;=) 75.0 kg of weight and Cohort 2 consists of participant's with greater than (&gt;) 75.0&#xD;
      kg to &lt;= 120.0 kg of weight. Participants in each cohort will be randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment periods (Period I and Period II) with sequence AB and BA. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by injection site (i.e., thigh, abdomen, and arm) within each cohort.&#xD;
