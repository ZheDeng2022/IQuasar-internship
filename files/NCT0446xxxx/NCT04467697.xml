      The purpose of this six-month treatment extension study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess feasibility of a lower starting dose of SOV2012-F1 (daily dose of 400 mg [200&#xD;
           mg with breakfast meal and 200mg with dinner meal]) to titrate individual doses in order&#xD;
           to further enhance drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the blood pressure (BP) effects of Marius's oral testosterone undecanoate&#xD;
           formulation, SOV2012-F1, using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).&#xD;

      This is the six-month treatment extension of Study MRS-TU-2019, which like Study MRS-TU-2019&#xD;
      (NCT03198728), is an open-label study. The MRS-TU-2019 ABPM Extension Study (MRS-TU-2019EXT;&#xD;
      NCT04467697), will extend the participation for up to 170 MRS-TU-2019 subjects who chose to&#xD;
      enroll into the MRS-TU-2019EXT, for a target of 135 evaluable subjects reaching the 4-month&#xD;
      ABPM assessment&#xD;
