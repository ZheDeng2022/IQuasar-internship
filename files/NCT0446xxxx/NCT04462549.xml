    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test a service the investigators of the study believe may&#xD;
      increase quality of life after brain injury and reduce the level of disability that might be&#xD;
      associated with that injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention is called &quot;Resource Facilitation&quot; and involves working one on one with a&#xD;
      brain injury specialist. This specialist is called a &quot;Resource Facilitator&quot; and will work&#xD;
      with participants to help set and achieve their own goals along with a team of professionals&#xD;
      that specialize in this kind of injury. If randomly assigned to the Resource Facilitation&#xD;
      group, participants will receive Resource Facilitation free of charge. If not, they will be&#xD;
      assigned to a control group and will not receive the intervention. However, both groups will&#xD;
      receive calls every three months. During these calls, a research assistant will collect data&#xD;
      about each participant's recovery and progress. If assigned to the Resource Facilitation&#xD;
      group, participants may also receive study information in the mail if research assistants are&#xD;
      unable to reach participants via telephone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 2.5 million people are hospitalized each year for traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The&#xD;
      Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) found in 2013 that more than 50,000 Hoosiers&#xD;
      suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Further, the prevalence of TBI-related disability in&#xD;
      Indiana was found to be 66,410. These findings clearly indicate that Indiana has a&#xD;
      significant health care and social burden associated with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, investigators have made substantial progress through our previous TBI HRSA grants in&#xD;
      the development and evaluation of the RF model as applied to vocational rehabilitation&#xD;
      outcomes. However, there are many people in Indiana who do not have access to these services.&#xD;
      Further, TBI is now recognized to be a chronic health condition, and investigators have not&#xD;
      implemented Resource Facilitation (RF) to improve or stabilize health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through our 2009-2014 HRSA TBI grant, investigators became interested in the RF model, but&#xD;
      noted the absence of empirical outcome data to support its effectiveness. To address this&#xD;
      need, investigators conducted the first randomized controlled trial of RF with 22&#xD;
      participants who were recruited while they were still in acute brain injury rehabilitation,&#xD;
      and were, on average, approximately 3 months post-injury. The participants were randomized to&#xD;
      RF or a treatment as usual control group. After six months, it was found that 64% of the RF&#xD;
      treatment group was successful at returning to competitive employment as compared to 36% of&#xD;
      the control group (Wald-Wolfkowitz z = -3.277, p &lt; .0001). While it was found that both&#xD;
      groups had reduced level of disability at follow-up (F = 60.65, p &lt; .0001), it was also found&#xD;
      that the interaction for groups and time was significant (F = 9.11, p = .007) indicating that&#xD;
      the participants who received RF were significantly less disabled at follow-up as compared to&#xD;
      the control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings were replicated in a larger randomized controlled trial that studied 44&#xD;
      participants with acquired brain injury that were again approximately 2-3 months post-injury.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized to 12 months of RF or a treatment as usual control group. The&#xD;
      results again demonstrated a significant advantage for the RF group (69%) for both rate of&#xD;
      return to work as compared to the control group (50%) and how quickly they returned to work.&#xD;
      Using a logistic regression, investigators found that group assignment was a significant&#xD;
      predictor of vocational outcome (Wald = 4.91, p= .027) and RF participants were found to be&#xD;
      seven times more likely to return to productive community-based work as compared to controls&#xD;
      (95% confidence interval, 1.25-39.15). The evidence supporting the efficacy of RF seemed&#xD;
      sufficient to support a clinical trial to examine effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these two publications, Indiana Vocational Rehabilitation supported a prospective&#xD;
      clinical cohort study of the effectiveness of RF. In this study, investigators provided RF to&#xD;
      210 clients of Indiana Vocational Rehabilitation and compared their vocational outcomes to&#xD;
      the participants in the control groups in our two previous randomized controlled trials. In&#xD;
      contrast to our randomized controlled trials, these participants who received RF were almost&#xD;
      10 years post-injury. Of the 210 participants in the RF treatment group, 69% (n=145)&#xD;
      successfully returned to competitive work. Six of these 145 successful outcomes were for&#xD;
      participants that had a goal of return to post-high school education. Investigators compared&#xD;
      these outcomes for the RF cohort with the outcomes attained by the control groups from our&#xD;
      two previous randomized controlled trials and found that 48% (n=16) of the control&#xD;
      participants successfully returned to paid employment. The difference between the two groups&#xD;
      revealed a significant advantage for the RF group (Î§2(1)=5.39, p = .018). These results&#xD;
      certainly provided evidence for the effectiveness of RF for helping people get back to work&#xD;
      after acquired brain injury in a cohort referred to us by Indiana Vocational Rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the success of our HRSA TBI grants and the results from the first two randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials and the prospective clinical cohort study, Indiana Vocational&#xD;
      Rehabilitation decided to support RF for any person with a brain injury and who qualified for&#xD;
      services in 2014, and RF was made available throughout the state of Indiana by 2015. Today,&#xD;
      approximately 350 individuals with acquired brain injury are receiving RF at any one time.&#xD;
      However, it is quite noteworthy that investigators had more than 700 referrals from the&#xD;
      community for RF, the vast majority of which will not qualify for Indiana Vocational&#xD;
      Rehabilitation services. It is for these reasons that in Indiana, investigators need to&#xD;
      expand access to RF to promote optimal health outcomes and decrease disability associated&#xD;
      with TBI.&#xD;
