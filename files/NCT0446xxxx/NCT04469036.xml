  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 41 million children, or 55 percent of all children in the United States, live more&#xD;
      than 30 minutes away from a pediatric trauma center. The management of pediatric trauma&#xD;
      requires medical expertise that is only available at Level I pediatric trauma centers, which&#xD;
      are specialized pediatric referral hospitals located in large urban cities. Smaller hospitals&#xD;
      lack pediatric trauma expertise and resources to properly care for these children. When a&#xD;
      small hospital receives a child with trauma, the standard of care is to conduct a telephone&#xD;
      consultation to a pediatric trauma specialist, err on the side of safety, and transfer the&#xD;
      child to the regional Level I pediatric trauma center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newer model of care, the Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center (VPTC), uses live video, or&#xD;
      telemedicine, to bring the expertise of a Level I pediatric trauma center virtually to&#xD;
      patients at any hospital emergency department. While the VPTC model is being used more&#xD;
      frequently, the advantages and disadvantages of these two systems of care remain unknown,&#xD;
      particularly with regard to parent/family-centered outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to optimize the patient and family experience and to minimize&#xD;
      distress, healthcare utilization, and out-of-pocket costs following the injury of a child.&#xD;
      The results of this project will help to optimize communication, confidence, and shared&#xD;
      decision making between parents/families and clinical staff from both the transferring and&#xD;
      receiving hospitals.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 days after emergency department visit</time_frame>
    <description>19 questions from the Communication with Parent Subscale of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Child Hospital Survey; specifically, we will report the following measures: Communication between you and your child's nurses (composite measure); Communication between you and your child's doctors (composite measure); Communication about your child's medicines (composite measure); Keeping you informed about your child's care (composite measure) Privacy when talking with doctors, nurses, and other providers (single-item measure); Preparing you and your child to leave the hospital (composite measure); Keeping you informed about your child's care in the Emergency Room (single-item measure). Higher scores are better; 0 (minimum) - 100 (maximum)</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after emergency department visit</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures state anxiety levels and is an easy-to-implement inventory that the individual can answer on his/her own. Responses for the State Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms.</description>

    <measure>30-day healthcare utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after emergency department visit</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare utilization will include measures such as hospitalization, re-hospitalization, primary and specialty healthcare visits, and diagnostics; these rates will be compared between the control and intervention groups</description>

    <measure>3-day Out of Pocket Costs</measure>
