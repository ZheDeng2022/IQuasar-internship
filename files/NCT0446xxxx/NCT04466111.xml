      This is a post-market, open-label, prospective, multi-center, observational study evaluating&#xD;
      upper limb pain relief with the DTM™ SCS programming approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data at follow-up visits will be compared to baseline assessments collected at the beginning&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected total duration of this study is approximately 26 months. Enrollment of&#xD;
      participants is expected to last 20 months. Participants that have received the permanent&#xD;
      implant will be followed up for 12 months after their device has been activated. A&#xD;
      participant will likely be committed to the study for about 14 months. This consists of&#xD;
      Baseline assessments, up to 10 days of trial stimulation, and 12 months of treatment&#xD;
      following implantation and activation of the device. All subjects who plan on remaining&#xD;
      implanted through the 6-month visit or who have completed their 6-month visit will be offered&#xD;
      to return for an additional 12-month visit. This would increase their commitment to the study&#xD;
      to 14 months.&#xD;
