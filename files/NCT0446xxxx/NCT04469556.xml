  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized multicentre phase II trial with a large translational component. The&#xD;
      trial will evaluate the two standard chemotherapy regimens: modified folfirinox (mFFX) and&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GA), in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. Integrated into this phase II trial are a number of laboratory components&#xD;
      including molecular profiling, patient derived organoid establishment, and drug testing&#xD;
      sensitivity and other biomarkers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two chemotherapy regimens GA and mFFX remain standard treatment options without&#xD;
      biomarkers to predict response. PASS-01 will for the first time explore progression free&#xD;
      survival differences in the two standard backbone regimens used in the advanced setting.&#xD;
      Biomarker driven strategies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are lacking, perhaps&#xD;
      accounting for a large number of failed phase II studies. This study will evaluate two&#xD;
      standard of care chemotherapy regimens, but will also explore high content molecular&#xD;
      profiling, chemotherapy sensitivity signatures, GATA6 and other putative biomarkers as&#xD;
      predictors of response to chemotherapy. In addition, the use of patient derived organoid&#xD;
      models for personalized medicine in PDAC will continue to develop within this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 150 patients diagnosed with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer will be&#xD;
      randomized to either arm.&#xD;
