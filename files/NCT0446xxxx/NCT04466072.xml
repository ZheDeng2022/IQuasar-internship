  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) are the most common causes of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death in patients with diseased hearts. The factors contributing to these&#xD;
      deadly arrhythmias are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a wide variety of microbial flora in the human GI tract, particularly colon&#xD;
      has been well recognized for a long time. There are also emerging links showing the effect of&#xD;
      an intact gut microbiome having effects on left ventricular remodeling after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and hypertension. Gut microbiota has also been associated with outcomes in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little available in current literature showing a relationship between gut microbiome&#xD;
      characteristics and ventricular arrhythmia burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome has particularly strong interactions with neuroendocrine and immunologic&#xD;
      mediators and has effects on the modulation of the autonomic nervous system. These systems&#xD;
      are also hypothesized to influence ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the relation and interaction between gut microbiome and ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmogenesis.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To identify specific gut microbiome characteristics of patients who are prone to&#xD;
      clinically significant or high burden of ventricular arrhythmias compared with patients with&#xD;
      similar conventional risk factors and low burden of ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine changes that occur in the gut microbiome composition after treatment of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 30 subjects recruited from the electrophysiology device clinic at the&#xD;
      VA medical center, who are individuals with underlying cardiomyopathy and prone to&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out of this cohort, we will identify 2 groups who have different ventricular arrhythmia&#xD;
      burden despite similar conventional clinical factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information regarding ventricular arrhythmia burden will be obtained from device&#xD;
      interrogation at the time of recruitment. Our proposal is study and compare the fecal&#xD;
      microbial composition of these groups to analyze association with ventricular arrhythmia&#xD;
      burden. Patients will provide a fecal sample for analysis at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinically indicated treatment in the high ventricular arrhythmia group, we will retest&#xD;
      fecal samples to assess for changes in characteristics after treatment. This will be done to&#xD;
      study changes in the gut microbiome with ventricular arrhythmia in the same individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial testing of the high burden group, they will undergo treatment aimed at&#xD;
      decreasing their burden of arrhythmia, with some combination of anti-arrhythmic drugs,&#xD;
      sympathetic blockade, or ventricular tachycardia ablation. After demonstrating a period of 3&#xD;
      months without sustained VT/VF on device interrogation, their fecal samples will be&#xD;
      re-analyzed. If a patient continues to have VT/VF requiring intermittent device therapies&#xD;
      despite a 6 month period of intensification of therapy, their fecal sample will be&#xD;
      re-analyzed after that 6 month timeframe.&#xD;
