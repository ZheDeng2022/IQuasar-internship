  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREPARE-IT investigator-initiated trial program is a simple, pragmatic, therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy evaluating pure icosapent ethyl (IPE) at initially higher doses intended to reduce&#xD;
      infection rates and subsequent morbidity and mortality among subjects at high risk of&#xD;
      infection due to COVID-19 (prevention arm), and to reduce the hospitalization rate and&#xD;
      complications in patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 (treatment arm).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few vaccines have received emergency authorization providing relative immunity, reducing both&#xD;
      transmission and infection rates and subsequent associated morbidity and mortality. However,&#xD;
      broad access to vaccines is limited globally, and emergence of COVID-19 viral mutations and&#xD;
      vaccine breakthrough cases underscore the need for complementary effective therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are limited systemic options available for effective treatment from&#xD;
      viral-inhibitors, polyclonal antibodies (immunomodulatory drugs) to mitigate the inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade and subsequent cytokine storm, and low-dose steroids such as dexamethasone in&#xD;
      high-risk patients, which was associated with a reduction in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Icosapent ethyl (IPE) is a safe, well-tolerated oral therapy proven to be effective in&#xD;
      improving outcomes in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes with one&#xD;
      or more additional risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of COVID-19, a recent pilot study on 50 patients on a loading dose of 8g/day&#xD;
      for three days, followed by 4g/daily showed a significant improvement in validated&#xD;
      patient-reported FLU-PRO score symptoms. A corresponding reduction in a key biomarker of&#xD;
      inflammation (hs-CRP) was also detected within the IPE arm at 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this pilot study provides the first evidence of an early anti-inflammatory effect of&#xD;
      IPE, to confirm these findings, we designed a randomized, placebo-controlled study program&#xD;
      investigating IPE with a similar loading dose intended to reduce infection rates and&#xD;
      subsequent morbidity and mortality among subjects at high risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (prevention arm), and to reduce the hospitalization rate and complications in patients with a&#xD;
      positive diagnosis of COVID-19 (treatment arm).&#xD;
