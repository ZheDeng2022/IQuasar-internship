    <textblock>
      A prospective, controlled, open trial in psoriasis patients with metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      candidate to methotrexate or secukinumab was conducted between January 2019 and May 2020. The&#xD;
      primary end point of the study was investigating any variations in waist circumference, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (LDL)-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine levels between baseline&#xD;
      and month-6 and 12 of follow-up.&#xD;

      A prospective, non-randomized controlled open trial in psoriasis patients with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome was conducted between January 2019 and May 2020. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18&#xD;
      years, being affected by moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and concomitant&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and being candidate to systemic treatment with methotrexate or secukinumab&#xD;
      according to the Italian guideline for psoriasis. Psoriasis was diagnosed on clinical base,&#xD;
      and it was classified as moderate to severe if PASI ≥ 10, Investigator Global Assessment&#xD;
      (IGA) score≥ 3 and/or Dermatology Life Quality Index ≥ 10%. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed&#xD;
      according to criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel&#xD;
      III (NCEP ATP III) and The American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute (AHA/NHLB).3 In particular, metabolic syndrome was confirmed in presence of at&#xD;
      least three of the following components: abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 102 cm for&#xD;
      men or ≥ 88 cm for women), triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol ≤ 40 mg/dL for men or&#xD;
      50 mg/dL for women, systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg or receiving drug&#xD;
      treatment, and fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria were being affected by&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis, pregnancy, breast feeding, having initiated a systemic treatment for&#xD;
      psoriasis in the previous 3 months and having a clinical condition that could affect the&#xD;
      metabolic parameters other than metabolic syndrome. After having signed the informed consent&#xD;
      for the participation in the study, eligible patients were consecutively assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to secukinumab (standard dose) or methotrexate 15 mg/week by subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration and folic acid supplementation 5 mg given 24 hours after methotrexate. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint was investigating any variation in waist circumference, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), blood pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (LDL)-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine levels at month-6. Any&#xD;
      other adverse events related to the treatments and the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      discontinued the treatment because of adverse reactions were also reported. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints were assessing the PASI 75 and PASI 90 proportion of responders in the two groups&#xD;
      at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Clinical and laboratory data were evaluated at the baseline and&#xD;
      every 3 months up to month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods A descriptive statistic was conducted using proportions for categorical&#xD;
      and mean and standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables. The categorical variables&#xD;
      were compared between the groups using the chi-squared test, while the quantitative variables&#xD;
      were compared using the Student's T test. Variations in waist circumference, BMI, blood&#xD;
      pressure, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, AST, ALT, creatinine levels between baseline and month-6 or 12 were assessed&#xD;
      by paired t-test in patient receiving methotrexate or secukinumab, respectively. PASI 75 and&#xD;
      PASI 90 proportion of responders at month -6 or 12 in the two cohorts' were compared by the&#xD;
      chi-squared test. The normal distribution of data was confirmed using the one-sample&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. A value of p&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using the STATA (version 13 StataCorp, College Station,&#xD;
      TX, U.S.A.).&#xD;
