      Study Objective: The main objective of the study is to assess the feasibility, effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of outpatient hysteroscopies performed in our Office Hysteroscopy Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data from the Office&#xD;
      Hysteroscopy Unit database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Tertiary care university hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Three thousand patients who consecutively attended an ambulatory hysteroscopy in&#xD;
      our centre from may 2008 to october 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The Office hysteroscopy was performed with several rigid 5-6 mm diameter&#xD;
      devices when indicated with a diagnostic and/or therapeutic purpose&#xD;

      Retrospective observational study of our prospectively collected database of 3000 consecutive&#xD;
      hysteroscopies performed from may 2008 to october 2019 in our Office Hysteroscopy Unit (OHU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients who attended an ambulatory hysteroscopy in our centre during the study&#xD;
      period were included. There were not any exclusion criteria and all data were prospectively&#xD;
      collected in a computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was to determine the main results of the Outpatient Hysteroscopy Unit in&#xD;
      terms of feasibility, effectiveness and safety. Feasibility was defined as the proportion of&#xD;
      explorations that could be satisfactorily performed. Effectiveness was evaluated through the&#xD;
      percentage of cases that were solved in our outpatient setting and did not require the&#xD;
      operating room to complete their diagnosis or treatment. Safety was assessed as the&#xD;
      percentage of complications registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we registered the intensity of the pain perceived by the patient with a Verbal&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) (from 0 to 10) during the procedure and ten minutes later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the hysteroscopies were performed in our Office Hysteroscopy Unit by three experienced&#xD;
      gynaecologists who performed the hysteroscopy assisted by a nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pain and anxiety management, a painkiller (ibuprofen 600 mg) and an anxiolytic (diazepam&#xD;
      5 mg) were orally dispensed to all patients 30 minutes before the procedure. Cervical&#xD;
      preparation with Misoprostol (400 mcg, intravaginal administration 4-6 hours before the test)&#xD;
      was administered only in cases of anticipated or previous failed cervical passage.&#xD;
      Paracervical anaesthesia was administered in selected cases of several pain during the&#xD;
      passage through the cervical canal. Premenopausal women were asked to take desogestrel 75 mg,&#xD;
      at least 30 days prior to the procedure for endometrial preparation and if the patient was&#xD;
      unwilling to take the medication, the procedure was preferably performed in the early&#xD;
      follicular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysteroscopy was performed with the several diagnostic and therapeutic rigid devices&#xD;
      available in our Office Hysteroscopy Unit in 5-6 mm diameter: mechanical instruments&#xD;
      (scissors and forceps), bipolar electrode (Versapoint ®), bipolar Gubini resector (Colibrí®)&#xD;
      and mechanical morcelators (Myosure® and Truclear®), They have been set up gradually in our&#xD;
      Unit. Saline solution 0.9% was used as a distention media with an automated pressure delivery&#xD;
      system and he vaginoscopic approach was performed.&#xD;
