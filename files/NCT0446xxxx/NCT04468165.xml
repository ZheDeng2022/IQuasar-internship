  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint of the study is ARR (Annualized Relapse Rate) at 12 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapses will be identified and recorded by Site investigators. A relapse is defined as any new or historical neurological symptom, not associated with fever or infection, lasting for at least 24 h and accompanied by new neurological signs. New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that occurred &lt;30 days after the onset of a relapse as defined earlier were considered part of the same relapse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with disability progression as measured by the EDSS over time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months from Initiation of Hikma DMF</time_frame>
    <description>Disability worsening is defined as 1.5-point increase (if baseline EDSS score was 0), 1.0-point increase (if baseline EDSS score was &lt; 5.5) or 0.5- point increase (if baseline EDSS score was ≥ 5.5) confirmed at least 6 months apart</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 Items (MSIS-29) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months from Initiation of Hikma DMF</time_frame>
    <description>The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items.</description>
