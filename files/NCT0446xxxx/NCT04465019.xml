      Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of disability in the&#xD;
      United States. The EKSO GT Bionics® (EKSO®) is a robotic exoskeleton approved by the Federal&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for rehabilitation following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA or&#xD;
      stroke) and recently received approval for use in patients with TBI. The aim of the study was&#xD;
      to examine if the use of exoskeleton rehabilitation in patients with TBI will produce&#xD;
      beneficial outcomes. Methods: This retrospective chart-review reports the use of the (EKSO®)&#xD;
      robotic device in the rehabilitation of patients with TBI compared to patients with CVA. The&#xD;
      investigators utilized data from a single, private rehabilitation hospital for patients that&#xD;
      received post-CVA or post-TBI robotic exoskeleton intervention. All patients that used the&#xD;
      exoskeleton were discharged from the hospital between 01/01/2017 to 04/30/2020. Ninety-four&#xD;
      percent (94%) of patients in the CVA groups and 100% of patients in the TBI group were of&#xD;
      Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Gains in total Functional Independence Measure (FIM), walking&#xD;
      and cognition, and length of stay in the rehabilitation facility were measured. Results:&#xD;
      Patients in the TBI group (n=11) were significantly younger than the patients in the CVA&#xD;
      group (n=66; p&lt; 0.05). Both groups spent a similar amount of time active, number of steps&#xD;
      taken, and the number of sessions in the exoskeleton. Both groups also started with similar&#xD;
      admission FIM scores. The FIM gain in the TBI group was similar to that of the CVA group&#xD;
      (37.5 and 32.0 respectively). The length of stay between groups was not different either.&#xD;
      Conclusions: The use of exoskeleton rehabilitation in patients with TBI appear to produce&#xD;
      similar outcomes as for patients with CVA, prompting further attention of this intervention&#xD;
      for this type of injury.&#xD;

      Study Design and Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, retrospective, chart review cohort study of patients from a private&#xD;
      single rehabilitation hospital. Study approval was granted by the local Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and the US Federal Policy for the&#xD;
      Protection of Human Subjects. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, a full waiver of&#xD;
      authorization under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996) was&#xD;
      submitted by the study team and approved by the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion criteria: Subjects in the TBI group included patients who suffered a&#xD;
      TBI and who used the EKSO® bionic exoskeleton during their rehabilitation treatment from&#xD;
      01/01/2017 to 04/30/2020. Subjects in the CVA group included all patients in the hospital&#xD;
      that used the EKSO® during their rehabilitation process during the same period of the&#xD;
      patients in the TBI group. Patients were excluded if their injury type was outside the scope&#xD;
      of the current study. The registered nurse at the rehabilitation facility identified the&#xD;
      patients based on the inclusion criteria, and this was verified by the doctor in physical&#xD;
      therapy who oversees the rehabilitation hospital patient population. Approval and&#xD;
      implementation of the EKSO® bionic device at the hospital commenced in 2014 for patients that&#xD;
      suffered a CVA and spinal cord injury. Main indications for the use of the EKSO® during&#xD;
      rehabilitation included a height range between 1.56 to 1.9 meters and a patient's weight&#xD;
      equal to or less than 100kg. Stable blood pressure was required, with the ability to follow&#xD;
      one to two steps commands, and the patient should also have demonstrated a normal range of&#xD;
      motion in hips, knees, and ankles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic factors considered in this study were age at the time of admission into the&#xD;
      rehabilitation facility (measured in years), and patient's sex (males or females). Ethnicity&#xD;
      was self-reported and collected in the study, but it was not considered as a covariate since&#xD;
      the vast majority of our cohort was of Hispanic origin. The overrepresentation of&#xD;
      Hispanics/Latinos in the current cohort responds to the demographic distribution of the area&#xD;
      the hospital serves. The investigators collected information related to the impairment type&#xD;
      produced by the CVA, and for the TBI; investigators collected the abbreviated injury scale&#xD;
      (ASI) to determine the injury severity score (ISS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in FIM score from admission to discharge was used as the primary outcome for this&#xD;
      study. The FIM score evaluates the ability of the patient in day-to-day functions within&#xD;
      three (3) major categories: self-care, mobility, and communication. To explore whether the&#xD;
      use of EKSO® facilitates the improvement in mobility and communication, investigators also&#xD;
      explored the motor FIM and social interaction FIM, problem-solving FIM, and memory FIM. In&#xD;
      parallel to FIM, investigators evaluated how the length of stay in the facility affected the&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources/measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables collected in this study were retrospectively obtained from the patient's electronic&#xD;
      medical chart. All information presented in this study was part of the patient's standard of&#xD;
      care. No additional intervention or data collection instrument was implemented. The standard&#xD;
      of care of the patient is as follows: all potentially eligible candidates were identified and&#xD;
      cleared by the physician with subsequent patient education regarding the use of the EKSO®.&#xD;
      For the use of the exoskeleton during the rehabilitation process, signed informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from either the patient or designated family member, depending on the status of the&#xD;
      patient. Data obtained during the active use of the exoskeleton was visualized in the screen&#xD;
      of the EKSO® (time active, steps taken, etc.) and subsequently recorded in each patient's&#xD;
      paper chart. This paper was then scanned and uploaded into the patient's electronic chart&#xD;
      under his/her progress notes. The therapy technicians helped in the data recording process.&#xD;
      All available data related to EKSO use for CVA and TBI at our facility were included in the&#xD;
      current study. The primary goal of the data analysis was to gather preliminary comparative&#xD;
      outcomes that could guide us into designing larger-controlled studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize selection bias in the current study, investigators used all patients that were&#xD;
      clinically determined by the attending physician to meet the criteria for exoskeleton&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Patients were included in the chart review regardless of the number of&#xD;
      sessions of exoskeleton use. All therapist and nurses at our facility have been certified to&#xD;
      use the FIM assessment tool and the data is entered using the Uniform Data System for Medical&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (https://www.udsmr.org/) software integrated within the hospital medical&#xD;
      record platform. The main data extractor in the study (A.M.) is the site expert for data&#xD;
      management within the Uniform Data System. Quality of the data was verified by the lead&#xD;
      doctor in Physical Therapy (M.E.A.). None of the patients that used exoskeleton in&#xD;
      rehabilitation had missing data during the time period used for the current study and all&#xD;
      patients in the cohort completed the recommended therapeutic program and were successfully&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exoskeleton use protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EKSO GT® was operated by a Licensed Physical Therapist who was certified to control the&#xD;
      device. The device is only approved to be used in a clinical setting. For the purposes of&#xD;
      this study, four different modes were utilized to engage and challenge the patients:&#xD;
      Pre-Gait, First Step, Pro Step Plus, and 2 Free. Pre-Gait Mode focused on the following&#xD;
      metrics to facilitate movement and active participation: bilateral weight shifting in&#xD;
      standing with biofeedback, mini squats, and stationary unilateral lower extremity&#xD;
      advancement. The First Step mode allowed the therapist to be in full control of all movement.&#xD;
      The therapist triggered the initiation and execution of each step reciprocally with the push&#xD;
      of a button. In the Pro Step Plus mode, there was an appropriate weight shift either done&#xD;
      independently by the patient or facilitated by the therapeutic handling of the physical&#xD;
      therapist. The patient was given the opportunity to initiate each step; the EKSO® device&#xD;
      completed any incomplete steps. The most advanced mode is called 2 Free. This mode was used&#xD;
      to challenge the patient across the continuum as they progress. The patient was responsible&#xD;
      for initiating and executing each step. The therapist programmed resistance unilaterally or&#xD;
      bilaterally to the lower extremities to increase the demand for the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for the entire study population were generated. Normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables were described with means and standard deviations, medians and ranges&#xD;
      were used for non-normally distributed variables, and frequencies and column percentages&#xD;
      summarized categorical variables. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups were evaluated using Student t-test for independent samples&#xD;
      for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally&#xD;
      distributed continuous variables, and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. To test&#xD;
      for the difference between the CVA and TBI groups in respect to socio-demographic and&#xD;
      treatment measurements, paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables&#xD;
      and Chi-square test/Fisher exact test for categorical variables were used. Shapiro-Wilk test&#xD;
      for normality was conducted to determine the normality of the continuous variables'&#xD;
      distributions. Linear regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the associations of&#xD;
      each of the outcome variables with age, sex, and length of hospital stay, and with the injury&#xD;
      groups (CVA and TBI) variable. All statistical tests were two-sided and were performed at a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS&#xD;
      Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA.).&#xD;
