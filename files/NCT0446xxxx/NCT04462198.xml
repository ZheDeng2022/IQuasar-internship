  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized-controlled, double-blind study of PIPE-505 or placebo given as an&#xD;
      injection one time in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss associated with&#xD;
      speech-in-noise difficulty. Visits to the clinic will occur at baseline, dosing, and days 1,&#xD;
      7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 after treatment. Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs, ear examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood laboratory analyses and&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events (AE). Efficacy will be assessed by periodic audiometry and other&#xD;
      audiological tests.&#xD;

          -  Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, at randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal tympanogram in the ear intended for injection (as defined in protocol) at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects with reproductive potential agree to comply with&#xD;
             protocol-approved double barrier contraceptive method during and for 3 months after&#xD;
             study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is in general good medical health with no clinically significant or&#xD;
             relevant abnormalities, including medical history, physical exam, vital signs, ECG,&#xD;
             and laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of an investigational product or intervention other than a non-interventional&#xD;
             registry study (including vaccine studies) within the greater of 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (if known) prior to Screening or expected during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy under current active treatment or considered at substantial risk&#xD;
             for progression or recurrence during the study interval, as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator. Note, central nervous system neoplasms or head and neck cancer are&#xD;
