  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised, open-label phase I study of an investigational medicinal product&#xD;
      (IMP) consisting of a HLA-A*02:01 restricted HA-1H T cell receptor transduced T cell&#xD;
      (MDG1021) immunotherapy for relapsed or persistent hematologic malignancies after allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The aim of the study is to determine the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose of MDG1021.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of a HLA-A*02:01 restricted,&#xD;
      HA-1H T cell receptor (TCR) transduced patient-derived T cell (MDG1021) immunotherapy, with&#xD;
      secondary endpoints including preliminary efficacy, in patients with relapsed or persistent&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the&#xD;
      dose-escalation part of the study, at least 9 patients will be treated with MDG1021 at 3&#xD;
      different doses to assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose using a standard 3+3&#xD;
      cohort design. Thereafter, the selected optimal MDG1021 dose will be assessed for safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in 20 additional patients during the dose-expansion part of the study.&#xD;
      Manufacturing feasibility will be determined. MDG1021 will be administered by single&#xD;
      intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA-1H is exclusively expressed on cells of the hematopoietic system. If the patient's&#xD;
      blood-cells, and thus lymphoma or leukemic cells, carry the immunogenic version of the HA-1H&#xD;
      antigen on their surface and the donor stem cells do not, MDG1021 immunotherapy could&#xD;
      eradicate the patient's cancer cells and allow the donor stem cells to repopulate the&#xD;
      patient's blood forming system.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The aim of the study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MDG1021 that will be determined on the basis of safety and ability to manufacture a cohort specific MDG1021 dose. The dose-escalation part of the study is designed to assess the safety and the MTD of MDG1021, using a standard 3+3 cohort design, with up to 3 additional subjects to be enrolled in case of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
Upon completion of the dose-escalation part of the study, 20 eligible patients will be treated in the expansion part of the study with MDG1021 at the RP2D to further evaluate safety, feasibility and preliminary efficacy.</intervention_model_description>
