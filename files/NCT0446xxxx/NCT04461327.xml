    <textblock>
      Joiner's interpersonal theory of suicide postulates that the wish of death comes from&#xD;
      feelings of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. But, only people who have&#xD;
      acquired the capability to kill themselves will attempt suicide. The acquired capability&#xD;
      refers to a reduction of fear to death, and a higher pain tolerance. Indeed, to commit&#xD;
      suicide involves to endure pain during the act. Thus, higher pain tolerance seems to be a&#xD;
      necessary feature for suicidal act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past studies have shown higher pain threshold and tolerance in suicidal patients, whatever&#xD;
      the stimulus was (electric, thermic or mechanical), compared to patients without suicide&#xD;
      history. Moreover, Caceda and colleagues demonstrated higher pain threshold in recent suicide&#xD;
      attempters (suicidal act within 72h) compared with depressed patients. Five days after the&#xD;
      initial evaluation, pain threshold of recent suicide attempters decreased to be similar to&#xD;
      depressed patients with suicidal ideation. Therefore, it may exist a specific state during&#xD;
      which the pain tolerance is increased. During this &quot;hypoalgesic state&quot; patients with suicidal&#xD;
      ideation could attempt suicide to get relief from suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, little is known about the specific mechanisms that are responsible for the higher&#xD;
      pain threshold and tolerance in suicide attempters. Pain is a dynamic system that results&#xD;
      from excitatory and inhibitory messages. The modification of one of these mechanisms could&#xD;
      explain the higher tolerance in recent suicide attempters. Three of them are of particular&#xD;
      interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is a modulatory pain mechanism. CPM works through&#xD;
           descending pathway that reaches the spinal cord and modulates pain processing from the&#xD;
           first nociceptive synapse.In recent suicidal patients, an increase of the CPM could&#xD;
           explain higher pain tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The &quot;wind-up&quot; mechanism is defined as the highest excitability of the second order&#xD;
           nerve. Even if the stimulus remains stable, pain continuously raises. In recent suicide&#xD;
           attempters, a reduction of this mechanism could explain higher pain tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The threshold of Aδ and C nociceptors. If a nociceptive fiber is less excitable than the&#xD;
           other, it would explain higher pain threshold.&#xD;

      Aim: The first objective of this project is to test different pain mechanisms that could be&#xD;
      involved in the increase of pain thresholds and tolerance in suicidal patients. The second&#xD;
      objective is to test whether there's a loss of pleasantness during social touch in suicidal&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to compare the efficacity of CPM between three groups of depressed patients:&#xD;
      recent or former suicide attempters and non-attempters. The secondary aims are 1) to compare&#xD;
      the wind-up mechanism between groups, 2) to compare the difference of excitability of Aδ and&#xD;
      C fibers between groups, 3) to correlate these physiological results to clinical variables&#xD;
      (emotional reactivity and emotional regulation, dissociation and body perception), and 4) to&#xD;
      compare the pleasantness associated with social touch between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: 153 depressed women will be enrolled and divided into three groups. I)&#xD;
      Women having recently attempted suicide (less than 72 hours) - II) women having a past&#xD;
      suicide attempt (more than 72 hours) - III) Women without lifetime history of suicidal&#xD;
      behaviour (affective control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials: The heat test stimuli are performed by a thermode (TCS II, QST Lab) which produces&#xD;
      ramping heat pulses from 32°C to 52°C. For the conditioning stimulus (cold pressor task),&#xD;
      participants will insert their arm (up to the elbow) in circulating cold water (8°C). Pain&#xD;
      intensity is rated by a CoVAS (computer visual analog scale). This scale is similar to a&#xD;
      classic visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; to the &quot;most intense pain&#xD;
      tolerable&quot;. The participant has just to move a cursor, thanks to the computer mouse. The&#xD;
      stroking is performed thanks to a Natural hair Blush Brush (No. 7, The Boots Company).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment: A clinical assessment will be made by a trained researcher. This&#xD;
      assessment will evaluate psychiatric diagnosis by the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders), the severity of depression by the IDS-C30 (Inventory of&#xD;
      Depressive Symptomatology), the intensity of suicidal thoughts by the CSSRS (Columbia Suicide&#xD;
      Severity Rating Scale), and the suicidal life history by the RRRS (Risk-Rescue Rating Scale)&#xD;
      and SIS (Suicidal Intent Scales). It will also gather information about socio-demographic&#xD;
      variables, the number of depressed episodes, the number of psychiatric hospitalizations, the&#xD;
      hormonal status, and the current medications. All psychotropics medications taken by the&#xD;
      patient will be collected for the last 72 hours, as well as the dose and the date of the&#xD;
      beginning of the treatment. The patients will also have to complete some self-report measures&#xD;
      about the severity of their depression (BDI-II), their level of anxiety (STAI), their&#xD;
      physical and psychological pain (EVA current and past), their childhood trauma (CTQ), their&#xD;
      emotional state (PANAS), their difficulty in emotional regulation (DERS), their emotional&#xD;
      reactivity (ERS), their body perception (BIS), their dissociative experiences, their&#xD;
      borderline symptomatology (BSL-23) and the kind of non-suicidal self-injuries practiced&#xD;
      (SHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests: The blood test is made between 2 and 24 hours before the experimental procedure.&#xD;
      The biological collection is made to measure medications' concentration if the patient takes&#xD;
      antiepileptics and/or lithium, and to measure complete blood count (CBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: All three pain mechanisms and social touch will be tested in one session&#xD;
      lasting 1h approximately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To distinguish the threshold of Aδ and C, a thermal stimulus will be used to provoke&#xD;
           painful and non-painful sensations (Thermode QST lab). Successive and alternate phases&#xD;
           of painful (hot) and non-painful (warm) stimulations will be used. The warm phase will&#xD;
           remain stable at 38°C for 5 seconds whereas the hot phase will consist of ascending heat&#xD;
           pulses from 39°C to 52°C for 1 second each. At every phase, the participant will be&#xD;
           asked if she feels pain or not to determine the pain threshold. The Aδ fiber threshold&#xD;
           will be the first time when the participant will report pain during the hot phase. The C&#xD;
           fiber threshold will be the first time when the participant will report pain during the&#xD;
           warm phase. These measures will be repeated five times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wind-up and CPM will be evaluated successively in three steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To measure the activity of the wind-up, a constant temperature (individually&#xD;
                determined) will be applied during 2 minutes on the left forearm (stimulus test).&#xD;
                This temperature will correspond to a painful sensation of 40/100 on the CoVAS for&#xD;
                each patient previously evaluated. During the test, the participant will report the&#xD;
                intensity of pain on the CoVAS in a continuous manner. The patient will move the&#xD;
                cursor along the continuous line to indicate the pain she feels and every change.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The CPM activation will be produced by a counter nociceptive stimulation (cold&#xD;
                pressor task). The right forearm of the participant will be placed during 2 minutes&#xD;
                in a cold water maintained at 8°C (conditioning stimulus).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To measure the efficiency of the CPM, the hot constant temperature (corresponding&#xD;
                to CoVAS= 40/100) will be re-applied, during 2 minutes on the left forearm&#xD;
                (conditioned stimulus). As previously, participant will report her pain on the&#xD;
                CoVAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the painful tests, the participant will have to complete two self-report&#xD;
      measures. The PANAS to evaluate their emotional state and the STAI state to evaluate their&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a final step, the pleasure associated with social touch will be tested. The experimenter&#xD;
      stroked the participant's marked skin areas for 70 seconds with a soft brush in either&#xD;
      CT-optimal speed (3 cm/s; slow touch group associated with pleasantness) or non-CT-optimal&#xD;
      speed (18 cm/s; fast touch group associated with a neutral feeling). The pleasure associated&#xD;
      with the stroke is then assessed on a 10-point Likert scale (from really unpleasant to really&#xD;
      pleasant). In this within design, the reaped measures (slow touch vs fast touch) will be&#xD;
      counterbalanced between participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pairing: A pairing will be made on age and antidepressant class (none, selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), tricyclic,&#xD;
      others). For each category of antidepressant, a 1 will be attributed if the patient takes one&#xD;
      medication of this category and a 0 if not. In each group, the sum of every classes of&#xD;
      medication will have to be equal. As a reminder, class of antidepressant are exclusive&#xD;
      between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical load: To control medication, a medication load index will be calculated as described&#xD;
      in Olié and al., 2018. Antiepileptics and lithium medications will be dosed in plasma.&#xD;
