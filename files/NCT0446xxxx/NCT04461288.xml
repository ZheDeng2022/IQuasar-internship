  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of Pride Posts Plus, a social&#xD;
      media-based smoking cessation treatment. A pilot randomized trial (N=120) will compare Pride&#xD;
      Posts Plus, which includes a gamification element, to Pride Posts (without gamification) and&#xD;
      to a usual care treatment. Participants will be adults who smoke, identify as sexual or&#xD;
      gender minorities, and use Facebook. The primary outcome will be biochemically verified 7-day&#xD;
      abstinence from smoking at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be treatment engagement, a&#xD;
      quit attempt (y/n), and thoughts about tobacco abstinence at 3 and 6 mos.&#xD;

      Participants (N=136) will be randomized to one of three conditions: (1) Pride Posts, a&#xD;
      Facebook-delivered smoking cessation intervention (including daily posts, and weekly live&#xD;
      group sessions, tailored to sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults; (2) Pride Posts Plus,&#xD;
      the Facebook-delivered smoking cessation intervention plus a gamification element, or (2) a&#xD;
      usual care condition which includes referral to smokefree.gov, a federally-developed&#xD;
      web-based intervention which includes similar digital treatment elements. All participants&#xD;
      will have access to up to six months of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Assessments will include&#xD;
      measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences. All&#xD;
      participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to provide biochemical&#xD;
      verification of smoking status using a portable carbon monoxide measurement tool. All&#xD;
      intervention and assessment procedures will be conducted digitally.&#xD;
