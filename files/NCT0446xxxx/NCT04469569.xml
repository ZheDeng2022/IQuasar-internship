  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this research is on increasing the uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      vaccine in young cancer survivors, a vulnerable population at high risk for developing new&#xD;
      cancers (such as cervical and anal cancer) caused by persistent HPV infection. An effective&#xD;
      vaccine exists that can prevent these cancers, but HPV vaccine uptake is low among young&#xD;
      cancer survivors. This research will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention, adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology&#xD;
      clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors 9-17 years of&#xD;
      age. Results of this research will provide important information that can be used to&#xD;
      implement new strategies to increase the uptake of the HPV vaccine among young cancer&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new cancers (such as cervical and&#xD;
      anal cancer) caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Compared&#xD;
      with the age- and sex-matched general population, female and male cancer survivors have a&#xD;
      1.4- to 2.5-fold excess risk, respectively, of developing HPV-related malignancies.&#xD;
      Fortunately, HPV-related malignancies are largely preventable due to availability of the&#xD;
      nonavalent HPV vaccine, which offers protection against ~90% of oncogenic HPV subtypes. We&#xD;
      have previously shown that uptake of the HPV vaccine is significantly lower in cancer&#xD;
      survivors compared with general population peers (22.0% vs 42.5% in those age 13-17yrs), and&#xD;
      that lack of healthcare provider recommendation is the strongest predictor of HPV vaccine&#xD;
      non-initiation in cancer survivors. Strategies that are most successful in increasing HPV&#xD;
      vaccine uptake in the general population focus on improving healthcare provider knowledge&#xD;
      about the HPV vaccine, enhancing the skills that healthcare providers need to effectively&#xD;
      recommend the vaccine to young people and their parents, and reducing barriers to receiving&#xD;
      the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention (HPV-PROTECT), adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology&#xD;
      clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors (9 to 17 years of&#xD;
      age and at least one year following completion of cancer therapy). The HPV-PROTECT&#xD;
      intervention has three components: i) Provider Communication Training; ii) Assessment and&#xD;
      Peer Feedback/Coaching; and iii) Provider Toolkit, and is designed to increase provider&#xD;
      knowledge regarding use of the HPV vaccine in the cancer survivor population, enhance&#xD;
      provider skills in delivering brief, compelling HPV vaccine recommendations to parents of&#xD;
      young cancer survivors, present ongoing feedback to providers regarding clinic- and&#xD;
      provider-level survivor HPV vaccination rates, and decrease barriers to receipt of vaccine by&#xD;
      survivors through the provision of Vaccine Action Plans. If the intervention is effective in&#xD;
      improving and sustaining increased uptake of the HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors, this&#xD;
      study will contribute important information needed to move forward with testing the&#xD;
      widespread use of the intervention in pediatric oncology practices.&#xD;
