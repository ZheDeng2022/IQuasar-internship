  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaerobic power and capacity are essential in many human activities, especially during sports&#xD;
      practice that demand a high strength and power of the limbs. Transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation is a noninvasive technique that can modulate motor brain areas involved in motor&#xD;
      functions and has the potential to optimize muscle capacity. However, their effects on&#xD;
      mechanical power are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      on mechanical power in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design&#xD;
      will be used. The 50 participants will be randomized into two groups: (1) Anodal tDCS(real)&#xD;
      and (2) Sham tDCS. A single session of anodal and sham tDCS will be performed on each task&#xD;
      (pre and post-jump test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evaluations will be performed by a single researcher who, like the participants, will not&#xD;
      know which stimulation group will be participating. Subjects who agree to the conditions and&#xD;
      sign the consent form may participate in the study. Participants who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be included in the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre and Post-test (immediately after tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue index will be evaluated by assessing the ground reaction forces (GRF) and the number of jumps in each test by means of the kinetic analysis of the 60-second vertical jump test (Bosco's Test).&#xD;
The fatigue index corresponds to the power reduction rate expressed as a percentage and reveals the degree of reduction in the ability to produce strength and maintain exercise.</description>

    <measure>Rating of perceived exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-test (immediately after tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective feeling of effort will be assessed by the Borg scale for perceived effort. This is a 15-point numerical scale that ranges from 6 to 20, where 6 means &quot;no exertion at all&quot; and 20 means &quot;maximal exertion.&quot;</description>
