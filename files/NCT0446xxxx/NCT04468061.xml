  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves testing the safety and efficacy of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has spread, or&#xD;
      metastasized, to other parts the body and is PD-L1-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy™;IMMU-132)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®; MK-3475)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or a combination of investigational drugs to&#xD;
      learn whether the drug or drug combination works in treating a specific disease.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug or drug combination is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sacituzumab Govitecan for metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for patients who have had 2&#xD;
      or more prior regimens for metastatic disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      has not approved Pembrolizumab for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer but it has been&#xD;
      approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, we are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studying Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab as a possible&#xD;
           treatment for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that are&#xD;
           PD-L1-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab Govitecan is composed of a chemotherapy drug, called Irinotecan, which is&#xD;
           attached to an antibody. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the immune system that&#xD;
           bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm. The antibody in this&#xD;
           study binds to certain types of cancer tumors, including triple-negative breast tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, called an anti-PD-1 or a checkpoint inhibitor, and is&#xD;
           an antibody (a type of human protein) designed to allow the body's own immune system to&#xD;
           seek out and destroy tumors. It has been used in previous research studies to treat&#xD;
           breast cancer, where it has been shown to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of either Sacituzumab&#xD;
           Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab, in delaying the worsening of&#xD;
           triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, research blood collections,&#xD;
      at least two research biopsies, paired research stool collections, questionnaires, data&#xD;
      collection, and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Sacituzumab Govitecan on days 1 and 8 and Pembrolizumab on day 1 of a 21-day&#xD;
           cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Sacituzumab Govitecan alone on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they are benefitting from this&#xD;
      therapy. Participants will be followed for the rest of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 110 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

             compliance with study requirements in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent) or any other form of immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medication (including disease modifying agents) and has required such therapy in the&#xD;
             last 2 years. Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is&#xD;
             not considered a form of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that currently&#xD;
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers that have been diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years are eligible:&#xD;
             cervical/prostate carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, non-melanoma cancer&#xD;
             of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed within the past 3 years and felt to&#xD;
             be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study principal investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B&#xD;
             (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus (defined as detected HCV RNA [qualitative]) infection. HIV-positive participants&#xD;
             are ineligible due to the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions of combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy with study drugs and the increased risk of fatal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Note: No testing for HIV, Hepatitis B,&#xD;
