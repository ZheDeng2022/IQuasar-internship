  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop an optimized intervention for reducing leisure sedentary&#xD;
      screen time (SST) in middle-aged adults with overweight or obesity. Investigators will use&#xD;
      the multiphase optimization (MOST) framework to conduct a highly efficient full-factorial&#xD;
      experimental study to simultaneously test the main effects for each of three intervention&#xD;
      components (LOCKOUT, TEXT, EARN) and their interactions (e.g., TEXT+EARN; LOCKOUT+EARN+TEXT)&#xD;
      over 16 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Aim: To identify which component(s) from three components under consideration for&#xD;
      inclusion in StandUPTV reduce SST by &gt;60 min per day per day at 16 weeks. The three&#xD;
      components tested will be: (a) LOCKOUT (no vs. yes); (b) TEXT (no vs. yes); and (c) EARN (no&#xD;
      vs. yes). The investigators will use a highly efficient experimental strategy to detect&#xD;
      effects of individual components as well as all two- and three-way interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this study is to examine how reductions in SST displace time into other&#xD;
      active behaviors, i.e., light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-to vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity (MVPA) and activity type (e.g., housework, walking, exercise behaviors).&#xD;
      The investigators will use both device-based (activPAL3c) and self-report (ACT24) measures to&#xD;
      understand whether SST displacement can increase active behaviors, particularly MVPA.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive a &quot;core&quot; intervention which will include a basic version of the StandUPTV app and a Fitbit watch to use throughout the 16-week intervention.The Fitbit will provide device-based behavioral feedback through the StandUPTV self-monitoring component. SST feedback will be Self-monitoring will provide passive and objective feedback regarding SST behaviors and MVPA drawn from Fitbit and SCREENTIME sources. StandUPTV will also contain basic education including information on the risks of SST and tips for reducing SST. As part of this education, all participants will be provided a behavioral target of reducing their SST by 50% from their baseline. This target will be customized for the participant within StandUPTV based on a baseline week of observation.</description>

They will earn SST on a 3:1 ratio up until they reach their baseline level of MVPA (5 mins of exercise earns 15 mins of SST). They will receive behavioral strategies to reduce screen time within the app (e.g., self-efficacy, barriers, exercising safely) and a planning tool for scheduling MVPA.</description>
