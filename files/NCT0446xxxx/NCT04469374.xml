      Aim: to examine the effect of an exercise intervention for preventing osteoporosis among&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine whether mean values for Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA) using Quantitative&#xD;
      Ultrasound (QUS) among postmenopausal women following an eight-month exercise intervention&#xD;
      (and at 3-month follow up), will be significantly higher than those obtained&#xD;
      pre-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine whether mean BUA values among postmenopausal women following an eight-month&#xD;
      exercise intervention (and at 3-month follow up) will be significantly higher than mean&#xD;
      values obtained from participants in a control group undertaking sham exercises for an&#xD;
      equivalent duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the feasibility of the eight-month exercise intervention for a potential larger&#xD;
      study (larger sample size, increased number of trial arms and increased outcome measures), in&#xD;
      terms of recruitment, adherence, perceptions, barriers, and acceptability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected at baseline, on study completion and at 3-month follow-up. Sequel to&#xD;
      baseline data collection and ascertainment of eligibility, participants will be randomised&#xD;
      into either the exercise intervention group or sham-control group. Randomisation will be&#xD;
      through computer-generation of random numbers. Participants will be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation. Both groups will complete their required programme for eight months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, participants will be required to perform 10 maximal vertical&#xD;
      jumps, with a 10-s rest interval between each jump, using an arm swing in countermovement&#xD;
      style on three days per week. The jumps will be performed without shoes on a hard surface.&#xD;
      The jumps will be preceded by a warm-up lasting approximately 3 min and consisting of&#xD;
      mobilisation exercises for the legs and lower back. Jumping will be progressed over time and&#xD;
      in accordance with individual needs. Initially, jumping may be undertaken with the use of a&#xD;
      handheld support (such as the back of a chair or table), should participants feel unstable.&#xD;
      Jumps will be progressed to include multi-directional movements (jumping to the side,&#xD;
      forwards, backwards, and diagonally). Natural progression will also occur as participants&#xD;
      should improve their jump height with increased muscular explosiveness. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out a simple, daily training log, stipulating when they have undertaken the&#xD;
      exercise, in order for adherence to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, participants will be required to perform balance exercises. The&#xD;
      balancing exercises will be progressed and varied (to ensure adherence). Initially, the use&#xD;
      of a handheld support (such as the back of the chair) can be used. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to balance on one leg for up to 60 seconds (2 x 60 s is equivalent in duration to&#xD;
      the 10 jumps). This exercise will initially be progressed using time, and then by doing the&#xD;
      following: confounding the visual fixation (e.g., head turns), changing the centre of mass&#xD;
      (e.g. arm/leg lifts); performing the stork balance (hands on hips, knee bent and supported by&#xD;
      standing leg); reaching in multiple directions before regaining the initial stance; closing&#xD;
      the eyes; reducing the base of support; and a combination of these activities. The starting&#xD;
      level of difficulty will be prescribed by the researcher, according to each participant's&#xD;
      functional ability. The balance exercises will be preceded by a warm-up lasting approximately&#xD;
      3 min and consisting of mobilisation exercises for the legs and lower back. The purpose of&#xD;
      the sham exercise is to foster the perception of full participation in the study, in order to&#xD;
      decrease attrition rates, and to blind participants to the intervention. The balance&#xD;
      exercises, although not improving bone health, could decrease the risk of fracture, making&#xD;
      the sham control group more ethical, owing to potential improvements, and limited risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure quality control, digitised video clips of all exercises will be provided for the&#xD;
      participants, who will be encouraged to perform the exercises as demonstrated on the video.&#xD;
      The participants will be invited to one fully supervised group exercise session per month.&#xD;
      These sessions will be used to monitor exercise quality, and to ensure progression is&#xD;
      appropriate for each participant. Sessions will last 15-20 min. Attendance at these sessions&#xD;
      will be monitored through registers. Apart from these supervised exercise sessions,&#xD;
      participants will be given free choice to determine where and when they do the exercises. At&#xD;
      the instructor-led session, training logs will be submitted. If they are unable to attend,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to submit training logs electronically, or via post. To encourage&#xD;
      adherence, an App will be used, which will enable weekly announcements to be posted, as well&#xD;
      as emails and/or text reminders. Participants will be free to contact the researchers about&#xD;
      any concerns they have during the intervention. Apart from the exercise undertaken,&#xD;
      participants will be requested to maintain their usual exercise throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve adherence, Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory for changing behaviour will be drawn&#xD;
      upon. Specific constructs will include the knowledge and skills to perform the prescribed&#xD;
      intervention, personal regulation of goal-directed health behaviour (self-control), and&#xD;
      self-confidence in engaging in the exercise despite the absence of supervision.&#xD;
      Reinforcement, i.e., activities that increase the propensity for adherence during the trial&#xD;
      and beyond the study's lifespan, will also be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' level of self-efficacy for engaging in lifestyle change will be assessed using&#xD;
      a five-point Likert scale, from 'not at all confident' to 'very confident'. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to rate how confident they are to commit to engage in the exercise, irrespective of&#xD;
      usual circumstances such as time constraints, stress, and fatigue. Assessment of&#xD;
      self-efficacy will take place at the study onset, and at one-monthly intervals (via&#xD;
      attendance at the supervised group sessions). With non-attendance, assessment will take place&#xD;
      electronically. In the event of a low rating, modes of handling such situations without&#xD;
      compromising commitment to the regime, will be given in relation to each participant's&#xD;
      personal circumstances. In addition, at the study outset, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      identify any circumstances that could motivate them to comply with the exercise, as well as&#xD;
      any perceived barriers to adherence. Any issues will be discussed, and participants will be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to design personalised adherence strategies. The aim will be to foster&#xD;
      self-efficacy in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the eight-month intervention, all females in the trial arm, who have completed the&#xD;
      study, will be invited to take part in a focus group (in groups of 8, depending on numbers&#xD;
      who volunteer for this), to examine participants' perceptions of the intervention. A topic&#xD;
      guide will be used, which includes: An exploration of the perceived barriers to undertaking&#xD;
      the exercise intervention; issues with adherence; acceptability of the intervention; adverse&#xD;
      events; enjoyment; ratings of perceived exertion; how easily the intervention could be&#xD;
      incorporated into lifestyle. At the end of the focus group, the topic guide will be checked&#xD;
      to ensure that all areas had been covered. Focus groups will likely last between 45 and 60&#xD;
      min, although will continue until the researcher feels that data saturation has been reached.&#xD;
      The focus groups will be audio-recorded and subsequently transcribed to facilitate analysis.&#xD;
      Non-verbal participant behaviour will also be recorded.&#xD;

          -  postmenopausal; aged ≥50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers will be excluded from the study if they: are using any medicated that may&#xD;
             affect bone turnover (e.g., corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants,&#xD;
             calcitonin, bisphosphonates, raloxifene, denosumab and/or anabolic agents such as&#xD;
             parathyroid hormone and growth hormone or steroids), including hormone replacement&#xD;
             therapy and hormone-based contraception, within 6 months of starting the study; have&#xD;
             or have had any bone, metabolic, kidney, liver, thyroid, gastro-intestinal or hormonal&#xD;
             disorders or cancer, that may affect bone turnover; have a close family history of&#xD;
             osteoporosis; have sustained a low trauma fragility fracture in the past 6 months; are&#xD;
             a heavy smoking (&gt;20 cigarettes/day); if they are already undertaking bone-specific&#xD;
             jumping exercises or equivalent exercises; if they have an existing knee, hip or back&#xD;
             injury or have any medical condition that would prevent them from completing the&#xD;
             exercise. Additional exclusions at baseline testing will include: a low BUA score,&#xD;
             i.e., estimated T score of &lt;2.5; obesity as determined by body mass index of &gt;35&#xD;
             km/m2, to minimise risk of strain or injury associated with the exercise. Participants&#xD;
             will also not be able to undertake the bone scan if they have any foot swelling, as&#xD;
             this can make results difficult to interpret.&#xD;
