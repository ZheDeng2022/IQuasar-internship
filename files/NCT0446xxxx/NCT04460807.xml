      In this Italian, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase III study&#xD;
      the efficacy of exemestane will be evaluated in addition to the standard front line treatment&#xD;
      in patients with hormone-receptor-positive high grade serous or endometrioid Epithelian&#xD;
      Ovarian Cancer (EOC). The patients enrolled in the EXPERT trial will receive exemestane or&#xD;
      placebo in addition to standard treatment. Patients and investigators will be blinded to&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis underlying the proposed clinical trial is that exemestane added to standard&#xD;
      first line therapy will significantly prolong median progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estrogen and Progesterone play a role in promoting EOC growth, metastasis, and progression.&#xD;
      Recent data show that ER and PgR expression is frequent in high grade EOC and has prognostic&#xD;
      significance. A large meta-analysis showed a clinical benefit with any endocrine treatment,&#xD;
      and in particular for aromatase inhibitors (AIs), with a greatere benefit for ER+ and/or PgR+&#xD;
      patients and platinum sensitive tumors. Moreover, the analysis of a few randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) showed a reduced mortality with endocrine therapy in EOC, suggesting that ER&#xD;
      and PgR have a predictive role and that inhibition of their activation could therefore be a&#xD;
      treatment option for EOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exemestane is a well-tolerated and effective AI in endocrine sensitive breast cancer which&#xD;
      inhibits the production of Estrogens by the adipose tissue in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Italian, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase III study&#xD;
      will be assessed the efficacy of exemestane versus placebo in addition to the standard front&#xD;
      line treatment in patients with high grade serous or endometrioid EOC, IHC positive (≥ 10%)&#xD;
      ER or PgR disease, stage IIB - IV according to the FIGO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to test the superiority of exemestane over placebo in&#xD;
      addition to the standard front line treatment in terms of PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to test whether the percent expression of ER and PgR is predictive of the effect of&#xD;
           exemestane on PFS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to test whether the addition of exemestane to the standard front line treatment can&#xD;
           prolong Overall Survival (OS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate objective response rate Overall Response Rate (ORR) of experimental&#xD;
           treatment compared with the standard one;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to assess whether the effect of exemestane is affected by the proliferative index Ki67;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to evaluate the effect of exemestane on Quality of Life (QoL);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to evaluate the compliance to the study treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to evaluate the safety profile of the experimental treatment compared with the standard&#xD;
           one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: a total of 468 subjects (234 per Arm) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either standard chemotherapy treatment plus exemestane (Experimental arm) or standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus placebo (Control arm). Exemestane/placebo will be self-administered as a&#xD;
      single oral tablet of 25 mg/day until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      physician/patient decision to withdraw, whichever comes first. Radiological disease&#xD;
      assessments and CA125 will be performed at baseline and every 4 months from randomization,&#xD;
      until end of study or disease progression whichever comes first. Safety assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at each cycle during standard chemotherapy treatment, then at each study visit, up&#xD;
      to 30 days after the last Experimental Treatment administration.Quality of Life will be&#xD;
      assessed by a menopause-specific questionnaire, administered to patients at baseline (T0), at&#xD;
      12 months (T1) and at disease progression (T2). For patients who have signed the specific&#xD;
      informed consent, tissues and blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
