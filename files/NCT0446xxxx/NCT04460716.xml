      This research project is an observational cohort study by retrospective chart review of&#xD;
      patients that underwent major noncardiac surgery at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland,&#xD;
      in the years 2011-2015. The PODMAS study aims to identify risk factors for POD in a general&#xD;
      surgical population.&#xD;

      The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) describes delirium&#xD;
      as a &quot;disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift&#xD;
      attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment)&quot;. In addition, a&#xD;
      &quot;disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial&#xD;
      ability, or perception)&quot; occurs. The deficits cannot be explained by other neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium develops within hours to a few days and can fluctuate in severity during the day.&#xD;
      Acute delirium lasts a few hours or days, whereas persistent delirium lasts for weeks or&#xD;
      months. In a hospital setting, delirium hardly ever lasts longer than a week but some&#xD;
      symptoms can persist for months after the patient was discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health&#xD;
      Problems, 10th rev. (ICD-10), delirium is a pathologic brain disorder, which consists of a&#xD;
      disturbance in consciousness, attention, perception, memory, psychomotor functions, emotional&#xD;
      stability, and circadian rhythm. The severity can range from mild to very severe POD occurs&#xD;
      in connection with a surgical procedure within the first four days after an intervention.&#xD;
      10-70% of all surgical patients above the age of 65 years are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is not only a burden to the patient and their family by increasing functional and&#xD;
      cognitive damages, and increasing mortality, it has a high impact on the economy, as well. A&#xD;
      patient with delirium has a longer length of hospital stay, more complications, and often&#xD;
      requires long-term care after being discharged from the hospital. All these aspects show the&#xD;
      need for prevention of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various preoperative risk factors that influence the development of POD. Advanced&#xD;
      age, preexisting cognitive impairment, depression and other psychopathologic symptoms, intake&#xD;
      of psychotropic substances, sensory impairment like decrease in visual or auditory&#xD;
      perception, impairment in daily life activities, dehydration, malnutrition, metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunctions, urinary catheters, severe diseases and different comorbidities such as chronic&#xD;
      cardiac insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, or previous history of stroke or infections favor&#xD;
      the development of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of POD after major noncardiac surgery and the burden to patients and healthcare&#xD;
      systems in general is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project is an observational cohort study by retrospective chart review of&#xD;
      patients that underwent major noncardiac surgery at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland,&#xD;
      in the years 2011-2015. The PODMAS study aims to identify risk factors for POD in a general&#xD;
      surgical population.&#xD;
