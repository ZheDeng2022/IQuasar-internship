  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of gliomas in imaging represents a real challenge today, at the initial&#xD;
      diagnosis, for therapeutic planning or follow-up treatment of these lesions. There is an&#xD;
      urgent need for non-invasive imaging tools to evaluate a glioma throughout its management. At&#xD;
      present, the diagnosis of certainty is only obtained through an anatomo-pathological analysis&#xD;
      with sampling during an invasive procedure (surgery or biopsy). Magnetic resonance imaging,&#xD;
      through perfusion, diffusion imaging or spectroscopy is developing in gliomas. However, it&#xD;
      remains time-consuming and is not always available. At the same time, positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) with amino acids is an interesting alternative for these brain tumours.&#xD;
      Amino acid PET has the advantage of being more specific than the abnormalities detected in&#xD;
      MRI and the amino acid radiotracers cross the blood-brain barrier, even if not broken, unlike&#xD;
      Gadolinium in MRI. Among these radiotracers, 18F-FDOPA can, among other things, assist in the&#xD;
      non-invasive staging of gliomas at initial diagnosis.&#xD;
