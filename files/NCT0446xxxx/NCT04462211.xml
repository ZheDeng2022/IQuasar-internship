  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal abnormalities are present in more than 80% of critical patients, and their&#xD;
      management has taken an important importance in intensive care unit (ICU), since it can&#xD;
      largely determine the clinical outcome, costs and long-term prognosis in This group of&#xD;
      patients. Only the constipation in the critical patient has been related to the failure of&#xD;
      weaning of the mechanical ventilator, an increase in mechanical ventilation time, and with&#xD;
      the increase of the stay in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, most critical health conditions cause a decrease in the motility of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract that intrinsically can contribute to constipation. This is explained&#xD;
      by the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased activity of the sympathetic system,&#xD;
      the use of vasopressors, high and prolonged doses of opiates, among others, which can reduce&#xD;
      gastric emptying and delay motility. These gastrointestinal abnormalities may be associated&#xD;
      with an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, reduced nutritional intake, bacterial&#xD;
      hyperproliferation in the digestive tract, intestinal mucosal injury and bacterial&#xD;
      translocation through the injured and / or inflamed mucosa. In addition, patients who&#xD;
      experience constipation often have gastroparesis and paresis of the ileum, conditions that&#xD;
      hinder the progression of nutritional support enterally and worsen the patient's clinical&#xD;
      picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of being quite common in the ICU, the impact is not known in depth, which implies&#xD;
      that these alterations are usually not prevented and on the other hand when treating their&#xD;
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological management is highly variable because, for a On the&#xD;
      other hand, staff turnover (intensivist physician) and on the other hand because there are no&#xD;
      protocols that reduce these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide comprehensive care in critical patient units, according to the best available&#xD;
      evidence in order to reduce the variation in daily care, clinical guidelines and protocols&#xD;
      are applied to manage the various specific problems that affect this group. of patients One&#xD;
      way to address the complexity of these problems is through the implementation of care&#xD;
      packages, which have taken relevance in the prevention of characteristic events of high&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. It is in this scenario, where the clinical pharmacist plays an&#xD;
      important role in the development of protocols, packages and their compliance. The clinical&#xD;
      pharmacist is dedicated to the review of the therapy of each patient, through pharmacological&#xD;
      conciliation actions with the attending physician, actively participating in the daily round&#xD;
      of the multidisciplinary team and at the same time developing &quot;professional support&#xD;
      activities&quot; that include , reviews of adverse events associated with medications, education,&#xD;
      auditing, research, development of guidelines and institutional protocols for the use of&#xD;
      effective and safe medications, with the objective of reducing mortality and its associated&#xD;
      costs, thus improving the quality of the Attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the importance of the problem, it is that this work proposes that the implementation&#xD;
      and active dissemination of a constipation bundle/protocol guided by a clinical pharmacist&#xD;
      ensures adherence to the strategy in the treatment team and a decrease in the incidence of&#xD;
      constipation in the critical patient of the ICU of a university hospital. To fulfill this&#xD;
      objective, a quasi-experimental study was designed in which the first stage will be&#xD;
      diagnostic observational and a second part of the interventional type, in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of adherence to the bundle/protocol on the incidence of constipation in critically&#xD;
      ill patients admitted to a ICU of a university hospital for a period of 6 months.&#xD;

      Stages of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried out in 5 phases distributed in 3 continuous periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 - 2 month period (observational period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of patient information for bundle/protocol development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 - 3 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol / bundle development according to evidence-based approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active dissemination of bundle/protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 3 - 1 month period (implementation and evaluation period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol / bundle implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of patient information, measurement of adherence and evaluation of the effect&#xD;
           of the bundle/protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Phases of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Collection of patient information for the elaboration of the bundle/protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from patients hospitalized at the ICU will be collected through a data collection&#xD;
      sheet, prospectively to quantify the local magnitude of the constipation and other&#xD;
      alterations associated with the decrease in intestinal motility, interventions performed with&#xD;
      their results and its consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected through a collection form, which will consist of 5 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part I: Basic background record (Age, gender, anthropometric data, ICU service you&#xD;
           enter, service from which it comes, chronic morbid history).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part II: Registration of factors in the patient that may be related to the presence of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal motility disorders, as a risk or protective factor during the stay in&#xD;
           ICU (type of mechanical ventilation, use of norepinephrine, medicines used in&#xD;
           sedoanalgesia, degree of sedation according to SAS scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part III: Characterization of the nutrition administered to the patient during the stay&#xD;
           in ICU (what type of enteral nutrition he is receiving, daily amount of nutrition, daily&#xD;
           water balance, amount of bowel movements and if he has diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part IV: Registry of Laxative/s and/or Prokinetic/s Treatment and its clinical&#xD;
           evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part V: Identification and Registration of adverse effects associated with the indicated&#xD;
           treatment that are clinically evaluable and/or by registration in the nursing and&#xD;
           medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Bundle/protocol development according to evidence-based approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol and bundle elaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Active dissemination of a constipation protocol / bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation strategies will be addressed using the EPOC taxonomy (Effective Practice and&#xD;
      Organization of Care (EPOC). EPOC taxonomy. Oslo: Norwegian Knowledge Center for the Health&#xD;
      Services; 2002). For the purpose of this work only part of the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions aimed at health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Distribution of the protocol and bundles by email and a hard copy to all unit heads. In&#xD;
      addition, all the professional prescribers of the unit will be given a hard copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Educational Talks: Directed to health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active education: Session in groups of no more than 10 people, usually carried out in&#xD;
           medical visits, as feedback in multidisciplinary reviews of a patient between different&#xD;
           professionals of the medical team and/or interconsultores (professionals from other&#xD;
           disciplines and/or units other than within the ICU), in order to engage and educate the&#xD;
           health professional about the interventions of the protoco and the bundles, and also&#xD;
           confirm learning by the professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive education: Sessions intended to disseminate information to the prescribing&#xD;
           doctors of the entire unit, and to solve doubts globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Local opinion leaders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention through the participation of health professionals designated by their colleagues&#xD;
      as &quot;educationally influential&quot; (health professionals staff of the ICU, nutritionist,&#xD;
      gastroenterologist or others)&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Reminders: any oral or visual intervention that encourages the health professional to&#xD;
      perform a clinical action related to the protocol / bundle. The following interventions are&#xD;
      included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral reminders (Aimed at both treating physician, medical staff, and nurse between&#xD;
           medical visits when there is evidence of suboptimal care for patients included in the&#xD;
           study, for example, when a patient is constipated and is not receiving treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administrative support (graphics or reminder stickers attached to each patient's box).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organizational Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Structural interventions Incorporation of the protocol and bundles in each medical record&#xD;
      of the patients included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Implementation of the bundle/protocol in patients admitted during this period, who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and our treating doctors accepted informed consent (if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in phase 3 of the study corresponding to the implementation of the&#xD;
      package will be patients of the ICU, whatever the applications during the statistics, the set&#xD;
      of exclusive controls for each service unit (previously accepted as a package) focused on the&#xD;
      prevention of a probable episode of constipation, as long as there is no contraindication&#xD;
      (previously described). If a patient included in the corresponding phase of the study will&#xD;
      present constipation, the pharmacological management for said health problem will be applied,&#xD;
      as specified in their &quot;pharmacological management protocol for constipation&quot; developed and&#xD;
      validated together with the package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These protocol / package interventions will be presented to the health team during medical&#xD;
      rounds by both the pharmaceutical chemist responsible for the investigation and by any other&#xD;
      professional of the patient's health team in order to comply with the adherence to the&#xD;
      protocol / package for each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Collection of patient information, adherence measurement and evaluation of the effect of&#xD;
      the protocol / package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from hospitalized patients in the ICU will be collected through a data collection&#xD;
      form previously validated in Stage 1. In addition, the following information will be&#xD;
      incorporated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part I to Part V: Identical to the one previously validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part VI: Applicability of bundle in each of the elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part VII: Applicability of protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be backed up in an EXCEL (office) format file for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe and the target population will be all admitted patients that meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria in the period of time in which stage 1 (observational period) and stage 3 (period of&#xD;
      implementation and evaluation) of the study are executed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events to evaluate&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research paper:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the analysis of the following definitions shall be understood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Adhesion: It will be understood as adherence to the effective fulfillment of the&#xD;
      interventions that will be prepared for the protocol and the bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Constipation: Constipation shall be understood as the presence of &quot;three or more&#xD;
      consecutive days without depositions&quot; and prolonged constipation as &quot;six or more consecutive&#xD;
      days without depositions&quot;. For both definitions, it will be considered as zero day without&#xD;
      depositions from the start of enteral nutrition, at most 96 hours after admission to the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety shall be understood as the analysis of adverse events described in the following&#xD;
      definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Intolerance to nutritional support: It is understood as an intolerance to enteral&#xD;
      nutritional support to the presence of &quot;gastric residue greater than 500mL in a measurement&#xD;
      during the day, or to the presence of vomiting&quot;, which will be taken into account in patients&#xD;
      who are being given enteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Liquid deposition: Liquid deposition shall be understood as the presence of a &quot;deposition&#xD;
      of liquid consistency quantified in an amount greater than 200 milliliters&quot;. It is also&#xD;
      synonymous with a diarrheal deposition. *&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mechanical fan day: A mechanical ventilator day will be considered when the patient&#xD;
      requires mechanical ventilator support for more than 12 hours on the day of hospitalization&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
