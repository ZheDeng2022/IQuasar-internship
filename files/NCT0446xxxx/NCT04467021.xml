  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well intensive blood pressure management works in decreasing&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure in patients with kidney or thyroid cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic) who are starting anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      cancer therapy. This study is being done to find out if a systolic blood pressure to a target&#xD;
      of less than 120 mmHg (intensive systolic blood pressure management) can be achieved, well&#xD;
      tolerated, and beneficial as compared to the usual approach to a target of less than 140 mmHg&#xD;
      while taking an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This study may help doctors&#xD;
      understand the best way to control blood pressure in kidney or thyroid cancer patients taking&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of an intensive (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt; 120 mmHg)&#xD;
      &quot;Intervention&quot; versus standard care (SBP &lt; 140 mmHg) &quot;Non-Intervention&quot; approach to blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) control in metastatic renal cell and thyroid cancer patients initiating&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive intensive systolic blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients&#xD;
      receive increased blood pressure medication every 2 weeks while systolic blood pressure is&#xD;
      120 mmHg or higher. Patients also monitor blood pressure at home 1 day a week (4 times in 1&#xD;
      day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressure readings to the provider and to a&#xD;
      central blood pressure monitoring team. Patients with changes in blood pressure medications&#xD;
      monitor blood pressure readings on 3 days in 1 week (4 times in 1 day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive standard blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients receive&#xD;
      blood pressure medications per doctor's instruction. Patients also monitor blood pressure at&#xD;
      home 1 day (4 times in 1 day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressures to a&#xD;
      central monitoring team.&#xD;
