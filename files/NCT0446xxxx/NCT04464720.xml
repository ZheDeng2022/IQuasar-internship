  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot trial of kitchen ventilation in the homes of children using&#xD;
      a youth engaged research strategy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial of children ages 6-12, children and their households will receive an intensive&#xD;
      home kitchen ventilation intervention after one week of baseline data collection. The&#xD;
      intervention includes education regarding improving ventilation in their homes during cooking&#xD;
      and replacement of their range hood if it has inadequate flow or an intolerable noise level.&#xD;
      During baseline data collection periods the households will be encouraged to continue their&#xD;
      regular cooking patterns. The investigators will measure home particulate matter &lt;2.5 microns&#xD;
      (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels for one week at baseline, and a final week after&#xD;
      all remaining families receive the cooking ventilation intervention, to assess for changes&#xD;
      within each household. The investigators will also examine changes in airways inflammation&#xD;
      (as measured by the exhaled fraction of nitric oxide, FeNO), lung function (as measured by&#xD;
      spirometry), and reported symptoms after the baseline and intervention period. Members of the&#xD;
      research team have successfully conducted youth participatory action research in the&#xD;
      low-income, high asthma prevalence community of Richmond, California (CA) as well as&#xD;
      extensive youth participatory action research on other environmental health concerns in the&#xD;
      low income city of Salinas, CA; using a similar model, the investigators aim to teach&#xD;
      research methods to a new group of Richmond youth.&#xD;

    <description>An educational video presentation for the families regarding the importance of ventilation use during and after cooking, and strategies for improving the ventilation during cooking, has been created by Dr. Holm, with input from Youth Research Assistants (YRAs) The youth involvement will help to ensure that the information is presented in a way that will resonate with the local community and will also provide the youth with exposure to developing health education tools. The educational video will be shown to families at the time of the intervention visit and they will receive printed reminder materials of what they have learned.</description>
