  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting is a common and distressing presenting complaint in Canadian emergency&#xD;
      departments. Commonly used nausea medications have proven to be effective in certain patient&#xD;
      populations, for example cancer patients. However, not one has been proven to be more&#xD;
      effective that the other in the emergency department setting. In addition, many are&#xD;
      associated with significant side effects and have the potential to interact with a patient's&#xD;
      home medications. This limits their use in the emergency department until the patient is seen&#xD;
      and assessed by their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that nasal inhalation of alcohol swabs is an effective therapy in&#xD;
      relieving nausea and vomiting in post-operative patients after surgeries. The goal of this&#xD;
      study will be to determine the effectiveness of alcohol swabs in the emergency department&#xD;
      setting in relieving nausea and vomiting.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND INFORMATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence exists supporting the use of nasally inhaled isopropyl alcohol swabs as&#xD;
      anti-emetic therapy. Multiple studies report isopropyl alcohol inhalation as an effective&#xD;
      treatment for post-operative nausea and vomiting, with no reported adverse events. This&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive substance is widely available in most health care settings in the form&#xD;
      of swabs used in the routine course of delivering care as an antiseptic skin cleanser. Two&#xD;
      previous studies in the United States have evaluated the use of inhaled isopropyl alcohol&#xD;
      swabs in alleviating nausea and vomiting in the emergency department setting. One study in&#xD;
      2016 study by Beadle et. al. demonstrated superior nausea relief using inhaled isopropyl&#xD;
      alcohol swabs compared to an inhaled placebo, while a 2018 study by April et. al.&#xD;
      demonstrated superior nausea relief with isopropyl alcohol swabs compared with inhaled&#xD;
      placebo and oral ondansetron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2016 study by Beadle et. al. has several important limitations. This was a single center&#xD;
      military hospital study, which only measured nausea scores 10 minutes after isopropyl alcohol&#xD;
      swab inhalation, and lacked other important outcomes such as the number of vomiting episodes,&#xD;
      use of rescue anti-emetics, ED length of stay and admission rates. The 2018 study by April&#xD;
      et. al. also has limitations. Mainly, alcohol swabs were used as often as required by&#xD;
      participants, and the dosing frequency of inhalations was not measured. They also excluded&#xD;
      patients who had a peripheral intravenous catheter inserted on arrival, which could suggest&#xD;
      that patients with more severe symptoms of nausea and vomiting requiring intravenous&#xD;
      anti-emetics were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's goal is to add to the current body of evidence on the use of isopropyl&#xD;
      alcohol in alleviating nausea and vomiting in the emergency department, particularly by&#xD;
      determining which dosing frequency of isopropyl alcohol inhalation yields the most effective&#xD;
      nausea relief by randomizing patients to different inhalation frequencies. This may help to&#xD;
      guide future triage protocols enabling isopropyl alcohol inhalation before provider&#xD;
      evaluation to improve treatment of nausea and patient satisfaction. In the current state of&#xD;
      emergency department overcrowding, the ability to adequately control a patient's symptoms at&#xD;
      triage may help decrease a patient's length of stay, as well as the number of patients&#xD;
      requiring beds. In addition, from a cost-savings perspective, alcohol swabs are a relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive therapy as compared to many commonly administered anti-emetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of nasally inhaled isopropyl alcohol&#xD;
      in alleviating nausea and/or vomiting in patients presenting to the emergency department with&#xD;
      a chief complaint of nausea and/or vomiting. Specifically, this study will determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nausea relief: mean reduction in nausea scores using a self-reported nausea scale&#xD;
           comparing the pre-intervention nausea score to the final nausea score at the study&#xD;
           endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participant satisfaction: self-reported satisfaction scale measured at the study&#xD;
           endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Optimal dosing frequency: compare the reduction in nausea scores among participants&#xD;
           inhaling isopropyl alcohol swabs every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes, and to participants&#xD;
           receiving no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Emergency department management: receipt of rescue anti-emetic medications and other&#xD;
           medications (ie. analgesics, intravenous fluids).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participant disposition: emergency department length of stay and admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome reflecting the efficacy of treatment is the mean nausea score reduction,&#xD;
      using a self-reported nausea score comparing the subject's pre-intervention score to the&#xD;
      final nausea score at the study endpoint. Nausea scores will be measured using a&#xD;
      self-reported 10-point verbal numeric scale ranging from 1-10, labeled &quot;no nausea&quot; at the&#xD;
      left end (1) and &quot;worse nausea imaginable&quot; at right end (10). Nausea scores will be measured&#xD;
      at baseline before intervention, 10 minutes post-intervention, 20 minutes post-intervention,&#xD;
      30 minutes post-intervention, and then every 30 minutes for a total of two hours throughout&#xD;
      the subject's emergency department visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes reflecting the efficacy of the study intervention are participant&#xD;
      satisfaction scores, the receipt of any rescue anti-emetic medications, emergency department&#xD;
      length of stay, and participant disposition. Satisfaction scores will be measured using a&#xD;
      self-reported 5-point verbal numeric scale ranging from 1-5, labeled &quot;very unsatisfied&quot; at&#xD;
      the left end (1) and &quot;very satisfied&quot; at the right end (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial of eligible patients presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency department with a chief complaint of nausea and/or vomiting. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three subject arms: 1) Nasally inhaled isopropyl alcohol swabs every 10&#xD;
      minutes for a total of one hour; 2) Nasally inhaled isopropyl alcohol swabs every 20 minutes&#xD;
      for a total of one hour; and 3) No intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of potential study subjects will be identified by the research team&#xD;
      during periods when available to enroll subjects. Patients will be approached while in the&#xD;
      waiting room or shortly after arrival to their assigned emergency department room, before&#xD;
      arrival of their treating physician and before any treatment is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation sequence will be generated using computer-generated random numbers using&#xD;
      blocks of 6. Concealment will be performed using sealed, opaque envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation will be expected to end at the study endpoint, either after two hours&#xD;
      of collection of nausea scores from the start of treatment or until there is administration&#xD;
      of anti-emetics from the treating physician before the two hours is complete. There will be&#xD;
      no further follow-up. Active study duration will be two hours for each study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimally clinically significant difference is assumed to be 3 points on a self-reported&#xD;
      10-point verbal numeric scale ranging from 1-10. For α=0.25 and β=.80 using a t-test, the&#xD;
      sample size required is 45 per participant arm (135 participants total). Imputation will be&#xD;
      used to replace any missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analysis will be done by the trial biostatistician. Participant baseline characteristics&#xD;
      will be summarized with descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals. The primary&#xD;
      outcome, i.e., mean reduction in nausea scores, will be analyzed using repeated measures&#xD;
      linear regression analysis. Study arm, time and study arm by time will be included as fixed&#xD;
      covariates and the correlation in repeated measures on the same subject over time will be&#xD;
      modeled using a suitable covariance structure. Least square mean differences, together with&#xD;
      95% Confidence Intervals, will be used to express the treatment effect, comparing each of the&#xD;
      intervention arms to the control arm. Statistical significance of each pairwise comparison&#xD;
      will be judged at the 2.5% level to maintain the overall level at 5%. A similar approach will&#xD;
      be used for ED lengths of stay (with transformation to improve normality if necessary).&#xD;
      Number of vomiting episodes and receipt of antiemetic drugs will be analyzed using Poisson or&#xD;
      logistic regression as appropriate. All analyses will be intention to treat. There will be no&#xD;
      interim analysis completed. Imputation will be used to replace any missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a quality control monitoring process and study monitor plan in place to&#xD;
      verify that all data are accurate and complete. An internal DSMB, free of competing&#xD;
      interests, will monitor the study and will generate a site monitoring report to detail&#xD;
      significant findings, deviations, deficiencies, plausibility, record completeness and any&#xD;
      corrective actions to be taken. The investigator will permit trial-related monitoring,&#xD;
      audits, REB review, and regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to source&#xD;
      data/documents.&#xD;
