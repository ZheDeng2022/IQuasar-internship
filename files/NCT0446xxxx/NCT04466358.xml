  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two methods of catheter ablation for treatment of&#xD;
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The first method being a modified CLOSE protocol used&#xD;
      for the control group and the second high density mapping guided isolation of pulmonary veins&#xD;
      used for the interventional group. Comparison will be made according to clinical parameters&#xD;
      and also durability of pulmonary vein isolation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLOSE protocol is among the latest methods of catheter ablation of AF. According to this&#xD;
      protocol, ablations are guided by ablation index, which takes into account ablation time, the&#xD;
      contact force and power supplied by the ablation catheter. In this protocol the distance&#xD;
      between individual ablation lesions is less than 6 millimeters (mm), thus ensuring the&#xD;
      continuity of the ablation line around the pulmonary veins. After ablation, the electrical&#xD;
      isolation of pulmonary veins (entry and exit block) is checked with a multi-electrode&#xD;
      circumferential catheter. The electrical inactivity of the ablation line itself is thus&#xD;
      checked indirectly via the conduction block. According to recent studies, the success rate of&#xD;
      catheter ablation with this protocol after one procedure at one year is approximately 90%.&#xD;
      Investigators believe that the presence of electrical activity within the ablation line,&#xD;
      which does not translate into and out of the pulmonary veins during the procedure and is not&#xD;
      detected by the currently used mapping technique, significantly affects the subsequent&#xD;
      clinical success of the procedure. Investigators assume that high-resolution mapping of the&#xD;
      ablation line would identify areas of electrical activity within the ablation line (dormant&#xD;
      conduction) and that the ablation of these areas during the first procedure would&#xD;
      significantly affect both the long-term isolation of the pulmonary veins and the clinical&#xD;
      success of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare long-term clinical efficacy and efficacy of pulmonary&#xD;
      vein isolation of two different methods of catheter ablation for treatment of AF.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised into two groups. In the first group isolation of pulmonary&#xD;
      veins will be performed following a modified CLOSE protocol, the isolation will be checked&#xD;
      with multipolar circumferential catheter. In the second group the ablation will be performed&#xD;
      with the same method but the isolation of pulmonary veins will be checked with&#xD;
      high-resolution mapping looking for dormant conduction in the pulmonary vein antra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators expect that the incidence of the recurrence od AF in the high resolution&#xD;
      mapping group will be lower during clinical follow-up. Investigators also expect that durable&#xD;
      pulmonary vein isolation will be present in higher proportion of participants where high&#xD;
      resolution mapping was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wide antral circumferential isolation of the pulmonary veins following modified CLOSE&#xD;
           protocol (1) - ablation index at the posterior side 400, at the anterior side 550;&#xD;
           distance between lesions &lt;6 mm. 30 minutes after the completion of the ablation line,&#xD;
           the isolation of the pulmonary veins is checked by inserting multipolar circular&#xD;
           catheter into each pulmonary vein. In case of electrical activity ablation is added to&#xD;
           close the gap in the line until pulmonary veins are electrically isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wide antral circumferential isolation of the pulmonary veins following modified CLOSE&#xD;
           protocol (1) - ablation index at the posterior side 400, at the anterior side 550;&#xD;
           distance between lesions &lt;6 mm. 30 minutes after the completion of the ablation line,&#xD;
           the isolation of the pulmonary veins is checked by inserting multipolar circular&#xD;
           catheter into each pulmonary vein. Additionally a high density map is created with the&#xD;
           multipolar catheter with at least 1000 mapping points for each pulmonary antrum. Signals&#xD;
           considered to represent gaps in the line: multicomponent intracardiac electrograms&#xD;
           consisting of at least three baseline deviations and/or conduction from vein to the&#xD;
           atrium during pacing beyond ablation line (10 milliAmpers, 1 millisecond) and/or voltage&#xD;
           amplitude inside the ablation line above 0.1 milliVolts. If intracardiac signals after&#xD;
           added ablation on the line persist after additional ablations this region is not&#xD;
           considered a gap in the line. The area of the gap is ablated until electric inactivity&#xD;
           of the pulmonary vein antrum as evidenced with high density remapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will record the characteristics of the areas where gaps will be recorded:&#xD;
      inappropriate drop in impedance during ablation (below 10 Ohms), the parameters of the&#xD;
      contact force of the ablation catheter tip during ablation, interlesion distance,&#xD;
      characteristics of unipolar recordings of intracardiac electrograms from the tip of the&#xD;
      ablation catheter and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (12) months after the procedure, all participants (even without proven atrial&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmia) will undergo a re-intervention to check electrical isolation of the&#xD;
      pulmonary veins and pulmonary vein antra with a multi-electrode mapping catheter and high&#xD;
      density mapping. In case of proven re-isolation of the pulmonary veins or their antra,&#xD;
      investigators will find the location of the gap in the ablation line and add additional&#xD;
      ablation at this location until electrical isolation will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 12&#xD;
      hours after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day after the procedure following examinations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  transthoracic ultrasound of the pericardium,&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be monitored clinically for at least 12 months after the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of blanking period, participants will come for the first outpatient&#xD;
      examination in outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center in Ljubljana. This will be&#xD;
      followed by a second outpatient examination after 6 months and a third outpatient examination&#xD;
      after 12 months of intervention. In case of palpitations participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      come to an earlier examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical efficacy of the procedure will be defined as absence of AF episodes longer than 30&#xD;
      seconds detected by 24-hour ECG monitoring. Additionally, episodes of AF detected with event&#xD;
      monitors and symptom driven 12-lead ECG recordings will be considered a recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first and second clinical follow-up (3, 6 months) the following examinations will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history taking and clinical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG recording,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour Holter ECG,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week event monitor with daily 2 minute ECG recordings that will be sent to the&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the third clinical follow-up (12 months) the following examinations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history taking and clinical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG recording,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour Holter ECG,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week event monitor with daily 2 minute ECG recordings that will be sent to the&#xD;
           investigator,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  transthoracic ultrasound of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical management: Antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) and anticoagulation (AC) management will be&#xD;
      directed by the referring physician. Anticoagulation is continued post-procedurally for at&#xD;
      least three months. This continuation of ADDs and AC will be controled by the referring&#xD;
      physician and a predefined protocol for discontinuation will not be provided. Subsequent&#xD;
      interventions including repeat catheter ablation will be directed by the referring physician&#xD;
      and recorded.&#xD;
