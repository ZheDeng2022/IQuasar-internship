      This study characterized the impact of respiratory-gated transcutaneous vagus nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (tVNS) on the modulation of the stress response circuitry, vagal tone and&#xD;
      depressed mood in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Twenty premenopausal women&#xD;
      with recurrent MDD in an active episode were recruited into a single-blind cross-over study&#xD;
      that included two functional MRI visits within a one week period with simultaneous mood and&#xD;
      physiological assessments. Randomization to exhalatory- or inhalatory-gated tVNS was&#xD;
      performed to control for order effects. The study hypothesis was that exhalatory-gated tVNS&#xD;
      would have a significantly greater impact on the regulation of brain activity in stress&#xD;
      response circuitry, vagal tone and depressed mood in MDD patients compared to&#xD;
      inhalation-gated tVNS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with alterations of the stress response&#xD;
      circuitry, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex,&#xD;
      ventromedial, dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Many of these regions are&#xD;
      morphologically and functionally sexually dimorphic and associated with vulnerability for sex&#xD;
      differences in MDD. A major role for the stress response circuitry is to assess potentially&#xD;
      stressful stimuli and respond with a neuroendocrine signal that coordinates homeostatic&#xD;
      responses throughout the body. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that alterations in this&#xD;
      circuitry are implicated in mood dysregulation, increased activation of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and imbalance between the sympathetic and&#xD;
      parasympathetic nervous system in depressed persons. Thus, the development of novel&#xD;
      interventions that regulate this system may have a significant impact on the improvement of&#xD;
      clinical and physiological alterations of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is an FDA approved treatment for MDD that modulates circuitry&#xD;
      implicated in mood regulation. Recently, a non-invasive variant of VNS, transcutaneous&#xD;
      auricular vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), which targets the auricular branch of the vagus&#xD;
      nerve (ABVN) has been proposed. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that the dorsal&#xD;
      medullary system receiving vagal afference inputs operates in tune with respiration and that&#xD;
      tVNS may be optimized by gating ABVN stimulation to the exhalatory phase of the respiratory&#xD;
      cycle. Thus, this study proposed to characterize the impact of respiratory-gated tVNS on the&#xD;
      modulation of the stress response circuitry, vagal tone and depressed mood in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent major depression (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty premenopausal women with recurrent MDD in an active episode were recruited into a&#xD;
      single-blind cross-over study that included two functional MRI visits, within a one week&#xD;
      period, with simultaneous mood and physiological assessments. Randomization to exhalatory- or&#xD;
      inhalatory-gated tVNS was performed to control for order effects. Subjects were exposed to a&#xD;
      mild visual stress challenge that preceded and followed 30 minutes of exhalatory- or&#xD;
      inhalatory-gated tVNS. The study hypothesis was that exhalatory-gated tVNS would have a&#xD;
      significantly greater impact on the regulation of brain activity in stress response&#xD;
      circuitry, vagal tone and depressed mood in MDD patients compared to inhalation-gated tVNS&#xD;
