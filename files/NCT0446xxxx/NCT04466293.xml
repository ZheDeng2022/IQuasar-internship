  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Clinical guidelines and policies often fail to achieve high levels of delivery of&#xD;
      intended clinical interventions. The difference in what investigators know works and what is&#xD;
      actually delivered at the clinic-level to patients, is known as the &quot;science-to-service gap.&quot;&#xD;
      In the realm of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, this gap is reflected in &lt;20% of TB preventive&#xD;
      therapy (TPT)-eligible persons living with HIV (PLWH) being offered or initiated on isoniazid&#xD;
      preventive therapy (IPT) in many settings. Recent innovation in TPT have brought new&#xD;
      pharmacological options allowing for shorter courses, intermittent dosing, or both. A 12-dose&#xD;
      once-weekly rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) regimen has been demonstrated to be effective and&#xD;
      well tolerated. This regimen has several potential advantages over IPT; however, if patients&#xD;
      are never assessed for 3HP eligibility and 3HP is not prescribed, TPT packets will remain on&#xD;
      pharmacy shelves and the potential health benefits will not reach those who need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this study is to identify a generalizable approach to overcome&#xD;
      current barriers to delivery of TPT in order to achieve high levels of TPT delivery during&#xD;
      routine care in public clinics. Investigators are proposing a choice architecture that makes&#xD;
      prescribing TPT the &quot;default&quot; or standard option and that for TPT not to be prescribed will&#xD;
      require a choice by a clinician to &quot;opt-out&quot; of TPT for a specific patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Investigators will use a cluster randomized design with the larger IMPAACT4TB (I4TB)&#xD;
      program to deliver 3HP to countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A subset of countries&#xD;
      and clinics within these I4TB countries will be included with each clinic the unit of&#xD;
      randomization. Clinics within study countries will be randomized to one of two strategies:&#xD;
      (1) standard implementation within the UNITAID project (clinic training on TPT along with&#xD;
      posters and other standard medication material) and (2) choice architecture default TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical process data will be used to assess the effectiveness of each strategy to determine&#xD;
      the proportion of PLWH (1) screened for TB preventive therapy, (2) eligible for TPT, and (3)&#xD;
      prescribed TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Identifying a pragmatic approach will lead the way for improving TPT&#xD;
      prescribing across the study sites. It will furthermore contribute to implementation science&#xD;
      at large in describing implementation strategies that may be applied to clinic-level&#xD;
      implementation of other innovations.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical guidelines and policies often fail to achieve high levels of delivery of the&#xD;
      intended clinical intervention. The difference in what investigators know works and what is&#xD;
      actually delivered at the clinic-level to patients, is known as the &quot;science to service gap.&quot;&#xD;
      In the realm of TB prevention, this &quot;science to service&quot; gap is reflected in &lt;20% of&#xD;
      isoniazid eligible PLWH actually receiving isoniazid in most settings. 3HP has several&#xD;
      potential advantages over isoniazid for TB prevention; however, if patients are never&#xD;
      assessed for 3HP eligibility and 3HP is not prescribed, packets of 3HP will remain on&#xD;
      pharmacy shelves and the potential health benefits will not reach those who need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of delivery of an innovation can occur for multiple reasons and at multiple levels:&#xD;
      this includes an outer setting of national policy and funding and inner setting of providers&#xD;
      embracing the innovation, feeling confident in prescribing it, and remembering to prescribe&#xD;
      it. The failure with TB preventive therapy (TPT) delivery appears to be mostly due a failure&#xD;
      of clinician having a realistic understanding in the benefits compared to risks of IPT,&#xD;
      confidence in appropriate prescribing, and remembering to prescribe at the appropriate time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple approaches have been suggested and/or implemented to improve clinic-level delivery&#xD;
      of recommended services. These include performance feedback, performance-based incentives,&#xD;
      change agents, opt-out services, routinizing the service in normal care delivery, quality&#xD;
      improvement officers or projects, clinic champions, electronic medical record &quot;popups&quot;, etc.&#xD;
      Not all of these approaches have been evaluated and of those that have been evaluated,&#xD;
      success is uneven. Part of the reason for variable success is that some of these context&#xD;
      specific approaches have failed in settings with variation in the context of the&#xD;
      implementation and variation in the barriers to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are proposing to test an implementation strategy to achieve high levels of&#xD;
      clinic-level delivery of TB preventive therapy. Investigators will conduct a cluster&#xD;
      randomized trial of a clinician &quot;optout&quot; strategy, shifting clinician decision making from&#xD;
      prescribing TPT to identifying individuals to whom not to prescribe TPT, and the standard&#xD;
      implementation strategy for 3HP roll-out in the IMPAACT4TB project: training and visual aids&#xD;
      (posters, etc.) in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training for clinic staff will be general on 3HP implementation and routine data recording as&#xD;
      part of the IMPAACT4TB implementation. A separate training will occur for clinicians working&#xD;
      in intervention clinics to minimize adoption of the routinization approach by control&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice architecture &quot;default&quot; or &quot;opt-out&quot; strategy is based on behavioral economic&#xD;
      theory. The key behavioral economic concepts are choice architecture for which the opt-out&#xD;
      approach makes delivery of TPT the default option - rather than the choice option. This&#xD;
      approach has been effective in multiple clinic implementation areas for other services. In&#xD;
      addition to shifting decision making by making TPT the default option it also normalizes TPT&#xD;
      to be appropriate for all PLWH, rather than those with perceived exposure, risk, etc.&#xD;
      Finally, by making TPT the default it prevents providers from overlooking TPT at initial&#xD;
      encounter and after ruling out TB disease if TPT was delayed due to concern for TB disease.&#xD;
      Investigators further hypothesize, and propose to assess, that through the process of&#xD;
      normalizing or routinizing TPT to all (versus selecting for eligibility) the self-efficacy of&#xD;
      providers regarding TPT prescribing will increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To use a feasible, low-resource strategy to achieve levels of TPT delivery&#xD;
      substantially higher than routine implementation in primary care public clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: proportion of TPT eligible/potentially eligible PLWH initiating ART at&#xD;
      clinics who are prescribed TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of TPT eligible/potentially eligible PLWH established on ART who are&#xD;
           prescribed TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of all unique HIV patients during study period prescribed TPT (3HP and IPT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events among TPT recipients and among non-TPT recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TPT completion among those who initiate TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TB diagnoses among TPT recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability and fidelity of choice architecture approach to clinicians&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have designed a cluster randomized trial of a clinic-level implementation&#xD;
      strategy for a standard of care intervention (TPT to PLWH). Clinics within study countries&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two strategies: (1) standard implementation within the I4TB&#xD;
      project (clinic training on TPT along with posters and other standard medication material)&#xD;
      and (2) &quot;choice architecture&quot; / &quot;opt-out&quot; TPT prescribing. Because of the clinic-level nature&#xD;
      of the implementation strategies, all PLWH receiving care at a clinic will be exposed to the&#xD;
      standard implementation or TPT choice architecture implementation. Clinical process data will&#xD;
      be used to assess the effectiveness of each strategy to determine the proportion of PLWH&#xD;
      prescribed TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Implementation of 3HP will only occur in any of the study countries after rifapentine&#xD;
      is registered for in-country use for TPT. No off-label or un-registered drug use will occur&#xD;
      as part of this study. This study is being conducted within the IMPAACT4TB project focused on&#xD;
      implementing 3HP and the study will be implemented alongside 3HP rollout in these countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient clinics will be selected for inclusion based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The clinic is supported by the in-country collaborating partner (through PEPFAR or other&#xD;
           international funding)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinic is prescribing both ART and TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinic has been selected for 3HP introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinics will be included starting sequentially with the lowest TPT performing clinics.&#xD;
           Ideally, no clinics with &gt;50% TPT prescribing will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Preferred characteristics: Another potential study clinic within 15 km; use of similar&#xD;
           of prescribing approach to multiple other clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each partner supports 20-30 clinics as part of the I4TB project. Of these approximately 22&#xD;
      will be selected for inclusion in each country. No additional considerations, beyond what is&#xD;
      listed above, will be used for clinic selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic randomization to study arm will be conducted publically (either in a single location,&#xD;
      or if blocking by country, in each country). Randomization will be achieved either through&#xD;
      computer randomization or through drawing marked balls from a bag. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by country and within each country by clinic ART population and urban / rural&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Strategy initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, optimization and adaptation of the implementation strategy for that&#xD;
      clinic will be discussed between clinic staff, 3HP country implementers, and research staff.&#xD;
      Core elements of the novel strategy (choice architecture default to 3HP prescribing) will be&#xD;
      maintained while allowing adaptation of specific algorithm tools, posters, clinical mentoring&#xD;
      approaches, and pre-printed, or ink-stamp prescriptions in patient clinic files&#xD;
      (prescriptions in most countries are written in the clinic-maintained patient paper file&#xD;
      rather than a slip of paper or electronic prescription system) or EMR modifications for&#xD;
      electronic prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice Architecture Strategy delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic staff will be responsible for strategy delivery for all patient interactions. Research&#xD;
      staff will provide training and guidance for the &quot;choice architecture&quot; arm. Research staff&#xD;
      will also work with the clinics to develop appropriate clinical stationary, ink stamps,&#xD;
      stickers, or EMR modifications for prescribing, and reminder systems (e.g. written by&#xD;
      pharmacy in clinic file, post-it on clinic file, post-it on lab results). The goal of this&#xD;
      approach is for TPT prescribing to occur routinely and as part of ART prescribing. This is in&#xD;
      contrast to considering prescribing only at the end of a long algorithm that includes TB and&#xD;
      other assessments. With this approach, a patient will &quot;automatically&quot; be prescribed TPT&#xD;
      unless the clinician specifically decides participants are not a candidate due to active TB&#xD;
      treatment or other clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-country research coordinators will travel to clinics to monitor strategy implementation&#xD;
      and provide support as appropriate within the strategy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps for &quot;opt-out&quot; strategy delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Providers will receive general training on TPT benefits, indications, and&#xD;
           contra-indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Providers will be provided with updated ART and TPT prescribing approach. This will be&#xD;
           adapted to the country context and may include a pre-printed prescription pad&#xD;
           (Mozambique), adaptations in clinical stationary (Zimbabwe), or adaptations to an&#xD;
           electronic prescribing system (Malawi).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The pharmacy or clinician (if the clinician dispenses) will dispense ART, cotrimoxazole,&#xD;
           and TPT as prescribed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers will receive training on benefits, indications, and contra-indications for TPT.&#xD;
      Providers will use the standard approach of the &quot;default&quot; being to not prescribe. Only if&#xD;
      providers specifically write for TPT will it be dispensed by a pharmacy or the provider.&#xD;
      In-country research coordinators will travel to clinics to monitor strategy implementation&#xD;
      and provide support as appropriate within the strategy procedures.&#xD;
