  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional drainage for uniportal video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a routine&#xD;
      method, usually with one or two chest tubes at intercostal incisions, but postoperative pain&#xD;
      due to the chest tube and unsatisfied drainage effect was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators are going to explore whether a prophylactic air-extraction&#xD;
      catheter combined with chest tube drainage may not increase complications in uniportal VATS&#xD;
      for upper lung lobectomy. The patients would be assigned to two arms, one with a prophylactic&#xD;
      air-extraction catheter combined with chest tube, and another with two chest tubes, and the&#xD;
      effect of the combined drainage strategy will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Research purpose and background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection is still one of the most important treatment methods for early stage&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Complete resection and reasonable dissection of mediastinal lymph&#xD;
      nodes are the key of cancer cure. Lobectomy has always been the standard surgical method for&#xD;
      lung cancer radical resection. It can remove the lesion and retain normal lung function by&#xD;
      resecting the lung lobe where the lesion is and preserve the remaining lobe. In recent years,&#xD;
      the development of uniport video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has further reduced the&#xD;
      trauma, with treatment benefit similar with that of two-port and three-port thoracoscopy.&#xD;
      However, based on the single hole thoracoscopic lung recruitment, incision drainage and other&#xD;
      issues also need further evidence support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No tube technology, such as no tracheal intubation, drainage tube, nor catheter combined with&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracoscopy, can significantly improve the rehabilitation of patients, and&#xD;
      further shorten the postoperative hospital stay. In addition, the safety of tubeless drainage&#xD;
      has been supported by more and more studies. However, poor drainage may also increase the&#xD;
      incidence of pneumothorax and postoperative pulmonary dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After upper lobe lobectomy, the cavity needs to be filled by the full recruitment of the&#xD;
      remaining lobes. theoretically, there is a higher demand for the strategy of the drainage&#xD;
      tube. The investigatorstried to compare the safety and effectiveness of the prophylactic&#xD;
      air-extraction catheter (later known as microtubule) combined with thoracic tube drainage&#xD;
      with traditional double drainage tube alone. Therefore, the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, non inferiority trial to verify the hypothesis that microtubule&#xD;
      combined with thoracic catheter drainage after uniport VATS upper lobectomy will not increase&#xD;
      the related perioperative complications compared with traditional thoracic tube drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The doctors participating in the operation and catheterization in clinical trials should&#xD;
           be at least attendings, so as to ensure the safety of operation and chest tube&#xD;
           placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The chest tube placement was carried out randomly with two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. From our previous clinical experience, the tube is placed for 3 days to 2 weeks, so it&#xD;
           last for a short time, and all of them can be extubated by doctors above the attending&#xD;
           level, so the detachment rate of the experiment is low and the quality can be&#xD;
           guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The trial team has written the test related procedures into the team medical process,&#xD;
           including but not limited to the time point of chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data checks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data checks will be performed by a individual attending doctor with GCP to compare data&#xD;
      entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or consistency with other data&#xD;
      fields in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification will be performed by a individual attending doctor with GCP to&#xD;
      assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the&#xD;
      data to external data sources (for example, medical records, paper or electronic case report&#xD;
      forms, or interactive voice response systems).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruitment The subjects were recruited on a voluntary basis. If they decide to&#xD;
      participate in this study, the personal data of subjects participating in the trial are&#xD;
      confidential. The subject's blood samples will be identified by the study number, not the&#xD;
      subject's name. Information that identifies the subject will not be disclosed to members&#xD;
      outside the study team unless permission is obtained from the subject. All study members and&#xD;
      study sponsors were asked to keep their identities confidential. The subjects' files will be&#xD;
      kept in a locked file cabinet for researchers' reference only. In order to ensure that the&#xD;
      study is carried out in accordance with the regulations, members of the government&#xD;
      administration or the ethics review committee may access the subject's personal data in the&#xD;
      research unit as required. At the time of publication, no personal information will be&#xD;
      disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      data collection All the patients learned about the two kinds of operation through&#xD;
      preoperative education, and voluntarily joined the research group and signed the ethical&#xD;
      agreement. In this clinical trial, patients were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      The members of the experimental group were only responsible for the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      of patients. The surgeons and assistants did not participate in the preoperative evaluation&#xD;
      and postoperative management. The pain assessment team, postoperative management personnel&#xD;
      and follow-up evaluators did not know what group the patients belonged to (patients could&#xD;
      wear wide clothes to cover the drainage tube after operation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      change management In cases with serious medical risk caused by the operation technology of&#xD;
      the trial, or the research indicates that the difference between the groups is too obvious,&#xD;
      the researcher should stop the trial and fill in the report form of violation of protocol&#xD;
      deviation and report to the ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients were enrolled normally and reached the number of cases required for the&#xD;
      trial, the trial was finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      reporting for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The sponsor shall provide the safety research data of the technology and other safety&#xD;
           related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the design scheme, the definition of adverse events should be clearly defined, and&#xD;
           the criteria for judging the severity of adverse events, as well as the classification&#xD;
           criteria for judging the relationship between adverse events and experimental operation&#xD;
           (such as positively related, possibly related, possibly unrelated, irrelevant and unable&#xD;
           to be determined). The protocol requires researchers to truthfully fill in the adverse&#xD;
           event record form, recording the occurrence time, severity, duration, measures taken and&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Before starting the trial, the members of the research team must be familiar with the&#xD;
           contents of the prevention and treatment of subjects and emergency plans in medical&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In case of SAE, the research physician must report to the project leader, the food and&#xD;
           drug administration, the sponsor, the medical ethics committee of our hospital, the&#xD;
           center ethics, and the office of drug clinical trial institution within 24 hours. When&#xD;
           and by what means (e.g. telephone, fax or written) to whom SAE was reported should be&#xD;
           recorded in the original data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The original medical ethics committee reports the paper version, including the receipt&#xD;
           page (with PI signature), SAE form and processing process in triplicate, and then&#xD;
           reports the electronic version of PPT, which is then sent to wangxing5447@126.com&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To study the doctor according to the implementation of treatment, if necessary, start to&#xD;
           prevent and deal with medical subjects and emergency plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At the same time, the research doctor should make a record of SAE, including at least&#xD;
           the description of adverse events, occurrence time, termination time, degree and&#xD;
           frequency of seizures, and the treatment given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The medical ethics committee will hold a meeting to organize experts to report and&#xD;
           discuss the SAE and the treatment process in our hospital, and require the follow-up of&#xD;
           SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to verify whether the new strategy is not inferior to&#xD;
      traditional method in uniport VATS upper lobe lobectomy. In terms of the incidence of&#xD;
      pneumothorax (primary), based on previous observational studies, the probability of&#xD;
      postoperative pneumothorax in new method and traditional method was about 10% and 6%.&#xD;
      Considering 25% of non-inferiority margin, efficacy analysis estimated that 75 patients in&#xD;
      each group were required to achieve power of 0.99 (via version 15.0; NCSs, Kaysville, UT,&#xD;
      USA) with unilateral α of 0.025. Considering some out of groups due to clinical factors or&#xD;
      other criteria (e.g., changing surgical methods according to pathological results during&#xD;
      operation, combined with other lobectomy, etc.), a total of 75 subjects in each group were&#xD;
      required, and 400 is the anticipating case number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data The investigators made a plan for missing data to address situations&#xD;
      where variables are reported as missing, unavailable, non-reported, uninterpretable, or&#xD;
      considered missing because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, sufficient case is planned for the missing data generated from changes in surgery, as&#xD;
      combined lobectomy or sublobectomies. Second, all the surgeons in our department will be&#xD;
      informed of this study, and the changes in surgical method should be avoided to their best&#xD;
      effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed to these select two groups in terms of clinical&#xD;
      parameters, including the incidence of pneumothorax, reintubation rate, pain score and other&#xD;
      parameters, respectively using t test, chi square test, rank sum test and other means. SPSS&#xD;
      20 will be validated to compare the primary and secondary observation end points between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
