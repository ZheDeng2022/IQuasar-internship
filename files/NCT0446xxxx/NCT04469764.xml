    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well abemaciclib works in treating patients with ovarian or&#xD;
      endometrial cancer that has an activation of the CDK4/6 pathway and that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving abemaciclib may work better for the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian and endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain an estimate of the proportion of patients' progression-free at 16 weeks (16 week&#xD;
      progression free survival [PFS] rate) in patients with recurrent ovarian (including fallopian&#xD;
      tube and primary peritoneal) or recurrent endometrial cancer following treatment with&#xD;
      abemaciclib as a molecularly matched targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess objective response rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST), progression free survival (PFS) and safety following treatment with&#xD;
      abemaciclib as a molecularly matched targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the relationship between response to abemaciclib and somatic gene alterations&#xD;
      that lead to CDK4/6 activation in ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between response to abemaciclib and hormone receptor&#xD;
      expression levels as well as somatic gene alterations that lead to CDK4/6 activation in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Patients with tumors&#xD;
      that are hormone receptor positive also receive anastrozole or letrozole per standard of&#xD;
      care. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks up to 1 year.&#xD;

             laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for&#xD;
             the patient's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation&#xD;
             of trial results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this trial&#xD;
