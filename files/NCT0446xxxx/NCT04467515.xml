      This is a Phase 1/2 multi-center, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to&#xD;
      evaluate safety, tolerability, dosimetry, pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of the targeted&#xD;
      radionuclide therapeutic CAM-H2 in patients with progressive, advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast, gastric, and GEJ cancer with disease progression following anti-HER2&#xD;
      standard of care treatment. The study duration for each phase will be up to 18 months. The&#xD;
