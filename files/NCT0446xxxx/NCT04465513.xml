  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a plus-sense single-stranded&#xD;
      RNA virus. After an incubation period, which typically lasts for 5-6 days, COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      present with a mild illness that lasts for a few days. Common symptoms are reminiscent of the&#xD;
      flu, and include fever, dry cough and dyspnea. A large percentage of patients resolve the&#xD;
      infection whereas others progress onto adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which&#xD;
      impedes gas exchange between the alveolar space and the bloodstream and creates the need for&#xD;
      assisted respiration. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of CARDIO supplementation in the recovery of those with COVID-19 infection following the&#xD;
      guidance from public health by reducing the need for mechanical respiratory support,&#xD;
      alleviating respiratory symptoms and reducing mortality.&#xD;

      SARS-CoV-2, a plus-sense single-stranded RNA virus, is the etiologic agent of COVID-19. After&#xD;
      an incubation period, which typically lasts for 5-6 days. COVID-19 patients present with a&#xD;
      mild illness that lasts for a few days. Common symptoms are reminiscent of the flu, and&#xD;
      include fever, dry cough and dyspnea. A large percentage of patients resolve the infection&#xD;
      whereas others progress onto adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which impedes gas&#xD;
      exchange between the alveolar space and the bloodstream and creates the need for assisted&#xD;
      respiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that between 5-10% of asthma patients do not respond to steroid-based&#xD;
      therapies and require higher doses of medication to achieve control of their disease, or have&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations, persistent symptoms and airway obstruction despite greater medication&#xD;
      use. These steroid-resistant asthmatics typically have greater morbidity and&#xD;
      disproportionately require 50-80% of asthma-related health care costs. The compromised state&#xD;
      of the lung in steroid-resistant asthma patients is similar to former smoker patients, for&#xD;
      which eosinophil presence in the lung is believed to be a major pro-inflammatory effector&#xD;
      cell in the pathogenesis of asthma. Further, in the United States, chronic lung disease&#xD;
      (primarily asthma) was the second most prevalent underlying condition in those admitted to&#xD;
      hospital for COVID-19 infection in adults ages 18-49.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIO is a safe, natural, salmon oil based, eosinophil effector function (EEF) reducing,&#xD;
      softgel formulation. Fish oil, inclusive of salmon oil, or marine-derived omega-3 supplements&#xD;
      have been established as cardioprotective. CARDIO has been studied in human clinical studies&#xD;
      for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and as an antioxidant, with an excellent safety&#xD;
      record. CARDIO has demonstrated therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic and&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions, particularly those involving eosinophil effector functions.&#xD;
      Specifically, CARDIO at 100 ug/ml inhibited eosinophil response to chemoattractant CCL11 in a&#xD;
      Shape Change assay; inhibited eosinophil response to chemoattractant CCL11 in an integrin&#xD;
      (CD11b) surface upregulation assay; and significantly enhanced apoptosis, in eosinophils&#xD;
      sourced from immuno-modulated individuals. Previous studies have shown that fish oil reduces&#xD;
      recruitment and infiltration of eosinophils into airways. Among the bioactive components in&#xD;
      fish oil, it has been demonstrated that the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has an inhibitory&#xD;
      effect on proliferation and migration of eosinophils. In vitro and animal dosing studies have&#xD;
      been completed for therapeutic dose determination for an accelerated Phase 2 trial&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, based on in vitro and in vivo studies, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that CARDIO may reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 by protecting&#xD;
      respiratory epithelium and alveolar pneumocytes from eosinophil-mediated damage. In light of&#xD;
      the mechanism of action outlined above, it is possible that CARDIO could be used as a&#xD;
      therapeutic for COVID-19 with the goal of preventing progression into severe disease and in&#xD;
      particular in preventing the need of a mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population being investigated are hospitalized patients, all with mild to moderate&#xD;
      respiratory distress due to COVID-19. Though the age has a reasonably wide range to&#xD;
      facilitate recruitment, the exclusions in place provide the required guidance measures to&#xD;
      ensure patient safety and address associated comorbidities. Individuals most prone to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalization as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection are those with&#xD;
      co-morbidities such as older age, cancer, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, type I or&#xD;
      II diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity and on immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatments. Therefore, participants with the above co-morbidities will comprise the&#xD;
      population of interest. However, in this context, each participant will be assessed on a&#xD;
      case-by-case basis by the Qualified Investigator to ensure all inclusions and none of the&#xD;
      exclusions are met, and that the safety of their participation in the study is critically&#xD;
      evaluated. The requirement of mild to moderate COVID-19 will be assessed using the most up-&#xD;
      to-date National Institutes of Health (NIH) Treatment Guidelines for the Clinical&#xD;
      Presentation of People with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Using the NIH guidelines for clinical&#xD;
      presentation of COVID-19 and identification of mild and moderate disease severity will ensure&#xD;
      potential patients are evaluated based on the most up-to-date information in the ever&#xD;
      changing COVID-19 research landscape. The safety of patients will be assessed at each&#xD;
      assessment day, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be established, and an interim&#xD;
      analysis is planned to guide safe continuation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this randomized, open-label study is to investigate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of CARDIO plus best standard-of-care in reducing the need for mechanical respiratory support,&#xD;
      alleviating respiratory symptoms and reducing mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      in patients who are hospitalized. The SPIRIT statement for protocols items for trials are&#xD;
      followed and the reporting will be done in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement.&#xD;
