  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid and an over-the-counter supplement that has shown promise in&#xD;
      clinical studies of stress-related disorders, such as anxiety, depression and posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD). Epidemiological studies suggest that patients with PTSD are at higher&#xD;
      risk of developing addiction, including alcohol use disorder (AUD).The following hypothesis&#xD;
      will be tested in this trial: pregnenolone is associated with a reduction in both PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms and the number of standard drinks per week in outpatients with PTSD and AUD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct an 8-week, non-randomized, open label trial of pregnenolone in 20&#xD;
      persons with PTSD and AUD. The study will serve as a pilot study to determine feasibility and&#xD;
      collect pilot data for NIH R01 proposals. All participants will be titrated to 800 mg/day of&#xD;
      pregnenolone over the course of 4 weeks and maintain this dose for the remainder of the&#xD;
      study. The study will consist of a screening visit to determine eligibility (Baseline I) and&#xD;
      a Baseline II visit where participants will receive study medication, and follow-up visits at&#xD;
      Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Participants will complete a variety of assessments at each study&#xD;
      visit, including clinician-rated and self-report measures of PTSD, alcohol use, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, cognitive performance, and side effects. Blood work will be done to ensure&#xD;
      participant health and safety prior to randomization into the study, as well as to assess&#xD;
      pregnenolone blood levels. All participants will meet with a study clinician at each visit to&#xD;
      monitor safety and assess any adverse events.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CAPS-5 is a 30-item questionnaire, corresponding to the DSM-5 diagnosis for PTSD. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Similarly, CAPS-5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster: Criterion B (items 1-5); Criterion C (items 6-7); Criterion D (items 8-14); and, Criterion E (items 15-20). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. The higher scores are associated with greater PTSD severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Standard alcoholic drinks per week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Followback will be used to assess the change in the number of standard alcoholic drinks per week. The TLFB will be administered by an interviewer and involves asking participants to retrospectively estimate their alcohol use 28 days prior to the first appointment and between each visit. The reported drinks are then converted to standard drinks based on the drink's alcohol by volume (ABV). The higher number is associated with more standard drinks and worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Timeline Followback (TLFB) heavy drinking days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Followback will be used to assess the change in the number of standard alcoholic drinks per week. The TLFB will be administered by an interviewer and involves asking participants to retrospectively estimate their alcohol use 28 days prior to the first appointment and between each visit. The reported drinks are then converted to heavy drinking days based on the drink's alcohol by volume (ABV) and participant's sex (male/female) - 5 drinks per day for males and 4 for females. Each day during which 4-5 drinks are consumed is counted as a heavy drinking day within a given assessment period. The higher number is associated with more heavy drinking days and worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SAFTEE is a side effect self-report assessment scale that consists of 56 potential side effects. Participants rate how bothersome each side effect is on a scale of &quot;none&quot; (0), &quot;mild&quot; (1), &quot;moderate&quot; (2), &quot;severe&quot; (3). The higher total score (all items summed together) indicates a higher level of side effect burden.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-rated PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. The self-report rating scale is 0-4 for each symptom, reflecting a change from 1-5 in the DSM-IV version. Rating scale descriptors correspond to &quot;Not at all&quot; (0), &quot;A little bit&quot; (1), &quot;Moderately&quot; (2), &quot;Quite a bit&quot; (3), and &quot;Extremely&quot; (4).A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items. The higher score is associated with poorer outcome.</description>
