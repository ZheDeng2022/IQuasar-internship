  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational study aimed at evaluating the incidence of familial AML/MDSs in patients with&#xD;
      de novo MDSs or AML with almost one relative affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other&#xD;
      cancers at young age (&lt; 40 years)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational study aims to collect&#xD;
      clinical information on patients with familial AML/MDSs from January 2014 to December 2022.&#xD;
      No intervention is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the patients with familial MDSs or&#xD;
      AML (i.e. with relatives affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers at young age&#xD;
      (&lt; 40 years)) or presence of signs, symptoms or laboratory tests compatible with one of the&#xD;
      known syndromes with germinal susceptibility to AML/MDSs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to estimate the incidence of familial AML/MDSs, a survey will be sent every year to&#xD;
      all participating sites to collect only the number of the all diagnosis of AML/MDS. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed until December 2023 in order to have at least 1 year of&#xD;
      observation.&#xD;
