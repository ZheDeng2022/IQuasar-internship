  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This smartphone-based personalized multiple intervention study aims to prevent cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and reduce dementia and cerebrovascular events in 45-74 year old persons with high&#xD;
      risk of stroke in China. The investigators plan to monitor and manage participants'&#xD;
      behavioral and health (vascular risk factors control, sleep quality, mental health and&#xD;
      cognitive training) based on self-monitoring and personalized feedback via smartphone app.&#xD;
      The short-term primary outcome is 1-year change in global cognitive score measured by a&#xD;
      modified National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Canadian Stroke&#xD;
      Network-Canadian Stroke Network protocol. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention&#xD;
      based on self-monitoring and personalized feedback will prevent cognitive decline by the&#xD;
      initial 1-year intervention. The long-term primary outcome is the development of dementia and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events during a total of 5 years' follow-up. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the smartphone-based personalized multiple intervention may reduce the 5-year risk of&#xD;
      dementia and cerebrovascular events, mainly through the improvement in vascular risk factors&#xD;
      control, sleep quality, mental health and cognitive training activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ≥ 3 stroke risk factors (including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or valvular heart disease, smoking history, obvious overweight or obesity, lack&#xD;
      of exercise, family history of stroke), or with transient ischemic attack, are regarded as&#xD;
      patients with high risk of stroke. Studies have indicated that these stroke risk factors&#xD;
      might be associated with an increased risk of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) progress,&#xD;
      glymphatic dysfunction, cognitive decline, dementia, and cerebrovascular events. However,&#xD;
      prevention in these patients is largely unknown and the management of these patients is a&#xD;
      very troublesome issue. Previous study has demonstrated that interventions in the feedback&#xD;
      and monitoring method could improve exercise adherence in older people compared with other&#xD;
      methods including comparison of behavior, social support, natural consequences, identity and&#xD;
      goals and planning. Therefore, the investigators plan to monitor and manage vascular risk&#xD;
      factors control, sleep quality, mental health and cognitive training based on self-monitoring&#xD;
      and personalized feedback on a smartphone app in patients with high risk of stroke. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the intervention based on self-monitoring and personalized&#xD;
      feedback will reduce cognitive impairment, glymphatic dysfunction, CSVD progress, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, anxious symptoms, improve sleep quality, and reduce dementia and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      events incidence in the study group compared to the control group.&#xD;
