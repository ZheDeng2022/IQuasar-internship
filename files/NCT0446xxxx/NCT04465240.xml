  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study, named THRIVE (The Research In Virtual Environments Study), is to&#xD;
      test hypotheses for how neighborhood environments influence stress and emotion, as a&#xD;
      mechanism by which they may influence health. Neighborhood environments may have both acute&#xD;
      influences on stress-related processes, but also may have lifespan effects due to the&#xD;
      chronic, cumulative effects of repeated exposures and the long-term toll of adapting to&#xD;
      adverse neighborhood environments. However, assessing neighborhood influences on stress and&#xD;
      emotion is methodologically challenging. This study develops such a novel, alternative&#xD;
      approach to address these questions by deploying a virtual reality (VR) based model of&#xD;
      neighborhood disadvantage and affluence that creates an immersive experience approximating&#xD;
      the experience of being in different neighborhoods. In this study, this model will be applied&#xD;
      to understand neighborhood effects in a diverse sample of adolescents (n = 130) from a range&#xD;
      of disadvantaged and affluent neighborhoods. The proposed study will employ a randomized&#xD;
      experiment (n = 65 per condition), with online questionnaires and a single study session, to&#xD;
      determine (a) if virtual exposure to neighborhood disadvantage elicits differences in emotion&#xD;
      and stress reactivity; (2) if growing up in a disadvantaged neighborhood results in&#xD;
      habituation or sensitization to different neighborhood characteristics; and (3) if chronic&#xD;
      stress results in habituation or sensitization to different neighborhood characteristics.&#xD;
      This research will develop an innovative methodology that will help establish the role that&#xD;
      neighborhoods may play in eliciting stress as well as the processes of adaptation to chronic&#xD;
      stress and chronic neighborhood exposures. In addition, it will help establish a method that&#xD;
      can be utilized more broadly to study contextual and social environmental influences on&#xD;
      psychological and biological risk in adolescence.&#xD;
