  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the ability and amount of fluciclovine positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging needed to recognize tumors that have come back (recurrence) after&#xD;
      brain injury from radiation therapy (radionecrosis) in patients with intracranial disease&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). F-18 fluciclovine is a radiotracer&#xD;
      that works by accumulating in tumor cells, making it easier to detect tumors. The results of&#xD;
      this study may also help investigators understand all the ways that F-18 fluciclovine may&#xD;
      affect patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the static fluciclovine F18 (fluciclovine) PET imaging tumor-to-background&#xD;
      ratios (TBRmax; TBRmean) which distinguish true tumor recurrence from radionecrosis in&#xD;
      patients with intracranial metastatic disease previously treated with radiation therapy, and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggesting recurrent disease, using histopathology&#xD;
      as proof of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine static fluciclovine PET standardized uptake value (SUV)peak, SUVmean values&#xD;
      and metabolic tumor volumes (MTV) which distinguish true tumor recurrence from radionecrosis&#xD;
      in patients with MRI findings suggesting recurrent disease, using serial MRI as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine early dynamic fluciclovine PET time activity curve values which distinguish&#xD;
      true tumor recurrence from radionecrosis in patients with MRI findings suggesting recurrent&#xD;
      disease, using histopathology or serial MRI as a marker of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate the determined static fluciclovine PET SUVpeak, SUVmean, TBRmax, TBRmean,&#xD;
      and MTV values with progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In patients with true tumor progression, SUV values will be correlated with Ki67 staining&#xD;
      on final pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fluciclovine intravenously (IV) and undergo brain dynamic PET/MRI imaging&#xD;
      over 50 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
