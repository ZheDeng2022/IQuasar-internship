    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, open-label, fixed sequence, two-period pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and relative systemic bioavailability of topical and oral&#xD;
      tofacitinib formulations in approximately 14 healthy subjects. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      single oral dose of tofacitinib 5 mg tablet in Period 1 of the study followed by a 7-day&#xD;
      washout period. In Period 2, participants will receive repeat administration of Tofacitinib&#xD;
      Citrate Topical Gel 3.2% BID for 14 days.&#xD;
