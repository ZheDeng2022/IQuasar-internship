  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to prospectively collect information about the operative time and&#xD;
      intraoperative radiation experienced by patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion&#xD;
      procedures guided by the MvIGS spine navigation system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective case series to assess the use of the Machine-vision&#xD;
      Image Guided Surgery (MvIGS) spine navigation system for treatment of spinal stenosis,&#xD;
      scoliosis, and spondylolisthesis that requires fusion. This is a single-arm, open-label&#xD;
      study. All participants will undergo their single and multi-level posterior spine fusion&#xD;
      surgery using bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation under MvIGS intraoperative navigation&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Machine-vision Image Guided Surgery (MvIGS) spine navigation system.</intervention_name>
    <description>The intended use of the MvIGS navigation system is to provide high quality intraoperative imaging with no radiation exposure. Use of the proprietary integrated surgical light with embedded tracking technology and Flashâ„¢ registration allows for continuous and direct visualization of the surgical field. The MvIGS system is exempt from IDE regulations as the device cleared Premarket Notification FDA-510(k) (K162375). The device includes:&#xD;
A single mobile cart with a boom arm and an integrated surgical light with embedded tracking technology (P/N 10-0001);&#xD;
Proprietary imaging software (P/N 60-0007); and,&#xD;
Kit of tacked surgical instruments including a spine reference clamp, awl tip, pedicle probe (P/N 11-0006).</description>
