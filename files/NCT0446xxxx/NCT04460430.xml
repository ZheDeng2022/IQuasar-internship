  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HR+/HER2-negative BC represent ∼70% of all newly diagnosed breast tumours and are responsible&#xD;
      for most recurrences and deaths due to this disease, and despite available standard&#xD;
      therapies, ∼15-20% of hormone tumours recur at distant sites. As BC is a clinically and&#xD;
      biologically heterogeneous disease, intrincsic subtype may play an important role in&#xD;
      classifying patients. In this case, HER2-E subtype is present in approximately 6.6-11.0% of&#xD;
      HR+/HER2-negative tumors and might express either HER2, estrogen receptor (ER) or&#xD;
      progesterone receptor (PR), we also know that HER2-E is present twice as much in metastatic&#xD;
      tumors compared to primary tumors and that HER2-E patients may benefit in terms of PFS form&#xD;
      an anti-HER2 drug as was showed using retrospective sample in EGF30008 trial. Therefore,&#xD;
      incorporation of novel drugs in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) can improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes in HR+/HER2-negative BC advanced disease specially in those with HER2-E subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods NEREA is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II study evaluating treatment&#xD;
      with neratinib in combination with ET in pre and post-menopausal women and men with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic HER2-enriched (HER2-E), HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer who had&#xD;
      recurrence or progression while receiving previous ET (either aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen&#xD;
      or fulvestrant) in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease or both. The study will&#xD;
      follow a Simon's 2-stage design with one interim and one final efficacy analysis. The primary&#xD;
      objective will is assess the efficacy of neratinib in combination with ET is this group of&#xD;
      patients, efficacy will be measured as Progression-Free Survival at 6 months (PFS6) defined&#xD;
      as the proportion of patients alive and without progression, locally assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator through the use of RECIST v.1.1 at 24 weeks after first treatment&#xD;
      administration, imaging evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks for the first 12 months&#xD;
      following treatment start, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      Clinical Benefit Rate at 6 months , Overall Response rate, Duration of response, Time to&#xD;
      response and Incidence, duration and severity of Adverse Events. The interim analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted when 33 patients are evaluable for the primary endpoint having the potential for at&#xD;
      least 3 'on treatment' disease assessment scans. If less than 15 patients achieved a PFS6,&#xD;
      the trial will be terminated for futility in favor of the null hypothesis. If more than 28&#xD;
      patients achieved a PFS6, the trial will be stopped in favor of the alternative hypothesis&#xD;
      demonstrating activity. If none of the two above-mentioned conditions are attain, up to a&#xD;
      further 23 patients may be evaluated, for at least a total of 56 evaluable patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, if a total of 28 or more patients achieved a PFS6 at the end of the second stage,&#xD;
      then the null will be rejected in favor of the alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive neratinib 240 mg every day in combination with ET, with either&#xD;
      exemestane, fulvestrant or tamoxifen: exemestane 25 mg every day orally, tamoxifen 20mg every&#xD;
      day orally or fulvestrant 500 mg administered in two intramuscular injections of 250 mg each&#xD;
      at C1D15 and at D1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle at investigator discretion. LHRH agonist&#xD;
      will be used in men and premenopausal women if no oophorectomy has been performed previously.&#xD;
      All patients will take prophylactic loperamide with a stablished doses scheme during the firs&#xD;
      cycle and on demand in subsequent cycles&#xD;

             regimen for advanced disease). The tumor tissue should be of good quality based on&#xD;
             total and viable tumor content and must be evaluated centrally for PAM50 analysis&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Patients whose tumor tissue is not evaluable for central testing&#xD;
             are not eligible unless a biopsy from metastatic lesion is performed for this purpose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  * Measurable disease or non-measurable (but evaluable), as defined by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
             (Note: Previously irradiated lesions can be considered as measurable disease only if&#xD;
             disease progression has been unequivocally documented at that site since radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% measured by echocardiography&#xD;
