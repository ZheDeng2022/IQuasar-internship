  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For metastatic/advanced NSCLC patients who do not have targetable mutations, either&#xD;
      immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/L1) pathway alone or in&#xD;
      combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy is now a standard of care. However, still&#xD;
      about half of the patients do not benefit due to treatment resistance. It is therefore&#xD;
      critically important to find novel therapies and combinations to benefit patients who have&#xD;
      failed or are intolerant to 1st line immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesizes that ipatasertib in combination with taxane (e.g. docetaxel) can be&#xD;
      an effective strategy. Ipatasertib is a novel adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive&#xD;
      inhibitor that has demonstrated robust and selective targeting of protein kinase B (PKB, also&#xD;
      known as AKT) in cancer patients. Importantly, evidence from preclinical studies has&#xD;
      demonstrated that AKT inhibitors (e.g. ipatasertib) can enhance the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy via modulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3'K)-AKT activity.&#xD;
