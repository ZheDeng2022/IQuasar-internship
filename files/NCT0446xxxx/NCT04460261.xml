  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a prospective and experimental study. Geriatric individuals (age â‰¥&#xD;
      65 years) with COPD and non-COPD were included in the study. Training program was identical&#xD;
      for both groups and consisted of 4 weeks of foundation IMT followed by 4 weeks of functional&#xD;
      IMT. Respiratory muscle strength, symptoms, exercise capacity, balance, postural control,&#xD;
      physical activity and quality of life were evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is one of the most&#xD;
      important causes of worldwide mortality and morbidity, increases with age and the disease&#xD;
      worsens with the effects of aging. The effects of COPD are not only limited to the lungs, it&#xD;
      also affects other organs and systems, causing loss of strength in the respiratory muscles.&#xD;
      Respiratory muscles are the skeletal muscles that must maintain their continuous activities&#xD;
      for the continuity of life. Just like other skeletal muscles, the respiratory muscles can&#xD;
      also be trained based on the principles of exercise. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is an&#xD;
      exercise method used in both patients with COPD and the elderly population. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that IMT has positive effects in COPD and elderly individuals. However, in all these&#xD;
      studies IMT applications (also known as &quot;foundation or conventional IMT&quot;) focus only on the&#xD;
      respiratory task of the respiratory muscles. Nevertheless, in addition to their basic task of&#xD;
      respiration, respiratory muscles are also involved in core stabilization and postural&#xD;
      control.The aim of this study was to create an integrated IMT program for geriatric&#xD;
      individuals with and without COPD and investigate its effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were divided into two groups as individuals with and without COPD. A total&#xD;
      of 8 weeks of IMT was applied for both groups using a threshold pressure loading device The&#xD;
      participants were asked to perform IMT twice a day in the morning and evening. Both groups&#xD;
      were trained 3 days a week under the supervision of a physiotherapist and other days of the&#xD;
      week without a supervisor. The treatment program consisted of 4 weeks of foundation IMT&#xD;
      followed by 4 weeks of functional IMT.The intensity of the exercise was adjusted to 40-50% of&#xD;
      the MIP. After 10 consecutive breathing cycles, the participants were asked to perform 3-4&#xD;
      breathe controls. As the tolerance increased, consecutive respiratory cycles were increased.&#xD;
      The intensity of MIP was adjusted by weekly MIP measurements. Currently, foundation IMT is&#xD;
      commonly used to train respiratory muscles. In the present study, foundation IMT was applied&#xD;
      during the first 4 weeks of training. The participants were asked to sit in a comfortable&#xD;
      upright position. Then the nose clip was placed, and the patients were instructed to tighten&#xD;
      their lips around the mouthpiece and breathe against the resistance. During this 4-week-long&#xD;
      training, all IMT applications were performed solely in a sitting position, without any&#xD;
      loading in other positions. Following the foundation IMT, all participants underwent four&#xD;
      weeks of functional IMT. Initially, all participants were taught diaphragmatic breathing and&#xD;
      activating abdominal wall musculature. Each training session started with warm-up exercises&#xD;
      and ended with cool-down exercises. During the loading phase, core stability, dynamic trunk&#xD;
      activation and postural control exercises were applied together with IMT.&#xD;
