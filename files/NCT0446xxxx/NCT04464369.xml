    <textblock>
      No instrument is available for the assessment of the symptoms in patients suffering from&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia - postprandial distress syndrome patients - PDS. Indeed PDS is an unmet&#xD;
      clinical need in drug development. To do so, the development of suitable endpoints for its&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After interviews of patients suffering from PDS (Focus groups) and identification of the&#xD;
      emerging symptoms a draft version of the Leuven Postprandial Distress Scale (LPDS)&#xD;
      questionnaire has been designed. This study will assess the reliability of the scoring rule,&#xD;
      the construct validity and ability to detect change of the draft LPDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 100 PDS patients will be randomised in two arms receiving respectively either&#xD;
      Itopride 100 mg tid or Placebo tid during 8 weeks. Patients of both arms will be tested with&#xD;
      LPDS using daily diary cards and by anchor questionnaires (PAGI-SYM, OSS, OTE) at baseline&#xD;
      and during the study drug administration period.&#xD;

      2.3 Study design After review of the literature, identification of the intended population&#xD;
      (PDS patients with the lowest EPS component), it has been decided that the conceptual&#xD;
      framework for the instrument will be based on the motility subscales of DSSI assessing the&#xD;
      severity of the symptoms on 5 point Likert Scale (0-4; no symptom, mild, moderate, severe,&#xD;
      very severe). After interview of patients suffering from PDS (Focus groups) and&#xD;
      identification of the emerging symptoms a draft version of LPDS questionnaire has been&#xD;
      designed. This study will assess the reliability of the scoring rule, the construct validity&#xD;
      and ability to detect change of the draft LPDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 100 PDS patients will be randomised in two arms receiving respectively either&#xD;
      Itopride 100 mg tid or Placebo tid during 8 weeks. Patients of both arms will be tested with&#xD;
      LPDS using daily diary cards and by PAGI-SYM, SF-NDI, OSS, OTE at baseline and during the&#xD;
      study drug administration period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility (2w) Randomisation Study drug administration (8w)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Placebo tid (LPDS, OTE, OSS, PAGI-SYM, SF-NDI) Eligible patients Group 2 Itopride 100&#xD;
      mg tid (LPDS, OTE, OSS, PAGI-SYM, SF-NDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Interventional study for LPDS responsiveness. This study will be a multicentre randomized&#xD;
      multiple-assessed, placebo-controlled parallel-group study of Itopride 100 mg tid in PDS. The&#xD;
      rationale to use Itopride is the lack of efficient treatment for FD. Itopride was extensively&#xD;
      used in FD trials and is prescribed in clinical practice in several parts of the world. The&#xD;
      treatment period for evaluation of LPDS responsiveness will be 8 weeks after a 2 week&#xD;
      eligibility period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will assess the severity of their symptoms using the new LPDS questionnaire adapted&#xD;
      from the conceptual framework. This will be done through daily paper diaries. Assumingly, the&#xD;
      diaries will include ratings of PDS symptoms, EPS symptoms, bloating, nausea and belching. In&#xD;
      addition, patients will fill out OSS, PAGI-SYM and SF-NDI questionnaires at the end of the&#xD;
      run-in period, and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. They will also fill out OTE after&#xD;
      2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. (See these different questionnaires and the rationale to&#xD;
      use them in annex)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, patients will be proposed to enter an open label period of one month&#xD;
      (Itopride 100 mg tid). This open label period is not part of the study and has been&#xD;
      associated for the benefit of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Assessment of symptom severity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual symptom severity (hypothesized for LPDS) will be assessed in daily diaries using a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - No symptom&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Mild (Symptom is present but is not bothersome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Moderate (Symptom is present and bothersome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Severe (Symptom interferes with normal activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Very severe (Normal activity is not possible)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall symptom severity assessment (OSS) questionnaire (with 1 week recall):&#xD;
&#xD;
      What was the overall severity of your stomach symptoms during the past week? (Please select&#xD;
      one answer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very mild&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very severe&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Treatment Evaluation (OTE) questionnaire (with 1 week recall):&#xD;
&#xD;
      When thinking about the last week, how have your stomach symptoms have been (compared to your&#xD;
      condition before you started this treatment)? (please select one answer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extremely better&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Much better&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somewhat better&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A little better&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About the same&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A little worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somewhat worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Much worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extremely worse&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAGI-SYM and SF-NFI are more complex and described in the literature&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients who are capable to understand the study and the questionnaires, and to comply&#xD;
             with the study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
             At visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients suffering from active PDS (Rome III) as per LPDS scoring system (See Focus&#xD;
             Group study) during 2 weeks before randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        At visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the&#xD;
             patient unsuitable for entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with any major psychiatric disorder (including those with a major&#xD;
             psychosomatic element to their gastrointestinal disease), depression, alcohol or&#xD;
             substance abuse in the last 2 years. Patients suffering from one psychiatric trouble&#xD;
             stabilised for six month by the administration of one drug (Not amitryptiline) are&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients presenting with predominant symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient with predominant symptoms of GERD according to GERD questionnaire (Two &quot;yes&quot;&#xD;
             answer to question 21)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients suffering from diabetes type 1 or type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients taking medications for the treatment of their upper digestive symptoms:&#xD;
             prokinetics and acid suppressants (PPIs). A wash-out is allowed if medically indicated&#xD;
             (E.g.: lack of efficacy or side-effects). This wash-out is minimum two weeks for the&#xD;
             patients taking PPIs*&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with well-known hypersensitivity to gastroprokinetic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with confirmed gastro-intestinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with former digestive surgery affecting the gut motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Many patients take PPIs in absence of efficient treatment. In the literature,&#xD;
                  PPIs appear effective in patients suffering from substantial concomitant&#xD;
                  heartburn that is not allowed for inclusion in this study. In this context, a&#xD;
                  medically indicated wash-out and the proposal of a therapeutic alternative is&#xD;
                  appropriate.&#xD;
