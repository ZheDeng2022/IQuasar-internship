  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous systems that results&#xD;
      in focal inflammatory lesions and then diffuse and degenerative inflammatory phenomena. It is&#xD;
      considered to be the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment is a common and disabling part of MS. Studies carried out in the years&#xD;
      1990-2000 estimated their frequency to be between 40 and 60% of MS patients: they reflect the&#xD;
      natural history of the disease. Effective treatments for the inflammatory component of the&#xD;
      disease that are now available may have led to a reduction in their frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive disorders were identified at an early stage of the disease and affect certain areas&#xD;
      preferentially:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most common achievement is the reduction in the speed of information processing. It&#xD;
           is present from the early stage of the disease. Progressive deterioration over time is&#xD;
           observed, which is a prognostic factor for long-term cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term memory was impaired in 40-65% of patients in historical cohorts. More specifically,&#xD;
      encoding and retrieval were affected, with storage and consolidation being preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The attainment of executive functions is also common.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phonemic and semantic fluency are also disturbed in MS patients. Among cognitive&#xD;
           impairments, language impairment has been little studied in MS: in 2016 only 22&#xD;
           controlled studies were identified. The assessments carried out were most often partial,&#xD;
           making it impossible to define the characteristics or to conclude that specific&#xD;
           linguistic impairments are independent of other cognitive impairments. Finally, recent&#xD;
           studies suggest that the frequency of language impairment in MS may be underestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems important to assess the prevalence of language disorders in a large&#xD;
      cohort of patients with RRMS or MS, and to characterize these disorders by identifying the&#xD;
      linguistic processes involved and the brain substrates involved. This will make it possible&#xD;
      to envisage the implementation of more systematic screening for language disorders in MS and&#xD;
      to improve patient management, in particular by developing targeted rehabilitation protocols.&#xD;

      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis and Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental tasks based on psycholinguistics and functional MRI are not standardized tests.&#xD;
      To be able to interpret the results of patients, they must therefore be compared with healthy&#xD;
      controls of the same age (+/-3 years) and level of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require the inclusion of cases and controls matched to these cases on the&#xD;
      above characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are seen in consultation or day hospitalization and who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      non-inclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Accompanying persons accompanying patients &quot;matching&quot; with included patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will also be offered the opportunity to participate in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit (D0) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of the HAD self-questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signature of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of socio-demographic data to adjust standardized test results (age, gender,&#xD;
           socio-economic and education level)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of the computerized ECVB self-questionnaire with the help of a clinical&#xD;
           research technician: only for cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scheduling of the HDJ assessment day (maximum 6 months after the inclusion visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (assessment in HDJ) (D0 + 6 months maximum) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological examination of the patient and performance of an EDSS if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery of standardised and normalised tests evaluating different cognitive functions&#xD;
           (Annexes 1 and 2 to 9): only for cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental language tasks (see description in section 6): for cases and controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-injected structural and functional encephalic MRI: only for cases with language&#xD;
           impairment detected in the examination battery (and their matched controls)&#xD;
