      HSCT has been implemented in (inter)national treatment guidelines for diffuse cutaneous&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) and is offered in clinical care and reimbursed by national health&#xD;
      insurance in several European countries. However, data and specific guidelines on the best&#xD;
      timing of HSCT in the course of dcSSc are lacking. In particular, it is unclear whether HSCT&#xD;
      should be positioned as upfront therapy or as rescue treatment for patients not responding to&#xD;
      conventional immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentre, randomized, open label trial aims to compare two treatment strategies used&#xD;
      in usual care: upfront autologous HSCT versus usual care with (intravenous (i.v.)&#xD;

      Rationale: This multicentre, randomized, open label trial aims to compare two treatment&#xD;
      strategies used in usual care: upfront autologous HSCT versus usual care with (intravenous&#xD;
      (i.v.) cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse thera-py followed by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and HSCT&#xD;
      as rescue option). HSCT has been implemented in (inter)national treatment guidelines for&#xD;
      diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) and is offered in clinical care and reimbursed&#xD;
      by national health insurance in several European countries. However, data and specific&#xD;
      guidelines on the best timing of HSCT in the course of dcSSc are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, it is unclear whether HSCT should be positioned as upfront therapy or as&#xD;
      rescue treatment for patients not responding to conventional im-munosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
      Given the risks and costs associated with HSCT, it may be preferable to evaluate the&#xD;
      patient's response to immunosuppressive therapy before proceeding to HSCT. Considering HSCT&#xD;
      as a rescue treatment could significantly delay the need for a potentially harmful treatment&#xD;
      and may be an efficient approach from a health economic perspective as HSCT is a highly&#xD;
      specialized, resource intensive and expensive medical procedure. On the other hand, in the&#xD;
      time frame needed to evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive therapy, pulmonary and cardiac&#xD;
      involvement may develop, negatively influencing a patient's prognosis and possibly leading to&#xD;
      a contra-indication for HSCT. We hypothesize that upfront HSCT results in less toxicity and&#xD;
      medical costs in the long run. Therefore, we propose a multicentre randomized open label&#xD;
      trial in chemotherapy naive patients with early dcSSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the optimal treatment strategy in early dcSSc: the effect of HSCT as&#xD;
      upfront therapy compared with that of immunosuppressive medication in early dcSSc, with&#xD;
      respect to survival and prevention of major organ failure (referred to as 'event-free&#xD;
      survival' which is considered as primary endpoint), safety and the impact on skin thickening,&#xD;
      visceral involvement, functional status, and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals are to evaluate (in both treatment arms) whether disease activity correlates&#xD;
      with immunological parameters, including immunopathology of skin, immune reconstitution, and&#xD;
      autoantibodies. We will also de-termine the cost-effectiveness of HSCT as first line&#xD;
      treatment versus usual care and try to identify factors associated with response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This investigation is an international multicentre, prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      open label trial com-paring two treatment strategies used in regular care: upfront autologous&#xD;
      HSCT versus immunosuppressive thera-py with i.v. CYC pulse therapy followed by MMF and HSCT&#xD;
      as rescue option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients aged between 18 - 65 years with an established diagnosis of dcSSc&#xD;
      according to the ACR/EULAR criteria. Patients disease duration (non-Raynaud's symptoms)&#xD;
      should be ≤ 2 years and mRSS ≥ 15 (diffuse skin pattern) and /or clinically significant organ&#xD;
      involvement (heart and lung involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One group (A) receives upfront autologous HSCT and the other group (B) receives&#xD;
      12 monthly i.v. pulses CYC (750 mg/m2), followed by at least 12 months of oral MMF (max 3&#xD;
      grams daily) at one year after start of treatment. Rescue therapy may be considered in both&#xD;
      arms in case of insufficient response or clinically relevant flare, but preferably not within&#xD;
      the first 6 months after randomisation. For patients from Arm A methotrexate, mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil or mycophenolic acid, or rituximab can be (re)instituted, according to local&#xD;
      preference. Based on earlier studies, the clinical benefits of i.v. pulse cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      may take between 6-12 months. Therefore it is recommended to then switch patients from arm B&#xD;
      to HSCT only in case of rapidly progressive disease, which is arbitrarily defined as ≥30%&#xD;
      increase in mRSS or ≥20% relative decline in FVC, TLC, or DLCO predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is event-free survival after&#xD;
      randomisation/treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints: Overall Survival (OS), progression-free survival, number of&#xD;
      participants that need rescue therapy (i.e. the alternative treatment) due to treatment&#xD;
      failure. Treatment related mortality, treatment toxicity, and changes in mRSS, FVC, TLC and&#xD;
      DLCO, nailfold microscopy, immunological markers in skin and blood, cardiac MR and 18FDG-PET.&#xD;
      The CRISS at 12 months. Safety and tolerability outcomes according to CTC-criteria (CTCAE&#xD;
      v5.0). Patient reported outcomes at 12 and 24 months include: Quality of life (EQ-5D), SHAQ,&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal complaints (UCL SCTC GIT 2.0), sexual functioning.&#xD;

    <description>The American College of Rheumatology Composite Response Index in Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (ACR CRISS) was developed using expert consensus and data driven approaches for use in clinical trials (Khanna et al, 2016).&#xD;
The exponential algorithm determines the predicted probability of improvement from baseline, incorporating change in the mRSS, FVC percent predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and HAQ-DI. The outcome is a continuous variable between 0.0 and 1.0 (0 - 100%). A higher score indicates greater improvement. Subjects are not considered improved (ACR CRISS score = 0) if they develop new: 1) renal crisis; 2) decline in FVC% predicted by 15% (relative) from baseline and confirmed after 1 month; or 3) left ventricular failure (systolic ejection fraction &lt; 45%); or 4) new pulmonary artery hypertension on right heart catheterization requiring treatment.</description>

    <description>Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) The MRSS is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin induration. It is correlated with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral involvement, especially in early disease2, 4. It is scored on a 0 (normal) to 3+ (severe induration) ordinal scales over 17 body areas, with a maximum score of 51 and is used to categorize severity of SSc. Minimally clinically significant difference in MRSS is 3-5 points (Amjadi et al., American College of Rheumatology; Aug 2009; 2493-2494) It has been extensively used as primary/ secondary outcome in RCT with Scleroderma.

The evaluation of the images will be done centrally. The NFS-findings will be described standardly according to the consensus of the EULAR study group on microcirculation in rheumatic diseases. As such, the images will be evaluated in a quantitative (density, di-mension, morphology and presence of haemorrhages) and a qualitative way (normal, aspecific abnormalities, early/active/late scleroderma pattern). As we will analyse 16 NFS-images per subject, an overall qualitative as-sessment per subject will be assigned, based on the most prevalent pattern per subject.</description>

    <description>The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 is a standardized set of outcome measures developed through literature review, patient focus groups and cognitive debriefing among patients with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, other common gastrointestinal disorders, SSc, and a census-based US general population control sample (Khanna et al, 2009). The scale consists of eight domains relating to gastroesophageal reflux (13 items), disrupted swallowing (7 items), diarrhea (5 items), bowel incontinence/soilage (4 items), nausea and vomiting (4 items), constipation (9 items), belly pain (6 items), and gas/bloat/flatulence (12 items).
