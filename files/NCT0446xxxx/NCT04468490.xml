  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a frequent symptom in cancer patients with a negative impact on the quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL).Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is defined as &quot;a transient exacerbation of pain,&#xD;
      manifesting spontaneously or related to a specific predictable or unpredictable triggering&#xD;
      factor, despite stable and adequately controlled basal pain&quot;. The present study assesses the&#xD;
      percentage of patients who are treated according to the European guidelines (ESMO, 2018) for&#xD;
      BTcP management in 4 European countries and the impact of the adherence to guidelines on&#xD;
      patients' pain relief and QoL.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typical BTcP episodes are of short duration (15-30 minutes/episode), moderate to severe&#xD;
      intensity and rapid onset (maximum peak between 3-15 minutes). The best management of BTcP&#xD;
      requires a thorough evaluation to tailor the treatment strategies. Indeed, patients with&#xD;
      breakthrough pain should have this pain specifically assessed, starting from the appropriate&#xD;
      diagnosis. Recently developed European guidelines support this approach and recommend&#xD;
      treating BTcP using rapid-onset opioids (ROOs), with pharmacodynamics that mirror the quick&#xD;
      start and short duration of the pain episode.Nevertheless, despite the drug treatment for&#xD;
      BTcP has undergone knowledge advances in recent years and several guidelines have been&#xD;
      published, this condition is still often inadequately managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will assess the percentage of patients who are treated according to the&#xD;
      European guidelines for BTcP management in 4 European countries and the impact of the&#xD;
      adherence to guidelines on patients' pain relief and QoL.&#xD;
