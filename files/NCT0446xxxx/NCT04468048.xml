      Conscious sedation (CS) if often used in the field of gastroenterology to alleviate pain and&#xD;
      discomfort with interventional procedures. Although CS is relatively safe, there is concern&#xD;
      for the development of cardiopulmonary complications. Music has been shown in multiple&#xD;
      studies to decrease anxiety and improve patient satisfaction following cardiac, pulmonary,&#xD;
      and surgical procedures. This is a prospective single-blinded randomized control trial that&#xD;
      will examine the effects of active music participation and music listening on patients&#xD;
      undergoing colonoscopy through propofol use (monitored anesthesia) at The Brooklyn Hospital&#xD;
      Center. The study will enroll patients who will undergo colonoscopy from November 2018 to&#xD;
      April 2019 and randomize them to receive music or no music starting at the initial nursing&#xD;
      evaluation in the pre-procedure area. We hypothesize that incorporating music during&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedures will alleviate patient discomfort, reduce narcotic/sedative usage and&#xD;
      post-operative complications.&#xD;

      Introduction Conscious sedation (CS) in the field of gastroenterology is commonly&#xD;
      incorporated in order to alleviate pain and discomfort associated with interventional&#xD;
      procedures. The use of CS to combat patient anxiety has been well documented [1]. Although CS&#xD;
      is relatively safe, it is not immune to cardiopulmonary complications. Multiple studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a clear correlation between advancing age and procedure related complications&#xD;
      [2-4]. It is also important to note that despite the lack of association between age and&#xD;
      additional complications in a study conducted by Clarke et al, a third of their patients did&#xD;
      not receive sedation/narcotic medications [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, which affects approximately two third of the U.S. population, has a myriad of health&#xD;
      related risks and has been shown to contribute to the overall complications associated with&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures [6]. Because those who are obese and overweight have higher than normal&#xD;
      BMIs, BMI should not be ignored when assessing cardiopulmonary complications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing endoscopic procedures. Moreover, a study by Qadeer et al. revealed that patients&#xD;
      with high BMIs were more likely to experience hypoxic episodes [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Sharma et al. (2007) looked at more than 300,000 patients who underwent endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures while monitoring their risk factors for cardiopulmonary complications [4]. Older&#xD;
      age, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) grade value &gt;2, inpatient procedures, and&#xD;
      involvement of trainee with procedure were all shown to be associated with cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      complications. In addition, another study by Bini et al.(2003) illustrated that the age of a&#xD;
      patient, comorbid conditions, month of procedure (July and August), and midazolam dose were&#xD;
      linked with increased negative outcomes [2]. The correlation between complication rate during&#xD;
      procedures along with the year of the trainee conducting the procedure indirectly&#xD;
      demonstrated the complications in the new academic year (July and August). Understanding that&#xD;
      sedation during endoscopic procedures incurs significant risks particularly in patients who&#xD;
      are underweight, obese or have numerous comorbidities can lead to steps aimed at better&#xD;
      managing the aforementioned risks and reducing patient discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music has been shown in many studies to decrease anxiety and improve patient satisfaction&#xD;
      during and after procedures in cardiac, pulmonary and surgical procedures [7-16]. In regards&#xD;
      to endoscopies, one hundred and eighty patients who were listening to music prior to&#xD;
      endoscopic procedure had a significant reduction in stress compared to controls [17]. A&#xD;
      similar type of study performed by Hayes et al. (year) revealed that music resulted in a&#xD;
      statistically significant decrease in the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) levels of patients&#xD;
      undergoing an endoscopy [18] . In another study, music was played prior to and during&#xD;
      procedure with no sedative/narcotic medications [19] . Patients with music experienced a&#xD;
      decrease in blood pressure (BP) and RR compared to their counterparts who did not listen to&#xD;
      music. A 3 point attitude scale showed that patients with music had less discomfort,&#xD;
      illustrating that music has the potential to modulate physiological parameters. An&#xD;
      instrumental composition from the album &quot;Nada Himalaya&quot; performed by S.G. Sachchidananda, was&#xD;
      previously studied by Phanishree et al. (unpublished data), which demonstrated a decrease in&#xD;
      the blood pressure and heart rate in patients. Furthermore, the patients were much more&#xD;
      relaxed and calm compared to the beginning of the study. Other music genres have relaxation&#xD;
      properties as well but we wanted to test one specific type of music to see proof of concept&#xD;
      in colonoscopy before we introduce other genres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propofol is currently being used more frequently for the use of monitored anesthesia in&#xD;
      surgical settings. Patients on propofol have a better recall that music was being played&#xD;
      compared to general anesthesia, but they could not adequately recall the type of music [20].&#xD;
      Ambient room noise seems to be one of the main factors associated with increasing propofol&#xD;
      requirements in an operation room (OR) which music seems to alleviate [21] . This has been&#xD;
      further illustrated by the use of Bispectral index (BIS), which demonstrated increasing brain&#xD;
      activity when OR decibels were over 50 [22]. With the initiation of music and propofol in the&#xD;
      setting of spinal anesthesia, there was a significant decrease in propofol dose and cortisol&#xD;
      levels intra-op demonstrating the stress relieving effect of music [23,24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fully monitor the sedation requirements for patients undergoing colonoscopy two different&#xD;
      scales will be utilized to assess the depth of sedation. The validated University of Michigan&#xD;
      Sedation Scale (UMSS) is a combination of auditory and visual stimuli that are used to assess&#xD;
      the depth of sedation. Since Auditory stimuli can be difficult to assess with the headphones&#xD;
      we will also utilize the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the depth of sedation. The BIS&#xD;
      monitor is attached to an electrode that is fixed on the forehead of the patient and&#xD;
      continually assesses the brain activity of the patient. A computer algorithm will assess the&#xD;
      brain activity and gives a value that determines the level of sedation. This in conjunction&#xD;
      with the UMSS scale will give an adequate representation of the depth of sedation. The UMSS&#xD;
      is the standard of care (SOC) in colonoscopy and BIS in general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UMSS scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - Awake and alert&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Minimally sedated: tired/sleepy, appropriate response to verbal conversation and/or&#xD;
           sound&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Moderately sedated: somnolent/sleeping, easily aroused with light tactile stimulation&#xD;
           or a simple verbal command&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Deeply sedated: deep sleep, arousable only with significant physical stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Unarousable&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial propofol induction dosage is determined by the anesthesiologist and is given&#xD;
      according to the mg/kg requirements. After the induction process the UMSS and BIS scores will&#xD;
      be utilized to determine the amount of propofol to be given as IV pushes to achieve adequate&#xD;
      sedation. Furthermore, the anesthesiologist routinely assesses the American society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiology (ASA) grading system to determine the degree of risk associated with a&#xD;
      procedure with each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASA grading system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 1 Healthy person. Grade 2 Mild systemic disease. Grade 3 Severe systemic disease. Grade&#xD;
      4 Severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life. Grade 5 A moribund person who is&#xD;
      not expected to survive without the operation. Grade 6 A declared brain dead person whose&#xD;
      organs are being removed for donor purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Goals and Objectives This is a prospective single-blinded randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial that will examine the effects of active music participation and music listening on&#xD;
      patients undergoing colonoscopy via propofol (monitored anesthesia) at the Brooklyn Hospital&#xD;
      Center. Our study aims to enroll patients who will undergo colonoscopy and randomize them to&#xD;
      receive either music or no music starting at the time of initial nursing evaluation in the&#xD;
      pre-procedure area. The primary endpoint is to assess the utilization of narcotics/sedatives&#xD;
      during colonoscopy. Secondary endpoints include willingness to repeat the procedure, anxiety&#xD;
      associated with procedure, and association between the year of trainee and the amount of&#xD;
      narcotic/sedatives used in each arm of the study. The complications that occur in reference&#xD;
      of the year of trainee will be observe. We hypothesize that incorporating music during&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedures will alleviate patient discomfort, reduce narcotic/sedative usage and&#xD;
      post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study design chosen for this study is a prospective single-blinded randomized&#xD;
      control trial as there will be a control group who will not be listening to music and&#xD;
      treatment group. The period study will be conducted for the period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study population will include all individuals undergoing colonoscopies&#xD;
      that consented to participating in the study. The study subjects will include the patients&#xD;
      undergoing the procedure and the gastroenterology fellows performing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Based on a previous study measuring discomfort of patients undergoing colonoscopy&#xD;
      we hypothesized that music can decrease the sedative/narcotic usage by 20 to 25 percent [25].&#xD;
      We expect a difference of 0.32mg/kg difference with a standard deviation of 0.69. Based on&#xD;
      this, with a power of 90% and alpha of 0.05, we need 128 patients per group for a total of&#xD;
      384 patients. We plan to enroll 460 patients (over 18-years of age) to include a 20% dropout&#xD;
      rate due to lack of compliance with headphones, inability to complete the exam, or failure to&#xD;
      finish all accompanied documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Methods and Study Sites The study coordinator or investigators at The Brooklyn&#xD;
      Hospital will approach all patients at the time of registration for colonoscopy. The&#xD;
      coordinator will explain the study briefly and if agreeable will be given an iPad with a&#xD;
      prerecorded video explaining the study in detail. After informed consent, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the control group (no music) or music group via a sealed envelope. A&#xD;
      sealed envelope will delineate the particular group the patient will be randomized to. Once&#xD;
      randomized, both groups will fill out a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form to&#xD;
      determine the baseline anxiety stress levels (Appendix A). This will be followed by a brief&#xD;
      form (Appendix B) that will determine the type and number of procedures performed in the&#xD;
      past. The forms will be administered in English, Spanish and Polish. Spanish and Polish&#xD;
      translation will be provided using telephone medical translation services at The Brooklyn&#xD;
      Hospital Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Storage Confidentiality of research data will be protected in accordance&#xD;
      with the prevailing standards that apply to all clinical data. The binder with the data&#xD;
      collection form and patient information will, as mentioned above, be locked in a filing&#xD;
      cabinet in the GI endoscopy suit and will be reviewed only by the key study personnel. The&#xD;
      patients' electronic health records, which contain the remainder of the patient data, are&#xD;
      password protected. No personal identifying information will be used in any presentation or&#xD;
      publication. The principal investigator and co-investigators will monitor study procedures to&#xD;
      ensure confidentiality of data, safety and proper conduct of the study. Changes to the study&#xD;
      will only occur after IRB amendment approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits Utilizing headphones which can place a slight pressure around the ear,&#xD;
      posing a very minimal risk. There is also a very rare possibility of hearing damage due to&#xD;
      loud music being played on the headphones. To prevent this, the patient will adjust the music&#xD;
      to his or her desired level with audible tones for both groups in the study prior to starting&#xD;
      the music. There is a slight possibility of the loss of confidentiality, however this will be&#xD;
      minimized by keeping all study related materials and data collection forms in a locked file&#xD;
      cabinet as described above. Please refer to the confidentiality section of the protocol.&#xD;
      Breaches of confidentiality, protocol deviations and any adverse events or other problems&#xD;
      that may affect the safety of the subjects will be reported to the IRB in a timely fashion&#xD;
      This study does not involve greater risk to the subjects than what is normally encountered&#xD;
      during the performance of routine physical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of the study is to demonstrate an overall improvement in sedation and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction while decreasing the total amount of sedatives utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waiver of HIPAA Informed Consent This is a single blind prospective study that involves&#xD;
      standard of care with human subjects. When not in use by the researchers, the data collection&#xD;
      forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet located in Division of Gastroenterology and&#xD;
      Hepatology, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, 240 Willoughby St., Maynard building, 2nd floor.&#xD;
      Patient's data will be recorded in the computer and will be protected throughout the study in&#xD;
      usual ways for IT security. The data collection form to be used is attached. All patient&#xD;
      identifiers will be de-identified upon completion of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources and Budget The study is not funded and does not require extra lab tests, clinic&#xD;
      visits, or supplies outside of standard clinical care. Therefore, these will not incur any&#xD;
      additional costs for either the patients or the institution. There is no budget associated&#xD;
      with this project as investigators will participate on a volunteer basis. There is no&#xD;
      pay/stipend for study participants. Study personnel are limited to the participating&#xD;
      gastroenterology, internal medicine, and research staff at the Brooklyn Hospital Center. No&#xD;
      expenses will be incurred and nothing will be gained other than normal scholarly gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions Our results will improve patient satisfaction, reduce post-surgery complications&#xD;
      and lessen the anxiety surrounding endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopies. It is our&#xD;
      hope that improving our understanding of the role of music in regards to anxiety related&#xD;
      colonoscopies, through a prospective, randomized, controlled research study, can help better&#xD;
      facilitate patient care and outcomes and serve our population at the Brooklyn Hospital&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
