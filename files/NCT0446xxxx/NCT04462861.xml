  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An external tunneled central venous access device (CVAD) is a small plastic tube that is&#xD;
      tunneled under the skin into a major vein for long-term use (Figure 1). Patients who require&#xD;
      a tunneled CVAD are some of the sickest patients we encounter and include oncology,&#xD;
      hematology, and gastrointestinal (intestinal failure) patients. These patients are heavily&#xD;
      reliant on their tunneled CVAD, which can be a lifeline for long-term administration of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics, IV medications, blood product transfusions, antibiotics, enteral&#xD;
      nutrition, blood draws and fluids. Unfortunately, nearly 30% of pediatric external tunneled&#xD;
      CVADs fail prior to the completion of treatment. External tunneled CVAD failures lead to&#xD;
      unnecessary morbidity and mortality, interruption of medical therapy, and the added costs and&#xD;
      risks associated with additional procedural complications. It is hypothesized that a newly&#xD;
      designed securement method for external tunneled central venous access devices (CVAD) will&#xD;
      reduce catheter-related complications and increase patient, parent and provider satisfaction,&#xD;
      compared to the current standard of care, which is a clear transparent film dressing over the&#xD;
      catheter exit site. A 20 patient, prospective clinical trial is proposed to address the&#xD;
      following specific aims, which will determine if the securement device:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is rated by patients, parents and providers as easy to apply and comfortable for users&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduces CVAD-related complications, such as delayed healing of the tract,&#xD;
           catheter-related infections, and episodes of catheter dislodgement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improves the quality of life for patients and their parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is preferred over the standard, clear transparent dressing alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Requires any design modifications to improve performance and/or comfort of the device&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective pilot trial to examine the feasibility for a new CVAD securement device&#xD;
      prototype (see appendix for computer-aided design drawings). Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      identified by either mid-level providers, consulting services, or attending surgeons.&#xD;
      Researchers will obtain consent from the patient or their parent/legal guardian. Caregivers&#xD;
      will be educated on how to apply the securement device and will be given a number to call&#xD;
      should they have any questions or concerns. Once the patient is enrolled and provided with&#xD;
      the device, the investigators will perform follow up telephone interviews at one and three&#xD;
      weeks to evaluate their experience and ensure they did not experience any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively record the primary and secondary outcomes regarding use&#xD;
      of the securement device, including: comfort, quality of materials, adhesive, ease of use,&#xD;
      skin problems, infections, dislodgement episodes, catheter breakage, types and numbers of&#xD;
      interactions with healthcare providers (phone calls, emergency department and clinic visits),&#xD;
      perceived safety, and overall impressions.&#xD;
