  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to prove that wraps manufactured with infrared textile are capable of&#xD;
      augmenting peripheral circulation in the lower legs, arm and feet of participants with&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus. Infrared is currently used in saunas and various textiles as general&#xD;
      wellness products that purport to improve various health conditions and augment&#xD;
      microcirculation. This study is intended to investigate specifically whether wraps capable of&#xD;
      harnessing infrared energy can improve oxygenation in the feet, arms and lower legs of&#xD;
      diabetics using noninvasive transcutaneous oximetry to do so.&#xD;

      Infrared energy is a type of electromagnetic energy that is invisible, and is further&#xD;
      subdivided into three subsets based on wavelength. Far infrared (FIR or IR-C) is a subset of&#xD;
      energy in the infrared spectrum that is thought to transfer energy in the form of heat,&#xD;
      perceived by thermoreceptors in the skin as radiant heat. FIR is thought to be both absorbed&#xD;
      by the human body but is also emitted in the 3-50 micron range, with a peak output at 9.4&#xD;
      micron. The range of far infrared varies depending on which source is referenced but is&#xD;
      generally felt to start at 3 to 5 microns. The use of FIR has been studied in various&#xD;
      circumstances and thought to improve various biological functions via FIR heat lamps, saunas,&#xD;
      ray devices and FIR emitting ceramics and fabrics. There are no short-term or long-term&#xD;
      safety issues that have arisen in any studies thus far. As noted in the 2006 statement of the&#xD;
      ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), &quot;…the contribution&#xD;
      made by the IR-C spectral region (3-1,000 micron) is normally of no practical concern from a&#xD;
      health hazard standpoint.&quot; FIR has been shown to increase blood flow in forearms, and access&#xD;
      flow and survival of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. An unpublished study, by&#xD;
      McClue, reported an apparent increase in pedal circulation of approximately 10% using&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen monitoring in healthy subjects wearing socks infiltrated with FIR&#xD;
      emitting textiles. The mechanism of improving circulation is not entirely elucidated, however&#xD;
      recent work suggests a role of increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide&#xD;
      production and modulating profiles of circulating miRNAs (mircoRNA, small noncoding RNAs of&#xD;
      ∼22nt in length which are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the&#xD;
      posttranscriptional level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes prevalence has increased significantly over the past decade, with estimates&#xD;
      from 2015 of 26 million Americans diagnosed and predicted to increase to 32 million by 2020.&#xD;
      Both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes is well known to increase the risk of nontraumatic lower&#xD;
      extremity amputation by, amongst other factors, impairing circulation to the feet through&#xD;
      both peripheral arterial disease and microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive transcutaneous oximetry measurements of the leg have been validated as a valuable&#xD;
      tool in assessing lower extremity circulation in both normal subjects and diabetic&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial seeks to prove that exposure to IR, through the use of newly developed socks&#xD;
      (wraps here with same material) that contain thermoreactive particles woven into textile,&#xD;
      which both emit IR and reflect the IR back from the body, can augment circulation in the&#xD;
      feet, arms and lower legs of diabetic subjects. Noninvasive transcutaneous oximetry will be&#xD;
      used as the assessment modality. If this study confirms this hypothesis, future studies may&#xD;
      be planned to determine if the use of a IR-containing textile can prevent new ulcers from&#xD;
      forming in high risk patients and perhaps even speed the healing of prevalent foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from both primary care and specialty medical offices who carry a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus, will be between the ages of 18 to 80 and will act as their&#xD;
      own controls. The goal will be to enroll a minimum of one hundred (100) patients who will be&#xD;
      evaluated noninvasively with transcutaneous oxygen measurements using Radiometer TCM&#xD;
      (PeriFlux 5000) supplied by Radiometer America, Inc. Upon screening and after signing&#xD;
      informed consent, patients will have ankle brachial index (ABI) measurements performed on&#xD;
      both legs to exclude those who have severe peripheral arterial disease (ABI index or 0.4 or&#xD;
      lower). Upon arrival on study day, subjects will have both feet evaluated by a registered&#xD;
      nurse (RN), to ensure there are no signs of infection, active foot ulcers, or other open&#xD;
      wounds. If there is any such evidence, the patients will be excluded from the trial and sent&#xD;
      for further evaluation and treatment according to standard of care by their primary care&#xD;
      clinicians or podiatrists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be placed on an exam table reclined at a 120-degree angle with legs extended&#xD;
      and supported by leg rest. The TCPO2 machine will have been turned on prior to patient&#xD;
      arrival for calibration. If necessary, any hair on the subject's foot or leg will be removed&#xD;
      in the area of fixation ring application by a disposable razor. The subject will then have up&#xD;
      to 3 fixation rings attached, used for measuring TCPO2, placed on the lower leg and foot. The&#xD;
      fixation rings will be further secured around the circumference with medical tape,&#xD;
      approximately 1 inch by 0.5 inch per piece to further enhance the seal. In a double blind&#xD;
      fashion, subjects will be randomized to have either placebo or IR wraps placed in a&#xD;
      sequential way. The wrap will be placed over the foot, arm and lower leg covering the&#xD;
      fixation rings. Three drops of contact solution will be placed inside each fixation ring,&#xD;
      followed by attachment of the electrodes. There will then be a 30 minute rest/stabilization&#xD;
      period allowing for the TCPO2 to stabilize (stabilization phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wraps will then be gently applied to the arm, feet and leg, while being careful not to&#xD;
      disturb the fixation rings. The placebo wraps are identical in all ways to the study wrap,&#xD;
      with the exception that the placebo wraps do not contain the proprietary thermoreactive&#xD;
      minerals woven into the fabric. The active phase will then commence and continue for 60&#xD;
      minutes, with TCPO2 measurements taking place continuously and recorded at least every 10&#xD;
      minutes. At the end of the 60-minute study period, the leads will be removed, followed by the&#xD;
      wraps. The fixation rings are not removed, however. The TCPO2 machine should be recalibrated&#xD;
      after the leads are returned to the holding chamber, prior to the second half of the trial&#xD;
      using the other wraps (either IR or placebo, whichever was not used in first session). There&#xD;
      will then be a 10-minute break period, subjects will be allowed to use the restroom and may&#xD;
      place loose foot coverings over their feet for ambulation. Following the subjects return to&#xD;
      the exam table, the same above protocol will be followed, with 30 minutes of&#xD;
      rest/stabilization after the leads are placed back on for the baseline readings prior to wrap&#xD;
      placement. Repeat TCPO2 measurements will be obtained according to the same schedule as&#xD;
      indicated above. Activity will be restricted during the active and stabilization phase of the&#xD;
      protocol. Patients will be encouraged to void prior to initiation of each half of the&#xD;
      protocol. However, should subjects have to use the bathroom during one of the active phases,&#xD;
      the rest and stabilization phase will restart at time zero following the bathroom break and&#xD;
      reattachment of the TCPO2 sensors. At the completion of the study, the leads and fixation&#xD;
      rings will be removed and subjects will return placebo and study socks to the appropriate&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
