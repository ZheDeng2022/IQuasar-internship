  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heterozygous mutations in ADCY5 induce hyperactivity of striatal adenylate cyclase type 5&#xD;
      (AC5), manifesting as early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders. Numerous treatments have&#xD;
      been tried without much efficacy thus far. Two patients from the same family reported&#xD;
      efficacy of caffeine on paroxysmal episodes, both to prevent episodes and to reduce their&#xD;
      duration (efficacy estimated to be around 80%), which was specific to caffeine as it was&#xD;
      reproduced with caffeine citrate capsules. Interestingly, there is a rationale underlying&#xD;
      this observation. Indeed, caffeine is an antagonist of adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), which&#xD;
      activate AC5 and are localized preferentially in striatal neurons that express dopamine&#xD;
      receptors D2 .Caffeine therefore likely induces AC5 inhibition, and thus clinical improvement&#xD;
      in patients with hyperactivity of this protein. This observation has been recently published&#xD;
      in2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect preliminary data by interviewing our neurologist and&#xD;
      neuropediatric colleagues, in France and abroad since it is a rare disease, on the effect of&#xD;
      caffeine on motor symptoms and global clinical status in their ADCY5 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heterozygous mutations in ADCY5 induce hyperactivity of striatal adenylate cyclase type 5&#xD;
      (AC5) manifesting as early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders. The phenotype combines&#xD;
      chorea, dystonia and/or myoclonus with frequent facial involvement, axial hypotonia,&#xD;
      fluctuations and/or episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia which can be nocturnal and/or painful,&#xD;
      generally without intellectual deficiency, epilepsy or cerebellar syndrome . It is a very&#xD;
      rare disease, affecting around twenty patients in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific context of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous treatments have been tried without much efficacy thus far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific justification for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two patients from the same family reported efficacy of caffeine on paroxysmal episodes, both&#xD;
      to prevent episodes and to reduce their duration (efficacy estimated to be around 80%), which&#xD;
      was specific to caffeine as it was reproduced with caffeine citrate capsules. Interestingly&#xD;
      there is a rationale underlying this situation. Indeed, caffeine is an antagonist of&#xD;
      adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), which activate AC5 and are localized preferentially in&#xD;
      striatal neurons that express dopamine receptors D2. Caffeine therefore likely induces&#xD;
      inhibition of AC5, and thus clinical improvement in patients with hyperactivity of this&#xD;
      protein. This observation has been recently published in 2019 HYPOTHESIS Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that most patients with ADCY5-related dyskinesia respond well to caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicentric retrospective study, which will be conducted in neurology and&#xD;
      neuropediatric departments across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by their own physician. This research will take place over 18&#xD;
      months in total: 12 month to collect all patients' data and 6 months to analyse data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants will be between 5 and 20, depending on colleagues replies.&#xD;
