  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of human motion using radar has become an increasingly active topic of study due&#xD;
      to the diverse applications offered by such an analysis (Lai et al., 2008; Fairchild &amp;&#xD;
      Narayanan, 2016; Narayanan et al., 2014). Information about human motion has important&#xD;
      applications for urban military operations, search-and-rescue missions, surveillance, and&#xD;
      hospital patient monitoring. The micro-motions of human movement in the presence of radar&#xD;
      illumination creates unique modulations in the received signal known as the micro-Doppler&#xD;
      effect. By analyzing these frequency modulations, one can infer the type of movement being&#xD;
      performed. This micro-motion associated with human movement produces a nonlinear and&#xD;
      non-stationary signal that can be characterized using time-frequency domain analysis. Such&#xD;
      signals will be used to identify high injury risk versus low injury risk athletes, which&#xD;
      creates an opportunity to direct limited prevention resources to these high-risk athletes;&#xD;
      identify individuals at risk of falls; and, may even be useful in diagnosing conditions such&#xD;
      as Parkinson's where asymmetrical movement patterns occur as an early indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional methods of movement analysis involve the use of expensive video motion capture&#xD;
      systems that accurately measure the 3-dimensional position of passive reflective markers&#xD;
      affixed to human body landmarks such as joints and body segments, and while motion capture&#xD;
      systems are used to effectively estimate movement dynamics, they are generally not portable,&#xD;
      they are expensive, and they can be cumbersome when the reflective markers are applied to&#xD;
      older persons or persons with movement deficiencies. Drs. Narayanan and Onks have&#xD;
      successfully tested a novel use of Doppler radar that is portable, less expensive, and&#xD;
      eliminates the need for affixing cumbersome reflective markers to participants. In addition,&#xD;
      preliminary testing has demonstrated the ability to discriminate between certain movement&#xD;
      conditions at a level of precision we feel are not obtainable with video motion capture.&#xD;

      Each subject will report for their scheduled data collection in the biomechanics laboratory.&#xD;
      Boney landmarks (shoulder, hip, knee, ankle, etc.) will be used to place small reflective&#xD;
      markers for use with motion capture analysis. The radar will be positioned so that the MDS&#xD;
      data can be captured simultaneously with the motion capture data. Each volunteer will&#xD;
      complete the following activities: â€¢ Walk with athletic shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walk with bilateral heel lifts in shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walk with unilateral heel lift&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Squat jump with athletic shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Squat jump with bilateral heel lifts in shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Squat Jump with unilateral heel lift&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stationary standing posture with athletic shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stationary standing posture with bilateral heel lifts in shoes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stationary standing posture with unilateral heel lift Each activity will be performed&#xD;
           three times toward the radar in order to assess repeatability and reliability, and also&#xD;
           for maintaining adequate statistical training and testing datasets for confirming the&#xD;
           use of previous established classification algorithms. These algorithms will again be&#xD;
           used to calculate prediction accuracy for the different activities (walking, jumping,&#xD;
           and stationary posture) and different footwear conditions (shoes without inserts, shoes&#xD;
           with bilateral inserts, shoes with unilateral inserts). The biomechanical motion capture&#xD;
           data will be processed similarly to the MDS data to compare to accuracy between the two&#xD;
           methods for the same observed task-specific differences. Our goal is to determine if MDS&#xD;
           can achieve the same measurement accuracy as motion capture for the same task. Since&#xD;
           biomechanical motion capture is the &quot;gold standard&quot; of human movement measurement, the&#xD;
           successful completion of this aim will establish the validity of MDS as an effective&#xD;
           clinical measure of human movement.&#xD;
