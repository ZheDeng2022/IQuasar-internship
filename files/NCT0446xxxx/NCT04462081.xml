      To assess the feasibility in diabetics in a primary care setting of screening for NAFLD and&#xD;
      advanced fibrosis, by using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate the&#xD;
      hepatic proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to&#xD;
      estimate hepatic stiffness.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study consisting of a one-time visit by diabetic patients with&#xD;
      optional following liver biopsy. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether liver fat&#xD;
      fraction and liver stiffness, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, are associated&#xD;
      with subclinical cardiovascular disease, as evaluated by coronary artery calcium scan in&#xD;
      diabetics. During the visit, patients will undergo review of medical history, vitals&#xD;
      (including body mass index, blood pressure), physical exam, blood work, urine collection,&#xD;
      ECG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including MR proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF)&#xD;
      and MR elastography, ultrasound using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, and&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scan for coronary artery calcium scoring. Blood work will be sent&#xD;
      for labs relevant to traits of metabolic syndrome including markers for diabetes (hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1C, fasting glucose) and hyperlipidemia (lipid panel). Serum, plasma and whole blood will be&#xD;
      stored for future studies. Results from history, physical exam, and radiographic imaging will&#xD;
      be analyzed and if they indicate the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, patients will&#xD;
      be offered an optional liver biopsy for further assessment. All patients will be invited to&#xD;
      continue in the study and have follow-up visits every two years for a total duration of the&#xD;
      study of 5 years.&#xD;

      There is a separate optional component of the study where subjects will be asked to donate a&#xD;
      blood sample for genetic research.Subjects will be offered the opportunity to review, discuss&#xD;
      and sign the consent at their scheduled visit. All questions will be answered at this time&#xD;
      and throughout the study. Declining to give a genetic sample does not prohibit the&#xD;
      participant from participating in the study. The biospecimen collected as part of this study&#xD;
      will be kept in Dr. Loomba's locked research freezer at the Clinical Teaching Facility&#xD;
      (CTF-building A).These samples and data may be stored for 50 years to be used at a later date&#xD;
      for investigation of new novel biomarkers. This will be made clear to the patient during the&#xD;
      consent process.&#xD;
