    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well leflunomide works for the treatment of patients with CD30+&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorders that have come back (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Leflunomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall response rate of leflunomide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess complete response rate and duration of response of leflunomide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess toxicities of leflunomide treatment. III. To assess disease status by the CAILS&#xD;
      (composite assessment of index lesion severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To generate a preliminary ribonucleic acid (RNA) signature associated with response of&#xD;
      CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LYPDs) cells to leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented response (complete response [CR] or partial [PR]) any time during study treatment. Response will be categorized by modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT). Will be calculated along with the Clopper Pearson binomial 95% exact confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Complete response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR any time during study treatment. Response will be assessed by mSWAT. Will be calculated along with the Clopper Pearson binomial 95% exact confidence intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator; median duration of response will also be estimated when possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Observed toxicities will be summarized, in terms of type, grade, time of onset, duration, and attribution to the study treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Micro (mi)R ribonucleic acid (RNA)/messenger (m)RNA expression profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be summarized by descriptive statistics. The data will also be used to explore the miRNA/mRNA that show significant differences between responders and non-responders after leflunomide treatment. For miRNA/RNA profiling, fold changes &gt; 3 with an false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.</description>

             abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least three&#xD;
             months after the last dose of protocol therapy. The effects of study treatment on a&#xD;
             developing fetus have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the&#xD;
             trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute active infection requiring systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;

             composition to leflunomide or cholestyramine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-hematologic malignancy within the past 3 years aside from the following&#xD;
             exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or the patient's ability to give&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Leflunomide has potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,&#xD;
             unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to&#xD;
             feasibility/logistics)&#xD;
