  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases,&#xD;
      with 90% of cases directly attributable to smoking. Unfortunately, many patients continue to&#xD;
      smoke and have an urgent need to quit. Proactive tobacco treatment programs identify patients&#xD;
      outside of a routine clinical appointment and engage them in making a supported quit attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most previous research of proactive tobacco treatment has used telephone outreach, which can&#xD;
      be resource intensive. Electronic methods (texting, secure messaging) may be effective while&#xD;
      requiring fewer resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a previously tested telephone outreach intervention will be adapted for&#xD;
      electronic delivery, with content tailored to smokers with COPD. First, information will be&#xD;
      gathered from smokers with COPD and the medical staff who care for them to adapt the program&#xD;
      for electronic delivery. Then, the program will be pilot-tested. Smokers with COPD will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either usual medical care or the outreach intervention, with goals to&#xD;
      increase participation in smoking cessation programs, quit attempts, and successful&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory conditions&#xD;
      and the 4th leading cause of death in the US. 90% of cases are directly attributable to&#xD;
      smoking. Quitting smoking is the most important intervention for these patients, who continue&#xD;
      to smoke at rates double the national average. Smokers with COPD remain undertreated for&#xD;
      tobacco use. Proactive tobacco treatment programs identify patients outside of a routine&#xD;
      clinic visit, engage them in making a quit attempt and connect them with treatment. These&#xD;
      programs may be particularly beneficial for smokers with COPD. Previous phone-based programs&#xD;
      are resource intensive to deliver. Electronic methods for delivering proactive outreach for&#xD;
      tobacco cessation may be effective and cost-effective, and can be tailored to the target&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A proactive tobacco treatment program adapted to electronic delivery and tailored&#xD;
      to smokers with COPD will be effective and cost effective for increasing quit engagement&#xD;
      among smokers with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multi-aim implementation study with randomized pilot. Aim 1: Mixed methods&#xD;
      (survey and interview) assessment of current use of health information technology among&#xD;
      smokers with COPD with a focus on the impact of the chronic disease state on tobacco&#xD;
      cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Qualitative assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementation of proactive&#xD;
      tobacco treatment programs for patients with COPD among staff and leadership.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Randomized pilot of a proactive tobacco treatment program for smokers with COPD&#xD;
      delivered through secure messaging, compared to usual care. Sub-aim will assess marginal cost&#xD;
      associated with the program.&#xD;
