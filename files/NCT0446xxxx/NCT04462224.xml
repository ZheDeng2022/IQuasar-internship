  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four novel biologic therapies (benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) have been&#xD;
      recently approved for moderate-to-severe, eosinophilic or oral steroid-dependent asthma. The&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of these therapies have been determined primarily by randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials that compared annualized rates of significant asthma exacerbations (SAEs), lung&#xD;
      function changes, and standardized symptom survey score changes in therapy-treated subjects&#xD;
      in comparison to placebo matched controls. Yet, there is increasing interest to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy, health benefits, and safety in medical therapies using real-world evidence (RWE).&#xD;
      Further, home monitoring of asthma using mobile health (mHealth) technology may help&#xD;
      scientists develop new and more sensitive indicators of asthma control that could improve&#xD;
      clinical care. The hypothesis is that real world evidence, collected at home using several&#xD;
      mobile health technologies, will help determine the efficacy, health benefits, and side&#xD;
      effects of these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess real-world evidence (RWE) indicators of worsening and improving asthma.&#xD;
           Scientists will measure steps per day, duration and vigor of exercise per day, sleep&#xD;
           quality, and the number of awakenings per night using Fitbit activity trackers.&#xD;
           Scientists will measure symptoms using once-monthly custom survey delivered to&#xD;
           participant smartphones via Twilio. Rescue medication use and adherence to maintenance&#xD;
           medications may be measured using digital inhaler devices. Adherence to biologic use&#xD;
           using HealthBeacon smart sharps containers may be measured. Measures collected will be&#xD;
           correlated to patient-reported significant asthma exacerbations (SAEs), lung function&#xD;
           (FEV1), and the asthma control test (ACT) collected in clinic every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use RWE to determine responses to biologic therapies. Scientists will combine at-home&#xD;
           and clinic data to determine responses to biologics.&#xD;

    <description>A protocol-defined asthma exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids for 3 or more days; for patients receiving long-term oral corticosteroids, an exacerbation was a 20 mg or more increase in average daily dose of oral prednisone (or a similar dose of another systemic corticosteroid). The rate of protocol-defined asthma exacerbations, normalized by subject-time at risk and computed over the 24 observation or 52-week treatment period in each treatment group.</description>
