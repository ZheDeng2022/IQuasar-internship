    <textblock>
      By leveraging a community-based, cancer-specific electronic healthcare record for this study,&#xD;
      we aim to understand treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among patients with HR+/HER2-&#xD;
      mBC who received care within the context of a large community oncology network in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a documented diagnosis of hormone receptor-positive (estrogen&#xD;
             receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive), human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
             receptor 2-negative mBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Aged 18 years at initial recorded diagnosis of mBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Initiated one of the following qualifying regimens within the USON during the study&#xD;
             identification period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Palbociclib combination therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole,&#xD;
                  exemestane, or anastrozole) among patients as first-line therapy in the advanced&#xD;
                  or metastatic setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Palbociclib combination therapy with fulvestrant following as first-line or&#xD;
                  beyond therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, exemestane or anastrozole) monotherapy as&#xD;
                  first-line treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Fulvestrant monotherapy as first-line or beyond therapy in the advanced or&#xD;
                  metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Received care at a USON site(s) utilizing the full EHR capacities of iKM at the time&#xD;
             of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. EHR data available from the USON site(s) where the patient received treatment are&#xD;
             accessible for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. During the study observation period, patients observed with at least 2 visits after&#xD;
             the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Enrollment in an interventional clinical trial during the study observation period&#xD;
             since clinical trial participants may have clinical scenarios that deviate from the&#xD;
             population of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Among the Pb-AI and AI mono cohorts, evidence of prior treatment with other CDK 4/6&#xD;
             inhibitors (ribociclib or abemaciclib), aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, exemestane,&#xD;
             or anastrozole), tamoxifen, raloxifene, toremifene, or fulvestrant in the advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Among the Pb-FUL and FUL mono cohorts, evidence of prior treatment with CDK 4/6&#xD;
             inhibitors (ribociclib or abemaciclib) in the advanced or metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Receipt of treatment indicated for another primary cancer during the study observation&#xD;
             period or history of another primary cancer within the USON iKM EHR database.&#xD;
