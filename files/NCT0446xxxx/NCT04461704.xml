    <textblock>
      Analysis of monitored clinically parameters during the course of labor is a seldom studied&#xD;
      area in Taiwan and worldwide. Important monitored parameters include, fetal heartbeat,&#xD;
      uterine contractions, oxygen saturation and blood pressure, among others.1 During labor,&#xD;
      uterine contractions can cause pain.3 This pain may be measured using a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS).2 The pain from uterine contractions promotes the release of hormones including&#xD;
      cortisol which can cause decreased or irregular contractions and possibly prolong labor.3&#xD;
      This study aims to study the association between monitored clinical parameters and pain in&#xD;
      women in Taiwan during labor in order to increase the understanding to safe childbirth.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational study to measure and collect and physical parameters&#xD;
      from females at least 20 years of age in the labor room. Collection of measurements and&#xD;
      physical parameters will begin when the subject enrolls in the study. Besides, ECG and SpO2&#xD;
      will be recorded continuously until the end of the study period. In addition, uterus&#xD;
      contraction cycle and fetal heart beat will be recorded during the study period based on&#xD;
      standard of care in the labor room. Pain will be recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at&#xD;
      baseline and when the caregiver perceives that there is a change in the subject's pain status&#xD;
      until the end of the study period. The time of each assessment of pain on VAS should be&#xD;
      recorded. Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if they have a cesarean section or any&#xD;
      complication during labor in the opinion of the investigator. Subject participation in the&#xD;
      study will end when eight hours have elapsed since baseline, the subject leaves the labor&#xD;
      room or the subject delivers the baby.&#xD;
