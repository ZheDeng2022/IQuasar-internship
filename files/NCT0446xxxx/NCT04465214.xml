      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many digital devices, such as smartphones and activity monitors, have sensors to collect and&#xD;
      track health data. Researchers believe these devices may be able to transform the quality of&#xD;
      clinical research and healthcare. They believe they may be able to help assess the symptoms,&#xD;
      response to therapy, and quality of life of people with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect data from people with cancer using an Apple iPhone alone or together with an Apple&#xD;
      Watch in order to assess their symptoms and activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 years and over who have cancer and receiving treatment for their cancer in&#xD;
      another NIH protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit. They will have visits every 2 4 weeks based on the&#xD;
      treatment protocol in which they are co-enrolled. Then they will have a follow-up visit 4&#xD;
      months after the baseline visit. Visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Karnofsky Performance Scale/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status to see how&#xD;
      their disease affects daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will use an iPhone to collect data. This includes a 6-minute walk test and&#xD;
      tests of hearing, reaction time, and cognitive status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have an iPhone, an Apple Watch will be provided to them after training at the&#xD;
      baseline visit. Continuous measurement of their activity will be recorded by the watch&#xD;
      between 2 visits. They will wear the watch while they are on study. They will wear the watch&#xD;
      while it is not being charged. They should charge the watch at night time. They will have the&#xD;
      watch for 4 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A growing number of mobile health solutions are enabling the tracking, diagnosis, and&#xD;
           management of various physiological processes and disease conditions, and many common&#xD;
           devices such as smartphones (e.g., iPhone) have integrated robust sensors to collect and&#xD;
           track this data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The two most commonly used tools in oncology include the Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
           Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scales that&#xD;
           were invented more than 50 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although standard performance status (PS) measurements are simple to implement in the&#xD;
           clinic, they are retrospective, subject to bias and limitations including intra- or&#xD;
           inter- observer variability, they are intermittent, providing a snapshot of the&#xD;
           participants status at the time of assessment, and they are largely subjective, relying&#xD;
           on physician judgement and participants ability to recall events and describe their&#xD;
           symptoms. The inability to retrospectively verify or confirm the accuracy of PS&#xD;
           assessment is another limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The benefits to participant care of knowing the accurate PS are extensive, including&#xD;
           making the right treatment decision based on the side effect profile, survival benefit&#xD;
           and eligibility on clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biometric data can also play a role in empowering participants to become active&#xD;
           participants in their own care, by providing them with quantitative feedback on&#xD;
           activities of daily living and other functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are some studies exploring the accuracy of available electronic activity&#xD;
           monitoring (EAM) systems, but the available data on use of EAM systems in oncology&#xD;
           participants is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous biometric data can provide actionable insights into fluctuations in not only&#xD;
           the activity level of cancer participants, but also their cognitive function and mood&#xD;
           throughout treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the current limitations in the overall clinical evaluation of cancer participants,&#xD;
           the use of remote sensor technologies can provide an objective, frequent, and near-real&#xD;
           time stream of data in a machine-readable format that is free of human bias and can&#xD;
           greatly enhance the ability of both clinicians and participants to manage the&#xD;
           complexities of cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of collecting data to assess fatigue, reaction time,&#xD;
      and cognitive functioning, in participants with cancer, using an Apple iPhone and Apple Watch&#xD;
      in the clinic setting and with or without additional activity monitoring in the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: Male or female subjects aged &gt;= 18 years with a diagnosis of&#xD;
           malignant tumors who are under active treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion Criteria: Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, known current&#xD;
           alcohol or drug abuse, any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding&#xD;
           or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be done in two arms (enrolled concurrently) on a total of 60 evaluable&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to Arm 1 will have all assessments done in the clinic. A specially&#xD;
      programmed iPhone, Apple Watch, an NIH iPad, and investigator conducted assessments will be&#xD;
      used to collect data assessing participant fatigue, reaction time, and cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      These data will be compared with data collected from questionnaires including: patient&#xD;
      reported outcome (PRO)-CTCAE fatigue and mood grading, ECOG/KPS, Neuro-QOL Ability to&#xD;
      Participate in Social Roles and Activities short form, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning&#xD;
      System, and The NIH Toolbox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 of this study will be a subset of enrolled participants who have a personally owned&#xD;
      iPhone. Participants in Arm 2 will complete the same battery of assessments in the clinic as&#xD;
      those in Arm 1, with additional continuous measurement of their activity recorded by an Apple&#xD;
      Watch at home, between clinic visits. Participants in Arm 2 will have the option of having&#xD;
      the apps designed for this study installed on their personally owned iPhones so they can&#xD;
      complete the app assessments at home. The Apple Watch will be given to these participants (or&#xD;
      they may use a personally owned Apple Watch) who will be trained by study staff on using the&#xD;
      device for continuous monitoring. Participants who agree to have the study apps installed on&#xD;
      their personally owned iPhone will be trained by study staff on the use of the apps.&#xD;
