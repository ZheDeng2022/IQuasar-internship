  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective multi-center, randomized, controlled trial of 150 patients&#xD;
      conducted to assess the impact of individual use of the Apple Watch compared to the Withings&#xD;
      Move on patient-reported and clinical outcomes at 6 months and up to 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a a randomized, controlled trial to determine the impact of the Apple Watch Series 6&#xD;
      compared to the Withings Move on both patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization over&#xD;
      6 months and up to 1 year. Our research method will employ a patient-centered health data&#xD;
      sharing platform (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 150 total patients&#xD;
      after they receive elective direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (or atrial flutter, if they have a history of atrial fibrillation). A total of&#xD;
      50 patients at each of 3 clinical sites, Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Mayo Clinic, and Duke&#xD;
      Health before they undergo DCCV. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive the Apple&#xD;
      Watch Series 6, while half will receive a control device (Withings Move). Patients will then&#xD;
      be queried about specific symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and medication adherence&#xD;
      monthly. This project will provide novel and needed post-market data about the Apple Watch&#xD;
      Series 6 ECG and irregular rhythm detection notification features and, on a larger scale,&#xD;
      help delineate the impact of an innovative digital health technology on real-world patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the impact of using the Apple Watch ECG and irregular rhythm&#xD;
      notification features on patient-reported outcomes and clinical utilization after patients&#xD;
      receive cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter, if they have a history of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the accuracy of the Apple Watch ECG compared to physician&#xD;
      interpretation of 12-lead ECGs obtained in routine clinical care.&#xD;
