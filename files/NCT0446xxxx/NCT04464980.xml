  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two phase study investigating combinations of pharmacological and behavioral&#xD;
      interventions to optimize the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The Retention Phase&#xD;
      will assess strategies for improving retention on buprenorphine (BUP) and extended-release&#xD;
      injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX). The Discontinuation Phase will assess which approaches are&#xD;
      most likely to lead to long-term success (absence of relapse), and what characteristics of&#xD;
      participants distinguish those who can safely discontinue Medications for Opioid Use Disorder&#xD;
      (MOUD) from those who remain at risk of relapse and should not discontinue.&#xD;

      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test strategies to improve retention in treatment on medications for opioid use&#xD;
           disorder (MOUD), among patients initiating treatment for OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test strategies to improve outcomes among patients who have achieved stable remission&#xD;
           on MOUD and want to discontinue MOUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop models to predict who is able to discontinue MOUD without relapse, based on&#xD;
           patient characteristics, including duration of MOUD prior to discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a multicenter, randomized, pragmatic non-blinded design. The study has&#xD;
      two phases, a Retention Phase and a Discontinuation Phase.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current opioid use disorder (heroin, fentanyl or other&#xD;
             synthetic opioids, and/or prescription opioids);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Seeking treatment for opioid use disorder and choosing either buprenorphine (BUP) or&#xD;
             extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If choosing buprenorphine, willing to be randomized to SL-BUP-16mg, SL-BUP-32mg, or&#xD;
             XR-BUP;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to be randomized to either MM (standard Medical Management plus counseling&#xD;
             treatment as usual available at the site) or MMR (MM plus usual counseling and access&#xD;
             to the Pear-002a mHealth app);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In good-enough general health (meaning good enough health to be in outpatient&#xD;
             treatment) as determined by the study medical clinician on the basis of medical&#xD;
             history, review of systems, and physical/mental status exam, to permit treatment with&#xD;
             XR-NTX or BUP;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing and able to provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Able to speak English sufficiently to understand the study procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If female of childbearing potential, willing to practice an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control for the duration of participation in the study (participants who become&#xD;
             pregnant during the study will continue to be followed; treatment may be modified&#xD;
             consistent with pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Retention Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serious medical, psychiatric, or co-occurring substance use disorder or concomitant&#xD;
             medication that, in the opinion of the study medical clinician, makes the patient not&#xD;
             appropriate for outpatient treatment with buprenorphine or XR-NTX, but instead&#xD;
             requires a higher or different level of care. Examples include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Disabling or terminal medical illness (e.g., uncompensated heart failure,&#xD;
                  cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease) as assessed by medical history, review of&#xD;
                  systems, physical exam and/or laboratory assessments;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Severe, untreated or inadequately treated psychiatric condition (e.g., active&#xD;
                  psychosis, uncontrolled bipolar disorder) as assessed by history and/or clinical&#xD;
                  interview, requiring a different level of care (e.g., hospitalization);&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Current severe alcohol, benzodiazepine, or other depressant or sedative hypnotic&#xD;
                  use, requiring a different level of care (e.g., hospitalization);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior requiring a different level of care (e.g.,&#xD;
             hospitalization);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known allergy or sensitivity to preferred medication or its components;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Maintenance on methadone at the time of signing consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For those preferring XR-NTX, presence of pain of sufficient severity as to require&#xD;
             ongoing pain management with opioids;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For those preferring XR-NTX, body habitus that, in the judgment of the study&#xD;
             physician, precludes safe intramuscular injection of XR-NTX (e.g., BMI&gt;40, excess fat&#xD;
             tissue over the buttocks, emaciation);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If female, currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on conception;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are currently in jail, prison or other overnight facility as required by court of law&#xD;
             or have pending legal action that could prevent participation in study activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have used the reSET or reSET-O mHealth apps in the 3 months prior to consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Other major reasons that might prevent an individual from participating in the study&#xD;
             (e.g., a planned move out of the area).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Discontinuation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have been receiving buprenorphine for OUD for at least the past year or XR-NTX&#xD;
             pharmacotherapy for OUD for at least the past 6 months prior to consent for the&#xD;
             Discontinuation Phase;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Express the desire to discontinue MOUD after a shared decision-making discussion with&#xD;
             the treating provider;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Meet stability criteria, i.e., have abstained from opioids (other than buprenorphine),&#xD;
             cocaine, methamphetamine, and non-prescribed benzodiazepines for the past ≥12 weeks,&#xD;
             and do not meet DSM-5 criteria for current (≥12 weeks) alcohol use disorder&#xD;
             (participants with cannabis use will be eligible);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If currently taking buprenorphine, are willing to take either SL-BUP or XR-BUP if&#xD;
             randomized to that condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to be randomized to either MM or to MMD;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able to provide written informed consent after discussion with their provider&#xD;
             regarding the risks of discontinuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Able to speak English sufficiently to understand the study procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If female of childbearing potential, willing to practice an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control while in the study and taking study medication (participants who become&#xD;
             pregnant during the study will continue to be followed; treatment may be modified&#xD;
             consistent with pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Discontinuation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serious medical or psychiatric disorder or concomitant medication that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the study medical clinician, would make study participation hazardous to the&#xD;
             participant or compromise study findings or would prevent the participant from&#xD;
             completing the study. Examples include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Disabling or terminal medical illness (e.g., uncompensated heart failure,&#xD;
                  cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease) as assessed by medical history, review of&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Severe, untreated, or inadequately treated psychiatric condition (e.g., active&#xD;
                  psychosis, uncontrolled bipolar disorder) as assessed by history and/or clinical&#xD;
                  interview, requiring a different level of care (e.g., hospitalization);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior requiring a different level of care (e.g.,&#xD;
             hospitalization);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For participants entering the study taking buprenorphine, presence of pain requiring&#xD;
             or likely requiring ongoing pain management with buprenorphine or other opioids;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If female, currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on conception;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of opioids (other than buprenorphine), cocaine, methamphetamine, or non-prescribed&#xD;
             benzodiazepines in the past 12 weeks;&#xD;
