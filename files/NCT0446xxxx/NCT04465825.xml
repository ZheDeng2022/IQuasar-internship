      Part I. This study will examine the relationship between steady-state and peak exercise&#xD;
      performance in participants with tetraplegia or paraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their peak energy expenditure measured using a discontinuous step&#xD;
      test. Participants will then perform three different trials of exercise at a steady state at&#xD;
      a target intensity that corresponds with 90%, 70%, and 60% of their own measured peak energy&#xD;
      expense. Participants will exercise at the prescribed power output until fatigue.&#xD;
      Participants may choose which exercise mode they use (with all steady-state trials being in&#xD;
      the same mode as the peak test), and may choose to perform the study twice in the different&#xD;
      exercise modes. Exercise trials will be performed over a number of different sessions in a&#xD;
      randomized order, allowing for adequate rest and recovery between trials, and depending on&#xD;
      each participant's capabilities and preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II. This study will determine if high intensity interval training (HIIT) results in&#xD;
      greater energy expense than constant rate aerobic exercise, and will test if exercising with&#xD;
      HITT effects time to fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will exercise using a high intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol, which&#xD;
      involves alternating high intensity bouts of short duration with low intensity bouts of&#xD;
      longer duration. Participants will have their peak energy expenditure measured using a&#xD;
      discontinuous step test. Participants will then perform one trial of steady-state exercise at&#xD;
      a target intensity that corresponds with 50% of their peak energy expense, for a target of&#xD;
      20-45 minutes. Participants will perform a separate trial using a HIIT protocol of exercise&#xD;
      at a target intensity that corresponds with 50% of their peak energy expense interspersed&#xD;
      with bouts of high intensity (target intensity that corresponds with 90% of peak energy&#xD;
      expense) for 30-60 seconds, for a total duration target of 20-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may choose which exercise mode they use (with all trials being in the same mode&#xD;
      as the peak test), and may choose to perform the study twice in the different exercise modes.&#xD;
      Exercise trials will be performed over a number of different sessions in a randomized order,&#xD;
      allowing for adequate rest and recovery between trials, and depending on each participant's&#xD;
      capabilities and preferences.&#xD;
