  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After appendectomy was first described by Mcburney in 1889, it has been the most practiced&#xD;
      emergency surgery in the world with the lifetime incidence of acute appendicitis being&#xD;
      5%-25%. Most cases are uncomplicated cases without any complications and perforation&#xD;
      (20%-30%). Although appendectomy is still a curative therapy, medical treatment has come to&#xD;
      the fore in uncomplicated cases after improvements in imaging methods for diagnosing acute&#xD;
      appendicitis and especially the developments in antibiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment for acute appendicitis is, in fact, not a new condition. Practicing the&#xD;
      option of elective surgery following intravenous antibiotherapy for plastron appendicitis&#xD;
      that is among the complicated acute appendicitis has lead to further consideration of medical&#xD;
      treatment. A number of studies conducted for this purpose suggest that conservative treatment&#xD;
      in uncomplicated acute appendicitis may be a first-line treatment. Medical treatment of the&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute appendicitis prevents negative appendectomies, which indicates that&#xD;
      surgical removal of non-inflamed appendix ranging from 6% to 20%. In addition to preventing&#xD;
      unnecessary organ loss, it ensures eliminating postoperative complications such as intestinal&#xD;
      obstruction and wound site complications due to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immature granulocytes (IG) are monitored in peripheral blood as immature polymorphonuclear&#xD;
      cells because of the activation of bone marrow. Although their counts can be determined&#xD;
      through direct inspection, they can be provided with automated systems within complete blood&#xD;
      count parameters as well as technological developments. The increase in their number&#xD;
      specifically suggests the activation of the bone marrow and can provide information about the&#xD;
      infectious process before leukocytosis is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to determine the importance of IG count and percentage to evaluate the role&#xD;
      of medical treatment and control its success in cases of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.&#xD;

      After approval of local ethics committee (KSU Bioethics Committee, for the study with&#xD;
      protocol number 179; dated June 19, 2019; session no. 2019/11; and decision no.: 4), the&#xD;
      investigator's study was organized as a 1-year prospective randomized study. As a criterion&#xD;
      for terminating the study, the expiration of 1 year or reaching the total number of patients&#xD;
      obtained through power analysis. In the primary study endpoint, to detect a 20% difference&#xD;
      with α = 5% and ß = 20%, a total sample size of 64 patients was reported to be necessary for&#xD;
      achieving statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis over the age of 18 and treated by the same&#xD;
      surgical team were prospectively registered to Kahramanmaraş Sütçü Imam University General&#xD;
      Surgery Clinic between July 2019 and April 2020. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed with&#xD;
      history, physical examination results, laboratory results, and imaging methods&#xD;
      (Ultrasonography or Computed Tomography (CT)). As per these results, patients with Alvarado&#xD;
      Score 7 and above were diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Patients diagnosed with complicated&#xD;
      acute appendicitis based on imaging methods (such as perforation, periappendicular abscess&#xD;
      formation, and plastron formation), patients who are pregnant, patients who did not want to&#xD;
      be included were excluded from the study. Patients were informed that there were medical&#xD;
      treatment and surgical treatment options in uncomplicated acute appendicitis and written&#xD;
      consent was obtained from patients. For randomization purposes, patients were given balls to&#xD;
      draw. Using this ball drawing, patients were divided into two groups as those that would&#xD;
      receive random medical treatment (Group M) and those that would undergo direct appendectomy&#xD;
      (Group A) (Open appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy). Group M was divided into two&#xD;
      subgroups as those who responded to medical treatment within 24 h of follow-up and those who&#xD;
      failed medical treatment. The study was terminated as the total number of 64 patients was&#xD;
      reached because of power analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group A, after examining the patient in the emergency, the patient was urgently taken to&#xD;
      operation to perform appendectomy (open or laparoscopic). A complete blood count and CRP were&#xD;
      studied on patients within the first 24 h of the postoperative course. In Group M, oral&#xD;
      intake was discontinued on admission of patients to the clinic and intravenous ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      (200 mg; twice a day) and metronidazole (500 mg; three times a day), which were effective for&#xD;
      both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, were started with fluid&#xD;
      replacement. When the duration of nonsurgical follow-up is between 12 and 24 h, there is no&#xD;
      increase in the perforation risk. Considerable complications can be encountered after 48 h&#xD;
      (wound site infections, wound decomposition, and other complications). Therefore, because of&#xD;
      increased risk of perforation and the likelihood of complications as a result, the response&#xD;
      protocol for medical treatment was restricted to 24 h. During follow-up, vital signs of&#xD;
      patients were verified every 6 h. At the 24th h of follow-up, the patients were asked for&#xD;
      their complaints and physical examinations were performed. Control of complete blood count,&#xD;
      CRP, and abdominal US were performed. At the 24th hour of the follow-up, Alvarado score was&#xD;
      repeated to patients. Patients who had no regression in the clinic and laboratory results&#xD;
      (with an Alvarado score ≥ 7 and who had an appendix unresponsive to medical treatment&#xD;
      according to imaging methods (with no change in diameter or increased or developed&#xD;
      complications) were considered to be unresponsive to conservative treatment and rescue&#xD;
      appendectomy was performed. Patients with a regression in physical examination and laboratory&#xD;
      results (with calculating Alvarado score &lt;7) and those with an appendix that responded to&#xD;
      medical treatment as per imaging methods (with reduced diameter or not monitored with US)&#xD;
      were considered to have responded to conservative treatment; and oral intake was initiated&#xD;
      without surgery. . They were discharged from the hospital with a prescription of 1-week oral&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen (a combination of oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg and oral metronidazole 500 mg&#xD;
      two times daily (morning and evening)). At the end of antibiotic therapy, patients were&#xD;
      called for control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, IG count and IG% were measured using an&#xD;
      automated hematological analyzer (XN 3000; Sysmex Corp., Kobe, Japan) and CRP levels were&#xD;
      measured using an automated biochemical analyzer (Cobas C-702 module, Roche Diagnostics,&#xD;
      Basel, Sweden) from blood samples obtained at the initial admission to the emergency&#xD;
      department and the 24th hour of the follow-up. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) levels&#xD;
      were manually calculated. The IG fraction includes promyelocytes, myelocytes, and&#xD;
      metamyelocytes but not band neutrophils or myeloblasts. Moreover, DNI (IG percentage-%) is&#xD;
      the IG count to white blood cell ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Evaluation: IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences for windows, Version 20.0&#xD;
      software package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used to evaluate statistical data.&#xD;
      Therefore, 64 patients were required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 10% among&#xD;
      IG count and percentage, the means using student t-test and repeated measures ANOVA at the 0.&#xD;
      05 significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed for the suitability of patients for normal&#xD;
      distribution. Based on their suitability for normal distribution, paired sample t test was&#xD;
      used to evaluate intra-group measurements in numerical data, while student t-test and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test were used in inter-group evaluation. Repeated measurement ANOVA and&#xD;
      Scheffe's post-hoc test were used to evaluate the relationship between subgroups and&#xD;
      appendectomy group. Note that Chi square test and Fischer's exact test were used to evaluate&#xD;
      the categorical data. Numerical data were given as median (minimum - maximum), and&#xD;
      categorical data were indicated in numbers (n) and percentages (%). Statistically, p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      values were considered to be significant.&#xD;
