      This prospective multicenter cohort study is to compare the post-operative implant failure&#xD;
      rate between the patients with femoral neck fracture (AO classification 31-B) using Femoral&#xD;
      Neck System (FNS) versus Multiple Cancellous Screws (MCS) at 2-year follow up. The patients&#xD;
      are divided into the FNS group and the MCS group according to the internal fixation they&#xD;
      choose. The internal fixation failure rate (IFFR) and differences in fracture prognosis of&#xD;
      the two groups will be compared. Obtain clinical data of FNS in the Chinese population, and&#xD;
      verify the safety and efficacy of FNS for patients with femoral neck fracture.&#xD;

      This is a prospective multicenter cohort study. The team leader is Peking University Third&#xD;
      Hospital. All patients are divided into 2 groups according to the internal fixation they&#xD;
      choose. Investigators use FNS for internal fixation in Group 1 and MCS in Group 2. Since FNS&#xD;
      is clinically comparable to the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) system, investigators used DHS&#xD;
      clinical data as a statistical reference. The relevant parameters of the sample calculation&#xD;
      are α = 0.05 (one-sided) and β = 0.2. PASS 15 was used for calculation, and the final sample&#xD;
      size was 290. The FNS group and the MCS group each included 145 patients. See the text for&#xD;
      detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients that meet all the inclusion criteria but&#xD;
      do not meet any exclusion criteria, and who have signed the informed consent will be&#xD;
      recruited, and each patient will be assigned a unique patient identification number, which&#xD;
      will be used throughout the study identify the patient. Investigators will perform&#xD;
      preoperative preparation, intraoperative operation and internal fixation implantation&#xD;
      according to the instructions provided in the product packaging. Investigators only plan to&#xD;
      include cases that can successfully conduct closed reduction, therefore investigators will&#xD;
      exclude cases that require open reduction. For the MCS group, three cancellous screws with an&#xD;
      inverted triangle pattern are used to fix the fracture of femoral neck. After the operation,&#xD;
      the patients will be managed according to the standard nursing and rehabilitation procedures&#xD;
      of the experimental site and the results of laboratory tests will be recorded. Regular&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation will be performed after the operation until the end of the two-year&#xD;
      follow-up or the primary end point of the study. In this study, the internal fixation failure&#xD;
      rate (IFFR) is used as the primary end point of the study, which is defined as the total&#xD;
      incidence of internal plant cut-out and fracture. The results of the radiographic&#xD;
      examination, the lateral X-ray film and computed tomography(CT), will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      independent radiologist to determine whether there are cut-out or fracture of the internal&#xD;
      plant. Secondary endpoints include: 1. Bone nonunion after 36 weeks: evaluate bone healing&#xD;
      according to the lateral X-ray examination. According to the regulations of Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration of the US, it is defined as nonunion if there are no obvious signs of fracture&#xD;
      healing 9 months after the fracture, or if there is no obvious difference in fracture space&#xD;
      after three consecutive months. 2. Garden classification proportion, and Garden index for&#xD;
      reduction assessment. 3. Clinical prognosis: o A 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) o&#xD;
      Harris hip score. 4. Operation time, from the incision to internal fixation implanted. 5. The&#xD;
      times of intraoperative fluoroscopy, average 25 milliseconds per X-ray shot, record the&#xD;
      number of X-ray shot. 6. Postoperative adverse events within 2 years, including ipsilateral&#xD;
      femoral head avascular necrosis, infection, wound hematoma, ipsilateral coxa vara, and&#xD;
      ipsilateral limb shortening. In this study, it is difficult to blind anyone . Investigators&#xD;
      will try their best to reduce human-induced bias in experimental results. Investigators will&#xD;
      use one-sided α = 0.05 for statistical tests and confidence interval calculations. P value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. SPSS (latest version: SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      USA) will be used to analyze the results.&#xD;

    <description>Synthes Femoral Neck System (FNS) was developed with the intention to combine advantages of DHS (dynamic hip screw) and MCS (multiple cancellous screw). The FNS implants consist of plates, bolts, locking screws and antirotating-screws. The plate consists of a small base plate with one or two locking holes and a barrel portion. The barrel allows for gliding of the head elements while restricting rotation around the head-neck axis, so FNS is a fixed-angle gliding fixation device that allows for controlled collapse of the femoral neck, like DHS. The FNS was also designed to minimize implant footprint on the bone with its compact design, like MCS. Furthermore, the FNS was designed to reduce the length of incision necessary for implant insertion when compared to DHS. This new concept of femoral neck fracture fixation still emphasizes the biology of fracture healing by initial fracture compression.</description>

    <description>Multiple cancellous screws (MCS) fixation is the most common and classic method to deal with femoral neck fractures which is less invasive and retains more viable bone, compared with dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation that appears biomechanically more stable. In this study, three cancellous screws with an inverted triangle pattern are used to fix the fracture of femoral neck.</description>
