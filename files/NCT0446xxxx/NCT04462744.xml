    <textblock>
      The study aims at evaluating the effect of an oral health educational program on the&#xD;
      knowledge and self-reported protocol of primary school teachers in Beni-Suef towards&#xD;
      traumatic dental injuries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) are considered a public health concern representing 5% of&#xD;
      all injuries. According to the world health organization (WHO) about 16-40% of children&#xD;
      across the world are subjected to TDIs with the most susceptible age group between 6-12 years&#xD;
      old. Dental trauma may be caused by falls, blows to the face and sports which could be mild&#xD;
      as concussion or subluxation, or complicated as avulsion ). The majority of the injuries took&#xD;
      place at home followed by school, so teachers are one of the first to be present at the site&#xD;
      of action, making their knowledge of emergency management essential to the provision of&#xD;
      proper care to an injured child .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, in cases of avulsion of permanent tooth the proper management is to find the&#xD;
      missing tooth and immediately replant, or transport the tooth in suitable transportation&#xD;
      media, then referral to the dentist for treatment and follow up. The prognosis of such case&#xD;
      mainly depends on the time between the injury and the replantation and the media of&#xD;
      transportation . The unnecessary negative consequences of not providing proper first aid&#xD;
      management in such case could lead to more time consuming and costly treatment and in a&#xD;
      worst-case scenario permanent loss of one or more tooth . This could cause pain and have&#xD;
      significant functional, esthetic, speech, and psychological effects on children thus&#xD;
      affecting their quality of life .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have evaluated the knowledge level of schoolteachers with respect to&#xD;
      dental trauma and its emergency management concluded that teachers lack knowledge towards&#xD;
      traumatic dental injuries. They recommended establishing oral health educational programs to&#xD;
      raise the teachers' knowledge and improve their attitude towards TDIs . Other educational&#xD;
      studies showed remarkable increase knowledge after oral health educational program and that&#xD;
      is why educational programs and training are needed to improve proper management of traumatic&#xD;
      injuries by schoolteachers and avoid unnecessary negative consequences.&#xD;
