  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A collaboration gap across sectors is a common problem in Denmark and Brazil. Brazilian Heart&#xD;
      Insufficiency with Telemedicine (BRAHIT) will run in parallel with the ongoing Danish&#xD;
      Reaching the Frail Elderly project (REAFEL - NCT04162548), supported by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Higher Education and Health (Innovationsfonden - Grand Solutions), until 2021. REAFEL seeks a&#xD;
      stronger collaboration between primary care and hospital cardiologists to manage frail&#xD;
      elderly patients, using teleconsultation and data from mobile devices in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health resources are scarce in Brazil and a pressing need for the Municipal Secretary of&#xD;
      Health of Rio de Janeiro is to reduce wait times to access some areas, as cardiology. When&#xD;
      patients are stable after undergoing highly complex procedures in a tertiary hospital, are&#xD;
      discharged to outpatient treatment at primary care but, a heterogenous expansion of the&#xD;
      primary care system in the Rio de Janeiro municipality has created a great resistance from&#xD;
      the population, and among cardiologists, to accept continuing cardiology treatment at the&#xD;
      primary care system. Enhancing a collaboration between primary care and cardiologists, that&#xD;
      is tangible for the patients, can relieve this pressure. The cross-sectorial collaboration in&#xD;
      BRAHIT is based on the involvement of Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia (INC), a tertiary&#xD;
      cardiology hospital, with primary investigator Aurora Issa (INC) and primary-and homecare in&#xD;
      Rio de Janeiro, with primary investigator Leonardo Graever, Primary Care Special Advisor in&#xD;
      the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro. The project proposal originates from Denmark and sponsors&#xD;
      the project through a Danida grant (Window 2 from the Danish Foreign Ministry - Danida&#xD;
      Fellowship Center 18-M03-KU) to the cardiologist Helena Domínguez, as associate professor in&#xD;
      the Dept. of Biomedicine, UCPH, and consultant in Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being complex public health intervention studies, mixed methods are necessary to evaluate the&#xD;
      value gained in the project and to provide research-based policy briefs. The methods include&#xD;
      qualitative analyses and a cluster-randomization trial, the latter used for power&#xD;
      calculation. Such calculation is based on adequate heart failure medications aggregated in a&#xD;
      score constructed for this purpose. Secondary end-point is rate of number of readmissions for&#xD;
      any cause, after discharge with heart failure diagnosis.&#xD;

      1. AIM The aim of BRAHIT is to test a new model of care for patients with heart failure in&#xD;
           Rio de Janeiro since the investigators can apply well-defined international guidelines&#xD;
           for high-quality management of heart failure patients as success criteria, which have&#xD;
           been endorsed and adapted in Brazil. Ultimately to provide a policy advice for&#xD;
           innovative health management with telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BACKGROUND Previous clinical trials that have randomized patients to conventional care&#xD;
           or home monitoring with telemedicine solutions have failed to demonstrate a benefit of&#xD;
           telemedicine. This is probably due to a selection bias. Accordingly, if only patients&#xD;
           with high e-literacy, education and social level are selected for participating in&#xD;
           telemedicine studies, it is probable that they have maximum advantage from any&#xD;
           treatment, thus making it difficult to assess a benefit with telemedicine. In contrast,&#xD;
           weaker patients who truly need a close care remain out of reach for cardiology&#xD;
           expertise, remaining under primary care management, with scarce resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another problem is that, once the participants have access to the new healthcare&#xD;
           management to be studied, conventional management gets unavoidably changed and&#xD;
           comparison is no longer possible. Therefore, in BRAHIT, randomization will not occur at&#xD;
           the individual patient level, but through cluster randomization at the organizational&#xD;
           level of the primary care clinics. Successful multifaceted programs for heart failure&#xD;
           are based on multiple visits to cardiology outpatient clinics, and patients can be&#xD;
           safely transferred to Primary Care, but can be too strenuous for frail patients or&#xD;
           impossible in remote areas BRAHIT includes quality indicators that allow monitoring&#xD;
           quality of care; telemedicine-based tools for patient education, to enhance e-health&#xD;
           literacy and innovative communication and data-exchange to support integrated care&#xD;
           between health sectors. Telemedicine in BRAHIT can bring cardiology expertise to&#xD;
           socially frail patients and, thereby, overcome social inequality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Brazilian primary care sector is challenged with long waiting lists for referrals to&#xD;
           specialist visits, elective surgeries, and to access higher technology services . This&#xD;
           is aggravated in the last years, as Brazil is facing austerity measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Brazilian primary Health Care Model has evolved to almost 60% coverage, based on&#xD;
           Family Health Teams, composed by specialized general practitioners, a nurse, nursing&#xD;
           technicians and community health agents, while the rest are Family Health Teams with&#xD;
           &quot;generalists&quot; (under-graduated physicians).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The municipality of Rio de Janeiro, as it is particularly suitable for this project,&#xD;
           with roughly six million habitants and a large social and cultural diversity. About 80%&#xD;
           of the population has access to internet, electronic medical records and communication&#xD;
           and information technology and Homecare teams are able to use social media and blogs in&#xD;
           communicating with the local population. Therefore, it is feasible to use telemedicine&#xD;
           communication in association with homecare teams to reach the entire population living&#xD;
           in Rio de Janeiro. Furthermore, in BRAHIT, Primary care physicians training programs on&#xD;
           heart failure will be based on action mapping, with adaptive technology-enhanced&#xD;
           distance learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. METHODS Participants Patients discharged from Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia (INC)&#xD;
           with the heart failure as the primary reason for admittance (ICD-10): (DI-11.0, 13.0,&#xD;
           42.0, 42.6, 42.9, 50.0, 50.1, 50.9) and requests from Primary care to INC on questions&#xD;
           for management of patients with heart failure diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background population Rio de Janeiro State has nowadays 2,888 family health/homecare&#xD;
           teams , covering 9,695,782 (57.99%) people of the State Population, and Rio de Janeiro&#xD;
           municipality has 1.164 Family Health Teams, covering 4,016,835 people (61.61%) of the&#xD;
           city population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis A new collaboration model across sectors, using telemedicine aid, can improve&#xD;
           the quality of care management of chronic heart disease, and reach out to weak patients.&#xD;
           Concretely, the investigators test the hypothesis that the proportion of patients&#xD;
           receiving correct medications for heart failure will increase from 30% to 60% in&#xD;
           patients managed according to the BRAHIT model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize, that use of the BRAHIT model will result in&#xD;
           a reduction of number of readmissions for heart failure within 90 days after discharge&#xD;
           from 50% (current proportion of readmissions) to 30% (secondary end-point).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Project design Since BRAHIT intends a complex public health intervention, it is&#xD;
           necessary to apply mixed methods in a pragmatic manner to analyze the development and&#xD;
           impact of the intervention. During an initial feasibility phase, unmet needs will be&#xD;
           described based on ethnographic field observations on patients belonging to one Family&#xD;
           Clinic that agrees to take a role as pilot-test clinic. Equivalent observations will be&#xD;
           registered from patients discharged from INC with the selected heart failure diagnoses,&#xD;
           who belong to other Family clinics or Basic Clinics discharged from INC Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be informed that new procedures are being tested at INC Hospital. Data&#xD;
           will be gathered for all patients in current clinical settings. Cluster randomization&#xD;
           will follow with telemedicine intervention or usual care stratified by Family clinics&#xD;
           and Basic Clinics willing to participate. Patients will be followed according to which&#xD;
           primary care the patients belong to. The patients will be informed on what cluster their&#xD;
           Primary Care Clinic and invited to be followed, including interviews for at least one&#xD;
           year, until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up details&#xD;
&#xD;
           To quantify adequate use of target medications in the subgroup of patients with heart&#xD;
           failure and reduced ejection fraction, the investigators construct a Brazilian Heart&#xD;
           Insufficiency with Telemedicine (BRAHIT) score based on changes of clinical parameters,&#xD;
           where higher score indicates worsening:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NYHA: improved or I (0 points) / no improvement (1 point) / worsening (2 points)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight: closer to target or on-target (0 points) / no change +/- 1.9 Kg since last&#xD;
                measurement (1 point), increase 2 Kg or more (2 points)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ACE-I/ARB: Target dose (0 points) / tried but not reached target or not tolerated&#xD;
                (1 point) / Never used (2 points)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Betablockers: Target dose (0 points) / tried but not reached target or not&#xD;
                tolerated (1 point) / Never used (2 points)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mineralocorticoid antagonist: Target dose or not indicated (0 points) / tried but&#xD;
                not reached target or not tolerated (1 point) / Never used (2 points)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each patient record will have the option &quot;unknown&quot;, when no data are available at each&#xD;
           follow-up timepoint, to provide an indicator for data quality in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative measurements Ethnographic observations throughout the study will be recorded&#xD;
           and summarized at the end of the feasibility phase, identifying patient groups and&#xD;
           elements in the process needed to reach the patients who have difficulties to receive&#xD;
           specialized assistance when needed and an equivalent summary will be repeated based on&#xD;
           subsequent observations until the end of the study, aiming to elucidate how use of&#xD;
           low-cost technologies can equally reach frail and resourceful patients, regardless of&#xD;
           the level of health literacy. Open-questions interviews will be conducted during the&#xD;
           cluster-randomization phase to evaluate how successful the approach is from the patient&#xD;
           perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistics These are a priori calculations based on expected outcomes, and they will be&#xD;
           re-calculated based on the observations acquired during the pilot phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be described as absolute and relative frequencies, and&#xD;
           continuous variables as medians (interquartile range) or means (standard deviation)&#xD;
           according to the distribution of the variable. Normality will be evaluated with the&#xD;
           visual inspection of histograms and application of the Shapiro-Wilks test of normality.&#xD;
           Comparison of categorical variables will be analyzed with the Fisher exact test or&#xD;
           chi-square for the relationship between intervention and outcomes, whereas continuous&#xD;
           variables will be analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. To assess the relationship&#xD;
           between intervention and outcomes the investigators will construct models of analysis of&#xD;
           variance (ANOVA). These tests will be calculated as two-tailed, and p values &lt; 0,05 will&#xD;
           be considered significant. For evolution over time the investigators will perform&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier tests. The investigators use SAS, R and STATA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculations for primary outcome Mortality and risk of readmission can be&#xD;
           decreased roughly by 10% when patients are managed by multidisciplinary teams, compared&#xD;
           to primary care management. There are no currently available data for an accurate power&#xD;
           calculation for the population of Rio De Janeiro. Yet, based on the BREATH registry,&#xD;
           almost 50% of the patients admitted with heart failure diagnosis are re-admitted to the&#xD;
           hospital within 90 days after discharge, in most cases due to lack of use of relevant&#xD;
           heart failure medications. Accordingly, 30% of patients in the cohort were admitted due&#xD;
           to inadequate medicines for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assuming a similar success to that dedicated clinics, use of beta-blockers, the most&#xD;
           triggered treatment compliance due to side effects, can rise from less than 40% to 89%&#xD;
           (Danish experience) or from 35 to 42% (Germany). Based on these effects, and counting on&#xD;
           two parallel clusters, managing 26 patients in the novel collaborative BRAHIT model,&#xD;
           there should be an improvement of adherence to the treatment from 30% to 60%, three&#xD;
           months after discharge, with 90% power and a significance level of 5%. This shall be&#xD;
           re-calculated with most recent data at the end of BRAHIT feasibility phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes In addition to the 30% admissions due to inadequate medications, many&#xD;
           re-admissions may be due to insecurity from the primary care side. The investigators&#xD;
           expect that the BRAHIT intervention provides a 20% absolute reduction of readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PUBLICATIONS AND DISSEMINATION The protocol and the results of the pilot phase of BRAHIT&#xD;
           will be published in international peer-reviewed journals, the latter according to the&#xD;
           extended CONSORT checklist for quantitative measurements. The findings and the evolution&#xD;
           of the project will be described following the Template for Intervention Description and&#xD;
           Replication (TIDieR) checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the project aims a high outreach through presentation in popular scientific&#xD;
      media for the broader public and to publish a short policy advise that can facilitate&#xD;
      implementation of the findings in BRAHIT.&#xD;
