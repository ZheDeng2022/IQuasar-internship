  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are investigating the use of a virtual reality programme to reduce pain and anxiety&#xD;
      experienced during manual vacuum aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment&#xD;
      that can be interacted with in a seemingly real way by a person using special electronic&#xD;
      equipment. In this study a VR headset is worn by the patient allowing them to experience a&#xD;
      relaxing environment whilst the procedure manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR is mostly used in computer gaming but has uses in medical field and has been used in the&#xD;
      treatment of long standing pain, treatment of burns, dentistry and treatment of cancer pain.&#xD;
      However, its role in the management of pain and anxiety during gynaecological procedures like&#xD;
      manual vacuum aspiration has not been researched. This study explores whether it has a place&#xD;
      in the treatment of gynaecological pain and reduction of anxiety.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many simple gynaecological procedures can be performed in an outpatient setting without the&#xD;
      need for general anaesthesia. Such office-based procedures include outpatient hysteroscopy,&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy, large-loop-excision of the transformation zone and manual vacuum&#xD;
      aspiration for the management of miscarriage. Advantages experienced by patients include&#xD;
      reduced anaesthetic risk, enhanced recovery time and flexibility of timings. For the&#xD;
      healthcare provider there are significant cost benefits on the basis of reduced theatre time,&#xD;
      staff and equipment. Patient satisfaction is generally high but influenced by their&#xD;
      experience of pain and feelings of anxiety before, during and after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is to invetsigate the role of distraction techniques and the&#xD;
      feasibility of using virtual reality for the management of acute pain and anxiety experienced&#xD;
      by patients undergoing manual vacuum aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Feasibility of using virtual reality as a distraction technique in management of acute pain&#xD;
      and anxiety in patients undergoing manual vacuum aspiration for miscarriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding the acceptability and effectiveness of VR interventions in office&#xD;
           gynaecology procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding the factors that might influence the willingness of patients to&#xD;
           participate in a future formal trial of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding how best to implement the technology and designing of the contents of the&#xD;
           VR intervention.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients: Clinical indications for undergoing an MVA will be confirmed. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
        will include all women of 18 - 50 years of age, planned for a MVA who are able and willing&#xD;
        to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hearing impairments and blindness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of epilepsy or any previous seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known anatomical characteristics that may make performing the office procedure&#xD;
             more difficult (e.g., cervical conisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known characteristics that make the patient unsuitable for undergoing MVA (e.g.&#xD;
             known bleeding disorder, gestation &gt;12 weeks)&#xD;
