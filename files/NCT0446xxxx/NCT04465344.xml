  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multicentric, prospective open-label ethics committee approved clinical&#xD;
      study to investigate safety, visual outcomes, contrast sensitivity and rotational stability&#xD;
      after bilateral implantation of Isatis TF IOL following cataract surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a staged, multicentric, controlled, prospective, open-label clinical study whereby&#xD;
      patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of hydrophobic&#xD;
      acrylic refractive trifocal intraocular lenses (Isatis TF) or the monofocal control device&#xD;
      Isatis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device, Control lens and all study products, including the devices used&#xD;
      for the study examinations, will be used within the intended use specifications from the&#xD;
      manufacturer. In addition, no invasive or other burdening examinations will occur for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in up to five clinical centers in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device under investigation is a hydrophobic acrylic trifocal intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      manufactured by the sponsor of this study. The trifocality of this investigational device is&#xD;
      based on a purely refractive principle with the goal to provide additional near and&#xD;
      intermediate visual acuity with low photic side effects. The IOLs will be implanted in the&#xD;
      course of routine cataract surgery and will benefit to patients suffering from cataract&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control device (Isatis) is a hydrophobic acrylic monofocal intraocular lens to be&#xD;
      implanted during cataract surgery. This control lens is CE approved and commercially&#xD;
      available in Spain. Isatis monofocal lens is the parent lens of the device under&#xD;
      investigation and both lenses share mechanical and material properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 180 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and undergo bilateral&#xD;
      implantation of the Isatis TF intraocular lens or Isatis lens in a 2:1 ratio. Subjects&#xD;
      participating in the trial will attend a total of maximum 11 study visits over a period of&#xD;
      11-13 months. Subjects would have the option for unscheduled visits if required medically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses will be performed after the last patient finished the 120-180 days&#xD;
      postoperative examination.&#xD;

With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined.

With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined. Following conditions shall be examined with the slitlamp:&#xD;

    <measure>IOL rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>day of surgery, 1-2 days postoperative, 7-14 days postoperative, 30-60 days postoperative, 120-180 days postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the rotational stability of the lenses after implantation, the actual IOL orientation has to be recorded as the intended surgical position during surgery using a photograph through the surgery microscope or within one hour after surgery using a photograph through a slit lamp to document the rotational position of the IOL. Additional orientations are measured and recorded at the follow up visits by taking retroilluminated photographs in mydriasis using the slit lamp.&#xD;
To determine the rotational stability, it is important that the IOL axis marks of the IOL are visible as well as concurrent structures of the eye (in the same image) that are fixed and stable. Preferred fixed structures are limbal vessels. The pupil is dilated if necessary to visualize the IOL axis marks.</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative, 120-180 days postoperative, 330-420 days postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A Halo and Glare simulator software (Eyeland Design Network GmbH, Germany) will be used to assess the subjective perception of photic phenomena. The patients will be asked to adjust the halo and glare level in a simulated image to the amount they perceive of such photic phenomena. This test is performed pre- and postoperatively. The preoperative outcomes serve as a baseline measurement.</description>
