  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of adavosertib and how well it&#xD;
      works when given in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with esophageal&#xD;
      or gastroesophageal junction cancer for which no treatment is currently available&#xD;
      (incurable). Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and&#xD;
      shrink tumors. Giving adavosertib together with radiation therapy kill more tumor cells than&#xD;
      radiation therapy alone in treating patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximally tolerated dose of adavosertib (AZD1775) to be used in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy for patients with esophageal/gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      (GEJ) cancer that is metastatic or inoperable and not eligible for definitive chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the efficacy of AZD1775 when&#xD;
      administered in combination with radiation therapy by assessing changes in Ogilvie dysphagia&#xD;
      score following treatment, time to second intervention for dysphagia, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify biomarkers that are predictive for response to experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of adavosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days per week for 3 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive adavosertib orally&#xD;
      (PO) QD for 2-5 days (depending on dose level) during weeks 1 and 3 of radiation therapy in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;

          -  Patients with a life expectancy &gt; 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 8 weeks prior to treatment&#xD;

                  calculated per institutional standards) obtained from an ECG (Note: if one ECG&#xD;
                  demonstrates a QTcF &gt; 480 msec, then a mean QTcF of =&lt; 480 msec obtained from 3&#xD;
                  ECGs 2-5 minutes apart, is required at study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with congenital long QT syndrome are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AZD1775 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for 2 weeks prior to study drug exposure,&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 1 month after completing treatment. Women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum&#xD;
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 1 week of registration. Should&#xD;
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation and for 3 months after completion of treatment.&#xD;
             Male patients should not donate sperm during exposure to study drug and for 3 months&#xD;
             after study drug discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to starting study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to AZD1775&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD1775 is a WEE1 inhibiting agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with AZD1775, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with AZD1775. These potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior thoracic or abdominal radiation therapy for cancer that would result in&#xD;
             significant overlap of radiation therapy fields at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with a history of Torsades de pointes&#xD;
             unless all risk factors contributed to Torsades have been corrected. AZD1775 has not&#xD;
             been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to&#xD;
             affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 will be determined following review&#xD;
             by the principal investigator&#xD;
