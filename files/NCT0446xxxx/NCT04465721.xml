  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of American adults have overweight or obesity and are at high risk of developing&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Although caloric restriction has many health&#xD;
      benefits, it is difficult to sustain overtime for most people. Time restricted eating (TRE),&#xD;
      a novel type of intermittent fasting, facilitates adherence to the intervention and results&#xD;
      in weight loss and improvement of metabolism. The investigators propose to to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of self monitoring and TRE (10-h/d) vs. self-monitoring and habitual prolonged&#xD;
      eating duration ( HABIT) (13 hours/d) on weight loss and body composition, metabolic function&#xD;
      and circadian biology, in metabolically unhealthy adults aged 50 to 75 y old, with overweight&#xD;
      or obesity. The investigators hypothesize that TRE, compared to habitual long duration of&#xD;
      eating, will decrease cardiovascular risk burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      American adults have a high prevalence of overweight, obesity and prediabetes. Small weight&#xD;
      loss delays the progression to type 2 diabetes and decrease cardiovascular risk, yet&#xD;
      adherence to long term calorie restriction is difficult to sustain. There is an urgency to&#xD;
      find effective, easy-to implement and sustain, and affordable life style interventions.&#xD;
      Restricting the food intake interval, or time restricted eating (TRE) has been shown in&#xD;
      small-scale pilot studies to result in weight loss and improve metabolism, while being less&#xD;
      challenging than calorie count. We propose to rigorously assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      sustainability of self-monitoring with and without TRE, administered via a smartphone&#xD;
      application, on weight loss and decreased cardiovascular risk. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      metabolically unhealthy mid-life adults with overweight or obesity who habitually eat for&#xD;
      more than 13h/day, will be randomized to a self monitoring and restricted eating window to&#xD;
      10h/d (TRE) or to a self-monitoring and habitual eating window (13h, HABIT), and followed up&#xD;
      to 12 months. Ambulatory measures of food intake, sleep, physical activity and glucose, and&#xD;
      outpatient well controlled studies will be done to determine the effect of TRE versus&#xD;
      habitual eating duration (HABIT), as well as the mediators of these effects. Hypotheses: 1)&#xD;
      TRE vs. HABIT will result in decreased fat mass, measured by quantitative magnetic resonance,&#xD;
      and effect mediated via decreased daily total energy intake, measured by double labeled&#xD;
      water; 2) TRE vs. HABIT will result in lower insulin resistance, lower glycemia and shift in&#xD;
      fuel utilization preferentially to lipid mobilization; 3) Adherence to the TRE intervention&#xD;
      will be associated with greater weight loss at 3 months and weight maintenance at 12 months.&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide important insights into understanding the physiological&#xD;
      and molecular interactions between restricting daily eating interval and metabolic function,&#xD;
      and could provide evidence for using TRE interventions to improve metabolic health and&#xD;
      decrease cardiovascular risk in the large number of mid-life and older Americans in great&#xD;
      need of life style intervention.&#xD;
