      Overall study aim of this study is to analyse descriptive statistics of Patient-Reported&#xD;
      Outcome（PROs） which will be used in the Hyperkalemia（HK） registry study in hyperkalemia&#xD;
      patients with Chronic Kidney Disease（CKD） or Heart Failure（HF） to describe the practice&#xD;
      patterns of hyperkalemia treatment in in clinical practice. Based on these assessments, this&#xD;
      study will provide the information for the applicability of PRO measurements which will be&#xD;
      used in the Hyperkalemia registry study to the study population, i.e. CKD and/or HF patients&#xD;
      with hyperkalemia&#xD;

        This study will include patients with hyperkalemia treated at outpatient clinics. Eligible&#xD;
        patients will be screened through the regular visit to study sites in a consecutive manner.&#xD;
        This study will be conducted in outpatient clinics in general hospitals. 150 hyperkalemia&#xD;
        patients with CKD or HFrEF will be enrolled and assessed cross-sectionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        After the written informed consent, subjects will be asked to complete the&#xD;
        questionnaire-based survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL), compliance to treatment with potassium binders,&#xD;
        and other factors including age, sex, height, weight, smoking status, alcohol use and&#xD;
        socio-economic status will be collected through the designated questionnaires. Information&#xD;
        on disease status and on treatment patterns will be collected from physicians, and the&#xD;
        latest results of laboratory tests will be collected from medical records (within 6 months&#xD;
        before enrolment).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatients aged ≥20 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperkalemia patients defined as meeting either of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Having a history of S-K ≥5.1 mmol/L ≥2 times within 6 months before enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Having a history of S-K ≥5.5 mmol/L once within 6 months before enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Currently treated by potassium binders for the treatment of hyperkalemia at&#xD;
                  enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having been diagnosed as CKD (≥stage 3b) or HFrEF by investigators as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        CKD is diagnosed based on the guidelines of CKD issued by the Japanese Society of&#xD;
        Nephrology (JSN, 2018) as being either or both of condition 1 and 2 for ≥3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clear sign of kidney impairment based on urinalysis, imaging, blood test, or biopsy.&#xD;

             creatinine, gender, and age using following the formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        eGFR creat (mL/min/1.73m2) = 194 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)-1.094 x age (years)-0.287 (for&#xD;

             potassium supplements within 6 months before enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy or life expectancy of less than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have GI disturbance/chronic diarrhoea/stoma, and investigators determine&#xD;
             those affect significantly serum K level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have autoimmune disorders, and investigators determine those affect&#xD;
             significantly serum K level&#xD;
