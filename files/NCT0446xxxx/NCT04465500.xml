  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is trying to find out if the combination of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT),&#xD;
      MRI guided high dose radiation (HDR) brachytherapy treatment (internal radiation implant&#xD;
      procedure) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) treatments lead to less side effects.&#xD;
      This study is also looking at patient outcomes, quality of life, and overall survival for&#xD;
      patients receiving this treatment.&#xD;

    <description>EBRT will be administered every 5 consecutive days for 5 consecutive weeks. This is standard of care practice for this therapy. This may be revised as applicable per treating physician discretion. The dose of radiation will be in accordance with standard clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of prostate cancer.</description>

    <description>HDR brachytherapy will be administered per standard clinical practice (per NCCN guidelines version 1.2020 for prostate cancer), however standard clinical practice may vary between clinicians. Therefore, the dose of 15Gy in 1 fraction and a set of dosimetry guidelines are to be followed for the purposes of this study. A diagnostic MRI will be co-registered with Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) to perform the HDR brachytherapy.</description>

             orchiectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has had prior radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, to the region of this&#xD;
             study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has had previous or concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer&#xD;
             (prior chemotherapy for different cancer is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has MRI incompatible metallic implant(s) that cannot be removed.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Transmural myocardial infarction within 6 months (180 days) of registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time&#xD;
                  of registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness&#xD;
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration&#xD;
&#xD;

                  or severe liver dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition. The&#xD;
                  need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the&#xD;
                  treatments involved in this protocol may be slightly immunosuppressive.&#xD;
                  Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.&#xD;
