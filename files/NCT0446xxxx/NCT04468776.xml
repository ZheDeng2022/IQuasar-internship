    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized (1:1:1) comparative effectiveness trial of medication (zolpidem or&#xD;
      trazodone), cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and the combination&#xD;
      (medication + CBT-I) for the treatment of chronic insomnia in men and women aged 18-80 living&#xD;
      in rural areas with 1 year of follow-up. A total of 1200 participants will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized in the United States. This trial is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes&#xD;
      Research Institute.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common health problem that causes distress, impaired function, and increased&#xD;
      risk for other health problems. Chronic insomnia is defined by problems with the quality or&#xD;
      amount of sleep, including difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and/or awakening&#xD;
      early and being unable to return to sleep. In developing this application, patients,&#xD;
      providers, payors, and the investigators identified both concerns and opportunities with&#xD;
      current treatments for chronic insomnia. Medications and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy for&#xD;
      insomnia (CBT-I; a treatment program to improve sleep through changes in behavior and&#xD;
      thinking) are both effective for treating insomnia. Zolpidem, the most frequently prescribed&#xD;
      insomnia medication, is widely available, but may cause side effects and dependency.&#xD;
      Trazodone is increasingly prescribed off-label for treatment of insomnia, but evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety is more limited. CBT-I is the recommended first line treatment by many&#xD;
      professional organizations, but it is not widely available in physicians' practices.&#xD;
      Patients, providers, and payors face important unanswered questions: Which treatment should&#xD;
      be used for the treatment of chronic insomnia? Is combination therapy more effective, and&#xD;
      does it result in lower zolpidem use? Who responds best to which treatment? These dilemmas&#xD;
      are particularly relevant to patients and providers in rural areas, where access to&#xD;
      behavioral health specialists is limited, and concerns regarding use of controlled substances&#xD;
      is particularly acute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, we propose the study, Comparative Effectiveness of&#xD;
      Zolpidem/Trazodone and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Rural Adults (COZI). The&#xD;
      investigators will use a well-tested Internet version of CBT-I, which is just as effective as&#xD;
      in-person CBT-I, but more widely available. The aims of COZI are to: 1: Compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of medication preference (zolpidem or trazodone), CBT-I, and combination&#xD;
      treatment for insomnia symptoms over 12 months. 2: Compare the effectiveness of medication&#xD;
      preference, CBT-I, and combination treatment for other symptoms and problems, including&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, mood, and health outcomes. 3: Compare the side effects of&#xD;
      medication preference, CBT-I, and combination treatment. 4: Conduct an exploratory analysis&#xD;
      of heterogeneity of treatment effects for common factors (age, gender, socio-economic status,&#xD;
      degree or rurality, and other factors). COZI will study 1200 patients (400 per treatment)&#xD;
      recruited from 8 health care systems across the country, each of which has established&#xD;
      practices in rural areas. Patients will be treated with medication prescribed by their own&#xD;
      physician (zolpidem or trazodone), Internet CBT-I, or a combination of the two. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate treatment effects at 9 weeks, and 6 and 12 months (with limited&#xD;
      additional assessments for adverse events and medication use at 1 and 9 months). Our study&#xD;
      questions and design reflect early and ongoing engagement of key stakeholders including&#xD;
      patients, providers, and payors, who are members of the Study Advisory Committee (SAC). SAC&#xD;
      members will work with study investigators to recommend the best strategies for recruiting&#xD;
      patients, measuring treatment effects, and disseminating study findings. The SAC will meet&#xD;
      quarterly. Patients and other stakeholders have already provided guidance on which treatments&#xD;
      are most worth studying, and which symptoms would best reflect the effects of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients and other stakeholders will also be part of the Steering Committee, which is the&#xD;
      main decision-making group for our study, and which will meet monthly. COZI will lead to&#xD;
      answers for patients and providers addressing insomnia; improved health and function for&#xD;
      millions of rural Americans; and sustainable changes in how insomnia is treated in rural&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
