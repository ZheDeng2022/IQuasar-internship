  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undertreated patient symptoms and resulting acute care use require approaches that improve&#xD;
      symptom-burden. Previously a lay health worker (LHW)-led symptom screening intervention was&#xD;
      developed for patients with cancer. In pilot work, the intervention was associated with&#xD;
      improvements in patient symptom burden and reductions in healthcare use and costs of care at&#xD;
      the end of life. This intervention will be expanded across several clinics to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the LHW intervention on with cancer and the LHW will be trained to refer patients&#xD;
      to palliative care. This randomized intervention will evaluate the effect on healthcare use,&#xD;
      total costs, palliative care and hospice referral.&#xD;

      All patients with newly diagnosed cancer, over the age of 75 with a medical record number&#xD;
      ending in an odd number up to 200 patients will be included in the CareMore Pilot 2 Program.&#xD;
      Any patients who decline to participate will be excluded from the 200 patients in the&#xD;
      CareMore Pilot 2 Program. The first 200 patients who do not qualify will be the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
