  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BTK inhibition and checkpoint blockade are promising classes of therapy for central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) lymphoma and have demonstrated efficacy with acceptable toxicity. A multidrug&#xD;
      approach may carry a higher chance of durable efficacy in this aggressive disease that&#xD;
      carries significant morbidity and mortality. Given the poor outcomes and limited options for&#xD;
      patients who are not candidates for high-dose methotrexate, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      evaluate the combination in this patient population.&#xD;
