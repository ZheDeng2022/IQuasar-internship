      Randomized, controlled treatment with an intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4mg) insert&#xD;
      following cataract surgery with intraocular lens implant (IOL) combined with minimally&#xD;
      invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), specifically iStent, iStent inject or KDB in patients with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To determine treatment and patient reported outcomes, following cataract surgery with&#xD;
      intraocular lens implant in conjunction with minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) more&#xD;
      specifically iStent, iStent inject or KDB with an intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4 mg)&#xD;
      insert, inserted four days (+/- 1 day) prior to surgery as compared to insertion on day of&#xD;
      surgery. Patients with either primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension&#xD;
      (OHTN) requiring cataract surgery with IOL implant, will be separated into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4 mg) insertion four days (+/- 1 day) prior to&#xD;
      cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implant and MIGS (iStent, iStent inject or KDB)&#xD;
      insertion. (Patient to use antibiotic three days prior to surgery) Group 2: intracanalicular&#xD;
      dexamethasone (0.4 mg) insertion on the day of cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      implant and MIGS (iStent, iStent inject or KDB) insertion. (Patient to use antibiotic three&#xD;
      days prior to surgery)&#xD;
