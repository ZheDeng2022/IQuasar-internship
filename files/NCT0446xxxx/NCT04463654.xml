  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue&#xD;
      without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned, is an increasing health&#xD;
      care problem in Denmark. Approximately 20 % of Danish adolescents report a history of NSSI at&#xD;
      some point in their lives. Individuals with NSSI have an increased risk of suicidality.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of great importance to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      low-cost app in reducing NSSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to investigate whether treatment as usual (TAU) and the Zero Self-Harm app is&#xD;
      superior to TAU in reducing 1) frequency of NSSI-episodes and 2) suicide ideation, and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in individuals with NSSI. As people with NSSI, without a comorbid&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnosis, are not eligible to receive psychiatric treatment in Denmark, TAU&#xD;
      includes many different treatments and counseling services, i.e. counseling at non-profit&#xD;
      organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment services for&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, and care, information and attention at emergency departments. Common&#xD;
      to them all is that they do not offer specialized treatment focused on NSSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed as a 2-arm, parallel group, 6 months, randomized clinical superiority&#xD;
      trial. A total of 280 participants, 140 in each arm, will be included. One group will receive&#xD;
      TAU, the other will receive TAU and the Zero Self-Harm App. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      through non-profit organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment&#xD;
      services, and psychiatric and somatic emergency departments in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are engagement in two or more episodes of NSSI in the past month, no&#xD;
      further planned treatment, have a smartphone, fluent in Danish, provide an informed written&#xD;
      consent, age above 18 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate whether the introduction of the Zero Self-harm app&#xD;
      to individuals with NSSI in Denmark, can 1) reduce the frequency of NSSI-episodes, 2) prevent&#xD;
      escalation of NSSI and 3) reduce suicide ideation, and depressive symptoms, compared to&#xD;
      treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that Zero Self-Harm will reduce the frequency of NSSI-episodes&#xD;
      by enhancing participants skills to avoid impulsive urges resulting in NSSI. Thereby, the app&#xD;
      will help deal with negative affect and trait impulsivity, core features in the etiology of&#xD;
      NSSI, and further decrease associated symptoms, e.g. suicide ideation and depression. We&#xD;
      expect that the Zero Self-Harm app will be able to reduce the mean monthly frequency of NSSI&#xD;
      in the intervention group by at least 3 episodes. Thus, we hypothesize that the Zero&#xD;
      Self-Harm app will be superior to the control condition in 1) reducing the frequency of&#xD;
      NSSI-episodes, 2) preventing escalation of NSSI and 3) reducing suicide ideation, and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: The trial is designed as a 2-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, pragmatic,&#xD;
      randomized clinical superiority trial. Based on the power calculation listed below, a total&#xD;
      of 280 participants, 140 in each arm, should be included. One group will receive the Zero&#xD;
      Self-Harm app by downloading a specific link sent to them after randomization, and the&#xD;
      control group will be allocated to a wait-list and allowed to download the app after they&#xD;
      have finished the last questionnaire at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Recruitment will be broad and target both individuals with shorter duration and&#xD;
      milder symptoms of NSSI, possibly not in contact with mental health facilities, and&#xD;
      individuals with more severe and chronic NSSI, already in contact with mental health&#xD;
      facilities in Denmark. Recruitment will be done through non-profit organizations, service&#xD;
      centres in municipalities, schools for adolescents above 18, outpatient clinics for&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric and somatic emergency departments in Denmark.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be conducted through non-profit organizations' websites and social media&#xD;
      platforms, as well as providing information about the project through presentations at&#xD;
      schools, posters at relevant recruitment facilities and encouraging personnel to refer&#xD;
      potential participants when meeting people with NSSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment and randomization: Enrolment will be done by the research assistant when contacted&#xD;
      by potential participants via email or telephone. Participants will be encouraged not to send&#xD;
      personal information through email and only over the phone, to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given oral and written information about the study, time for&#xD;
      consideration and the possibility for an appointment with a next of kin before deciding to&#xD;
      enrol in the project. Consent will be obtained by sending an e-mail from REDCap to the&#xD;
      trusted Danish secure platform e-boks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After filling out the baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the waitlist control group or the Zero Self-harm app, with a 1:1 allocation, using a&#xD;
      computer-generated sequence randomization generator in REDCap. The randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by sex and number of previous NSSI-episodes (based on the baseline score of the&#xD;
      DSHI) to avoid overrepresentation of patients with a high number og NSSI in one treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor the research&#xD;
      assistant can be blinded in this trial, and neither primary nor explorative outcomes can be&#xD;
      blinded. An employee outside the research team will extract data from REDCap at study&#xD;
      completion to two separate excel-sheets, and group allocation will be coded with A and B, to&#xD;
      ensure blinding of the research assistant while analysing data, drawing conclusions and&#xD;
      drafting the first manuscript. Blinding will be lifted once drafting of the first manuscript&#xD;
      has been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: When randomized to the Zero Self-Harm app the participants will receive an&#xD;
      email with a link to download the app and an introduction via an instruction manual, in&#xD;
      addition to instruction videos implemented in the app. This will ensure the navigation and&#xD;
      knowledge of the technicalities of the app. Participants in the waitlist control group will&#xD;
      receive no study intervention but will be offered the possibility to download the Zero&#xD;
      Self-Harm app after they have finished the last questionnaire at 6 months. This will be&#xD;
      stressed at the initial appointment as well as after the collection of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: Above-mentioned outcome measures are collected at baseline and 3- and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up through self-administered internet-based questionnaires from REDCap.&#xD;
      Participants will receive an e-mail with a link to the online survey, where they can log on&#xD;
      to a secure data portal, REDCap, with a personal trial id-number and a two step-code. To&#xD;
      improve the response rate, two email reminders are sent out automatically, and if&#xD;
      participants still have not answered the questionnaire, they will receive a phone call from&#xD;
      the research assistant encouraging them to answer the questionnaire. When data collection is&#xD;
      finished, all data from the participants will be imported to a local secured drive with&#xD;
      limited access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, there will be a continuous data collection with information about the usage of the&#xD;
      app, and register-based data will be collected through the Danish National Hospital Register&#xD;
      and the Cause of Death Register. App use and register-based outcomes, such as mortality and&#xD;
      admission to psychiatric and/or somatic emergency departments, will be assessed at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be aware of potential harms of the app, the 20 first participants receiving the Zero&#xD;
      Self-harm app will receive a call after they have completed the last questionnaire at&#xD;
      6-months, and interviewed about their experiences of the app. These interviews will be&#xD;
      analysed for possible harms, and the results will be discussed in the research group which&#xD;
      will then decide on whether or not to continue the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: Primary outcome is the mean difference in the monthly frequency of NSSI after&#xD;
      6 months. We expect that participants in the intervention group will have a mean score that&#xD;
      is 3.5 points lower compared to participants in the TAU group at follow-up after 6 months.&#xD;
      The mean score is based on clinical experience and estimates from a previous study&#xD;
      investigating the interventions ability to reduce monthly NSSI episodes (45). Based on&#xD;
      previous publications, we expect a post-intervention standard deviation of 9. If the true&#xD;
      difference in the experimental and control means is 3.5, we will need to include 140&#xD;
      participants for each group to a total of 280 participants to be able to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis, that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with a&#xD;
      probability of 0,1. The Type I error probability associated with this test is 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Analysis of the primary outcome will be conducted according to the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle: All participants will be included in the final analysis&#xD;
      according to group assignment regardless of adherence to treatment. This study has multiple&#xD;
      assessment points and for the primary analysis, we will use repeated measurements in a mixed&#xD;
      model with unstructured variance. This procedure can handle baseline differences and missing&#xD;
      data. For participants with missing data in two or more data points, we will identify&#xD;
      potential differences to participants with full data and include these variables as potential&#xD;
      confounders in secondary analysis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be conducted in SPSS, version 22.0. Confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      presented as well as significance level. All tests will be two-tailed and p values below 0.5&#xD;
      will be considered significant and interpreted with respect to hierarchy of hypothesis&#xD;
      recognizing that all outcomes, apart from the primary, are exploratory .&#xD;
