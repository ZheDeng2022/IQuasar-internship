  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      watching streamed videos through virtual reality (VR) goggles during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be used to evaluate whether video-streaming services on VR&#xD;
      goggles are worthwhile additions to standard anesthesia care during total knee surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usual anesthetic care for total knee replacement involves intravenous sedation as well as&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. In this study, participants will receive usual care, and in addition, will&#xD;
      be asked to wear VR goggles once they arrive in the operating room. Participants will choose&#xD;
      from a selection of 10 shows and movies to watch for the duration of the surgery&#xD;
      (approximately 2 hours).&#xD;
