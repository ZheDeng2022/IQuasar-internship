  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia affects 30-40% of hospitalized patients. Despite the fact that basal/bolus&#xD;
      insulin therapy has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      patients, achieving good glucose control remains a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines the effects of Fiasp (a faster acting insulin) on blood sugars after&#xD;
      meals compared to another type of insulin known as Novolog. The study will be performed in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital, who are not in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, and who are being seen by the inpatient diabetes consult team. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be treated with Fiasp or Novolog injected multiple times a day before meals and at&#xD;
      bedtime, in addition to a once daily injection of insulin glargine as basal insulin. Which&#xD;
      type of meal time insulin (Fiasp vs Novolog) the subject gets is decided by chance, like the&#xD;
      flip of a coin. Insulin doses will be started and titrated based on a protocol. All the&#xD;
      subjects will wear a blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)) sensor placed in their arm&#xD;
      which they will wear for 72 hours during the study. The glucose values from the CGM,&#xD;
      collected during the time it is worn, will be downloaded and compared to assess the response&#xD;
      to the two different types of insulins - Fiasp and Novolog. The goal is to determine if Fiasp&#xD;
      works as well as or better than Novolog in controlling blood sugars, particularly after&#xD;
      meals, in the subjects of the study.&#xD;
