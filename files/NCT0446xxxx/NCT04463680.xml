  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important for women taking rifampin to be aware if they are at greater risk of an&#xD;
      unintended pregnancy while on the implant. An unintended pregnancy has many social,&#xD;
      emotional, and financial impacts on women and society. Rifampin is also a Class C medication&#xD;
      for pregnancy and could have potential negative effects on a developing fetus. Additionally,&#xD;
      women considering rifampin for treatment of LTBI face additional risks with an unintended&#xD;
      pregnancy, making the reliability of contraception even more important for these women. The&#xD;
      results of this study can directly inform counseling on a national and international basis&#xD;
      for women who use the contraceptive implant and are considering their treatment options for&#xD;
      LTBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rifampin is an antibiotic historically prescribed as part of a treatment regimen for active&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) infection. Though active TB infections have become rarer over time in the&#xD;
      US, it is estimated that up to 13 million people in the US may have latent TB infections&#xD;
      (LTBIs), with even greater numbers of LTBIs worldwide1. In efforts to combat the persistent&#xD;
      rate of LTBI, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released updated&#xD;
      treatment guidelines for LTBI in 20181. This recommended treatment guideline consists of four&#xD;
      treatment regimens, varying in duration from 3 to 9 months. The CDC recommends utilization of&#xD;
      the shorter regimens when possible to achieve higher patient compliance and infection clear&#xD;
      rates. The second shortest duration treatment regimen (4 months) consists of daily rifampin&#xD;
      only1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its antitubercular properties, rifampin is a known strong cytochrome P-450&#xD;
      (CYP) 3A4 enzyme inducer2. Similar to other strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g.&#xD;
      carbamazepine), rifampin can affect the serum concentrations of exogenous steroid hormones&#xD;
      found in hormonal contraception2. The only published literature on the interaction between&#xD;
      rifampin and hormonal contraception has focused on combined oral contraceptives3. Five&#xD;
      studies that investigated the pharmacokinetics of combined oral contraceptives all found&#xD;
      significant reductions in serum ethinyl estradiol and progestin concentrations with rifampin&#xD;
      co-administration3. This pharmacokinetic effect is significant enough to warrant a category 3&#xD;
      recommendation (theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages) from the CDC&#xD;
      Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraceptive Use for concomitant rifampin and&#xD;
      combined hormonal contraceptive methods4. This pharmacokinetic effect is large enough to&#xD;
      raise concerns for combined hormonal contraceptive method efficacy and recommendation of&#xD;
      alternative methods. One of those alternative methods is the etonogestrel (ENG) implant&#xD;
      (Nexplanon®), which has a category 2 recommendation in the CDC MEC for concomitant rifampin&#xD;
      use4. However, in the clarifications for this recommendation, the CDC MEC warns that rifampin&#xD;
      is &quot;likely to reduce the effectiveness&quot; of the ENG implant, with no supporting evidence&#xD;
      provided4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior work found that a strong CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine) caused clinically significant&#xD;
      reductions in serum etonogestrel concentrations among contraceptive implant users5. The&#xD;
      investigators found a median decrease in serum ENG of 61% (range 25-87) with 8/10&#xD;
      participants having serum ENG concentrations &lt;90pg/mL after concomitant carbamazepine5.&#xD;
      Though there is currently no published data on the pharmacokinetic interaction between&#xD;
      rifampin and the ENG implant, given its similar enzyme induction properties, there is concern&#xD;
      that the CDC MEC recommendation for rifampin and the ENG implant may underestimate the&#xD;
      potential risk for contraceptive failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the social, financial, and healthcare costs of unintended pregnancies, it is imperative&#xD;
      that the investigators better understand the drug-drug interaction between rifampin and the&#xD;
      ENG implant. Especially in light of the contradictory category 2 recommendation and&#xD;
      clarification in the CDC MEC4, more data are needed to determine if rifampin has a&#xD;
      significant enough pharmacokinetic effect on the ENG implant to potentially cause&#xD;
      contraceptive failure. This information would allow healthcare providers around the world the&#xD;
      ability to provide improved counseling to patients needing treatment for LTBI in regards to&#xD;
      both their TB treatment regimen and their concurrent contraceptive options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic effect of rifampin on serum etonogestrel concentrations&#xD;
           in contraceptive implant users at the dose of rifampin used for latent tuberculosis&#xD;
           infection (LTBI) treatment (600mg per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory Aim - to evaluate the effect of rifampin on serologic measures of ovulatory&#xD;
           suppression (estradiol and progesterone) in contraceptive implant users&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      · The investigators hypothesize that rifampin will have a significant pharmacokinetic effect&#xD;
      on participants' etonogestrel levels resulting in etonogestrel concentrations at least 35%&#xD;
      decreased from baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, pre and post study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      effect of rifampin on serum ENG levels in contraceptive implant users. The investigators will&#xD;
      enroll healthy women using an ENG implant for at least 12 months and no greater than 36&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then begin a 2 week regimen of rifampin at 600mg per day. This dose is the&#xD;
      recommended dose for treatment of LTBI and duration of 2 weeks will achieve steady state&#xD;
      rifampin levels with adequate time for liver enzyme induction. All participants will then&#xD;
      return at the end of the second week for a repeat blood draw. The investigators will again&#xD;
      obtain serum as described above for planned measurement of serum ENG concentrations. The&#xD;
      investigators will also obtain blood samples for repeat measurements of serum estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone. The investigators will also measure a serum rifampin level at the time of the&#xD;
      second ENG blood draw to confirm compliance. Serum estradiol, serum progesterone, and serum&#xD;
      rifampin levels will all be measured at the UCH Clinical Laboratory. At the conclusion of&#xD;
      enrollment, all stored serum samples will be de-identified and shipped to a Merck® laboratory&#xD;
      for serum ENG concentration measurement. Batch analysis will be performed using a liquid&#xD;
      chromatography mass-spectrometry method that has been previously validated. Participants will&#xD;
      serve as their own controls for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be required to use either a back-up non-hormonal method of birth&#xD;
      control or abstain from intercourse during the study and for 2 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
      rifampin. Rifampin has a half-life of 3-4 hours, and thus, will be eliminated within 1-2 days&#xD;
      of the last dose, but the investigators will allow a full 2 weeks of buffer to ensure that&#xD;
      the contraceptive effect of the implant has reinitiated before recommending resuming&#xD;
      unprotected intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will occur at the Comprehensive Women's Health Clinic in Lowry.&#xD;
