  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a new drug treatment to reverse tumor resistance to&#xD;
      radioiodine in BRAF mutant tumors so that radioiodine can be given to shrink tumors. This&#xD;
      study is also being done to find out the highest doses of copanlisib and vemurafenib that,&#xD;
      when given in combination, do not cause serious side effects, and whether the study treatment&#xD;
      will make radioiodine therapy work better in patients with BRAF-mutant thyroid cancers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin&#xD;

             mutation, as confirmed in a CLIA-certified laboratory or using an FDA-approved assay&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 (tumors in previously irradiated fields may be&#xD;
             considered measurable if there is evidence of tumor progression after radiation&#xD;
             treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RAIR disease, as defined by any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A metastatic lesion that is not RAI-avid on a diagnostic radioiodine scan&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An RAI-avid lesion that remained stable in size or progressed despite RAI&#xD;
                  treatment before entry in this study (there are no size limitations for the index&#xD;
                  lesion used to satisfy this entry criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The presence of at least 1 FDG-avid lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No receipt of treatment for thyroid cancer, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No I-131 therapy &lt; 6 months before initiation of the protocol (time of initiation&#xD;
                  of the protocol is defined as the first day of drug therapy with vemurafenib and&#xD;
                  copanlisib); diagnostic activities of I-131 (0-10m Ci) are allowed within 6months&#xD;
                  of initiating the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No external beam radiation therapy &lt;4 weeks before initiation of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No chemotherapy or targeted therapy including TKIs &lt;4 weeks (or &lt;5 half lives of&#xD;
                  the drug) before the initiation of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for correlative studies. Either&#xD;
             a paraffin block or at least 20 unstained slides are acceptable (30 unstained slides&#xD;
             is ideal); if &lt;20 unstained slides are available, and a paraffin block is not&#xD;
             available, the patient may be able to participate at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain an orally administered pill without any clinically&#xD;
             significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption, such as&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to undergo 2 research biopsies of (a) malignant lesion(s). Tumor tissue obtained&#xD;
             before study consent or treatment can also be submitted in lieu of performance of the&#xD;
             first pretreatment biopsy if the Principal Investigator deems it to be of sufficient&#xD;
             quantity/quality/timeliness (tumor tissue obtained more than 3 years from time of&#xD;
             study consent would not be eligible). Patients may be exempt from biopsy if (1) the&#xD;
             investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no tumor is accessible for&#xD;
             biopsy, (2) the investigator or person performing the biopsy feels that the biopsy&#xD;
             poses too great of a risk to the patient, or (3) the patient's platelet count is&#xD;
             &lt;100,000/mcL or the patient cannot be safely removed from anticoagulation therapy (if&#xD;
             the anticoagulation therapy needs to be temporarily held for the biopsy procedure). If&#xD;
             the investigator deems a second research biopsy to be high risk, the patient may be&#xD;
             exempt from the second biopsy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;

             during dosing and for 6 months after the last administration of study treatment.&#xD;
             Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In cases of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone-level&#xD;
                  assessment (FSH level in the postmenopausal range) is this acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months before screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or&#xD;
                  placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%)-for&#xD;
                  example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. Note: In&#xD;
                  cases of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable, on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (i.e., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago. In cases of oophorectomy&#xD;
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
                  follow-up hormone-level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing&#xD;
                  potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active men, unless they use a condom during intercourse while on treatment&#xD;
             and for 6 months after stopping treatment with study drugs (men should not father a&#xD;
             child in this period). A condom is required to be used by vasectomized men as well&#xD;
             during intercourse to prevent delivery of the drug via semen.&#xD;
