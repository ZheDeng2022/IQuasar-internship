  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics(PK)&#xD;
      and anti-tumour activity of adavosertib in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
      This study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort1 and Cohort2. At least 3, or up to 6, evaluable&#xD;
      Japanese patients with advanced solid tumours will be enrolled in each cohort to confirm the&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability, describe any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for&#xD;
      adavosertib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the PK profile of adavosertib To describe adavosertib's preliminary anti-tumour&#xD;
      activity using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and anti-tumour&#xD;
      activity of adavosertib in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumours. This study consists&#xD;
      of 2 cohorts, Cohort1 and Cohort2. At least 3, or up to 6, evaluable Japanese patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumours will be enrolled in each cohort. The total number of subjects will&#xD;
      depend upon the available data in each cohort and the Safety Review Committee (SRC)'s&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to start in June 2020 and end in April 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study to confirm the tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments and treatment duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in each part will receive the study treatments as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Adavosertib 250 mg by mouth (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 days ON and 2 days OFF for&#xD;
      week 1 and 2 of a 21 days cycle Cohort 2: Adavosertib 300 mg PO QD for 5 days ON and 2 days&#xD;
      OFF for week 1 and 2 of a 21 days cycle Subjects will be allowed to continue adavosertib&#xD;
      until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met.&#xD;
