  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the treatment efficacy and&#xD;
      feasibility of combining thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) with the IMpower133 regimen in the&#xD;
      upfront treatment of ED SCLC patients. Patients with a response after induction therapy with&#xD;
      carboplatin/etoposide and atezolizumab will be included into this study to subsequently&#xD;
      receive atezolizumab maintenance therapy and will be randomized to receive TRT or not. This&#xD;
      trial aims to i.) increase the efficacy of combined atezolizumab- and chemotherapy by adding&#xD;
      radiotherapy and ii.) determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic, immunological and radiological treatment in the first-line setting of&#xD;
      advanced SCLC, and iii.) to collect tumor tissue as well as blood and stool samples for&#xD;
      separate biomarker research project.&#xD;
