      Prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of superior laryngeal&#xD;
      nerve block for adults with neurogenic cough refractory to proton pump inhibitor as&#xD;
      determined by improvement in validated cough severity questionnaires before and after&#xD;
      injection of Marcaine and Kenalog compared to placebo (saline injection).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participants will be referred into (via other USF affiliated departments) or recruited within&#xD;
      the University of South Florida Department of Otolaryngology practice. Individuals will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility based on referral description. Eligibility will be determined by&#xD;
      history at initial visit based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be adults with chronic cough &gt;8 weeks duration and presumed neurogenic cough based on&#xD;
      initial evaluation. Chronic throat clearing with foreign body sensation for &gt;8 weeks duration&#xD;
      will also meet criteria for inclusion and will be used synonymously with and considered&#xD;
      chronic cough for the remainder of this protocol and study. Patients will be excluded if&#xD;
      primary cause is determined to not be neurogenic. Patients will be excluded if there are&#xD;
      other possible significant contributors to the cough that have not been treated (no other&#xD;
      obvious treatable and untreated cause), or they will be treated per the standard of care&#xD;
      prior to enrolling in this study. Patients will be screened for at least a 4-week course of&#xD;
      PPI therapy during duration of symptoms. Patients with possible UACS were included if a trial&#xD;
      of medications had been completed previously. If patients are on long term medications that&#xD;
      are effective for their respective related condition (but still ineffective at adequately&#xD;
      controlling chronic cough), they will be encouraged to make no unnecessary changes through&#xD;
      treatment/study duration. These include acid suppression therapy (outside of the recent&#xD;
      6-week trial of PPI if applicable), therapy for UACS symptoms if indicated (eg, Flonase and&#xD;
      antihistamine, saline rinses, etc.), neuromodulators (e.g., gabapentin). Patients were&#xD;
      excluded if they started any of these medications in last month and were not willing to&#xD;
      discontinue them for the duration of the trial. Participants must be willing and able to&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study, be willing to be assigned to and undergo intervention or&#xD;
      the placebo, and be willing to adhere to the study protocol for the duration of the trial:&#xD;
      2-4 visits, approximately 3 weeks of treatment, 6 week PPI trial with 4 week discontinuation&#xD;
      period if no improvement (if applicable), up to 12 week follow up questionnaires (survey&#xD;
      only), participate in cough suppression, take PPI as prescribed for duration specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were excluded if at any point they met the following criteria: unwilling to&#xD;
      participate in protocol, allergic to Bupivacaine or triamcinolone acetonide suspension,&#xD;
      presence of severe uncontrolled medical condition, any significant pulmonary processes&#xD;
      (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, non-asthmatic eosinophilic&#xD;
      bronchitis, structural abnormalities, etc.), presence of asthma (determined by presence of&#xD;
      abnormal pulmonary function test (PFT) provocation testing), concern for aerodigestive tract&#xD;
      malignancy from history or exam, structural abnormality seen on NPL or prior imaging,&#xD;
      immunocompromised, current smoker, use of ACE inhibitor at time of or one month preceding&#xD;
      first injection, or vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants underwent NPL will be also conducted at initial visit (Reflux finding&#xD;
      score, RFS). Informed consent will be obtained at this time. Demographics (including sex,&#xD;
      age, past medical history, related comorbidities, sidedness of globus sensation,&#xD;
      neuromodulator use, results of any prior chest radiograph during symptom duration, ever&#xD;
      referred to SLP for voice therapy) will be recorded at initial visit. Related comorbidities&#xD;
      include UACS, allergic rhinitis, CRS, GERD. Patients who had not previously received adequate&#xD;
      PPI trial were placed in 4 to 6-week course and encourage/counseled to complete lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications to reduce reflux. Patients with less than complete response to PPI (persistent&#xD;
      clinically significant cough) therapy were included in study. Patients follow-up visit for&#xD;
      consideration of injection was schedule one month after discontinuing PPI trial.&#xD;
      Questionnaire scores were determined immediately prior to first injection. All patients were&#xD;
      counseled on cough suppression prior to initial injection. Patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      placebo (2-cc normal saline) or intervention (total of 2-cc injection, mixture consisting of&#xD;
      1-cc of Bupivacaine and 1-cc of Kenolog-40) injection groups using computer-generated random&#xD;
      assignment. Injections will begin at initial visit or at follow-up visit if trial of PPI&#xD;
      required. Immediately preceding injections, patients will be given 5 sprays of 4% topical&#xD;
      lidocaine to facilitate injection which will also act to facilitate patient blinding.&#xD;
      Injection will be delivered into the region of the proximal superior laryngeal nerve using&#xD;
      greater cornu of hyoid and superior cornu of thyroid cartilage as landmarks. Injection will&#xD;
      be placed 1-cm anterior to the midpoint of these landmarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If globus sensation or trigger site was localized to one side, this was recorded and initial&#xD;
      injection was directed at this side, otherwise this was picked at random. The second&#xD;
      injection was directed at the same side if partial improvement (patient's subjective sense of&#xD;
      least 50% reduction of symptoms) was observed after the first injection. The second injection&#xD;
      was directed at the contralateral side if there was no initial improvement. Third injection&#xD;
      was offered if there was improvement during either of the first two injections (completed on&#xD;
      the ipsilateral side of prior two injections or the side with most improvement if bilateral&#xD;
      had been completed). There was no second/third injection if complete resolution of symptoms&#xD;
      was observed after the preceding injection. Follow up for repeat injection will be scheduled&#xD;
      in 1-2 weeks, and exact time recorded. Questionnaire scores were then recorded 2 weeks after&#xD;
      final injection of the series. Surveys (see next section, CSI and CQLQ) will also be sent for&#xD;
      patients to complete at 6 and 12 weeks after last injection, which will be analyzed in&#xD;
      subsequent study. Surveys will have a one-week window to be considered in their nominal&#xD;
      category. All adverse events will be recorded. See data capture sheet for collected&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
