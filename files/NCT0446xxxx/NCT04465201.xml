    <description>Defined as the number of times a CO calibration sequence is successfully completed and the CO is displayed divided by the number of times the pinging sequence is attempted. The endpoint is a rate and therefore has no units of measure. It is the &quot;number of times CO was successfully completed, and CO is displayed&quot; divided by the &quot;number of times the pinging sequence was attempted&quot;</description>
