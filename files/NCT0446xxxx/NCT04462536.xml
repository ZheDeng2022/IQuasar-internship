  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of nerinetide can reduce&#xD;
      neurological disability in people who have had a stroke and are selected for endovascular&#xD;
      therapy without the use of a tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase, tenecteplase, or&#xD;
      equivalent).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 3, randomized, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, single-dose, adaptive design with a single interim analysis for unblinded sample size&#xD;
      re-estimation. Because AIS (acute ischemic stroke) is a medical emergency, the trial is&#xD;
      designed to enable the administration of standard-of-care treatments without delay in order&#xD;
      to save the life of the person concerned, restore good health or alleviate suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants harboring an acute ischemic stroke who are selected for endovascular&#xD;
      revascularization without intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy will be given a&#xD;
      single, 2.6 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) intravenous dose of nerinetide or placebo.&#xD;
      Outcomes of the main trial will be evaluated throughout a 90 day observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed at 1-Year for the analytic sub-trial for further outcome&#xD;
      assessment by telemedicine or telephone interview conducted by individuals blinded to the&#xD;
      outcome of the main trial. This sub-trial will be conducted to explore the independent&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life at 1-Year.&#xD;

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke. mRS scores range from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome), with 0 indicating no residual symptoms; 5 indicating bedbound, requiring constant care; and 6 indicating death.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants exhibiting a worsening of their index stroke.</measure>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol 5-Dimensional 5-Level) is a generic instrument for describing and valuing health. It is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of five dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension has five response categories corresponding to: no problems, slight, moderate, severe and extreme problems. The respondents will also rate their overall health on the day of the interview on a 0-100 visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS, higher scores mean better outcomes).</description>
