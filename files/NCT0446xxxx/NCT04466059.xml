      To the best of our knowledge, BELUGA will be the first prospective trial investigating the&#xD;
      usefulness of deep learning-based hematologic diagnostic algorithms. Taking advantage of an&#xD;
      unprecedented collection of diagnostic samples consisting of flow cytometry datapoints and&#xD;
      digitalized blood-smears, categorization of yet undiagnosed patient samples will&#xD;
      prospectively be compared to current state-of-the-art diagnosis at the Munich Leukemia&#xD;
      Laboratory (hereafter MLL). In total, a collection of 25,000 digitalized blood smears and&#xD;
      25,000 flow cytometry datapoints will be prospectively used to train an AI-based deep&#xD;
      neuronal network for correct categorization. Subsequently, the superiority will be challenged&#xD;
      for the primary endpoints: sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, most probable diagnosis,&#xD;
      and time to diagnose. The secondary endpoints will compare the consequences regarding further&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up and, thus, clinical decision making between routine diagnosis and AI&#xD;
      guided diagnostics. BELUGA will set the stage for the introduction of AI-based hematologic&#xD;
      diagnostics in a real-world setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In numerous recent studies, deep neuronal networks (DNN) have been leveraged to examine the&#xD;
      usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based DNN for diagnostic purposes. In essence,&#xD;
      they have successfully proved to recapitulate state-of-the-art diagnoses currently performed&#xD;
      by humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the use of artificial intelligence for pattern recognition showed that DNN&#xD;
      could categorize complex and composite data points, chiefly images, with high fidelity to a&#xD;
      specific pathogenic condition or disease. The majority of these studies are primarily based&#xD;
      on extensive training sample collections that were categorized a priori. Subsequently, this&#xD;
      &quot;training&quot; provided the necessary input to classify newly delivered specimens into the&#xD;
      correct subgroups, frequently even outperforming independent human investigators. So far,&#xD;
      these studies have thus provided the rationale for the use of DNN in real-world diagnostics.&#xD;
      However, the prerequisite for using DNN in a real-world setting, where specimen sampling and&#xD;
      analysis would need to outperform human diagnosis prospectively, would be a blinded and&#xD;
      prospective trial. Currently, there is a lack of prospective data, therefore still&#xD;
      challenging the notion that DNN can outperform state-of-the-art human-based diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithms. Here we want to investigate the validity and usefulness of AI-based diagnostic&#xD;
      capabilities prospectively in a real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematologic diagnostics heavily rely on multiple methodically distinct approaches, of which&#xD;
      phenotyping aberrant blood or bone marrow cells from affected patients represents a&#xD;
      cornerstone for all subsequent methods, such as chromosomal or molecular genetic analyses. At&#xD;
      the MLL, five different diagnostic pillars are required to provide diagnostic evidence for a&#xD;
      specific malignant blood disorder faithfully: cytomorphology and immunophenotyping first,&#xD;
      guiding more specific methods such as cytogenetics, FISH, and a diversity of molecular&#xD;
      genetic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      +++ Objectives +++&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotyping of blood cells is primarily based on two distinct challenges; (1) the&#xD;
      morphological appearance and abundance of specific cell types and (2) the presence of&#xD;
      particular lineage markers detected by flow cytometry. These two methods are critical for&#xD;
      each subsequent decision-making process and, thus ultimately, the final diagnosis.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, these two methods are ideally suited for automated analysis by DNN due to&#xD;
      their inherent image-based nature. This has been recently illustrated by a publication by&#xD;
      Marr and colleagues (Matek et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0101-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In BELUGA, we want to investigate whether the automated analysis of blood (from peripheral&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow aspirates) smears and flow-cytometry-based analyses can provide a&#xD;
      benefit for diagnostic quality and, ultimately, patient care. Moreover, BELUGA will provide&#xD;
      evidence for the cooperative nature of image-based diagnostic tools for other pillars of&#xD;
      hematologic diagnostic decision making such as genetic and molecular genetic&#xD;
      characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BELUGA, therefore, consists of three parts (A-C) (See Figure in the attached File). In A, we&#xD;
      want to train a DNN with an unprecedented collection of blood smears and flow-cytometry-based&#xD;
      data points collected during the course of 15 years. These samples consist of all&#xD;
      hematological malignancies currently identified and recognized by the current WHO&#xD;
      classification for hematologic malignancies. Due to the varying incidences of these entities,&#xD;
      the total number of training items varies from 1,000 to 20,000 for 15 years. However, we deem&#xD;
      this discrepancy a benefit to this trial's overall aims, because this diverse spectrum will&#xD;
      inform us on the number of training items needed for outperforming the state-of-the-art&#xD;
      diagnostics in cytomorphology or flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part B, we will compare the overall performance of our trained DNN prospectively to new&#xD;
      yet undiagnosed samples arriving at our laboratory (see the main section for details). The&#xD;
      superiority of DNN based categorization will be challenged based on the pre-defined outcome&#xD;
      parameters accuracy with respect to state-of-the-art diagnostics, mismatch-rate, and time&#xD;
      needed to provide a diagnostic probability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, in C, we will investigate the effects on faster and more accurate diagnostic power by&#xD;
      leveraging our trained DNN to aid downstream diagnostic methodologies such as chromosomal&#xD;
      analysis or panel sequencing of patient samples.&#xD;

    <description>As a primary endpoint, we will examine the ability of DNN to classify disorders according to (after initial assessment disease/healthy) to the gold-standard diagnosis. The gold-standard diagnosis is defined as an integrated diagnosis, including cytomorphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, FISH, and molecular genetics. DNN will independently provide a bi-directional (probabilistic) diagnosis, with the most probable diagnosis. The primary analysis will include a direct comparison between the human cytomorphological examination and the pattern recognition software.&#xD;
Secondly, this result will be provided to downstream diagnostic departments to assess phenotypic diagnosis's usefulness for genetic characterization. We hypothesize that the turn-around time will be significantly enhanced, further providing quality at sooner timepoint.</description>
