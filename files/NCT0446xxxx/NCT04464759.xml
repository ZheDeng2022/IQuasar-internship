      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy (objective response rate) of&#xD;
      using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab or with nivolumab&#xD;
      alone in subjects with advanced/metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three parts to this Phase 1/2 study in subjects with advanced melanoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1a will identify the MTD and preliminary safety of combination hydroxychloroquine and&#xD;
      nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b will identify the MTD and preliminary safety of hydroxychloroquine administered in&#xD;
      conjunction with nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will assess the clinical efficacy of combination hydroxychloroquine and nivolumab&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
