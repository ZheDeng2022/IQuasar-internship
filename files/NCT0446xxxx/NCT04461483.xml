  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of TAK-935 with single ascending doses (Part 1) and multiple doses with&#xD;
      titration (Part 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935 tablet. TAK-935 tablet is being tested&#xD;
      in Japanese healthy adult men. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAK-935 with single ascending doses (Part 1) and&#xD;
      multiple doses with titration (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 33 participants in total (Part 1 + 2). In Part 1, participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of these treatment&#xD;
      cohorts/groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Single dose of TAK-935 at 200 mg or placebo (fasted)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Single dose of TAK-935 at 600 mg or placebo (fasted)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Single dose of TAK-935 at 1200 mg or placebo (fasted)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned to one of these treatment groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cohort 4: Multiple doses with titration of TAK-935 or placebo at 100 mg twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      from Day 1 to Day 7, 200 mg BID from Day 8 to Day 14 and 300 mg BID from Day 15 to Day 21&#xD;
      (fasted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 36 days for Part 1 and 63 days for Part 2. Participants will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for 5 days in Part 1 and 26 days in Part 2.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
