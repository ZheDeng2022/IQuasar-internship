  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to Swedish&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease during the&#xD;
      first 2 months of the 2020 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to describe demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, treatments&#xD;
      and outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary goal is to identify&#xD;
      independent risk factors associated with increased mortality for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding baseline characteristics including comorbidities, intensive care treatments&#xD;
      and outcomes will be extracted. ICU lengths of stay and 30-day mortalities will be&#xD;
      calculated. The primary outcome is 30-day all-cause mortality. THIS PART OF THE STUDY HAS&#xD;
      BEEN COMPLETED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDITIONAL SUMMARY - EXTENDED INCLUSION PERIOD AND ADDITION OF LONG-TERM OUTCOMES Due to the&#xD;
      continued influx of patients requiring intensive care throughout 2020 and 2021, we extended&#xD;
      the inclusion period to 30 June 2021. Thus this new cohort will include all patients admitted&#xD;
      to ICUs in Sweden from 6 March 2020 to 30 June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate short (30day mortality) and long-term outcomes (365d mortality and&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications) of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection and COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies reporting outcomes for COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs) have been hampered by right-censoring after short observation periods. None have&#xD;
      reported 30-day mortality rates and the vast majority of studies have substantial proportions&#xD;
      of undischarged patients at the time of follow-up. The lack of follow-up at least to ICU&#xD;
      discharge may cause bias in reported mortality rates. Further, national data on critically&#xD;
      ill patients have not been previously published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to Swedish&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease during the&#xD;
      first 2 months of the 2020 pandemic. The Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) collects data&#xD;
      on patients admitted to all Swedish ICUs, with 100% coverage since 2019. Thus, SIR is able to&#xD;
      report on outcomes in a national intensive care population without selection. Little is known&#xD;
      about the epidemiology of COVID-19 infections in Sweden, which has one of the world's highest&#xD;
      life expectancies and a significant burden of comorbidity. Coupled with Sweden's 'relaxed'&#xD;
      approach to COVID-19 pandemic management, health care outcomes are understandably under&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to describe demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, treatments&#xD;
      and outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary goal is to identify&#xD;
      independent risk factors associated with increased mortality for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDITIONAL SUMMARY updated 20 October 2021 Due to the continued influx of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      in ICUs in Sweden throughout 2020 and 2021, we extended of our sample size to encompass all&#xD;
      patients admitted up to 30 June 2021 (previously 6 May 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to investigate short- and long-term outcomes including mortality and the incidence of&#xD;
      new cardiovascular and respiratory diagnoses up to one year after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 22 mar 2021 we received ethical committee approval for these extensions.&#xD;
