  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal vault cytology is commonly used for follow-up surveillance in patients treated for&#xD;
      cervical cancer. It is known that the smear inadequacy rate is high, especially in patients&#xD;
      post-radiotherapy at 10%. The current practice is to use Cervex-Brush®, which was designed&#xD;
      for cervical smear taking. Cervix will shrink into a dimple with a flat vaginal vault and&#xD;
      vagina may be stenotic after radiotherapy, rendering the use of the conventional sampling&#xD;
      device difficult. Orcellex® Brush was designed to collect cells from oral mucosa, with high&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and low smear inadequacy of 1% in one study. As both the vaginal vault&#xD;
      mucosa and oral mucosa are flat surface lined with stratified squamous epithelium, the use of&#xD;
      Orcellex® Brush in vaginal vault smear appeared applicable. It has a smaller head with a flat&#xD;
      surface of hair, which might better fit the flat vault surface and narrow vaginal canal. It&#xD;
      is postulated that the Orcellex® Brush helps in improving vaginal vault smear adequacy rate&#xD;
      in patients after radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cervical cancer treated with primary irradiation will be recruited at their&#xD;
      routine post-treatment surveillance follow-up in the out-patient clinic, in the order of&#xD;
      their appointment time. Study procedure will be explained and written informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained from each subject at the visit. Systemic and vaginal examination will be carried out&#xD;
      as usual. Subjects will receive vaginal vault smear by both Cervex-Brush® and Orcellex® Brush&#xD;
      during the same speculum examination. The order of using smear sampling devices will be&#xD;
      randomized. Randomization will be carried out according to computer-generated random numbers,&#xD;
      allocated by sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes. Subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups: using Cervex-Brush® first followed by Orcellex® Brush, or vice versa. The&#xD;
      procedure of smear taking will be carried out by four trained clinicians who are independent&#xD;
      of the study. The method of smear taking will be standardized for both Cervex-Brush® and&#xD;
      Orcellex® Brush. The vaginal vault will be swept horizontally by the brush and the cervical&#xD;
      dimple, if seen, will be rotated five times by the brush. Each sampling device will be shaken&#xD;
      vigorously in separate Thinprep specimen containers, which is labelled as smear A for&#xD;
      Cervex-Brush® and smear B for Orcellex® Brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are unaware of the sequence of the sampling device used, as they cannot see the&#xD;
      procedure of smear taking during examination. The patient will be asked about the pain score&#xD;
      during each smear taking, by using the visual analog scale. Any vaginal bleeding will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimen will be sent to the laboratory and will be processed by the ThinPrep method. The&#xD;
      cytopathologist is unaware as to which device is used for that particular specimen and the&#xD;
      slide prepared from it. One pathologist will be responsible in screening all the vault smears&#xD;
      involved in this study. Adequacy of vault smear sample was defined by the Bethesda System as&#xD;
      a minimum of 2000 well-visualized and well-preserved squamous cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be arranged subsequent follow-up visits at appropriate time interval according&#xD;
      to the department protocol. Patients with inadequate smear result by both sampling devices&#xD;
      will be called back early within 8 weeks for repeat smear using the conventional&#xD;
      Cervex-Brush®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cervical cancer in the department will have surveillance follow-ups at variable&#xD;
      intervals from 3 months to 12 months, depending on the time interval from previous treatment&#xD;
      and patients' symptoms. Some patients may have repeated smears during the study period. As&#xD;
      the result of previous smear will have no impact on the adequacy rate of subsequent smear,&#xD;
      patients can be recruited for smear taking more than once in the study. Hence the actual&#xD;
      number of patients recruited in the study would be less than the calculated sample size of&#xD;
      160.&#xD;
