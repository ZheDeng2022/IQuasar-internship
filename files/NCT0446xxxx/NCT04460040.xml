  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proposal is to identify changes in the volume of highly metabolic&#xD;
      organs (liver, kidneys, and brain) that occur as a physiological adaptation to exercise&#xD;
      training and lower the resting energy expenditure. Secondary aims are to identify changes in&#xD;
      the metabolic efficiency of muscle in low levels of physical activity and evaluate the&#xD;
      effects on components of total daily energy expenditure including the sleeping metabolic rate&#xD;
      (SMR) and diet induced thermogenesis (DIT).&#xD;

      Using a clinical trial type protocol, 16 overweight (body mass index: 25-30 kg/m2) men (n=8)&#xD;
      and women (n=8) aged 21 to 45 years will exercise for 3 months in a moderate intensity&#xD;
      regimen of 20 kcal/week/kg body weight that reflects current recommendations for weight&#xD;
      management. The volume of various organs will be measured pre- and post-exercise intervention&#xD;
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A cycling ergometer with a varied workload will be&#xD;
      used to assess muscle metabolic efficiency. Changes in overnight SMR and 4 hours post&#xD;
      breakfast DIT will be evaluated by whole human room indirect calorimetry (&quot;metabolic&#xD;
      chamber&quot;). In addition, free-living Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) will be measured for ten&#xD;
      days pre- and post-intervention by doubly labeled water.&#xD;

    <description>The first phase of the study will comprise two weeks of control phase when participants will not engage in any exercise training but will be monitored for total daily energy expenditure and its components (REE, SMR, and DIT) and assessed volume of metabolic organs and skeletal muscle efficiency.&#xD;
Next, participants will start the active phase. In the first two weeks, participants will perform 150 - 200 min/week of a moderate intensity exercise so that they can adapt to the new regime and avoid injury. All exercise training will be monitored using heart rate sensor (HR) to track exercise adherence and HR range goals. Changes in daily non-exercise physical activity and sedentary behavior will be assessed for 10 days pre- and post-intervention by a tri-axial accelerometer. All study participants will be instructed to consume their habitual diet and to maintain the same caloric intake.</description>
