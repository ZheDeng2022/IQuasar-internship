  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, non-randomized, open-label, parallel group study. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in participants with severe renal impairment and compared with matched participants&#xD;
      with normal renal function. The duration of the study for an individual participant from&#xD;
      Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 5 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 4 cohorts, consisting of participants with severe renal impairment who&#xD;
      are not on dialysis (Cohort 1), moderate renal impairment (Cohort 2), mild renal impairment&#xD;
      (Cohort 3) and participants with normal renal function (Cohort 4). Following completion of&#xD;
      Cohort 1 and Cohort 4, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data will be reviewed and a decision&#xD;
      will be made whether to study unmatched participants with moderate and mild renal impairment&#xD;
      (Cohorts 2 and 3, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened up to 21 days before administration of study drug. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the clinical unit either on the evening of Day -2 or on the&#xD;
      morning of Day -1. Each participant will receive a single oral dose of the study drug under&#xD;
      fasted conditions on Day 1. Participants will be required to remain resident in the clinical&#xD;
      unit until the morning of Day 3 but, if participants prefer, may also remain resident until&#xD;
      all PK and other study procedures are completed on Day 7. This decision to extend residency&#xD;
      will be made at the discretion of the principal investigator. If participants do check out on&#xD;
      Day 3, participants will then return to the unit, as scheduled, for collection of PK samples&#xD;
      and safety assessments, with a final Follow-up Visit on Day 14.&#xD;
