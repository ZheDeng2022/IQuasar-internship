    <textblock>
      This research aims to find an effective dietary intervention among the Pakistani population.&#xD;
      According to WHO, diabetes is on the rise in developing countries; the current prevalence&#xD;
      among the Pakistani population is 11.2% which is expected to increase in the coming years&#xD;
      which is in line with the similar documented trend in neighboring south Asian countries.3,11&#xD;
      Since, ethnic south Asians carry a greater risk for developing T2D at a younger age and along&#xD;
      with the complications associated with diabetes due to its chronicity, this poses a&#xD;
      significant threat and an increased disease burden on the health care system.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first trial conducted on determining the efficacy of caloric restriction in&#xD;
      a subset of Pakistani population. There is limited inconsistent data on the efficacy of&#xD;
      time-restricted feeding, however, this will help elucidate if it does lead to positive&#xD;
      effects on the bio-health markers. One of the major hurdles in caloric restriction is patient&#xD;
      compliance, therefore, one of the intervention group will be used to determine if TRF with&#xD;
      caloric restriction helps improve the patient's compliance and produces significant results.&#xD;
      If such an intervention is effective in inducing weight loss it can also be applied for other&#xD;
      overweight patients. Eventually, it will help in countering the rising obesity in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate purpose of the knowledge obtained is to find a patient friendly, novel and&#xD;
      therapeutic dietary intervention which will help in limiting the rise in T2D patients. It'll&#xD;
      help in introducing an effective lifestyle intervention to promote health, which will reduce&#xD;
      the dependence on pharmacological therapies, as well as, in the long-term reduce burden on&#xD;
      the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained can provide framework for new guidelines in helping the patients to&#xD;
      lose weight, which can be utilized by the government to increase general awareness which will&#xD;
      help prevent diseases linked to obesity. In light of the randomized controlled trial, the&#xD;
      primary health physicians can educate and increase awareness regarding the different dietary&#xD;
      interventions the patients can utilize which will help increase the number of options for the&#xD;
      patients. Social media platforms can be utilized due to their extended outreach for the&#xD;
      transmission of accurate information to the general population.&#xD;
