  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative airway complications associated with endotracheal intubation can be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While some of these complications are predictable, some may occur urgently. If the&#xD;
      endotracheal cuff is over-inflated and its pressure is high, mucosal damage resulting from&#xD;
      mucosal pressure is one of the main factors for tracheal morbidity. Endotracheal tube cuff&#xD;
      pressure is not routinely measured. It was confirmed that the palpation of the pilot balloon&#xD;
      was insufficient to detect high cuff pressures. In laparoscopic cases, the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to investigate whether the increase in intra-abdominal pressure as a result of carbon&#xD;
      dioxide insufflation, and the change of respiratory functions after trendelenburg position&#xD;
      are effective on cuff pressure and whether there is a difference compared to laparotomic&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;

      It was planned to include 50 patients in the American Anesthesiologists Association (ASA) 1-3&#xD;
      risk score group, which will be an elective gynecological operation between the ages of&#xD;
      18-70. When patients arrive in the operating room, after the ECG, pulse oximeter,&#xD;
      non-invasive pressure monitoring is provided in the supine position, 18 gauge intravenous(iv)&#xD;
      vascular access will be opened and balanced fluid 4-6 ml / kg / h will be inserted.&#xD;
      Anesthesia induction with midazolam 0.05 mg / kg, propofol 2-3 mg / kg, Fentanyl 1-2 µg / kg&#xD;
      and rocuronium 0.6 mg / kg will be achieved after 3 minutes of preoxygenation. he muscle&#xD;
      relaxant effect will be monitored by monitoring TOF (train of four), and after sufficient&#xD;
      relaxation (TOF 95%), the anesthetist will be intubated with the 7-7.5 number endotracheal&#xD;
      tube suitable for the high-volume low-pressure patient. The cuff of the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      will be inflated with the help of an injector and the cuff will be attached to the manometer.&#xD;
      Cuff pressures will be inflated to 25 mmHg. The patients will be given oxygen at 40% and air&#xD;
      at 3lt / min. The maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved with sevoflurane and 0.05-0.1mcg&#xD;
      / kg / min remifentanil infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient feels pain in the perioperative period, 50 mcg fentanyl iv will be used as&#xD;
      rescue analgesia. During the operation, rokurunium (0.2mg / kg) boluses will be delivered&#xD;
      according to the patient's clinic and the TOF value between 0-2 (depending on the type of&#xD;
      surgery). Mechanical ventilation will be started in volume controlled mode with 6-8 ml / kg&#xD;
      tidal volume, and 12 frequencies. Respiratory frequencies,tidal volume and positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) values of patients will be optimized so that end tidal CO2 is&#xD;
      35-45 mmHg throughout the case. At the end of surgery, 100 mg tramadol and 1 g paracetamol&#xD;
      will be administered to patients for the purpose of postoperative analgesia. Patients will be&#xD;
      extubated after the muscle relaxant is recurrentized with 0.03mg / kg neostigmine and 0.01mg&#xD;
      / kg atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's numeric rating scale (NRS) score is 3 or more during recovery, 0.3 mg / kg&#xD;
      Petidine hydrochloride will be applied as rescue analgesia. The 'Case Tracking Form' prepared&#xD;
      for the follow-up of the research will be recorded demographically, age, height, weight and&#xD;
      BMI information of the patients in the preoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the perioperative period, cuff pressures in the supine position after intubation, at the&#xD;
      5th, 15th, 30th, 45th minutes and before extubation will be measured and recorded with the&#xD;
      cuff manometer. In addition to the follow-up form, intra-abdominal pressure, PEEP, P peak and&#xD;
      P plateau values, anesthesia time, operation time during each measurement will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients who were followed-up in the recovery were evaluated by the service nurse who did not&#xD;
      know how to work in the service at the postoperative 1st, 12th, 24th hours, and the NRS&#xD;
      (numeric rating scale) (0 is painless, 10 is the most painful and will be asked to describe&#xD;
      the pain from 1 to 10); It will be evaluated in terms of dysphagia, cough, sore throat,&#xD;
      hoarseness.&#xD;
