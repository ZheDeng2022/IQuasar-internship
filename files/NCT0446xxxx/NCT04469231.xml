    <textblock>
      A multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, historically controlled study. Demonstrate the&#xD;
      Synergy Disc is at least as safe and effective as conventional anterior cervical discectomy&#xD;
      and fusion (ACDF) to treat cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) in subjects who are&#xD;
      symptomatic at only one level from C3 to C7 that are unresponsive to conservative management.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated preoperatively, at the time of surgery, and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 24 months after surgery. Follow-up will continue annually until the last patient reaches&#xD;
      24-month follow-up. The primary analysis will occur at 24 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, historically&#xD;
      controlled comparison of the Synergy Disc to the control of conventional anterior cervical&#xD;
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery in patients with cervical DDD. A total of 175 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to the investigational group not including approximately 15 training cases.&#xD;
      The investigational group results will be compared to a historical control data from the ACDF&#xD;
      control group, which utilized an identical study design. A statistically rigorous&#xD;
      observational study design using propensity score (PS) subclassification will be used to&#xD;
      demonstrate covariate balance and enhance the quality of inferences regarding effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety relative to ACDF control. After investigational device enrollment is complete, but&#xD;
      before most investigational device subjects have reached their 24-month endpoint, a data set&#xD;
      containing only baseline covariates of prospectively enrolled investigational device patients&#xD;
      and historical ACDF control patients will be constructed. The propensity score methods&#xD;
      detailed below will be implemented by an outcomes-blinded statistician. A Propensity Score&#xD;
      Memo summarizing the proposed observational design will be developed and submitted for review&#xD;
      by stakeholders including FDA. The outcomes-blinded statistician will remain blinded until&#xD;
      after consensus is achieved that the design is acceptable. This will allow for additional&#xD;
      outcomes-blinded PS modeling if required. The objective of this clinical trial is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the Synergy Disc is at least as safe and effective as conventional ACDF to treat&#xD;
      cervical DDD in subjects who are symptomatic at only one level from C3 to C7 that are&#xD;
      unresponsive to conservative management.&#xD;

    <description>The Synergy Disc is a cervical disc prosthesis that can be inserted between C3-C7 in skeletally mature patients after anterior discectomy to provide restoration of motion to the functional spinal unit. The Synergy Disc is designed to restoring kinematics to the cervical spine. The Synergy Disc is intended for use in the cervical spine for reconstruction of the disc following a single level discectomy for intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy.</description>
