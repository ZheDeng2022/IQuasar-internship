      The purpose of this study is to characterize the Freestyle Libre Glucose Monitoring System in&#xD;
      pediatric and adult subjects with respect to YSI reference venous plasma sample measurements.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to six (6) clinical research sites in the United&#xD;
      States. Subjects will wear two Sensors. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be&#xD;
      given to the subject. Subjects will be asked to perform at least 4 capillary Blood Glucose&#xD;
      (BG) tests per day using the primary Reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the corresponding&#xD;
      Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to report any&#xD;
      problems with the device. Subjects will make up to six (6) scheduled visits to the clinical&#xD;
      study site, including the Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Based on the subjects' age&#xD;
      and&#xD;
&#xD;
      /or weight, subjects will have up to three (3) in- clinic visits during which intravenous&#xD;
      blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur.&#xD;
