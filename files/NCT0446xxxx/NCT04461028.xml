      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study is being conducted to see if using the liposomal Bupivacaine for the&#xD;
      Interscalene block will improve the patient pain control and the whole patient's experience&#xD;
      48 hours after surgery when compared to using the regular Marcaine (bupivacaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride) in addition to the dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All preoperative, surgical, post-operative care in the recovery room, and discharge&#xD;
      instructions will be the same as any other patient undergoing this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After obtaining informed consent, an anesthesiologist will receive an envelope with&#xD;
           result of randomization. Patients will receive a single injection interscalene nerve&#xD;
           block prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GROUP 1 liposomal Bupivacaine - will receive a 20 ml mixture of 10 ml of Liposomal&#xD;
                Bupivacaine 1.3% and 10 ml of Bupivacaine HCl 0.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GROUP 2 Bupivacaine with dexamethasone - will receive 20 ml of Bupivacaine HCl 0.5%&#xD;
                with 4 mg of preservative-free dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Patients will undergo general endotracheal anesthesia with inhaled anesthetic&#xD;
      (Sevoflurane) for a goal MAC 1.0. Other than the aforementioned interscalene nerve block,&#xD;
      patients will not receive any other local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Patients will receive a multimodal analgesic and antiemetic regimen standardized for&#xD;
      shoulder arthroscopies at our institution. Preoperatively, all patients will receive 300 mg&#xD;
      of gabapentin and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen orally. Intraoperatively, patients will receive 4&#xD;
      mg of ondansetron and 15 mg of ketorolac intravenously. Postoperatively, patients will remain&#xD;
      on an oral regimen of 300 mg of gabapentin three times daily for one week, and 1,000 mg of&#xD;
      acetaminophen and 10 mg of ketorolac every 8 hours for 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Additional intraoperative or postoperative opioid analgesics will be administered as&#xD;
      needed. Patients with a history of PONV or otherwise deemed high risk for PONV by the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist will receive a scopolamine patch before induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder arthroscopy is one of the most commonly performed ambulatory orthopedic procedures&#xD;
      in the United States. However, despite advances in arthroscopic technique, significant&#xD;
      postoperative pain remains a major challenge in the perioperative period. Regional anesthesia&#xD;
      has played a key part in alleviating postoperative pain, particularly the use of single-shot&#xD;
      interscalene nerve blocks. However, single-shot blocks are limited by their relatively short&#xD;
      duration of action. The use of continuous peripheral nerve catheters is often limited by&#xD;
      institutional resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, adjuvants can be added to the local anesthetic solution to help prolong the&#xD;
      single-shot block. Whereas a long-acting local anesthetic such as Bupivacaine HCl can provide&#xD;
      analgesia for 8-12 hours when deposited perineurally, the addition of adjuvants such as 4 mg&#xD;
      preservative-free dexamethasone has been shown to prolong blocks for up to 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal Bupivacaine (Exparel®, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ) is a novel&#xD;
      formulation of Bupivacaine that was approved for interscalene nerve blocks in April 2018.8 By&#xD;
      incorporating Bupivacaine within a multivesicular liposomal suspension (DepoFoam®) that&#xD;
      causes a slow release of the drug, it is purported to extend a nerve block's analgesic effect&#xD;
      to at least 72 hours.9 10 ml of Liposomal Bupivacaine 1.3% (133 mg) is recommended for&#xD;
      interscalene blocks; this solution is also often mixed with Bupivacaine HCl to complement&#xD;
      early analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of Liposomal Bupivacaine in the context&#xD;
      of postoperative quality of recovery. Given the well-known postoperative pain and functional&#xD;
      limitations of shoulder arthroscopy, the postoperative Quality of Recovery (QoR) scale is an&#xD;
      appropriate tool to capture these outcomes. This scale assesses patient recovery in multiple&#xD;
      domains, including physiological, nociceptive, activities of daily living, cognition and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. To date, the QoR scale has been used in over 100 perioperative studies&#xD;
      and has been repeatedly validated in the postoperative setting, including ambulatory&#xD;
      orthopedic procedures. As they have been validated over the years, the QoR has been&#xD;
      correlated to quality of life and patient satisfaction with pain management after surgery,&#xD;
      two key components of a successful ambulatory procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial aiming to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of Liposomal Bupivacaine in this context. We hypothesize that using Liposomal&#xD;
      Bupivacaine will improve the quality of recovery in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy&#xD;
      for rotator cuff repair when compared to using Bupivicaine HCl 0.5% with preservative-free&#xD;
      dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We seek to determine if Liposomal Bupivacaine 1.3% will improve the quality of recovery, as&#xD;
      measured by QoR-15 scores, in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy for rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair when compared to Bupivacaine HCl 0.5% with 4 mg of preservative-free dexamethasone as&#xD;
      an additive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be defined as the QoR-15 score at 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include QoR-15 scores at 24 hours and 1 week after surgery, patient&#xD;
      reported pain scores and opioid use at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery, PACU length of&#xD;
      stay, and PACU opioids and antiemetics given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled blinded clinical trial with a parallel design&#xD;
      and an allocation ratio of 1:1 for the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified from the surgical schedule the day before surgery and will be&#xD;
      contacted by one of the study investigators to scan for eligibility for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consented the morning of their surgery by one of the study investigators or&#xD;
      the research coordinator. Study aims and procedures will be explained to patients and all&#xD;
      questions will be answered. There is no formal recruitment script, but the informed consent&#xD;
      form will be carefully reviewed with the patient to ensure adequate comprehension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated randomization table will be used for patient allocation to one of the&#xD;
      two study groups; either the Liposomal Bupivacaine group or the Bupivacaine HCl with&#xD;
      dexamethasone group. Randomization will be done in blocks of 10 patients each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will receive a single injection interscalene nerve&#xD;
      block prior to surgery. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: the Liposomal&#xD;
      Bupivacaine or Bupivacaine with dexamethasone groups. The Liposomal Bupivacaine group will&#xD;
      receive a 20 ml mixture of 10 ml of Liposomal Bupivacaine 1.3% and 10 ml of Bupivacaine HCl&#xD;
      0.5%. The Bupivacaine with dexamethasone group will receive 20 ml of Bupivacaine HCl 0.2%&#xD;
      with 4 mg of preservative-free dexamethasone. The research assistant collecting the data as&#xD;
      well the patient will be blinded to the nature of the group assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the nerve block, a block time out will be performed according to standard operating&#xD;
      procedures with the attending anesthesiologist present. Patients will be monitored during&#xD;
      block performance with standard ASA monitors. All patients will receive 2 L of continuous&#xD;
      oxygen via nasal cannula. 1-2 mg midazolam will be titrated to sedative effect. All blocks&#xD;
      will be done under ultrasound guidance using Sonosite S (Bothell, WA) machines with a high&#xD;
      frequency linear probe (6-13 MHz). The block will be performed with strict adherence to&#xD;
      sterile technique. After an optimal interscalene &quot;stop-sign&quot; view is obtained, a 21-guage&#xD;
      needle will be inserted in-plane and the local anesthetic will be deposited with a focus on&#xD;
      the C5 nerve root.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo general endotracheal anesthesia with inhaled anesthetic&#xD;
      (Sevoflurane) for a goal MAC 1.0. Other than the aforementioned interscalene nerve block,&#xD;
      patients will not receive any other local anesthetic. Patients will receive a multimodal&#xD;
      analgesic and antiemetic regimen standardized for these surgeries at this institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, all patients will receive 300 mg of gabapentin and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen&#xD;
      orally. Intraoperatively, patients will receive 4 mg of ondansetron and 15 mg of ketorolac&#xD;
      intravenously. Postoperatively, patients will remain on an oral regimen of 300 mg of&#xD;
      gabapentin three times daily for one week, and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 mg of&#xD;
      ketorolac every 8 hours for 48 hours after surgery. Additional intraoperative or&#xD;
      postoperative opioid analgesics will be administered as needed. Patients with a history of&#xD;
      PONV or otherwise deemed high risk for PONV by the attending anesthesiologist will receive a&#xD;
      scopolamine patch before induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity) and associated diagnoses such as depression&#xD;
      and anxiety will be collected preoperatively. A QoR-15 will be assessed at 24 and 48 hours&#xD;
      and 1 week after surgery. Patients will also be sent home with a pain diary to determine pain&#xD;
      scores and the amount of pain pills taken for 72 hours after surgery. Other data to be&#xD;
      collected will include PACU length of stay and any PACU medications (particularly opioids and&#xD;
      rescue antiemetics) given. Opioids will be converted to morphine equivalent doses. The&#xD;
      research assistant collecting data will be blinded to the nature of the group assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to begin enrollment pending IRB approval. The length of participation for each&#xD;
      patient will be 1-week in total after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using STATA 15 statistical software (College Station,&#xD;
      TX). Demographic or other categorical data will be analyzed using student's T test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Repeated measurements (QoR-15 scores, pain scores) will&#xD;
      be analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA or ANOVA on ranks, with further paired comparisons at&#xD;
      each time interval performed using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Normally&#xD;
      distributed data will be presented as means ± SE of the mean (SEM), non-normally distributed&#xD;
      data will be presented as medians ± quartiles (interquartile range) and categorical data will&#xD;
      be presented as raw data and as frequencies. The alpha level for all analyses will be set as&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average QOR-15 scores at time point of 24hrs is 112 ± 19 Myles 2016 . A clinically meaningful&#xD;
      differences in the QOR-15 scale is 8.0.Myles 2016 Our sample size calculation to detect a&#xD;
      8-point difference in the QOR-15 scale (p&lt;0.05) is 71 patients in each group (alpha=0.05,&#xD;
      power=80%). We will inflate our sample size by 10% to account for any missing data or any&#xD;
      withdrawal from the study; therefore, our estimated sample size will be 78 patients per group&#xD;
      for a total number of patients of 156. Statistical analyses will be performed using STATA 13&#xD;
      statistical software (Dallas, TX).&#xD;
