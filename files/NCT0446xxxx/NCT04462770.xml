  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of EPX-100 against placebo as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy in 60 patients with Dravet Syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of EPX-100 (clemizole hydrochloride) in children and young adults with Dravet&#xD;
      Syndrome. The 20-week study begins with a 4-week Observational Phase which will establish&#xD;
      seizure frequency and eligibility for treatment, followed by a 4-week Titration Phase to&#xD;
      identify the maximum tolerated dose in each patient. Thereafter, the patient will enter into&#xD;
      a 12-week Maintenance Phase. Safety chemistries, hematology, urinalysis, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and ECG's will be monitored throughout the 20-week study. The patient will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to enter a 52-week Open-Label Extension phase at the end of the Maintenance Phase&#xD;
      in which all patients will be administered EPX-100. The primary endpoint is the median&#xD;
      percent change in the 28-day in countable convulsive seizure frequency in the final 4 weeks&#xD;
      of the 12-week treatment period (Maintenance Phase) relative to the baseline (4-week&#xD;
      Observational Phase).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical diagnosis of Dravet Syndrome. Patients must have seizures which are not&#xD;
             completely controlled by anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Onset of frequent seizures prior to 18 months of age,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal development at onset,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of seizures that are generalized, unilateral clonic, and/or hemi-clonic,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Brain MRI without cortical malformation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Genetic mutation of the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene&#xD;
                  must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient must be approved to participate by the PI after a review of the medical&#xD;
             history, baseline seizure calendars and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Independent&#xD;
             Reviewer will confirm Dravet Syndrome diagnosis for each participant enrolled in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient must be approved to participate by the PI after review of the medical&#xD;
             history, baseline seizure calendars and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Independent&#xD;
             Reviewer will confirm Dravet Syndrome diagnosis for each participant enrolled in the&#xD;
             study and adjudicate all seizure types on the seizure calendar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Seizure criteria of â‰¥4 countable convulsive seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic,&#xD;
             atonic, focal with observable motor signs) per 4-week baseline period (Observational&#xD;
             Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients should be on a stable regimen of AEDs â‰¥30days prior to Visit 1 and generally&#xD;
             in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Parent or Legal Authorised Representative (LAR) is willing and able to maintain an&#xD;
             accurate and complete daily seizure calendar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Sexually active women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must be using a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of birth control and have a negative urine pregnancy test at the&#xD;
             screening visit. A WCBP is defined as a female who is biologically capable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant. A medically acceptable method of birth control includes intrauterine devices&#xD;
             in place for at least 3 months, surgical sterilization, or adequate barrier methods&#xD;
             (e.g., diaphragm and foam). Use of oral contraceptives in combination with another&#xD;
             method (e.g., a spermicidal cream) is acceptable. In participants who are not sexually&#xD;
             active, abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control and urine will be tested per&#xD;
             protocol. Women who are of non-child-bearing potential, i.e., post-menopause, must&#xD;
             have this condition captured in their medical history. Pregnant women are excluded&#xD;
             from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have parent or LAR available and willing to give written informed consent, after being&#xD;
             properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and prior to engaging in any&#xD;
             study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following excludes a patient from study enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known sensitivity, allergy, or previous exposure to EPX-100 (clemizole HCl).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exposure to any investigational drug or device &lt;90 days prior to screening or plans to&#xD;
             participate in another drug or device trial at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Seizures secondary to illicit drug or alcohol use, infection, neoplasm, demyelinating&#xD;
             disease, degenerative neurological disease, or central nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
             deemed progressive, metabolic illness, or progressive degenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent use of drugs known to interfere with EPX-100, including moderate or severe&#xD;
             inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5/7. Specifically, concurrent use of carbamazepine,&#xD;
             oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and/or phenobarbital are excluded, as well as refraining&#xD;
             from grapefruits and grapefruit juice during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior or concurrent use of fenfluramine or lorcaserin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has any medical condition that, in the Investigator's judgement, is considered to be&#xD;
             clinically significant and could potentially affect patient safety or study outcome,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: clinically significant cardiac disease (including&#xD;
             angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, and history of&#xD;
             arrhythmias), renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic or hepatic conditions;&#xD;
             or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has an active suicidal plan/intent or have had active suicidal thoughts in the past 6&#xD;
             months or a suicide attempt in the past 3 years.&#xD;
