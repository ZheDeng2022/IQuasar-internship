  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical study aims to validate the diagnostic performance, compared to a&#xD;
      reference ECG, of the electrocardiographic function of the BPM Core developed by Withings for&#xD;
      the automatic identification of atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BPM Core is a blood-pressure monitor with an build-in single-channel electrocardiogram&#xD;
      similar to a lead I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that Withings BPM Core has acceptable sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity in the automatic identification of AF and SR in comparison with a gold-standard&#xD;
      diagnosis from a 12-lead ECG by board certified cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algorithm classifies the device signals into four categories: normal sinus rhythm (RSN),&#xD;
      AF, arrhythmia other than AF, or non-interpretable. The latter category includes signals of&#xD;
      insufficient quality to be interpreted with confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This classification will be compared to the diagnosis made by three independent, blinded&#xD;
      cardiologists based on a 12-lead ECG. The final diagnosis retained will be decided by&#xD;
      majority with adjudication by a consensus of 3 to 6 cardiologists. The sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the device will then be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first secondary objective is to assess the quality of tracings of the BPM Core armband&#xD;
      thanks to a qualitative and quantitative comparison between BPM Core tracings and reference&#xD;
      ECG ones, based on clinical evaluation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, three independent cardiologists who have not performed or read the reference ECG and&#xD;
      do not know the patient's clinical files will make a diagnosis from the recordings from the&#xD;
      BPM Core. There will be a majority vote to select the diagnosis. The cases where the three&#xD;
      readers reached three different diagnosis will be reviewed by a panel of 3 to 6 board&#xD;
      certified cardiologists who will decide by consensus. Sensitivity and specificity will be&#xD;
      calculated relative to the reference ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, quantitative analyses will be performed to assess the quality of ECG tracings&#xD;
      provided by Withings BPM Core and its software, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The visibility and polarity of the ECG waves (namely P-waves, QRS complexes and T-waves)&#xD;
           will be determined by the cardiologists for each lead I signals recorded with Withings&#xD;
           BPM Core and with the 12-channel ECG device. The assessment will be made on the 5th&#xD;
           complete beat of the recording. For each of the waves (P, QRS and T), the agreement of&#xD;
           visibility and the agreement of polarity (when both are visible) between the signals of&#xD;
           Withings BPM Core and the reference ECG device will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the main ECG intervals (namely QT interval, QRS width and PR interval)&#xD;
           will be determined by the cardiologists for each lead I signal recorded by Withings BPM&#xD;
           Core and the 12-channel ECG device. The measurement will be made with a caliper on the&#xD;
           5th complete beat of the recording. For each interval (QT, QRS, PR), the difference of&#xD;
           length between the signals of Withings BPM Core and the reference ECG device will be&#xD;
           computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The heart rate will be first determined by the cardiologists for each lead I signal&#xD;
           (recorded by Withings BPM Core and the 12-channel ECG device) which are diagnosed as&#xD;
           NSR. The heart rate difference between the signals of Withings BPM Core and the&#xD;
           reference ECG device will be computed. Second, the heart rate of the signals recorded&#xD;
           with the BPM Core will be computed by the Withings software. The difference between the&#xD;
           heart rate estimated by Withings software on Withings BPM Core signals and the heart&#xD;
           rate determined by the cardiologists on the lead I signal from the ECG reference device&#xD;
           will also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will make sure that the same cardiologist will not be asked to annotate both a&#xD;
      Withings BPM Core signal and the corresponding lead I signal from the 12-channel ECG device.&#xD;
      The sponsor will then centralize the annotations of Withings BPM Core tracings and of the ECG&#xD;
      reference lead I signals and perform agreement calculations on synchronous pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second secondary objective is to verify the safety of use of the device by analyzing&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of use of the device will be assessed by the number of adverse effects.&#xD;
