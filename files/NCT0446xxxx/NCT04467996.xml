  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine balloon tamponade (IUBT) is recommended worldwide as the second-line therapy to&#xD;
      treat postpartum hemorrhage. While much literature demonstrates the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      therapy, little is known about how long the IUBT should be used once placed. Though it is&#xD;
      common to use IUBT for 12-24 hours, the balloon may be equally effective when used for&#xD;
      shorter durations of time, which could have beneficial effects for patients and hospitals.&#xD;
      The proposed study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of non-inferiority comparing&#xD;
      two durations of time for intrauterine balloon tamponade placement, 6 and 18 hours, in&#xD;
      controlling postpartum hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed study are to determine: 1) whether quantitative blood loss&#xD;
      significantly differs when the balloon is removed in 6 hours compared to 18 hours, 2) whether&#xD;
      hemorrhage-related morbidity differs when the IUBT is kept in place for 6 or 18 hours, and 3)&#xD;
      whether shorter duration of IUBT placement has beneficial effects including shortened&#xD;
      postpartum hospital stays, improved maternal-infant bonding, and reduced postpartum pain&#xD;
      prior to maternal discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that, once hemorrhage control has been achieved with IUBT placement, there is&#xD;
      no clinically significant difference in postpartum blood loss when the balloon is removed 6&#xD;
      hours after placement compared to 18 hours after placement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women at Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) who have an IUBT placed for&#xD;
             postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony will be approached for enrollment in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
