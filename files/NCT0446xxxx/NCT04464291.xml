  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was added to the National Immunization Program in Russia in&#xD;
      2014 which could affect the changes in pneumococcal serotypes in growing population. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the spectrum of serotypes of S. pneumoniae in patients&#xD;
      older 18-years: in healthy carriage, in patients with non-invasive and invasive forms of&#xD;
      pneumococcal infection. The patients will be divide into several groups: 18-64-years old, 65&#xD;
      years old and older, immunocompromised patients, immunocompetent patients with concomitant&#xD;
      diseases and patients from restricted organized collectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to meet the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the spectrum of serotypes of S. pneumoniae in adult population in different&#xD;
      regions of Russia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S. pneumoniae is a major cause of illness and death in children and adults worldwide. It&#xD;
      includes 91 serotypes. The distribution of serotypes that cause disease varies by age,&#xD;
      disease syndrome, disease severity, geographic region, and over time. Infants and young&#xD;
      children are thought to be the main reservoir of this agent. From the colonized&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal mucosa, pneumococci may spread by contiguous, non-invasive extension to other&#xD;
      sites in the respiratory tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1.6 million cases of fatal pneumococcal disease occur worldwide annually, mostly in&#xD;
      infants and the elderly.3 In addition, immunocompromised individuals of all ages,&#xD;
      immunocompetent patients with concomitant diseases (chronic heart failure,&#xD;
      broncho-obstructive syndrome, liquorrhea, ext.) are at increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is a serious and increasing problem&#xD;
      worldwide. Therefore vaccination is the most effective mechanism to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      pneumococcal infection in children and adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine is estimated by coverage of serotypes of S.&#xD;
      pneumoniae. The distribution of the serotypes can be potentoinally changed because of the&#xD;
      using of PCV in Russia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Prospective Multicentre Microbiological study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General informed consents are collected from patients at hospital admission. No additional&#xD;
      informed consents will be collected for this study since the procedures of microbiological&#xD;
      sample collection will be performed as a part of standard medical aid practices. Patient&#xD;
      confidentiality will be retained at all times, and patient identifiers will not be included&#xD;
      in the study. Collection of strains will be performed in patients, who meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically relevant causative isolate - The isolate must meet the laboratory criteria of&#xD;
           S. pneumoniae and be considered the &quot;probable causative agent&quot; of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolates from patients older 18-years with pneumococcal acute otitis media.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolates from patients older 18-years with pneumococcal pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolates from patients older 18-years with invasive pneumococcal diseases (meningitis,&#xD;
           sepsis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolates from healthy carriage older 18-years Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolates that have been collected and/or stored prior to June 1, 2018 or later than&#xD;
           September 30, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duplicate isolates (same genus and species) obtained at any subsequent time from the&#xD;
           same patient, regardless of susceptibility or phenotypic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Environmental samples (non patient-derived) or surveillance cultures taken for infection&#xD;
           control purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outside study group - Any isolate other than those defined by protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collection of strains of S. pneumoniae and identification - the participating laboratory&#xD;
           will collect, identify and store isolates and submit to reference laboratory of the&#xD;
           Institute of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy of Smolensk State Medical University only&#xD;
           clinical isolates that meet the study criteria as defined by protocol. Each isolate must&#xD;
           be accompanied by a Organisms Report Form (ORF). The ORF contains information regarding&#xD;
           the demographics of each isolate. Each investigative site will provide complete isolate&#xD;
           identification using the laboratory's routine procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  re-identification of strains of S. pneumoniae in the central laboratory (IAC, Smolensk)&#xD;
           - at least, 500 consecutive non-duplicate strains of S. pneumoniae from healthy carriage&#xD;
           and patients with non-invasive and invasive pneumococcal infections will be analyzed in&#xD;
           centers from the following locations: Central region, North-Western region, Ural,&#xD;
           Southern region, Siberia, Far-Eastern region. All the strains will be initially&#xD;
           re-identified to the species level at the IAC laboratory using classic bacteriologic&#xD;
           methods and MALDI Biotyper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  susceptibility testing - susceptibility testing to penicillin, erythromycin,&#xD;
           azithromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and vancomycin&#xD;
           will be determined by broth microdilution method. Interpretation will be done according&#xD;
           to EUCAST/CLSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serotyping (LATEX-TEST, Real-time PCR) - serotyping of S. pneumoniae will be performed&#xD;
           using PNEUMOTEST-LATEX TEST and Real-Time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reporting Strains collection: 01.06.2019 - 30.01.2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Re-identification: till 31.10.2019&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing: till 01.06.2020&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serotyping: till 31.05.2020 Data analysis and reporting: till 28.02.2021 This is a&#xD;
           non-interventional database study based on secondary use of data collected for other&#xD;
           purposes. No administration of any therapeutic or prophylactic agent is required in this&#xD;
           protocol. No reporting of individual adverse events to regulatory agencies is planned&#xD;
           for this database study because there is no access to individual patient/subject records&#xD;
           and it is not possible to assess the causality of individual cases. Pre-specified health&#xD;
           outcomes of interest, including any that qualify as adverse events, will be summarized&#xD;
           as part of any interim analysis (including safety analysis, if required) and in the&#xD;
           final study report, which will be provided to regulatory agencies by the sponsor as&#xD;
           required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any relevant safety information will be summarized in the appropriate Periodic Safety Update&#xD;
      Report (PSUR)/Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) and/or Development Safety&#xD;
      Update Reports (DSUR) if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an investigator elects to spontaneously report any suspected adverse reactions, they&#xD;
      should be reported via fax to Merck AER Mailbox FAX #215-661-6229 (US), or toll-free fax&#xD;
      1-800-547-5552 (ex-US and US availability), in English using an AE form (attached) for&#xD;
      reporting to worldwide regulatory agencies as appropriate&#xD;
