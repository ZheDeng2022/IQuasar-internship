      SUMMARY Background: Improvements in the management and prevention of obstetric haemorrhage&#xD;
      and sepsis, in addition to magnesium sulphate for preeclampsia have led to significant&#xD;
      reduction in global maternal mortality rates; thus leaving increasing number of survivors of&#xD;
      preeclampsia than previously. Preeclampsia is associated with inflammatory changes that alter&#xD;
      vascular integrity - an effect which may persist beyond pregnancy, resulting in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis which predisposes to myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To predict preeclampsia early in pregnancy and detect preeclampsia survivors at risk for&#xD;
      future cardiovascular disease and events using cardiac and gene markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: a cohort study design with recruitment of participants at 3 stages; in the first&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy, second half and the puerperium. Serum levels of fibrinogen, hsCRP,&#xD;
      apoA/apoB, triglycerides and other lipids, in addition to genetic studies would be compared&#xD;
      between those with preeclampsia and normal pregnancies, delivered mothers would be followed&#xD;
      up from puerperium, upto 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: would be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      software version 21.0. Numerical data would be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
      Results from the two groups of women would be compared using the independent T-test, Analysis&#xD;
      of Variance (ANOVA) and the chi-square test while the Mantel Haenszel statistics would be&#xD;
      used to determine risks. The level of statistical significance would be set at p-value less&#xD;
      than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and stroke are major causes of sudden&#xD;
      death because their precursors; atherosclerosis and hypertension are asymptomatic.&#xD;
      Under-utilization of routine health care check further increases the risk of sudden death&#xD;
      from these conditions. Preeclampsia is a recognized risk factor and screening of survivors&#xD;
      would help to detect women at risk for cardiovascular diseases and offer early preventive&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a disease that is strongly linked with the risk of stroke and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. This is a condition with greater prevalence in the Low and middle&#xD;
      income countries of the world especially sub-Saharan Africa, where the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality is reportedly higher. Larger numbers of survivors are expected with the rising&#xD;
      global gains in maternal mortality reduction associated with preeclampsia. These&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and stroke are major&#xD;
      causes of sudden death because the precursor conditions; atherosclerosis and hypertension are&#xD;
      largely asymptomatic. There are established biomarkers for these conditions which can be used&#xD;
      as screening tools. The low utilization of routine health care check and the asymptomatic&#xD;
      nature of these events increase the risk of sudden premature death from these conditions. The&#xD;
      postnatal period offers a good opportunity for screening for these events to detect women at&#xD;
      risk and offer early preventive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is essentially a disease of the trophoblast, it has also been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with oxidative stress, a phenomenon, which increases the levels of LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      peroxidation, leading to its increased uptake by macrophages, resulting in foam cell&#xD;
      formation and atherosclerosis. Preeclampsia is also associated with inflammatory changes that&#xD;
      alter vascular integrity - an effect which may persist beyond pregnancy, resulting in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis which predisposes to myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes in the vasculature are asymptomatic and unless hypertension is detected early&#xD;
      and vasoprotective or antithrombotic treatment commenced, sudden death may occur from stroke&#xD;
      or acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive heart disease refers to heart conditions that result from the effect of&#xD;
      hypertension. The heart in this instance now works under a higher pressure resulting in the&#xD;
      hypertrophy of cardiac muscle, thickening of the cardiac arterial vasculature (leading to&#xD;
      coronary arterial disease) and increased risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction. The&#xD;
      resulting cardiac muscle dysfunction leads to increasing levels of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, which can be detected in the blood stream and whose levels may correlate with the&#xD;
      presence and severity of the disease condition. Hypertension has similar effects on the&#xD;
      cerebral vasculature, where it can cause vessel rupture resulting in life-threatening&#xD;
      intracranial haemorrhage. The vessels under the influence of long standing hypertension may&#xD;
      undergo hypertrophy leading to thickening of the vessel wall with narrowing of lumen and then&#xD;
      cerebral ischemia, infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke if hypertension is&#xD;
      detected early and effectively controlled with antihypertensive drugs. This preventive&#xD;
      strategy has been shown to be of more benefit when commenced at a younger age and especially&#xD;
      in women of the black race who are at higher risk and would benefit more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the general adult population, lipids and cardiac biomarkers have been shown to predict the&#xD;
      occurrence of these cardiovascular events. These biomarkers include: High sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive Protein (hsCRP), Apolipoproteins (LDL, Apo B-100, Apo A1), Lipoprotein a (Lp(a),&#xD;
      Oxidized LDL, Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase (A2-LpPLA2), Sphingosine-1-phosphate&#xD;
      (Sph-1-P), small dense low density lipoprotein (sdLDL) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO). A recent&#xD;
      systematic review on markers for primary cardiovascular events revealed that in terms of&#xD;
      correlation with the development of cardiovascular disease; C-reactive protein, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, the apolipoprotein A/apolipoprotein B ratio, high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein, and vitamin D, were useful in the prediction of cardiovascular disease, while&#xD;
      for primary stroke; fibrinogen and serum uric acid were strong markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aimed to determine the risk of future cardiovascular disease and events&#xD;
      in survivors of preeclampsia using these established biomarkers, in conjunction with testing&#xD;
      for gene markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants would include all consecutive participants who meet the inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      each group of study within the 12-month period at all sites. They would be educated about the&#xD;
      study and informed consent obtained from them or from relatives (when patient is unable to do&#xD;
      so). A 10ml sample of venous blood and a dry blood spot on filter paper would be obtained (by&#xD;
      doctors from all the participating sites) from all the participants for assay of cardiac,&#xD;
      lipid and gene markers of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, training sessions on the study protocol and monitoring would be&#xD;
      held for all team members from the study sites and this would be done fortnightly until&#xD;
      completion of study to ensure uniformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples obtained would be centrifuged to obtain plasma and serum at each study site&#xD;
      which would then be transported in ice packs department of medical laboratory science of the&#xD;
      Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo for assay of lipid and cardiac biomarkers while the genetic&#xD;
      studies (DNA extraction and sequencing) would be done at the Centre for Advanced Medical&#xD;
      Research and Biotechnology (CAMRAB), laboratory at Babcock University Teaching Hospital,&#xD;
      Ilishan-Remo. All samples obtained would be coded such that the laboratory scientist is&#xD;
      blinded from the identity of the participants. The results obtained would then be transferred&#xD;
      into the pre-labelled proforma where other details of each participant including the biodata&#xD;
      and pregnancy history have already been entered. The participants details entered into the&#xD;
      proforma would also be entered directly into tablets linked with Redcap mobile application&#xD;
      for web hosting, which would then be exported later to SPSS for analysis. Twenty four-hour&#xD;
      telephone contact would be maintained with team members from all the study sites involved in&#xD;
      the study, through direct phone call and text message. A whatsapp chat group would be created&#xD;
      to link all four study sites for easy transmission of information. Twenty four-hour telephone&#xD;
      contact would be maintained with team members from all the study sites involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples would be collected into lithium heparin and plain anticoagulant-free&#xD;
      containers and transported immediately in an ice container to the laboratory for analysis&#xD;
      where they would be centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 minutes, at all sites, before transport of&#xD;
      both well labelled supernatant sera in plain bottles and plasma in lithium heparin bottles&#xD;
      after decanting from the packed red cells to Babcock University. Serum and plasma aliquots&#xD;
      would then be stored at -20ºC in Babcock University until further analysis. The drop of blood&#xD;
      spot obtained from each participant would be allowed to air-dry and then safely stored in a&#xD;
      cool dry storage refrigerator before transport to CAMRAB, where it would be maintained at&#xD;
      -80˚C until gene analysis. Serum and plasma samples that are not used would be stored at&#xD;
      -80˚C for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurements would be obtained by a trained nurse at each site with manually&#xD;
      operated mercury powered sphygmomanometer and these readings would be taken in the sitting&#xD;
      position. The Korotkoff sound V would be taken as the level for diastolic blood pressure in&#xD;
      all cases. The blood pressure would then be immediately entered into the study proforma for&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explaining the procedure with the aid of the subject information form, obtaining&#xD;
      consent and completing the history segments of the proforma, 10ml of venous blood samples&#xD;
      would be obtained from the participants prior to the commencement of any intravenous therapy.&#xD;
      This sample would be collected from the contra-lateral upper limb of patients who are already&#xD;
      on intravenous infusion. The venous blood would be aspirated from the participant's&#xD;
      ante-cubital vein and placed in a lithium heparin vacuum tube (5mls) and a plain&#xD;
      anticoagulant-free bottle (5mls). At the time of blood collection, a drop of blood would be&#xD;
      made on a filter paper for genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants would be followed up till end of puerperium thus; observation for the&#xD;
      development of preeclampsia in women admitted within the first half of pregnancy, those&#xD;
      admitted with preeclampsia in pregnancy would be observed for the correlation of preeclampsia&#xD;
      severity with the levels of biomarkers and those recruited postpartum would have their levels&#xD;
      of cardiac and gene markers compared with those of women who had normal pregnancies.&#xD;
      Telephone contact of the participants and their next of kin would be obtained and they or&#xD;
      next of kin would be contacted at 1, 2, 5 and 10 year intervals for development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and repeat serum levels of biomarkers.&#xD;
