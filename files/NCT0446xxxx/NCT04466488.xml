  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Clinical guidelines and policies often fail to achieve high levels of delivery of&#xD;
      intended clinical interventions. The difference in what the investigators know works and what&#xD;
      is actually delivered at the clinic-level to patients, is known as the &quot;science-to-service&#xD;
      gap.&quot; In the realm of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, this gap is reflected in &lt;20% of TB&#xD;
      preventive therapy (TPT) -eligible persons living with HIV (PWH) being offered or initiated&#xD;
      on isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in many settings. Recent innovation in TPT have brought&#xD;
      new pharmacological options allowing for shorter courses, intermittent dosing, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this study is to identify a generalizable approach to overcome&#xD;
      current barriers to delivery of TPT in order to achieve high levels of TPT delivery during&#xD;
      routine care in public clinics. Multiple approaches are in standard use to change prescribing&#xD;
      behavior including in service training, audit and feedback, clinical mentoring, the use of&#xD;
      clinical decision aids, and &quot;academic detailing.&quot; However, the overall change is generally&#xD;
      modest. To achieve a substantial increase in TPT delivery (from current approximately 20% to&#xD;
      60-80%) will require a fundamental change in the approach to selecting patients for TPT - a&#xD;
      redesign of the choice architecture of TPT prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators are proposing a choice architecture that makes prescribing TPT the&#xD;
      &quot;default&quot; or standard option and that for TPT not to be prescribed will require a choice by a&#xD;
      clinician to &quot;opt-out&quot; of TPT for a specific patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing a cluster randomized design to test the choice architecture&#xD;
      approach to increasing delivery of TPT. Clinics will be randomized to one of two strategies:&#xD;
      (1) standard implementation and (2) choice architecture default TPT. Because of the&#xD;
      clinic-level nature of the implementation strategies, all PWH receiving care at a clinic will&#xD;
      be exposed to the standard implementation or TPT routinization implementation. Clinical&#xD;
      process data will be used to assess the effectiveness of each strategy to determine the&#xD;
      proportion of PWH (1) screened for TPT, (2) eligible for TPT, and (3) prescribed TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: TB is the leading cause of death among PWH in South Africa and elsewhere on the&#xD;
      continent. TPT is a proven intervention to reduce mortality among PWH but is not widely&#xD;
      prescribed. This study seeks to identify an implementation strategy to reach optimal TPT&#xD;
      prescribing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV associated mortality and TB disease in LMIC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB is the leading cause of death due to an infectious agent worldwide. Among PWH in low and&#xD;
      middle income countries (LMIC), TB represents the leading cause of mortality among PWH. South&#xD;
      Africa is particularly affected by the syndemic of HIV and TB with an estimated HIV&#xD;
      prevalence in 2017 of 7.2 million and TB incidence of 567/100,000 population with over 60% of&#xD;
      TB cases among PWH. There were an estimated 78,000 deaths from TB in South Africa in 2017;&#xD;
      56,000 of the deaths among PWH. Findings from the investigators' group suggest this is likely&#xD;
      an underestimate of true TB disease and TB related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB preventive therapy reduces TB disease and mortality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past 30 years isoniazid based TPT has been known to reduce the risk of TB among PWH.&#xD;
      Multiple studies have subsequently confirmed and strengthened this finding. Following cohort&#xD;
      studies conducted in South Africa and Brazil by the investigators' team that showed marked&#xD;
      reductions in TB incidence for PWH, clinical trials of isoniazid preventive therapy have&#xD;
      reported up to a 70% reduction in TB incidence among PWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current delivery of TPT to PWH is anemic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the evidence and guidelines supporting TPT, current delivery of TPT is anemic.&#xD;
      Reports from South Africa (and preliminary data by members of this investigative team) have&#xD;
      observed between 14% and 35% of eligible patients are prescribed TPT. Other countries in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa have similarly low initiation. In 2017, TPT initiation, as reported in the&#xD;
      2018 World Health Organization (WHO) Global TB Report ranged from 1 to 53% for high burden&#xD;
      African countries. South Africa reports higher rates of TPT initiation compared to the rest&#xD;
      of the continent, but progress has plateaued and current initiation levels are insufficient&#xD;
      for impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current barriers to TPT delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key factors leading to low TPT initiation are (1) lack of provider confidence in definitively&#xD;
      ruling-out active TB, (2) concerns about increasing drug resistant TB, (3) understanding&#xD;
      appropriate screening for TB disease, (4) concerns for drug-induced liver injury (DILI), (5)&#xD;
      the complexity of prescribing guidelines, (6) misperceptions regarding which patients may&#xD;
      benefit, (7) not understanding the benefit of TPT, (8) assumption that patients will not&#xD;
      adhere to TPT, and (9) the increased work-load of TPT initiation. All of these factors&#xD;
      contribute to the cognitive load of TPT initiation, some also add to the workload. Drug&#xD;
      stock-outs in some settings have also posed a barrier to initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice architecture and TPT delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice architecture is a behavioral economics approach that is used to improve decision&#xD;
      making. Choice architecture involves deliberate consideration of how options are presented&#xD;
      and what follows from each option, including what happens if no active decision is made&#xD;
      (sometimes referred to as passive selection or the &quot;default&quot; setting). Choice architecture&#xD;
      can reduce time and complexity required for decision making leading to a reduction in the&#xD;
      cognitive load. Lower cognitive load can improve decisions; high cognitive load leads to&#xD;
      poorer decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently TPT initiation requires an active process to select TPT and a passive (neglecting&#xD;
      to consider TPT) process for not initiating. The current active process required for TPT&#xD;
      initiation includes at least four steps: (1) consider TPT, (2) evaluate reasons for not&#xD;
      initiating, this includes potential concerns for undiagnosed TB and the presence of liver&#xD;
      disease, (3) weigh the risks and benefits of TPT, (4) consider patient adherence, and (5)&#xD;
      write the TPT prescription. These steps require consideration (cognitive load) and time. Both&#xD;
      cognitive load and time compete with other priorities of a complex clinical encounter. As a&#xD;
      result, clinicians may &quot;defer&quot; consideration to the &quot;next&quot; visit or turn to rules of thumb to&#xD;
      justify deferring or not initiating TPT. Given that the vast majority of ART patients in&#xD;
      South Africa would benefit from TPT, the use of choice architecture making TPT the &quot;default&quot;&#xD;
      could improve provider decision making and safely increase TPT initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goals of this proposal are to test a low-cost and context appropriate&#xD;
      approach to translating TPT policy into on-the-ground TPT delivery. The investigators are&#xD;
      proposing a cluster-randomized trial (CRT) to measure the effectiveness of a choice&#xD;
      architecture-based TPT initiation strategy versus usual prescribing. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate a substantial increase in TPT initiating, potentially increasing from&#xD;
      approximately 35% to 60-80% of ART initiators. This can be achieved through choice&#xD;
      architecture and a decrease in cognitive load. The investigators will assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness, implementation measures, and patient-level delivery and acceptability to&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the proportion of patients newly starting ART also initiating TPT between the&#xD;
           choice architecture and usual prescribing arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the processes of TPT implementation by study arm including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provider adoption&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fidelity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provider acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provider cognitive load of TPT prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinic workflow integration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe patient-level characteristics associated with initiating TPT and adhering to&#xD;
           TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of patients already on ART initiating TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of eligible patients newly starting ART also initiating TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The proportion of eligible patients already on ART initiating TPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The proportion of patients who initiate TPT and discontinue TPT prior to completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV in South Africa and much of the world.&#xD;
      TPT is a proven approach to reduce mortality. This study has the potential of identifying an&#xD;
      approach to markedly increase TPT prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinic-level cluster randomized trial of a strategy to increase the delivery of&#xD;
      evidence-based care. Clinics will be randomized to the novel choice architecture strategy arm&#xD;
      or usual prescribing arm with analysis based on the clinic-level proportion of TPT initiated.&#xD;
      This study will further assess implementation outcomes, the underlying theory of change (the&#xD;
      effect of choice architecture on cognitive load), provider experiences with the novel&#xD;
      strategy, and patient experiences with TPT by study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted by the Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU) in two districts:&#xD;
      the Kenneth Kaunda district in the North West Province of South Africa and Mangaung District&#xD;
      in the Free State Province. Kenneth Kaunda district has a population of 742,000 and is served&#xD;
      by 36 public-sector clinics (primary care clinics and community health centers) providing HIV&#xD;
      care (ART, TPT, TB treatment). Mangaung District has a population of 747,431 and is served by&#xD;
      45 public clinics. Both districts have urban, peri-urban, and large rural areas. Both&#xD;
      districts are also settings with high HIV and TB prevalence with which the team is very&#xD;
      familiar, has a working relationship with the local Department of Health, and has completed&#xD;
      prior research on TB and TPT delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be conducted in 36 public clinics that provide antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART). Clinics will be located in rural and peri-urban areas in Kenneth Kaunda and urban and&#xD;
      rural areas of Mangaung, especially around Botshabelo. The investigators selected these two&#xD;
      areas based on a long-standing working relationship between the team and the Department of&#xD;
      Health in these locations and established PHRU research infrastructure in both locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cluster-randomized trial with the randomization at the clinic level and the&#xD;
      primary outcome at the clinic level. The strategy arm seeks to improve delivery of&#xD;
      guideline-mandated services to the clinic population. Thus the strategy clinics may have&#xD;
      greater prescribing of TPT and anticipated improved health outcomes, but clinic patients will&#xD;
      not perceive any differences in care nor will any individual randomization or patient-level&#xD;
      consent occur for the primary outcome of the proportion of patients who receive TPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection will be completed for a stratified randomization. Key clinic&#xD;
      characteristics used for stratification will be measured during a pre-study initiation&#xD;
      baseline assessment in the study clinics prior to randomization and will include clinic-level&#xD;
      characteristics of patient volume, staffing, and monthly ART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, data on TPT prescribing, ART initiation, ART maintenance, and clinic&#xD;
      staffing will be obtained for the prior 12 months. These data will be abstracted as monthly&#xD;
      aggregates from electric and paper clinic reporting systems. No patient level data or&#xD;
      identifiers will be abstracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a covariate-constrained randomization to balance, if an&#xD;
      imbalance is detected, ensuring validity of the randomization process. Implementation will be&#xD;
      staggered over time with each of two clinics from the intervention arms matched to control&#xD;
      clinics for the purpose of contemporaneous study initiation. Randomization will occur either&#xD;
      electronically or through drawing names with Department of Health representatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard TPT implementation is for a clinician to screen for TB and to consider TPT for&#xD;
      those who do not have &quot;presumptive TB&quot;. Clinicians in the study district (and most districts&#xD;
      in South Africa) have received training and job aids to assist in appropriate application of&#xD;
      the TPT initiation algorithm. Prescribing for TPT and ART is done by writing, by hand, the&#xD;
      prescription in the patient's paper file. As part of this study, all study clinic providers&#xD;
      will have access to standard Department of Health printed material and clinical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the choice architecture implementation strategy, all opt-out clinic providers and&#xD;
      pharmacists will be trained on the approach. The fundamental tenant of this approach is that&#xD;
      TPT will be prescribed with any ART initiation and any ART re-prescribing for 3-12 months of&#xD;
      TPT (adherent to current guidelines) if TPT has not been previously prescribed. This will be&#xD;
      facilitated by co-prescribing ART and TPT. That is when ART is being prescribed TPT is meant&#xD;
      to be prescribed at the same time of the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simultaneous prescribing will be facilitated through the introduction of an ink stamp or&#xD;
      pre-printed sticker to use for quick entry of the ART prescription along with TPT and&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole. This stamp/sticker will be available in the consulting rooms and will be&#xD;
      pre-stamped/applied by file clerks to files when retrieved. The stamp/sticker for ART&#xD;
      prescription, the prescription for TPT and for cotrimoxazole will be &quot;automatically&quot;&#xD;
      included. Active canceling of these prescriptions (and indicating the reasons) will be needed&#xD;
      to not have TPT dispensed.&#xD;
