      Objective: The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effect of aromatherapy on blood&#xD;
      pressure and stress response by inhalation and foot massage in individuals with essential&#xD;
      hypertension. Secondary aims;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to define the effect of aromatherapy inhalation method and foot massage application on&#xD;
           blood pressure and heart rate in individuals with essential hypertension,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to define the effects of aromatherapy inhalation method and foot massage application on&#xD;
           blood cortisol levels in individuals with essential hypertension,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to define the effects of aromatherapy inhalation method and foot massage application on&#xD;
           anxiety scores in individuals with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0-1: Aromatherapy inhalation method has no significant effect on blood pressure in&#xD;
           individuals with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-1: Aromatherapy inhalation method has a significant effect on blood pressure in&#xD;
           individuals with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0-2: Aromatherapy inhalation method does not have a significant effect on stress&#xD;
           response in individuals with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-2: Aromatherapy inhalation method has a significant effect on stress response in&#xD;
           individuals with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0-3: Foot massage application does not have a significant effect on blood pressure in&#xD;
           individuals with essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-3: Foot massage application has a significant effect on blood pressure in individuals&#xD;
           with essential hypertension.&#xD;

        -  H0-4: Foot massage application in patients with essential hypertension has no&#xD;
           significant effect on stress response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-4: Foot massage application in patients with essential hypertension has a significant&#xD;
           effect on stress response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The randomized controlled trial is performed with 69 individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      essential hypertension hospitalized.There are two interventions (group 1:&#xD;
      aromatherapy-inhalation method, group 2: aromatherapy-foot massage) and a control group in&#xD;
      the study. In power analysis based on blood cortisol level,80% power, 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval, effect size 0.39, standard deviation 3.09 were calculated and 23 participants in&#xD;
      each group were determined. Blood pressure is measured with a digital sphygmomanometer after&#xD;
      10 minutes of rest; stress response is determined by heart rate, blood cortisol levels and&#xD;
      anxiety scale. Aromatherapy with lavender oil is applied to the intervention groups; no&#xD;
      application is made to the control group and routine follow-up at the hospital continued. The&#xD;
      group-1 smells sterile cloth with 5 drops of lavender oil for five minutes and is done every&#xD;
      other day for three days. Group-2 receives a total of 20 minutes of foot massage with 5 drops&#xD;
      of lavender oil for each foot and is applied every other day for three days. Aromatherapy is&#xD;
      performed between 07:00 and 08:00 in the morning hours when the blood cortisol value peaked&#xD;
      at the highest level and homogeneity is achieved in terms of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: For intervention groups (group 1 and 2), blood pressure and heart rate will be&#xD;
      measured seven times in total, both at the first interview and before and after each&#xD;
      application, 10 minutes after the application; for control group, it is a total of seven&#xD;
      times, both once in the first interview and twice every other day. Blood cortisol level is&#xD;
      measured four times in total for the intervention groups, both at the beginning and after&#xD;
      each application; For the control group, it is measured at the same time as the intervention&#xD;
      groups at baseline and on the third follow-up day (twice in total). Anxiety scale&#xD;
      (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) is used for subjective stress response. Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory is evaluated at the beginning of the study for both groups (only once).&#xD;
      State Anxiety Inventory, for intervention groups, is applied four times both before and after&#xD;
      the first application and before and after the third application; for control group is&#xD;
      applied twice, on the first follow-up day and on the third follow-up day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Statistical methods to be used for study data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics (number and percentage, average, standard deviation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T test (Parametric), Mann Whitney U test (nonparametric) (according to the suitability&#xD;
           of the data for normal distribution)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One-way anova (Parametric), Kruskal Wallis Test (nonparametric) (according to the normal&#xD;
           distribution of data)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pearson / Spearman Correlation (according to the suitability of the data for normal&#xD;
           distribution)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of variance in repeated measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regression analysis&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>In the study, a digital sphygmomanometer, which has been calibrated in comparison with the mercury sphygmomanometer, is used in order to prevent individual differences in the measurement of blood pressure. For accurate results, the sphygmomanometer sleeve is sized for adult individuals (width = about 20 cm, length = about 40 cm). In order for the blood pressure not to be affected by the conditions during the measurement, it is taken into account that the individual did not drink tea or coffee, take caffeine, and preferably did not eat during the 30 minutes prior to measurement. Measurements are made after the individual has been resting in a quiet room for at least 10 minutes. The measurements at the first interview are made from both arms, the blood pressure in the high arm is considered to be the blood pressure of the patient. Blood pressure measurements in the follow-ups are also made from this arm.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean of heart rate (/dk)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate is the pressure of the left ventricle on the vascular wall of the blood that it throws into the aorta during systole from the skin surface.In the research, apical heart rate is measured with a stethoscope.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean of blood cortisol level (mg/dl)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Adrenal cortisol release is largely regulated by the limbic system-hypothalamus-pituitary and adrenal (L-HPA) axis.When an individual detects an environmental stimulus or stress to be avoided, activation of the HPA-axis is initiated in the central nervous system, and a physiological process occurs to stimulate the adrenal gland to release glucocorticoids for cortisol release.There are sources showing that the maximum cortisol values are between 04:00 and 08:00. The half-life of cortisol in circulation is 60 minutes, so the blood concentration changes rapidly. For this reason, interventions in the study are performed within hours when the serum cortisol level is highest and blood will be drawn for cortisol 5 minutes after the application.</description>

    <measure>Means of subjective anxiety scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is used to measure subjective anxiety scores.The State Anxiety Inventory is a 4-point Likert-type scale consisting of 20 questions aimed at measuring how individuals are feeling right now.The Trait Anxiety Inventory is a 20-item scale that generally determines how the individual feels, regardless of the situation and circumstances in which the individual is present.</description>
