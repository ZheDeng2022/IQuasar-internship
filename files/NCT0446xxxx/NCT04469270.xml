      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      administration of Engensis on pain in participants with painful diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (DPN) in the feet and lower legs, as compared to Placebo, as a second Phase 3,&#xD;
      well controlled study, sufficient in supporting the efficacy and safety of Engensis.&#xD;

      Overall Design VMDN-003-2 is an adaptive Phase 3, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Engensis&#xD;
      (containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient VM202) in Participants with painful DPN.&#xD;
      Following completion of the informed consent process, Screening activities (during 45 days&#xD;
      [from Day -52 to Day -7] prior to Day 0) will determine which Participants meet all-but-one&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, which are assessed by an adjudication procedure, followed by completion&#xD;
      of a 7-day eDiary prior to Day 0. Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a double-blind fashion and in a 1:1 ratio on Day 0 to either Engensis or Placebo.&#xD;
      During Screening, medical history and familial cancer history, demographics, vital signs,&#xD;
      height, body mass index (BMI), waist size, physical examination, retinal fundoscopy (by an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound of the right and left&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscles (to guide IM Study Injections), laboratory assessments, estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), HBA1c levels, viral screening, a record of all concomitant&#xD;
      medications and procedures, urine drug analysis, and urine pregnancy test for females of&#xD;
      childbearing potential will be conducted. In addition, the following procedures will be&#xD;
      conducted during Screening: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Accurate Pain&#xD;
      Reporting (APR) and Placebo Response Reduction (PRR), Michigan Neuropathy Screening&#xD;
      Instrument (MNSI), and cancer screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 7 days before Day 0 and randomization, Participants must complete the full Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (BPI-DPN) on an eDiary for determining the&#xD;
      Average Daily Pain Scores (ADPSs) for at least 5 out of the 7 days. Adverse event (AE)&#xD;
      assessments will start upon completion of the consent process at the start of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time prior to dosing on Day 0, Bedside Sensory Testing (BST) should be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, and prior to the first IM injections of Engensis or Placebo on Day&#xD;
      0, the partial BPI-DPN, , and quality of life instruments will be completed. Blood will be&#xD;
      collected for testing of selected cytokines, anti-HGF antibodies, and laboratory assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Participants will receive sixteen (16) 0.5-mL IM injections of Engensis or Placebo in&#xD;
      each calf gastrocnemius muscle at each of two Visits during two Treatment Cycles: Treatment&#xD;
      Cycle 1 on Day 0 and Day 14, and Treatment Cycle 2 on Day 90 and Day 104. At 2 hours (± 1&#xD;
      hour) after completion of IM injections of Engensis or Placebo on Days 0 and 14 and Days 90&#xD;
      and 104, vital signs and blood draw for cytokine levels will be performed. Treatment-emergent&#xD;
      adverse event (TEAE) assessment, including injection site reactions, will start as of&#xD;
      randomization (Day 0) and continue throughout the study. Follow-up Study Visits will be&#xD;
      conducted on Days 28, 60, 150, and 180 or early termination (ET). Vital signs will be&#xD;
      recorded at all Study Visits. At the Day 180 Visit (end of study), the following assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted: the full BPI-DPN (performed for 7 days prior to the Day 180 Visit), MNSI,&#xD;
      BST, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and the quality of life assessments (36-item&#xD;
      Short Form Health Survey [SF-36] and EuroQol Health Utilities Index [EQ-5D]), urine drug&#xD;
      analysis, retinal fundoscopy, physical examination, concomitant medications and procedures,&#xD;
      and anti-HGF antibodies. Blood will be drawn for determination of serum chemistry, lipid&#xD;
      profile, pregnancy status, hematology, and HbA1c levels. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of Engensis compared to Placebo as measured by changes in the&#xD;
      means of the Average Daily Pain Scores (ADPSs) of the full BPI-DPN, selected blood cytokines,&#xD;
      BST, and assessments of injection site reactions, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      assessments, vital signs, TEAEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study and Treatment Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will occur up to 52 days prior to Baseline (Day 0) and Participants will be&#xD;
      followed from Day 0, the day of first Study Injections, to Day 180/ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Frequency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented Participants will be seen and evaluated for enrollment during Screening (up to 52&#xD;
      days prior to Baseline, Day 0). There are 8 visits to the Clinical Site during the study from&#xD;
      Day 0 to Day 180 for Study Injections and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Groups and Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatment groups of Participants (Engensis or Placebo) will be in the study for 180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants (N = 152 to approximately 250):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size is a minimum of 152 Participants and the maximum sample size is 250&#xD;
      Participants based on the proposed adaptive design analysis. The final sample size of&#xD;
      Participants to be enrolled and evaluated will be determined by the independent Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (DMC). An interim analysis will be conducted after approximately 50% of&#xD;
      Participants in the target sample (i.e., 76 Participants) have completed the primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint at Day 180 or have withdrawn prematurely. The DMC will make a recommendation based&#xD;
      on an unblinded (comparative) power analysis.&#xD;
