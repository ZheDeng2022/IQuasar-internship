  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatomegaly is common in the morbidly obese patients and it may hamper the access to the&#xD;
      hiatal region during bariatric surgery. The doctors made a preliminary prospective study that&#xD;
      showed that a preoperative 4-week course of 1.500 Mg/ day without caloric restriction&#xD;
      resulted in a 20 % reduction in the volume of the left liver lobe (segment 2 and 3) on&#xD;
      ultrasounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine whether a 4-week preoperative course with omega-3&#xD;
      without caloric restriction (1650 mg of omega-3 / day for 4 weeks) may reduce liver volume&#xD;
      and its fat content, rendering thus surgery easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is the reduction of the volume of the left liver lobe as measured by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points are: the reduction of the whole liver volume, liver steatosis, liver&#xD;
      injuries during surgery, and duration of surgery, the evolution of liver tests as well as the&#xD;
      correlation between preoperative MRI data and intraoperative liver biopsy for the&#xD;
      quantification of liver steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an interventional, prospective, multicentric, randomized, double&#xD;
      blinded clinical trial. Morbidly obese patients with metabolic syndrome candidate to&#xD;
      bariatric surgery fulfilling criteria for bariatric surgery as established by the Haute&#xD;
      Autorité de Santé are elegible for the study. Number of subjects to be enrolled: 44 patients&#xD;
      in 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study time schedule: At the time of the enrollment visit two visits are scheduled, the first&#xD;
      before the beginning of the study and the last at the end. Surgery is scheduled no more than&#xD;
      7 days after the end of the treatment. At time of these two visits a clinical examination is&#xD;
      performed avec calculation of the BMI, blood tests (ASAT, ALAT; GGT, total, HDL and LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, glycemia, C-peptide, HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, C reactive protein)&#xD;
      and a MRI to evaluate the volume and the fat content of the liver. At time of surgery&#xD;
      duration of surgery and any eventual liver injury are recorded and a liver biopsy is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that, as shown by the preliminary study, the omega-3, will result in a&#xD;
      reduction in the volume of the left liver lobe of 20 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: If a 4-week preoperative course of omega-3 without caloric restriction results in&#xD;
      a significant reduction of liver volume and steatosis before bariatric surgery, it may be&#xD;
      recommended as a systematic preoperative treatment.&#xD;
