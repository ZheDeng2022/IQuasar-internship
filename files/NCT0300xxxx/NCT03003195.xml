  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an investigational agent,&#xD;
      P10s-PADRE, a peptide mimotope-based vaccine in subjects with metastatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After signing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent, subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      cancer will be enrolled. The vaccine doses will be prepared and dispensed by the University&#xD;
      of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Pharmacy following the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive 1.0 mL subcutaneous injections of the vaccine on 4 separate occasions.&#xD;
      The vaccine will be administered at rotating sites on the limbs or abdomen. The study will&#xD;
      last approximately 12 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of all races with clinical Stage IV cancer of any type, staged according to&#xD;
             American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC), sixth edition, receiving any line of&#xD;
             standard treatment for the specific cancer and with stable disease or better for at&#xD;
             least two months will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of all races with clinical Stage IV cancer of any type, staged according to&#xD;
             American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC), sixth edition, who have no standard&#xD;
             treatment options for the specific cancer (Patients whose standard of care consists of&#xD;
             watchful waiting) and who fulfill the other eligibility criteria will be invited to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bone-only disease will be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance status 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  White blood cells (WBC) count ≥ 3,000/mm3 within 3 weeks prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL)&#xD;
             of normal obtained within 3 weeks prior to registration or Aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             test (AST) ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal obtained within 3 weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit (IUL) of normal obtained within 3 weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.8 mg/dl obtained within 3 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign an informed consent document approved by UAMS Institutional Review Board&#xD;
             (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring treatment with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing diagnosis or history of organic brain syndrome that precludes participation&#xD;
             in the full protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing diagnosis or history of significant impairment of basal cognitive function&#xD;
             that might preclude participation in the full protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other current malignancies. Subjects with prior history at any time of any in situ&#xD;
             cancer, including lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervical cancer in situ,&#xD;
             atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or Clark I melanoma in situ, or basal or squamous&#xD;
             skin cancer are eligible, provided they are disease-free of these other malignancies&#xD;
             at the time of registration. Subjects with other malignancies - other than the one for&#xD;
             which they are being treated - are eligible if they have been continuously disease&#xD;
             free (from the old cancer) for ≥ 5 years prior to the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing diagnosis or history of autoimmune disorders or conditions of&#xD;
             immunosuppression. This includes, but is not limited to, being treated with&#xD;
             corticosteroids, including oral steroids (i.e. prednisone, dexamethasone [except when&#xD;
             used as an antiemetic in standard therapy]), continuous use of topical steroid creams&#xD;
             or ointments or any steroid-containing inhalers. Subjects who have been on systemic&#xD;
             steroids will require a 6-week washout period. Subjects who discontinue the use of&#xD;
             these classes of medication for at least 6 weeks prior to registration are eligible&#xD;
             if, in the judgment of the treating physician, the subject is not likely to require&#xD;
             these classes of drugs during the treatment period. Replacement doses of steroids for&#xD;
             subjects with adrenal insufficiency are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding, due to the unknown effects of peptide/mimotope vaccines&#xD;
             on a fetus or infant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study drug, and&#xD;
             must be counseled to use an accepted and effective method of contraception while on&#xD;
             treatment and for a period of 18 months after completing or discontinuing treatment.&#xD;
             Accepted methods include oral contraceptives, barrier method, IUDs, and abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
