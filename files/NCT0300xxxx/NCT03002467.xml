      The Investigator postulate that the use of PESI in addition to routine clinical practice, as&#xD;
      opposed to routine clinical practice based on clinical judgment alone, will help physicians&#xD;
      to correctly identify PE patients at low-risk of adverse outcomes. Considered that low-risk&#xD;
      patients could benefit from a short hospital stay, aim of this study is to demonstrate that&#xD;
      the use of PESI will lead physicians to discharge these patients earlier, thus reducing the&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay of PE patients (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients diagnosed with PE at the emergency department (ED) and admitted to participating&#xD;
      units represent the target population&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the availability of DOACs may influence the duration of hospital stay, the secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the present study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to demonstrate that a shorter hospital stay for low-risk PE patients (independently on&#xD;
           the method used to identify them) will reduce the incidence of hospital-associated&#xD;
           complications and improve patients satisfaction and quality of life, without increasing&#xD;
           the incidence of PE-related complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to demonstrate that the use of PESI, as opposed to clinical judgment alone, will be&#xD;
           associated with a greater proportion of patients discharged early (&lt; 72 hours from ED&#xD;
           admission) or treated entirely at home (&lt; 24 hours from ED admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to demonstrate that the use of DOACs will reduce the duration of hospital stay of PE&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to demonstrate that the use of DOACs, as opposed to standard treatment, will be&#xD;
           associated with a greater proportion of patients discharged early (&lt; 72 hours from ED&#xD;
           admission) or treated entirely at home (&lt; 24 hours from ED admission).&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 24 hours from acute PE diagnosis, each treating physician (local Investigator) will be&#xD;
      centrally randomized. Treating physicians (local Investigator) of the participating Units&#xD;
      will call the coordinating centres by phone for randomization. Before randomization, in order&#xD;
      to avoid any influence on treatment choice, each treating physician (local Investigator)&#xD;
      should declare in advance which treatment strategy will use for his patient&#xD;
      (intention-to-treat), i.e. standard treatment with heparin plus vitamin K antagonist&#xD;
      (standard group) or DOACs (DOACs group) Randomization will be stratified by treatment choice&#xD;
      of the local Investigator. Each of two 'intention-to-treat' approaches will be therefore&#xD;
      randomized to two arms, i.e. arm 1 or arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: treating physicians must formally calculate PESI and report in the clinical record&#xD;
      form* each day of hospitalization on top of routine clinical practice (standard care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: standard care (i.e. no formally calculation of PESI on top)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed centrally with a 1:1 ratio, following a computer-generated&#xD;
      list of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised physicians:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Local Investigator of participating canters. All participating centres are Internal&#xD;
      Medicine Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PE population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive adult outpatients of any age, gender and race, with an objectively confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of a suspected or unsuspected acute PE at the emergency department (ED) and&#xD;
      admitted to participating units will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected PE means that diagnosis has been made by an imaging test (computed tomographic&#xD;
      pulmonary angiography [CTPA], pulmonary angiography, V/Q lung scan) prescribed by a treating&#xD;
      physician who had clinical suspicion of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unsuspected PE means that diagnosis has been made incidentally by an imaging test performed&#xD;
      for other clinical indications (e.g. cancer staging or follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective diagnosis of acute PE means: a positive computed tomographic pulmonary angiography&#xD;
      (CTPA), a positive pulmonary angiography, a high-probability V/Q lung scan (or perfusion lung&#xD;
      scan with negative chest X-ray), or intermediate probability V/Q or perfusion lung scan with&#xD;
      proximal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) documented by compression ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that the distribution of hospital stay duration for PE will&#xD;
      have a standard deviation of 4 days. The I vestigators also hypothesize that the mean&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay will be reduced by at least 15% in PE patients whose treating&#xD;
      physician will be randomised to formally use PESI and by 5% in PE patients whose treating&#xD;
      physician will not be randomised to formally calculate PESI. Low-risk PE patients are almost&#xD;
      50% of all PE population. Therefore, with an α error of 0.05 and a statistical power (1-β&#xD;
      error) of 80%, 200 patients for each group (a total of 400 patients) need to be enrolled to&#xD;
      find a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between the mean hospital stay length.&#xD;
      As the variable 'hospital stay length' will have a non-normal distribution and needs to be&#xD;
      expressed and reported as median, 10% extra patients need to be enrolled to reach a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference with the previous statistical assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final total sample size will be, therefore, of 440 patients (220 patients for each group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main study parameter/endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome is the median length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy outcomes will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. health-system measures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  proportion of patients undergoing short-hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  proportion of patients undergoing complete home-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  post-discharge hospital re-admission&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  post-discharge outpatient visits to emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patient-related outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quality of life (5-point Likert scale questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety outcomes will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. overall mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PE-related&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PE-related mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  recurrent PE and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  major bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  clinically relevant non-major bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  minor bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  other anticoagulation-related complications (hematoma/infection at heparin or&#xD;
                fondaparinux injection sites, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalization-related&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hospital-acquired infections (pneumonia; urinary tract infection; other)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  iatrogenic complications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  immobilization syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pressure sores&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall mortality, PE-related safety outcomes, post-discharge hospital re-admission and&#xD;
      outpatient visits to emergency department will be measured at 14 days, 30 days, and 90 days.&#xD;
