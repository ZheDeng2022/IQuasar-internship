    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and how well durvalumab and tremelimumab&#xD;
      work in treating patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      liver. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the safety of durvalumab and tremelimumab following radioembolization with&#xD;
      selective internal radiation (SIR)-Spheres in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS)&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the hepatic response rate of SIR-Spheres followed by durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab in patients with MSS metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the overall&#xD;
      treated population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe the overall response rate of the treated population. III. Describe the&#xD;
      extra-hepatic response in the treated population (abscopal responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe intra-tumor immune alterations following SIR-Spheres, and following durvalumab&#xD;
      plus tremelimumab in comparison to baseline through serial hepatic metastases biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe the immune alterations in the blood following SIR-Spheres and following&#xD;
      durvalumab plus tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and tremelimumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at week 17, patients receive&#xD;
      durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 9 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
