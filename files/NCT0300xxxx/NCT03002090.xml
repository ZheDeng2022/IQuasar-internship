    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is known to negatively impact physical performance, attention, and time spent&#xD;
      doing physical activity. As a result, an iron deficient person must expend more energy to&#xD;
      complete the same amount of work as someone who is healthy. Another interesting relationship&#xD;
      has been observed between exercise training and iron status in that women who participate in&#xD;
      exercise training often have higher rates of iron deficiency than sedentary women. ID is&#xD;
      commonly treated using daily iron supplementation. However, it is currently unknown whether&#xD;
      participating in regular exercise somehow impacts the effectiveness of iron supplementation.&#xD;
      Iron deficient women who participate in exercise programs may potentially benefit less from&#xD;
      iron supplementation than those who do not. Another common treatment for the symptoms of iron&#xD;
      deficiency is the traditional Chinese herbal treatment, Ba-Zhen-Ke-Li (BZKL). While studies&#xD;
      have shown that BZKL impacts expression of some iron-related proteins and increases endurance&#xD;
      performance in rats, no studies have examined the efficacy of BZKL in improving iron markers&#xD;
      or physical performance in humans. This study will compare the efficacy of BZKL in improving&#xD;
      iron status and physical performance with that of ferrous sulfate supplementation. The&#xD;
      Cornell research team will achieve these objectives in collaboration with colleagues at&#xD;
      Kunming Medical University (KMU) in Kunming, China. A double-blind, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study will be conducted by a Cornell graduate student at KMU. The subjects will be&#xD;
      healthy women, age 18-26 years, attending KMU. Blood samples will be collected and analyzed&#xD;
      for measures of iron).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of ferrous sulfate (10 mg of elemental&#xD;
      iron), 6mg of BZKL, or an identical placebo pill twice daily for 8 weeks. Subjects will be&#xD;
      further randomly sub-divided to receive aerobic exercise training or no training during the&#xD;
      8-week supplementation period. At weeks 4 and 8, subjects will perform the same series of&#xD;
      tests as was performed at baseline. The investigators hypothesize that: 1. the women who&#xD;
      train and received iron will have smaller improvements in iron status than those who do not&#xD;
      train 2. The women who receive iron and train will have greater improvements in physical&#xD;
      performance than those who train and do not receive iron, and 3. The women who receive BZKL&#xD;
      will improve their iron status or physical performance more than those who receive placebo.&#xD;

      Background: Despite the overall improvements in malnutrition in the Chinese population, iron&#xD;
      deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (low iron and low hemoglobin, IDA) are still&#xD;
      widely prevalent in China. According to recent studies, the prevalence of anemia in Chinese&#xD;
      women of childbearing age is 20% and can be as high as 30% in rural areas, with 85% of anemia&#xD;
      cases resulting from ID. Diabetes, heart disease, and obesity are also highly prevalent in&#xD;
      China - though the Chinese government is taking actions against these epidemics, often via&#xD;
      interventions promoting physical activity. Iron deficiency without anemia (IDNA) can impair&#xD;
      adult physical performance and lowers time spent doing voluntary physical activities.&#xD;
      However, iron supplementation intended to alleviate IDNA may be less effective in those who&#xD;
      are physically active, suggesting an intricate, but currently undefined, relationship between&#xD;
      iron status, exercise, and physical performance capacity. A combined analysis of iron status,&#xD;
      exercise training, and physical performance in Chinese women could illuminate interactions&#xD;
      between these factors and their role in diabetes and obesity reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One common treatment for the symptoms of iron deficiency is the traditional Chinese herbal&#xD;
      treatment, Ba-Zhen-Ke-Li (BZKL). While studies have shown that BZKL impacts expression of&#xD;
      some iron-related proteins and increases endurance performance in rats, no studies have&#xD;
      examined the efficacy of BZKL in improving iron markers or physical performance in humans.&#xD;
      This study will compare the efficacy of BZKL in improving iron status and physical&#xD;
      performance with that of ferrous sulfate supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed research is to clarify the relationship between iron status,&#xD;
      physical performance, and aerobic exercise training. By conducting an iron intervention study&#xD;
      in combination with an exercise training program, the investigators can examine the modifying&#xD;
      effect of iron status on the physical performance changes from aerobic exercise training as&#xD;
      well as the modifying effect of participation in aerobic exercise in maintenance of iron&#xD;
      status. To achieve this goal, a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial will be&#xD;
      conducted with Chinese collegiate women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will be organized along three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I: To determine how changes in iron status, alone or in combination with exercise&#xD;
      training, influence physical performance. Hypothesis: Subjects who both improve iron status&#xD;
      and receive exercise training will show improvements in physical performance greater than the&#xD;
      additive improvements resulting from either treatment alone. This result would suggest iron&#xD;
      replete individuals benefit more from exercise training than those who are iron deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II: To determine how aerobic exercise training affects the maintenance of iron&#xD;
      homeostasis. Hypothesis: Subjects participating in exercise training will show smaller&#xD;
      improvements in iron status from iron supplementation than sedentary subjects who receive the&#xD;
      same iron supplementation. This would suggest regular exercise training negatively impacts&#xD;
      iron absorption, iron excretion and/or iron homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim III: To determine whether BZKL can be used as an alternative to iron supplementation for&#xD;
      improving iron status or physical performance of iron deficient, non-anemic women.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Those women who receive BZKL will improve in iron status and physical performance&#xD;
      measures more than those who receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research in Aims 1 and 2 is important because there is no known explanation for&#xD;
      the observed relationships between iron, exercise training, and physical performance in IDNA.&#xD;
      This research will allow clarification of the role that iron status plays in modifying the&#xD;
      effects of exercise training on physical performance as well as whether participation in&#xD;
      exercise impacts effectiveness of iron supplementation in improving iron status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term significance of this research is that establishing these relationships will&#xD;
      further the current understanding of how iron status impacts and is impacted by aerobic&#xD;
      exercise and physical performance. This knowledge could lead to improved physical activity&#xD;
      interventions, which help reduce chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes in populations&#xD;
      with high prevalence of ID, such as the U.S. and China. It will also help to inform iron&#xD;
      interventions designed to alleviate ID in physically active populations, such as rural&#xD;
      Chinese laborers and women in developed countries who participate in aerobic training to&#xD;
      improve fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be female subjects between the ages of 18-26 years with low body iron but&#xD;
      normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels, (ferritin &lt;20 Î¼g/L and Hb &gt; 120 g/L) who are otherwise&#xD;
      healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial with a 3x2 design.&#xD;
      Power calculations were based on the pilot study performed by the investigators in Shanghai&#xD;
      in 2013 and a study by Brownlie et al. Sample size was calculated to require 24 women per&#xD;
      group, which was expanded to 29 subjects per group to allow for sample dropout. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either 50mg of ferrous sulfate capsule twice a day (20mg elemental&#xD;
      iron/day), 6 mg of BaZhen KeLi, or identical placebo capsules for 8 weeks. Half of each&#xD;
      supplement group will also be randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training (5 days/week, 25 minutes/day) or no training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 0, 4, and 8 subjects will complete the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, skinfold thickness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical activity and 4-day dietary intake questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Resting venous blood draw for iron status assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exercise testing (VO2max test and energetic efficiency test)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Aims 1 and 2, the investigators will compare energetic efficiency, maximum ability&#xD;
      to use oxygen, ventilatory threshold, and blood lactate concentrations at baseline, after&#xD;
      supplementation (or placebo), and after exercise training (or no training). The 3x2 study&#xD;
      design will allow for the determination of whether subjects receiving iron benefit more from&#xD;
      exercise training. The investigators will also examine whether participating in exercise&#xD;
      training affects iron homeostasis or lowers iron status.&#xD;
