      The goals of the proposed research were to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. describe the person and environment characteristics and activity patterns of residents&#xD;
           in long-term care (LTC) facilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. modify the evidence-based, occupation-based cultural heritage intervention (OBCHI)&#xD;
           grounded on the results of Aim 1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. test the effectiveness of the OBCHI intended to facilitate adaptation to relocation into&#xD;
           LTC facilities relative to a usual activities group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention conducted by in-house staff&#xD;
           compared to the control group; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. examine person and environment factors as potential moderators of the relationship&#xD;
           between treatment condition and adaptation outcomes.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the person and environment characteristics and activity patterns of residents&#xD;
           in LTC facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modify the OBCHI grounded on the evidence-based results of Aim 1 specific to these&#xD;
           facilities and residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the effectiveness of the OBCHI conducted by activity department staff, relative to&#xD;
           usual activities, as measured by quality of life, activity engagement, and social&#xD;
           participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1a-c: Those receiving OBCHI will have significantly greater improvement in&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) quality of life, b) activity engagement, and c) social participation at&#xD;
           post-intervention relative to those receiving usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H2a-c: Those receiving OBCHI will have greater maintenance of improvements in a) quality&#xD;
           of life, b) activity engagement, and c) social participation at 1-month follow-up,&#xD;
           relative to those receiving usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in terms of quality adjusted life&#xD;
           year (QALY) and other health factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H3: When OBCHI is proven to be more effective in promoting quality of life than usual&#xD;
           activities, the investigators will expect the OBCHI to produce a higher QALY at a lower&#xD;
           cost per QALY.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H4: Between these two mutually exclusive treatments, the OBCHI intervention will be more&#xD;
           efficient (more effective and less costly) or cost saving with a negative incremental&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) when compared to those receiving usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examine person characteristics (i.e. cultural heritage, life experiences social support,&#xD;
           resilience, depression, and resident demographics [age, gender, ethnicity]) and select&#xD;
           environment characteristics (i.e., participant perceptions of the intervention and&#xD;
           facility) as potential moderators of the relationship between treatment condition (OBCHI&#xD;
           versus usual care) and change in adaptation outcomes from pre- to post-intervention.&#xD;

      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the need for LTC increases with the steady growth of older adults, relocation into&#xD;
      residential settings will grow. About 70 percent of persons over 65 will require spending&#xD;
      time in LTC services, with 40 percent requiring nursing home care for a period of time.&#xD;
      Relocation is moving from one permanent home to another permanent home which is sometimes&#xD;
      precipitated by an illness and considered a significant life event. Skinner noted a forced&#xD;
      relocation could have disturbing effects upon the elderly including loss of social and&#xD;
      community connections. However, even with a planned relocation, encountering this new and&#xD;
      unfamiliar environment requires the older person to rethink the ways in which his or her life&#xD;
      will differ with adjustment duration of a few weeks to several years. Many factors determine&#xD;
      the ways in which this 'new life' will evolve including: past adaptive strategies and life&#xD;
      experiences, family support systems, socioeconomic resources, and cultural values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moving from a familiar environment to an unfamiliar one involves adaptation, regardless of&#xD;
      age. Adaptation is a process involving interaction between the person and environment.&#xD;
      Indicators of successful adaptation to LTC have included: developing a sense of identity and&#xD;
      place, having care needs met, knowing and being known to other residents, maintaining or&#xD;
      developing social networks, continuity of lifestyle, and maintaining control over life&#xD;
      situations. As defined for this study, adaptation is a normal process by which a person&#xD;
      encounters a perceived challenge in the environment and is able to successfully manage that&#xD;
      challenge as measured by increased quality of life, activity engagement and social&#xD;
      participation. Central to adaptation is the cultural heritage that an individual brings to&#xD;
      the LTC facility upon relocation. Because culture is the learned beliefs, values, customs,&#xD;
      actions, communication, and life ways of an individual, it can be expected to permeate all&#xD;
      aspects of life in a residential facility. Attention to an individual's cultural heritage has&#xD;
      begun to make in-roads to the daily life routines encountered in these facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acknowledgement of the resident's culture is a major contributing factor to his/her quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL). However, QOL is a complex construct and has been used synonymously with terms&#xD;
      like well-being, life satisfaction, and functional health. Lawton asserted that QOL is a&#xD;
      collection of dimensions comprised of both objective and subjective factors which may include&#xD;
      all or some of the following: behavioral competence, objective environment, perceived QOL,&#xD;
      psychological well-being, and health-related status. Other factors associated with QOL&#xD;
      include: interaction with family and friends, personal qualities, room and meal items, number&#xD;
      of health problems, staff-resident ratios and continuity of care. These findings attest to&#xD;
      the importance of a person-environment 'match' when QOL issues for residents are considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incorporating meaningful activity and social connections into the lives of elders that have&#xD;
      been circumscribed by illness and disability is particularly important to QOL. Gerontological&#xD;
      literature concerning the activities of elders has concentrated upon personal care and&#xD;
      instrumental activities and how they contribute to health and functional status. These&#xD;
      obligatory tasks are essential to one's survival, but perhaps even more significant to an&#xD;
      elder's well-being are those discretionary activities involving social and meaningful&#xD;
      occupations; such findings support the proposition that activity and social support systems&#xD;
      are important in mediating the impact of illness on well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the relationship of relocation, culture, adaptation, QOL, activity engagement,&#xD;
      and social participation is reflected in outcomes where failure to provide culturally&#xD;
      competent and culturally sensitive care have occurred. With increasing diversity of the US&#xD;
      population, practitioners are challenged to deliver culturally competent services and to&#xD;
      improve the QOL for diverse LTC residents.&#xD;
