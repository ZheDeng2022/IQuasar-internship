      Because of the genetic and traditional commonalities between the underlying causes of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancers, we hypothesized that patients with&#xD;
      atherosclerotic CVD may have a high incidence of cancers when compared with those with&#xD;
      non-atherosclerotic CVD. To address this hypothesis, we investigated longitudinal clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in a total of 32,095 consecutive patients with CVD enrolled in the Sakakibara Health&#xD;
      Integrative Profile (SHIP) cohort study which was launched in 2006 for the purpose of&#xD;
      improving healthy life expectancy in patients with CVD in our institute.&#xD;

      The SHIP cohort study was launched in 2006 for the purpose of improving healthy life&#xD;
      expectancy in patients with any cardiovascular diseases (CVD) who were admitted to the&#xD;
      Sakakibara Heart Institute. The study used a continuous surveillance system to track all&#xD;
      subsequent incidents of CVD and/or non-CVD including cancers, via direct contact in the&#xD;
      outpatient department, hospital records, and a mailed questionnaire at least once a year.&#xD;
      Organ sites of cancers were also identified whenever possible. The study sorted any diagnoses&#xD;
      of CVD into nine categories, namely coronary artery diseases, aortic diseases, peripheral&#xD;
      artery diseases, myocardial diseases, unclassified or any-cause heart failure, valvular heart&#xD;
      diseases, arrhythmias, congenital CVD, and others. For example, if a patient had a couple of&#xD;
      diseases, he or she had a plural category. Cerebrovascular diseases were included in the&#xD;
      category of 'others' because of the mixed cause for the diseases such as embolic strokes,&#xD;
      lacunar infarction, cardio-embolic strokes, and hemorrhagic strokes, etc. Atherosclerotic CVD&#xD;
      were defined by the presence of one or more of the following three diseases: coronary artery&#xD;
      diseases, aortic diseases and peripheral artery diseases. With regard to the detail of&#xD;
      coronary artery diseases, there were acute coronary syndromes, previous myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and stable ischemic heart diseases. Aortic diseases consisted of acute aortic syndromes and&#xD;
      aortic aneurysms. Non-atherosclerotic CVD were defined as any CVD except atherosclerotic and&#xD;
      congenital CVD. The SHIP cohort study also handled to define lifestyle related diseases when&#xD;
      confirmed a diagnosis of one or more of the presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and chronic kidney disease in accordance with the universal criteria. A history of&#xD;
      tobacco smoking was also identified. Among a total of 36,151 patients with any CVD enrolled&#xD;
      in the SHIP cohort study between June 2006 and July 2014, we excluded 245 patients who had&#xD;
      already been diagnosed with any cancers at the time of enrollment in the SHIP cohort study,&#xD;
      and 3,811 patients with congenital CVD including Marfan syndrome. Thus, we analyzed a total&#xD;
      of 32,095 consecutive patients with acquired CVD in the present study.Our study was conducted&#xD;
      in two steps to assess an incidence of cancers in patients with acquired CVD. The first step&#xD;
      consisted of a comparison between those with atherosclerotic CVD and non-atherosclerotic CVD&#xD;
      with regard to an incidence of cancers. The second step determined the association between a&#xD;
      singular presence versus a plural presence of atherosclerotic CVD and an incidence of&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
