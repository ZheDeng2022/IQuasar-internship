      Autoimmune PAP is a rare lung disease affecting less than 5,000 individuals in US with no&#xD;
      FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy. Results from &quot;off-label&quot; use in case reports and clinical&#xD;
      studies completed outside of the US indicate that inhaled rhGM-CSF may be a safe and&#xD;
      effective thera-py for autoimmune PAP. Preliminary clinical trials of inhaled rhGM-CSF in&#xD;
      autoimmune PAP patients show promising results, 62%-96% therapeutic response rate without any&#xD;
      identifiable drug-related adverse effects in at least 73 autoimmune PAP patients. However,&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), optimal dose, and treatment duration to&#xD;
      maximize efficacy are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to begin to address these knowledge gaps for inhaled sargramostim for autoimmune&#xD;
      PAP patients with a pilot safety and PK/PD study (TPSC-110). TPSC-110, PharmPAP, which is a&#xD;
      self-controlled open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD of inhaled&#xD;
      sargra-mostim in autoimmune PAP patients. These results will impact the field by 1)&#xD;
      confirming existing published data, 2) monitoring the local effects of inhaled sargramostim&#xD;
      in autoimmune PAP patients, 3) potentially demonstrating a safe starting dose for a later&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled sargramostim for autoimmune PAP.&#xD;

      PAP is a rare syndrome of surfactant accumulation and resulting hypoxemic respiratory failure&#xD;
      that occurs in a number of diseases classified pathogenically into three groups: primary PAP&#xD;
      (caused by disruption of GM-CSF signaling - autoimmune PAP, hereditary PAP), secondary PAP&#xD;
      (caused by reduction in alveolar macrophage numbers and/or functions), and surfactant&#xD;
      dysfunction-related PAP (caused by mutations in genes required for normal surfactant&#xD;
      production). In current clinical practice, PAP is diagnosed based on a lung biopsy; an&#xD;
      approach that is not able to identify the etiology of the PAP. Current therapy involves the&#xD;
      physical removal of surfactant by a procedure in which the lungs are repeatedly filled with&#xD;
      saline and emptied - whole lung lavage, which is invasive, inefficient, and not widely&#xD;
      available, especially for children. Importantly, research advances have elucidated the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of diseases causing PAP in most patients and have identified new diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches. Simple blood-based research tests can now identify the PAP-causing&#xD;
      disease in about 95% of patients. Further, several promising potential disease-specific&#xD;
      therapies are currently in development. Preliminary clinical trials of inhaled rhGM-CSF in&#xD;
      autoimmune PAP patients show promising results, 62%-96% therapeutic response rate at two&#xD;
      doses (250 and 500 mcg/day) without any identified safety concerns. At least 73 people with&#xD;
      autoimmune PAP have been reported to have received inhaled sargramostim with no identified&#xD;
      drug-related adverse effects. However, the PK, PD, optimal dose, and treatment duration&#xD;
      needed to maximize efficacy are unknown. The short-term goal is to address knowledge gaps for&#xD;
      inhaled sargramostim for autoimmune PAP patients in the following clinical study: a pilot&#xD;
      safety and PK/PD study (TPSC-110). A major goal of this protocol is to evaluate the local and&#xD;
      systemic safety, PK, and PD one dose of inhaled sargramostim in autoimmune PAP. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that in patients with autoimmune PAP, aerosol inhalation of sargramostim will&#xD;
      be well-tolerated and safe because the GM-CSF autoantibody will limit detection of free&#xD;
      GM-CSF thereby preventing local and systemic toxicity. The specific objectives of this study&#xD;
      are to: 1) evaluate the safety profile of one dose of inhaled sargramostim in patients with&#xD;
      autoimmune PAP 2) estimate the PK profile of inhaled sargramostim following single dose&#xD;
      administration in patients with autoimmune PAP 3) measure the PD effects of inhaled&#xD;
      sargramostim following single dose administration in patients with autoimmune PAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is adults with autoimmune PAP who have measurable, clinically&#xD;
      significant disease satisfying all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study design&#xD;
      will involve recruitment, screening, and enrollment of participants into a phase I,&#xD;
      open-label, multi-site study. Sargramostim will be administered to autoimmune PAP patients&#xD;
      via aerosol inhalation one time at a dose of 125 mcg or 250 mcg. Adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      serious AEs (SAEs), PK, and PD parameters will be evaluated (see Appendix 3 Schedule of&#xD;
      Events). The experimental approach will evaluate 1) safety of inhaled sargramostim by&#xD;
      documenting occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs, 2) PK profile of GM-CSF in serum&#xD;
      and BAL fluid, 3) local and systemic PD effects of inhaled GM-CSF and 4) effects of inhaled&#xD;
      GM-CSF on the quality of life for participants. Anticipated results will determine the safety&#xD;
      profile of inhaled sargramostim in patients with autoimmune PAP, will evaluate total and free&#xD;
      GM-CSF levels in blood and lung, effects of sargramostim on blood and BAL cell counts,&#xD;
      differentials, baseline- and GM-CSF-responsiveness of blood leukocytes and BAL cells, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of PAP in patients with autoimmune PAP after single dose administration. These&#xD;
      results will impact the field by 1) confirming existing published data, 2) monitoring local&#xD;
      effects of inhaled sargramostim in autoimmune PAP patients, 3) demonstrating a safe starting&#xD;
      dose to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled sargramostim for autoimmune PAP.&#xD;
