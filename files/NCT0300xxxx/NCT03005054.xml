  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 20 participants will be enrolled in this trial if they have had an accident that&#xD;
      damages both the dermal (outside) and epidermal (inside) layers of skin on up to 49% of their&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This condition is called full-thickness complex skin defects resulting from acute traumatic&#xD;
      skin loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with StrataGraft skin tissue to evaluate it's safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness for use in treating full-thickness complex skin defects.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this range-finding study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of single or repeated application of StrataGraft skin tissue in full-thickness&#xD;
      complex skin defects resulting from acute traumatic skin loss (eg, thermal burns or degloving&#xD;
      injuries) requiring surgical excision and autografting.&#xD;

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There IS an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to protracted enrollment and limited wound closure in the first three subjects, the Sponsor decided to end further enrollment and the study was terminated with only 3 subjects enrolled into Cohort 1. No participants were enrolled into Cohort 2. Therefore, posted results include primary outcome measures for the 3 subjects enrolled, but no data for the secondary outcome measures.</limitations_and_caveats>
