  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An array of soft tissue augmentation techniques have been employed concomitant to implant&#xD;
      placement, as free connective tissue grafts or pedicle grafts for keratinized tissue&#xD;
      thickening in attempt not only to augment the soft tissue for better resistance to&#xD;
      inflammation and improved esthetic stability, but to preserve buccal bone thickness as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results obtained from the literature were controversial regarding the need of soft tissue&#xD;
      augmentation to curb buccal bone resorption and preserve pink esthetics. Scarce literature&#xD;
      was found, that monitored the ridge alterations following implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will monitor the effect of soft tissue augmentation on soft tissue esthetics and&#xD;
      buccal bone resorption during the process of remodeling in a measurable way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar bone remodeling following extraction could not be prevented by immediate implant&#xD;
      placement. Soft tissue augmentaion techniques have been suggested in order to overcome the&#xD;
      alterations of buccal bone during remodeling. Nevertheless, it is still inconclusive whether&#xD;
      soft tissue augmentation procedures actually have a protective role in preserving buccal bone&#xD;
      thickness in immediate implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim is to clinically and radiographically assess the effect of soft tissue grafting on buccal&#xD;
      bone resorption and pink esthetics around immediately placed implants in maxillary anterior&#xD;
      teeth after 24 months following implant placement. 18 non-restorable maxillary anterior teeth&#xD;
      randomly assigned into 2 groups: (test group) immediately placed implants with simultaneous&#xD;
      vascular interpositional periosteal connective tissue (VIP-CT) grafting versus non-augmented&#xD;
      implant sites (control group). Buccal bone changes were assessed at implant placement (0) and&#xD;
      at 4,9,12 and 24 months from baseline by specially manufactured device and at 24 months by&#xD;
      cone beam computed tomography scans (CBCT). Pink esthetic score (PES) was evaluated at 6, 9,&#xD;
      12 and 24 months intervals. Pain and satisfaction were assessed through questionnaires to the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
