      This study aims to compare the efficacy of monthly IPTp-DP with monthly IPTp-SP to determine&#xD;
      if IPTp-DP is associated with a reduction in malaria infection at delivery among HIV-negative&#xD;
      women in an area with high levels of SP resistance in Malawi.&#xD;

      Problem to be studied Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) due to Plasmodium falciparum infection is a&#xD;
      major cause of maternal morbidity and poor birth outcomes in malaria-endemic countries.&#xD;
      Pregnant women are at increased risk of more frequent and severe malaria infections than&#xD;
      non-pregnant women. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which involves administration of treatment doses of SP at&#xD;
      each antenatal visit in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, at least one month&#xD;
      apart, irrespective of malaria parasitemia, is currently recommended for all women, except&#xD;
      HIV positive women taking daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, in areas with stable moderate to&#xD;
      high transmission of malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SP is the only drug currently used for IPTp. Due to increasing resistance to SP, it is no&#xD;
      longer used as a treatment for symptomatic malaria, however, IPTp-SP remains effective even&#xD;
      in areas where SP resistance in children under five (determined by in vivo efficacy studies)&#xD;
      is up to 26%, and continues to be used for IPTp in countries where SP is no longer&#xD;
      recommended to treat symptomatic malaria. However, IPTp-SP has become more controversial&#xD;
      given recent data from northern Tanzania and Malawi that have demonstrated that at higher&#xD;
      rates of resistance, IPTp-SP may no longer be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative drugs which could replace SP have been tested; mefloquine,&#xD;
      azithromycin-chloroquine, and amodiaquine have been abandoned as options due to poor&#xD;
      tolerability among pregnant women. Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) remains an attractive&#xD;
      option because of the long half-life of piperaquine (PQ) and the demonstrated efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability in pregnancy. Recent studies in Kenya and Uganda using DP for IPTp&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant reduction in the prevalence of malaria throughout pregnancy and at&#xD;
      the time of delivery. However, there was not a clear benefit in terms of improved neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. Additional studies are therefore needed to determine the impact of switching from&#xD;
      IPTp-SP to IPTp-DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims Primary objectives To compare the efficacy of monthly IPTp-DP with monthly IPTp-SP&#xD;
      to determine if IPTp-DP is associated with a reduction in malaria infection at delivery among&#xD;
      HIV-negative women in an area with high levels of SP resistance in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if IPTp-DP results in decreased fetal morbidity compared with IPTp-SP,&#xD;
           where fetal morbidity is defined as the composite of any of the following: Preterm birth&#xD;
           (&lt; 37 weeks gestation), low birth weight (LBW) (&lt; 2,500 grams), or small for gestational&#xD;
           age (SGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tolerability and safety of IPTp-DP in the second and third trimesters of&#xD;
           pregnancy, including an assessment of cardiac risk, as measured by changes in QTc&#xD;
           intervals from baseline with each successive dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the frequency of adverse events and fetal congenital malformations in IPTp-DP&#xD;
           with IPTp-SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess how SP and DP affect the maternal intestinal and vaginal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Open-label, 2 arm randomized controlled superiority trial to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of IPTp-DP to IPTp-SP in Malawi. The trial is designed to show a 60% decrease in&#xD;
      malaria infection at delivery among HIV-negative women of all gravidity when IPTp-DP is used&#xD;
      instead of IPTp-SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected findings and dissemination It is expected that in areas of high SP resistance,&#xD;
      IPTp-DP will be superior to IPTp-SP in decreasing malaria infection at delivery. In addition,&#xD;
      it is anticipated that DP will be well-tolerated among pregnant women and that fetal outcomes&#xD;
      will be better than IPTp-SP.&#xD;
