      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel)/rituximab-coated nanoparticle AR160 in treating&#xD;
      patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or is not responding to&#xD;
      treatment. Nab-paclitaxel/rituximab-coated nanoparticle AR160 is a combination of paclitaxel&#xD;
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and rituximab. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such&#xD;
      as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulation and rituximab may work better in treating patients with B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nab-paclitaxel/rituximab-coated&#xD;
      nanoparticle AR160 (AR160) in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL). (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity and safety of AR160. II. To assess complete response rate (CR)&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of AR160 with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      B-cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of AR160 in two formal PK studies, dose 1 of cycle 1 (48&#xD;
      hours [h] PK analysis) and dose 1 of cycle 2 (24h PK analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel/rituximab-coated nanoparticle AR160 intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
