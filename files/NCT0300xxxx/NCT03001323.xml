    <textblock>
      Given the longer half life of insulin degludec compared to glargine /levemir ,investigators&#xD;
      believe that insulin degludec will reduce the rate of recurrent DKA. The investigator will&#xD;
      randomize participants to control and intervention group. Control group will receive&#xD;
      Lantus/Levemir and intervention group will receive degludec. The investigators will call&#xD;
      participants monthly and see them in the clinic every three months.The investigators will&#xD;
      follow them for 1 year and evaluate if there will be a difference in rate of DKA in between&#xD;
      these two groups.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a longer-lasting basal insulin (degludec) in patients with recurrent Diabetic&#xD;
      Ketoacidosis (DKA) will reduce the rate of recurrent DKA and improve adherence to daily&#xD;
      administration in patients who have had 2 or more episode of DKA in the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) to Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC)&#xD;
      who have a prior episode of DKA within 2 years will be offered enrollment in a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized unblinded trial to determine whether long acting insulin degludec will reduce the&#xD;
      rate of recurrent DKA and improve compliance over the period of 1 year when compared with the&#xD;
      control group who will stay on their pre-study long acting insulin (glargine or detemir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the difference in rate of recurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) over 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months in participants who have a history of previous DKA and medication adherence&#xD;
      between groups treated with degludec vs other long-acting insulins (glargine or detemir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BG control (Hba1c during study period) tested q 3 months Discharge long-acting insulin dose&#xD;
      compared to admission dose LOS for DKA admission Number of readmissions in one year Number of&#xD;
      ER visits Hypoglycemia -self reported, documented by glucometer or ER visit for severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia Adherence to study regimen from phone call information and clinic visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age &gt;18 year with previous diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus and previous admission for&#xD;
      DKA in any facility within the prior 2 years who meet the criteria for DKA at the time of&#xD;
      admission and are willing to participate in the study protocol will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DKA is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum bicarbonate below 18 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anion Gap over greater than or equal to 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serum ketones or beta hydroxybutyrate elevation &gt; 3 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Serum glucose greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients with no previous DKA, patients who are not willing to consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study protocol for 1 year, pregnant women, dementia, and end stage renal&#xD;
      disease on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will obtain informed consent and enroll participants admitted to the Hennepin&#xD;
      County Medical Center (HCMC) in this study from Jan 2016 until investigators have adequate&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect the initial data as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age, sex, height, weight, BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age at diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number previous DKA admissions in past 2 years, lifetime (even if the admission was to&#xD;
           other hospitals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Preadmission insulin dosing - long acting&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reason for DKA&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Alcohol, drug use, homelessness, mental illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Admission labs - HCO3, AG, BOHB, glucose, creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Length of stay with each DKA episode( LOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly assign to the intervention or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge on once a day degludec insulin by pen (supplied by Novo) at dose 0.3 U/kg with&#xD;
      reduction to 0.2 U/kg for GFR &lt;30 ml/hr. Degludec insulin will be started at study initiation&#xD;
      during the hospitalization if the participant is randomized to this arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fast acting insulin that participant is using will be adjusted so that total daily dose given&#xD;
      to cover 2 or 3 meals is equal to the long-acting insulin dose. Participants will have basal&#xD;
      bolus regimen either using carbohydrate counting or with set doses for meals, depending on&#xD;
      their ability. Participants will use the fast acting insulin they were on at the time of&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin adjustment if hypoglycemia (less than 60 mg/dl) or if fasting BG over 140 despite&#xD;
      insulin compliance. For hypoglycemia, dose will be lowered 0.05 U/kg and for elevated fasting&#xD;
      glucose it will be raised 0.05 U/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone calls every month to check on dose, compliance, hospital admissions, and hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Compliance with medication will be verified verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits every 3 months for 1 year with dose adjustment as above. Supply adequate&#xD;
      insulin degludec until next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge on 0.3 U/kg of admission long acting insulin glargine or detemir (provided by&#xD;
      diabetes and endocrine clinic) regardless of participant's home insulin regimen at the time&#xD;
      of admission with reduction to 0.2 U/kg in CKD with GFR &lt;30 ml/hr. This will be done at the&#xD;
      time of study initiation during the hospitalization if the participant is randomized to this&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fast acting insulin adjustment with meals and insulin adjustment for hypoglycemia will be&#xD;
      done similarly as in the intervention group. Phone calls every month to check on dose,&#xD;
      compliance, hospital admissions, and hypoglycemia. Compliance will be assessed verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits every 3 months for 1 year with insulin dose adjustment as above. Supply&#xD;
      adequate insulin glargine or detemir until next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), Minneapolis, MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Sample size, power calculation and statistical plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators determined that considering incidence of DKA 100 % (since all patients admitted&#xD;
      with DKA would be eligible for screening), moreover, in order to observe 30 % reduction in&#xD;
      DKA related hospitalization over 2 years period in intervention group and by keeping power at&#xD;
      80 % with confidence interval (CI) of 0.05, study will need to enroll 21 subjects in each&#xD;
      group or 42 total sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to mitigate the effects of loss to follow up, noncompliance and protocol deviations,&#xD;
      intention to treat (ITT) analysis will be performed on primary and secondary outcome measure&#xD;
      for both groups. A separate analysis will be done including those patient who will complete&#xD;
      the trial in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data of intervention and control group will be compared. In case of significant&#xD;
      differences, further analysis will be done to adjust for those differences prior to final&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ITT analysis will be based on in ITT comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be used for analyzing the data using&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis software (SAS) 9.4. For continuous variables, mean, median and variance&#xD;
      will be reported, while for discrete variables rate, risk ratios, relative risk, rate of&#xD;
      occurrence and percentage differences will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary outcome measure, investigators will use Ï‡2 test to assess relationship between&#xD;
      the primary outcome and some of the binary nature secondary measures. Stratification will be&#xD;
      used for analysis as needed. In that case, chi-square tests for overall and within relevant&#xD;
      stratifications will be conducted. To assess the difference between continuous variables&#xD;
      (such as hemoglobin A1C, bicarbonate, anion gap, Creatinine etc.), t-test will be used for&#xD;
      normally distributed data. Otherwise Mann-Whitney U test will be used. P-values at 95 % CI&#xD;
      will be reported. Since it is a superiority trial, we will use one-tail test for&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
