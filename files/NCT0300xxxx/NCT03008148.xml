  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase II/III, open-label, randomized, parallel and standard&#xD;
      chemoradiation-controlled study where eligible subjects will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive control treatment or study treatment. The primary objective of this trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of add-on JP001 to standard chemoradiation in increasing overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) on newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After enrollment, subjects' previous tumor block used for glioblastoma diagnosis that is&#xD;
      consented to provide during the study period will be sent to a central laboratory for the&#xD;
      assessment of MGMT status. Moreover, subjects will be randomized in either Control or Study&#xD;
      arm at Visit 2. Subjects in Control arm will receive a standard chemoradiation. However,&#xD;
      subjects in Study arm will receive a standard chemoradiation in combination with concurrent&#xD;
      JP001 in whole study period. During the study, a sufficient amount of investigational&#xD;
      products will be supplied to subjects in study groups until next scheduled visits. Subjects&#xD;
      will self-administer investigational product orally with water at approximately the same time&#xD;
      in each day. Subjects should fast for a minimum of 2 hours prior to any doses of JP001 and/or&#xD;
      Temozolomide and then fast for another 1 hour after taking JP001 and/or Temozolomide. During&#xD;
      and at the end of treatment, subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety parameters.&#xD;
      Moreover, there will be a Follow-up visit for safety 4 weeks after the End-of-Treatment&#xD;
      visit. If a subject is early withdrawn from the study, the End-of-Treatment visit should be&#xD;
      arranged and all assessments assigned in this visit should be performed. The Safety Follow-up&#xD;
      visit for early withdrawn subjects could be either clinic visit or telephone contact. If&#xD;
      withdrawn subjects refuse to perform Follow-up visit, the Follow-up visit is allowed to&#xD;
      cancel. For subjects who completed or discontinued study treatment, assessment of survival&#xD;
      status will be performed every 8 weeks by telephone contact until death, study end (last&#xD;
      subject last visit; the last subject needs to be followed at least 30 months), or study&#xD;
      termination by Sponsor. Survival information will be recorded in the medical source and CRF.&#xD;
      If subjects are lost to follow-up or refuse to receive the assessment of survival status, the&#xD;
      investigator will record the last date subjects known to be alive in the medical source and&#xD;
      case report form.&#xD;
