  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemay005 is a novel phosphodiesterase type 4(PDE4) inhibitor being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of psoriasis. This study is the first administration of Hemay005 in humans to&#xD;
      establish the initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile following single&#xD;
      doses of Hemay005. A total of approximately 44 subjects will be randomized into 6&#xD;
      cohorts(10mg, 20mg, 40mg, 80mg, 120mg, 180mg), approximately 8 healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled (6 active and 2 placebo) at each dose cohort by sentinel method(1 active and 1&#xD;
      placebo,5 active and 1 placebo), with the exception of 10mg (4 active) cohort. This study&#xD;
      includes an 28-day Screening Period, a 1-day Treatment Period, and an End of Study Visit&#xD;
      occurring approximately 11days (±3 days) after study drug administration.&#xD;
