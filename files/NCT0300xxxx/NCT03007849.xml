      Patients with sickle cell disease often develop painful crisis without any obvious reasons.&#xD;
      Some patients are more likely to develop this complication than others. It is now clear that&#xD;
      painful crisis only occurs when sickled red blood cells stick to white blood cells that have&#xD;
      been activated, usually by inflammation or infections. A recent study in mice with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease showed that the use of long term antibiotics could reduce the number of&#xD;
      activated white blood cells and reduce death of the mice during sickle cell crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that sickle cell patients who develop frequent painful crisis may&#xD;
      have a different pattern of bacteria in their intestine when compared to those whose painful&#xD;
      crisis occurs infrequently. In this study, the investigators propose to study sickle cell&#xD;
      subject's blood to determine how many activated white blood cells he/she have. The&#xD;
      investigators will also examine his/her stool to compare the bacteria in his/her stool to&#xD;
      those other sickle cell patients. The investigators will then investigate whether or not the&#xD;
      results from the blood and stool tests correlate with how frequently the patient develops&#xD;
      painful crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the patients' medical records to find out how many times they&#xD;
      have been admitted to the hospital for sickle cell crisis in the last 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators will also obtain information on the following: their age, their sex, whether&#xD;
      they are taking hydroxyurea or Penicillin, when they last had a transfusion or exchange&#xD;
      transfusion therapy and painful crisis needing hospital admission, whether they have received&#xD;
      any antibiotics (other than Penicillin) in the last 4 weeks, and whether they are&#xD;
      experiencing a painful crisis at the time that they enter the study. The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain, from their previous laboratory results, their levels of hemoglobin F and markers of&#xD;
      inflammation. The investigators will check their hemoglobin F level if they have not already&#xD;
      had this tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to enroll 50 subjects into this study at Rhode Island&#xD;
      Hospital/Hasbro Children's Hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The clinical course of sickle cell disease (SCD) is very variable. Some patients experience&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive disease infrequently, but other patients develop the complication recurrently.&#xD;
      The reason for the difference remains unclear. Although erythrocyte sickling occurs due to&#xD;
      factors such as dehydration, infections, extreme of temperatures, acidosis, and hypoxia,&#xD;
      neutrophil adhesion and activation are crucial in eliciting the vaso-occlusive crisis in&#xD;
      patients with SCD. Activated neutrophils upregulate the expression of various cellular&#xD;
      adhesion molecules that increase their &quot;stickiness&quot; in vivo. A murine model of SCD&#xD;
      demonstrated the importance of the intestinal microbiome in influencing the kinetics of&#xD;
      ageing neutrophils. Depletion of the microbiota with prolonged courses of broad-spectrum&#xD;
      systemic antibiotics resulted in a reduction of the number of these neutrophils and&#xD;
      protection against LPS-induced fatal vaso-occlusive crisis in these mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal barrier is a functional barrier that separates the gut lumen from the inner host.&#xD;
      It consists of mechanical elements (mucus, epithelial layer), humoral elements (defensins,&#xD;
      IgA), immunologic elements (lymphocytes, innate immune cells), muscular and neurological&#xD;
      element. Although the normal intestinal microbiota is the main source of endogenous&#xD;
      pathogens, it also contributes to the functional integrity of the intestinal barrier through&#xD;
      its interaction with the other components of the barrier. Failure of any of these components&#xD;
      will result in a breakdown of the protective intestinal barrier with the consequence of&#xD;
      recurrent intestinal-derived bacteremia/septicemia. A breakdown of the normal microbiome has&#xD;
      been implicated in the development of various pathologic states, including Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      following allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant, colon cancer, and metabolic&#xD;
      disorders such as obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explain the reason for the development of frequent vaso-occlusive crisis in some patients&#xD;
      with SCD, the investigators' stepwise hypothesis is that, due to the sickling process and the&#xD;
      consequent development of intestinal ischemia, patients with SCD, especially those with&#xD;
      frequent vaso-occlusive crisis, are more likely to have altered microbiota than healthy&#xD;
      individuals. If the normal microbiota is altered, the intestinal barrier will be compromised,&#xD;
      rendering the patients more susceptible to recurrent bacteremia of intestinal origin. Since&#xD;
      most SCD patients with vaso-occlusive crisis present without any obvious infections, it is&#xD;
      likely that the compromised intestinal barrier facilitates an inoculum of bacteremia not high&#xD;
      enough to cause overt infections but sufficient to activate neutrophils and elicit&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis. The first step towards testing this overall hypothesis is to test the&#xD;
      sub-hypothesis that altered intestinal microbiomes correlate with increased number of&#xD;
      activated neutrophils and frequent vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with SCD.&#xD;
