  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib when given together&#xD;
      with ramucirumab and how well they work in treating patients with gastric or gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent), or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Olaparib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as ramucirumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving olaparib&#xD;
      and ramucirumab may work better in treating patients with gastric or gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction cancer compared to ramucirumab and paclitaxel (a chemotherapy drug) or ramucirumab&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and ramucirumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>The association of BROCA HR assay with Signature 3 will be assessed using a series of contingency table analyses. The association of the presence of an individual mutation from the BROCA HR panel with the signature 3 (yes/no) using Fisher's exact test. Using a Cochran Mantel Haenzel test the relationship across all three measures will be examined. Finally, the relationship of each of these measures with response will be examined. To do this multiple logistic regression models can be fit with the response (complete response/partial response vs stable disease/partial disease) considered as the outcome variable and the assay measures can be used predictors.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because&#xD;
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;&#xD;
             a scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required; the patient can&#xD;

             for therapeutic anticoagulation must be clearly documented prior to enrollment and&#xD;
             must be discussed with the principal investigator (PI); due to risk of serious&#xD;
             bleeding with ramucirumab, patients on greater than or equal to 2 anti-thrombotic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the combination/comparator agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women are excluded from this study because olaparib and&#xD;
             ramucirumab have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised patients, this includes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive&#xD;
             patients, because of the potential for interaction with antiretroviral therapy and&#xD;
             ramucirumab and/or olaparib; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute&#xD;
             myelogenous leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow biopsy, if&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have had a prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double&#xD;

             hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red&#xD;
             blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable)&#xD;
