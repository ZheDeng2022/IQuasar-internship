    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance and safety of the fluorescence based fibre optic glucose&#xD;
      sensor for home usage.24 subjects will take part in the study, including 4 pre-diabetic&#xD;
      subjects, 8 Type I diabetic patients, 8 Type II diabetic patients and 4 diabetic patients who&#xD;
      require continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Type 1, Type 2 and prediabetic&#xD;
      subjects will wear one FiberSense sensor, randomly allocated to either the upper arm (50%) or&#xD;
      abdomen (50%) for 28 days. In addition, these subjects will wear a Dexcom sensor on the other&#xD;
      side of the abdomen for 7 days in one of the four study weeks. In all 4 CAPD subjects, one&#xD;
      FiberSense sensor will be placed in the upper arm for 28 days. No additional comparator&#xD;
      sensor will be placed in CAPD subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FiberSense system is a glucose-monitoring device indicated for continually recording&#xD;
      interstitial fluid glucose levels in patients ages 18 and older with insulin dependent&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus for the purpose of improving diabetes management. The System is intended&#xD;
      for use by patients at home and in health care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FiberSense system is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not&#xD;
      replace, information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FiberSense system aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these&#xD;
      excursions.&#xD;
