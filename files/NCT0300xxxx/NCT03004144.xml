  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross-sectional study investigating the impact of assistive forces applied by&#xD;
      the body-weight support system &quot;the FLOAT&quot; on the study participants. The study is conducted&#xD;
      at the University Hospital Balgrist in Zurich over a period of around 3 years. During this&#xD;
      time measurements on approximately 140 able bodied subjects and 60 patients with an&#xD;
      incomplete spinal cord injury will take place. The study participants are invited for a&#xD;
      single visit of around 140 min duration to the University Hospital Balgrist. During this&#xD;
      visit the study participants will repeatedly perform various activities of daily living (free&#xD;
      walking, standing up and sitting down, stair climbing and balancing) with and without&#xD;
      assistive forces from the body-weight support system. While performing the tasks, the study&#xD;
      participants' motions and muscle activities will be measured to evaluate the naturalness of&#xD;
      their movements. In addition, the collected data permits us to compare different movement&#xD;
      patterns and make conclusions about effective and optimal movement support. Obtaining this&#xD;
      knowledge will help us to shape the therapy of these activities to be tailored to the&#xD;
      patients and to train these movements with the help of the FLOAT under optimal conditions.&#xD;
