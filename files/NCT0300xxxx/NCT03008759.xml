    <textblock>
      The literature recognizes that fluoride is the most widely used and studied means for dental&#xD;
      remineralization. The use of fluoride toothpaste in brushing is considered more rational&#xD;
      method for the prevention of caries. However, the current challenge of toothpaste is the&#xD;
      substantivity, so new compounds have been introduced into these formulations. This study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate the in vivo effect of fluoride dentifrice containing nanoencapsulated Fluoride&#xD;
      (Nano-F) - in fluoride retention in saliva and dental plaque. A study of the clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory type, crossover, double-blind, randomized will be held. After sample calculation,&#xD;
      the total of 12 individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old, healthy, decayed, missing, and&#xD;
      filled teeth index less than 6 and residents in brazilian northeast capital will be part of&#xD;
      the sample. Fluoride bioavailability will be evaluated in the biofilm and saliva after the&#xD;
      use of fluoridated weekly. The biofilm will be assessed on 1h and 12 h after brushing; and&#xD;
      unstimulated saliva in times of 3, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes and 12 hours after. It will be 3&#xD;
      toothpastes: 50% Nanoencapsulated Fluoride, 100% Nanoencapsulated Fluoride and Free sodium&#xD;
      fluoride. Between weeks of use, brushing will be extended washout (without fluoride) to avoid&#xD;
      carryover effect. inferential data analysis will be carried out, considering the amount of&#xD;
      alpha &lt;0.05. So knowing that caries is a dynamic process, the largest fluoride retention in&#xD;
      the oral fluids promoted by the Nanoencapsulated Fluoride may have important impact on Des-Re&#xD;
      process and in the control of dental caries&#xD;

      1. Study design It is a quantitative study of double-blind randomized crossover clinical&#xD;
           type with inductive approach and documentation of technical and direct observation with&#xD;
           measurements in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to assess the bioavailability of intraoral fluoride week after the use of&#xD;
           fluoride toothpastes containing Nanoencapsulated Fluoride, it will be collected biofilm&#xD;
           samples 1h and 12 h after brushing; and unstimulated saliva in times of 3, 15, 30, 45,&#xD;
           60 minutes and 12 hours after. The data will be obtained by physical and chemical&#xD;
           analysis of the samples of fluoride (F). Therefore, the study will consist of two&#xD;
           interrelated steps: a clinical phase for biofilm collection and saliva; and laboratory&#xD;
           stage for fluoride analysis in the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Will be conducted pilot test with three participants before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample Size The sample size calculation was performed using fluoride concentration data&#xD;
           in dental biofilm previous study and taking effect size difference between the&#xD;
           experimental dentifrice (100% Nanoencapsulated Fluoride ) and positive control of at&#xD;
           least 3.4 ppm of F- in biofilm after 12 hours, namely, 25%. Admitting experimental&#xD;
           protocol with beta error of 10% alpha error of 5%, one-tailed and statistical power of&#xD;
           90%, the sample size was calculated for 6 people. For the calculation we used the Excel&#xD;
           software and mathematical formula for clinical trials of superiority given. Adding&#xD;
           sample loss resulted in 12 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Experimental Dentifrice For this study will be used four toothpastes: 50%&#xD;
           Nanoencapsulated Fluoride, 100% Nanoencapsulated Fluoride, Free sodium fluoride, Without&#xD;
           fluoride. The toothpaste, made available by the company from Brazil are packed in the&#xD;
           same packaging and have the taste of mint. Except wash out the tubes with toothpaste&#xD;
           will be identified by letters (A, B and C) by an independent researcher. The letters&#xD;
           code will not be revealed to the participants nor the researcher who will accompany&#xD;
           them. These will be drawn at random for daily use for seven days in four times, giving&#xD;
           an interval of one week wash-out between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In these periods of wash-out will use a toothpaste without fluoride. In the end, all&#xD;
           study participants will use the 5 experimental dentifrice at different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical phase The participant will be informed about the study and after its&#xD;
           acceptance, he/she will initiate the study. Initially will be clinical examination in&#xD;
           order to report the presence of any of the exclusion criteria already listed. After&#xD;
           verifying the absence of these criteria, there will be a dental prophylaxis pumice for&#xD;
           removal of this biofilm and in some cases may be made supragingival scraping. The&#xD;
           patient will be advised not to make use of any fluoride product during the experiment.&#xD;
           At first, volunteers are instructed to use a toothpaste without fluoride (wash out) the&#xD;
           first week, in order to equate the study participants and eliminate any potential&#xD;
           carryover effects of toothpaste used previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participant will get a tube of toothpaste and will be instructed to brush their&#xD;
           teeth for 1 minute and rinse with 10 mL of water twice a day (morning and night). On the&#xD;
           seventh day, the participant will be instructed to brush only the occlusal surfaces of&#xD;
           your teeth, to allow biofilm accumulation of flat surfaces. When going to bed, you are&#xD;
           warned not to eat or drink (except water) as well as not brushing your teeth until the&#xD;
           next day. On the following morning, approximately 12 hours after the last brushing and&#xD;
           fasting, the first dental biofilm sample and unstimulated saliva is collected. It will&#xD;
           be used to remove biofilm Hollenback vestibular faces, interproximal, palatal and&#xD;
           lingual right hemiarch and deposited in a pre-weighed Eppendorf tube in an analytical&#xD;
           balance. To saliva collection, the participant, at rest, will be instructed to spit for&#xD;
           a minute in a graduated glass tube. After that, the participant will brush the occlusal&#xD;
           surfaces for 1 min and rinse with 10 mL of water. Soon after, will new collection of&#xD;
           saliva and plaque. Saliva samples will give up in times of 3, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes&#xD;
           after brushing, while the biofilm left hemiarch will be collected one hour after&#xD;
           brushing. After the collection will be offered at breakfast organized by researchers&#xD;
           participating in the crown of that research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratorial phase Samples will be evaluated through physical-chemical analysis of&#xD;
           fluoride using calibrated fluoride electrode. Samples will be analyzed for fluoride&#xD;
           concentration using ion-specific electrode after diffusion facilitated with hexamethyl&#xD;
           disiloxane (HMDS). The calibration curve is made for each analysis. All analyzes will be&#xD;
           done in triplicate and be submitted for validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data analysis The study data will be analyzed by inferential statistics considering p&#xD;
           &lt;0.05.&#xD;
