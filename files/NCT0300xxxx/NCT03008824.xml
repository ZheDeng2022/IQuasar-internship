    <textblock>
      There is a rapidly escalating epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes across the world, with&#xD;
      the fastest rise occurring in low- and middle-income countries. India not only has one of the&#xD;
      highest rates in the world, but the disease starts at a younger age and lower levels of body&#xD;
      weight than in UK white caucasians. Among city-dwelling Indians, approximately 8% of people&#xD;
      aged 30-40 years already have diabetes. This is creating a heavy burden of disease and&#xD;
      disability, and an intolerable economic burden through medical costs and lost earnings. Until&#xD;
      now, efforts to prevent diabetes have mainly focussed on modifying the diet, lifestyle and&#xD;
      activity of at-risk adults (for example those who are overweight, have a family history of&#xD;
      diabetes or already have high blood sugar). However, recent research has indicated that&#xD;
      factors acting in early life (during development in the womb) place an individual at risk of&#xD;
      later diabetes. These include maternal malnutrition and low birthweight, and diabetes in the&#xD;
      mother during pregnancy. Our research has shown that Indian mothers often have low vitamin&#xD;
      B12 levels, which in turn causes high blood levels of a harmful metabolite (homocysteine). We&#xD;
      have shown that these mothers get more diabetes in pregnancy. Their children are more likely&#xD;
      to born with a low birth weight, and develop more body fat and higher plasma insulin levels&#xD;
      during childhood, which are signs of higher diabetes risk in later life. The risk is&#xD;
      increased further if the mother has normal or high status for another B vitamin, folate.&#xD;
      Thus, we have shown, for the first time a link between a specific nutritional deficiency in&#xD;
      the mother and diabetes risk in the next generation. One possible mechanism for the effect of&#xD;
      maternal nutrition on risk of diabetes in her children is through epigenetic effects, whereby&#xD;
      the nutritional environment during early development affects the switches that control gene&#xD;
      expression. Since these switches are passed on via either parent, we think it is possible&#xD;
      that paternal vitamin B12 status could also be important.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of GDM and offspring's metabolic risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an escalating epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) across the world in all ethnic&#xD;
      groups, in particular, people of South Asian origin. Current strategies for preventing T2D&#xD;
      rely mainly on altering risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle and healthy eating.&#xD;
      Though this is important, it is unlikely to make a big impact on this escalating epidemic,&#xD;
      which consumes significant proportion of health care budgets, world-wide. Some of the risk of&#xD;
      developing metabolic diseases such as T2D and cardiovascular disorders (CVD) are evident even&#xD;
      at birth. Indeed, recent research suggests that factors acting during early development,&#xD;
      including foetal growth restriction and exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) in the mother&#xD;
      increases diabetes and obesity risk in later life. The investigators recent work has shown&#xD;
      that maternal vitamin B12 insufficiency and hyper-homocysteinaemia, in combination with&#xD;
      normal/high maternal folate status, is associated with an increased risk of GDM in the&#xD;
      mothers, growth restriction in the foetus, and adiposity and insulin resistance in the&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDM is described as glucose intolerance first recognised in pregnancy. Similar to T2D, GDM is&#xD;
      also increasing at an alarming rate, attributed partly to increasing maternal age and body&#xD;
      weight. The current estimate is around 4% of all pregnancy though this could increase to as&#xD;
      much as 17% if the new IADPSG guidelines are implemented. Women who develop GDM are at 7-8&#xD;
      times higher risk of T2D13 and the children born to them are at higher risk of developing&#xD;
      T2D, abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life thus increasing their risk of CVD&#xD;
      in adulthood. Though the exact etiological processes of such increased risk not clear, some&#xD;
      of these effects could act through epigenetic mechanisms (intra-uterine programming).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study by Krishnaveni et al raises an intriguing possibility for a simple measure for&#xD;
      preventing GDM and future T2D. It is believed that the high prevalence of B12 insufficiency&#xD;
      in India was attributed to vegetarianism. As the majority of the UK population is&#xD;
      non-vegetarian, it is conceivable that B12 deficiency is unlikely during pregnancy. However,&#xD;
      the investigators have recently shown: a) B12 deficiency is not uncommon in women of&#xD;
      childbearing age (14%) and pregnant women (20% at 16-18 weeks of pregnancy) and b) B12&#xD;
      deficiency in GDM is associated with higher BMI and higher birth weight in a clinic&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological impact of GDM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers who are screened for GDM have lower perceived well-being. Diagnosis of GDM during&#xD;
      pregnancy often comes as a shock and causes significant distress to expectant mothers. There&#xD;
      is some evidence that such distress improves after treatment, presumably due to education and&#xD;
      support. These limited data come from women of Caucasian origin and no such data exists in&#xD;
      women of South Asian origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm these observations in the UK multi-ethnic population, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      carry out an adequately powered case-control study to examine: a) the influence of early&#xD;
      pregnancy B12, folate and homocysteine levels (as well as other clinical, biochemical and&#xD;
      genetic markers) on the risk of GDM and offspring's risk of future metabolic disorders by&#xD;
      measuring detailed anthropometry of the babies along with their biochemical and genetic&#xD;
      markers from the cord blood; and b) the psychological impact of diagnosis of GDM by measuring&#xD;
      the anxiety and distress by questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imbalance of B12, folate and homocysteine in early pregnancy predicts the risk of GDM in&#xD;
      mothers and metabolic risk of offspring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Pregnant women attending antenatal care in the UK; Cases will be pregnant women&#xD;
      carrying singleton foetuses, without pre-gestational diabetes, who are diagnosed with GDM&#xD;
      during the pregnancy. Equal number of South Asian and Caucasian mothers with GDM will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention / Exposure: Maternal vitamin B12, folate and homocysteine levels in early&#xD;
      pregnancy (&lt;16 weeks of gestation) Comparison Group: Mothers from the cohort who do not&#xD;
      develop GDM and are matched in age, parity and BMI to the cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational case-control study designed to compare early pregnancy B12,&#xD;
      folate and homocysteine levels in pregnant women who develop GDM (cases) and those who do not&#xD;
      (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no published data on the rate of B12 deficiency in GDM women in the UK and limited&#xD;
      data exists in non-GDM women in Caucasians. Preliminary results from the investigators' group&#xD;
      have shown that approximately 15% insufficiency in non-GDM and around 20%-25% in GDM women of&#xD;
      Caucasian origin. To detect a 5% difference in the prevalence of B12 insufficiency with 90%&#xD;
      power at the 5% significance level, 700 GDMs will be required. We plan to identify 1400&#xD;
      controls matched for age, BMI and parity. To achieve this,4080 pregnant women will be&#xD;
      required in their first trimester over the 2.5 years (if 20% develop GDM). Allowing for a 10%&#xD;
      drop-out rate and for age, parity &amp; BMI matching 4500 pregnant mothers will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several study launches are planned to raise the awareness among the public, midwifes and&#xD;
      general practitioners in the region. The relevant clinical research networks (CRNs) will be&#xD;
      involved from the beginning both to raise the awareness and for direct involvement in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most potential participants will be given the participant information sheet (PIS) when they&#xD;
      are seen for their booking visit by the community midwife. The midwife will assess their&#xD;
      eligibility for the study and hand out the PIS if they fit the inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      midwife will inform the research team of the mothers' details via a Reply Slip if she has no&#xD;
      objection to be contacted. The research team will then contact the mother and if possible,&#xD;
      the recruitment visit will be planned to coincide with her booking bloods or dating scan&#xD;
      appointment (usually around 12 weeks of gestation) to minimise the study visits ('Research&#xD;
      Team Recruitment', see right-hand side of Recruitment Flow chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the situation where a mother has been identified by her midwife as fitting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the study (i.e. she has high-risk factors for GDM and is therefore referred for&#xD;
      a GTT), but is not given a PIS at the booking visit, the research team will send this out by&#xD;
      post to the mother with an invitation letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback from the mothers at the recruitment visit (i.e. dating scan) suggests that the&#xD;
      mothers would have been happy to partake in the study at the same visit as receiving the PIS&#xD;
      for 4 main reasons: 1) the study (and the PIS) is simple to understand; 2) they spend a&#xD;
      significant amount of time awaiting scan and midwife appointment during this visit; 3) they&#xD;
      want to have their blood sample taken at the same visit (mothers have a blood test routinely&#xD;
      as a standard care); and 4) they prefer not to come back for a separate visit. The&#xD;
      investigators also believe this is reasonable as this is a non-interventional study and&#xD;
      provides opportunity for more mothers to participate in the study. Therefore if the mother&#xD;
      has had enough time to read and understand the PIS and provides consent, she could be&#xD;
      recruited straightaway and blood tests done together with her routine bloods on the same day.&#xD;
      However, if she prefers to take the PIS away and have more time to decide, the research team&#xD;
      will see her at a future date. Such a strategy can also be replicated in the community&#xD;
      booking visit to facilitate participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have basic demographic information collected and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements done during the recruitment visit and be asked to fill out physical activity and&#xD;
      psychological well-being questionnaires. To facilitate the ease of filling the questionnaire,&#xD;
      where ever possible patients will be given iPads to complete them. We will then collect blood&#xD;
      samples (approximately 15-20ml in addition to their routine booking bloods), a urine and&#xD;
      stool sample (optional) from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will have their OGTT at 24-28 weeks gestation and further blood, urine and stool&#xD;
      (optional) samples will be taken at this time for study purposes. Modified WHO (1998) and&#xD;
      NICE criteria will be used to diagnose gestational diabetes or not(i.e. fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose ≥ 6.1 mmol/l OR fasting plasma glucose &lt; 6.1 mmol/l and 2 hour plasma glucose &gt;&#xD;
      7.8mmol/l but &lt; 11.1 mmol/l on 75g glucose tolerance test). The criteria will be changed if&#xD;
      the new IADPSG criteria is adopted during the course of the study (or NICE updates its&#xD;
      criteria). The mothers will be asked to fill out further psychological well-being&#xD;
      questionnaires during the waiting time during the OGTT and for mothers subsequently diagnosed&#xD;
      with GDM, when they attend the antenatal-diabetes clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remainder of a participant's antenatal care will then carry on in the joint&#xD;
      antenatal-diabetes clinic (if she has been diagnosed with GDM) or in the community (for&#xD;
      non-GDM mothers, unless she has any other indication to be referred to the obstetric clinic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will have their deliveries in one of the NHS Hospitals involved in the&#xD;
      study. Cord blood, a piece of cord and placental biopsies (around 2cm each) will be taken at&#xD;
      the time of birth as well as detailed birth and neonatal outcome data and a stool sample from&#xD;
      the baby shortly afterwards. Baby's body fat content and distribution will be measured by the&#xD;
      'PEAPOD' machine. This is a non invasive, baby friendly way of accurately measuring the fat&#xD;
      distribution in the baby. This is optional. For mothers who have Caesarean sections (for&#xD;
      medical/obstetric reasons), we will ask for separate consent to take a sample of abdominal&#xD;
      fat and subcutaneous as well as myometrial smooth muscle tissues. All the samples obtained&#xD;
      will stored for future DNA isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the post-natal OGTT for GDM mothers (6 weeks post-partum) additional blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected and stored. Also, well-being questionnaires will be given out to all&#xD;
      participants post-natally. From 3 to 12 months, breast feeding mothers will be contacted&#xD;
      either through postal questionnaire or over the telephone.&#xD;
