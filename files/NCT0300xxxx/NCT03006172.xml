  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of inavolisib administered orally as a single agent in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CA-mutant solid tumors, including breast&#xD;
      cancer, and in combination with standard-of-care endocrine and/or targeted therapies for the&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage (Stage I) and an expansion stage (Stage II).&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of seven regimens: inavolisib as a single agent (Arm A),&#xD;
      inavolisib in combination with palbociclib and letrozole (Arm B), inavolisib in combination&#xD;
      with letrozole (Arm C), inavolisib in combination with fulvestrant (Arm D), inavolisib in&#xD;
      combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant (Arm E), inavolisib in combination with&#xD;
      palbociclib, fulvestrant, and metformin (Arm F), and inavolisib in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab (and letrozole or fulvestrant, if applicable (Arm G)).&#xD;
