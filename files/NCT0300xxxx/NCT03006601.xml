      This study aims to determine the treatment effect of vision therapy on myopic children by&#xD;
      assessment of accommodative function before and after therapy.&#xD;

      1. Specific aims of the proposed clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 To provide a definitive proof that vision therapy (VT) can improve the accommodative&#xD;
           function of myopic children by comparing the results from treatment group to placebo&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 To minimize the influences of confounding variables by randomly assigning the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 To observe the longitudinal effects of VT on accommodation system and its effect on&#xD;
           axial length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VT can improve the accommodative functions of 8-12 years old Chinese myopic children with&#xD;
      poor accommodative response.&#xD;

Patients will receive placebo procedure which were designed to look like real vergence/accommodative therapy procedures yet not stimulate vergence, accommodation, of fine saccadic eye movement skills beyond normal daily visual activities. Office-based procedures (60 minutes per visit, one time per week, 12 weeks) and home procedures (15 minutes each time, five times per week, 12 weeks) will be provided to patients.</description>
