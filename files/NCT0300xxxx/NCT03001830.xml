      The GO-8 study focuses on assessing safety and efficacy of gene therapy for patients with&#xD;
      severe haemophilia A&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilia A is an x-linked, life threatening bleeding disorder arising from defects in the&#xD;
      coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) gene. Current treatment for haemophilia A, the commonest&#xD;
      inherited bleeding disorder (prevalence of 1 in 5000 individuals) consists of life-long,&#xD;
      2-3X/week, intravenous injection of clotting factor concentrates, which is demanding,&#xD;
      exceedingly expensive not widely available nor curative. In contrast, gene therapy offers the&#xD;
      potential of a cure for haemophilia A as illustrated by our first unequivocal success in a&#xD;
      related condition, haemophilia B. In that study the investigators showed that a single&#xD;
      intravenous administration of a serotype 8 based adeno-associated virus, (AAV8) vector&#xD;
      encoding the factor IX (FIX) gene resulted in stable (&gt;6 years) therapeutic expression of FIX&#xD;
      without long-lasting toxicity. The investigators plan to use the same AAV8 platform to&#xD;
      evaluate a novel FVIII expression cassette, AAV2/8-HLP-FVIII-V3, in patient with haemophilia&#xD;
      A. Extensive preclinical studies demonstrate that AAV2/8-HLP-FVIII-V3 leads to long-term,&#xD;
      endogenous expression of FVIII in mouse and non-human primate models without toxicity even&#xD;
      when fifty-fold higher doses than the proposed starting clinical trial dose were used.&#xD;
      Therefore, an open label, Phase I/II dose escalation study entailing a single systemic&#xD;
      administration of AAV2/8-HLP-FVIII-V3 in adults (&gt;18 years of age) with severe haemophilia A&#xD;
      who have baseline factor FVIII levels of &lt;1% of normal has been designed to establish safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of our approach. Dosing will begin at 6x10^11 vector genome (vg)/kg progressing&#xD;
      sequentially to 2x10^12vg/kg and ultimately 6x10^12vg/kg in the absence of toxicity. A&#xD;
      minimum of 2 patients will be recruited at each dose with a possibility of expanding the dose&#xD;
      cohort to a maximum of 6 patients based on safety and efficacy. The study duration for each&#xD;
      patient will be 15 years after vector infusion.&#xD;
