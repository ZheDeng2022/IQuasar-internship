  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe any antitumor activity of avelumab monotherapy, as measured by the response&#xD;
           rate in patients with advanced or metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response of&#xD;
           avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced small intestinal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association of tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, MSI status, lymphocytic&#xD;
           infiltration, and somatic mutation burden with response.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the small intestine that is advanced (not&#xD;
             amenable to surgery) or metastatic (clinical stage IV). For the purposes of this&#xD;
             study, ampullary tumors are considered a part of the duodenum and are classified as&#xD;
             adenocarcinomas of the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
             Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria that has not been previously irradiated and which&#xD;
             can be followed by CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9/g/dL (may have been transfused)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤&#xD;
                  2.5 × ULN (or ≤ 5 × ULN if liver metastases are present)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min as&#xD;
                  calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archival tissue [paraffin block(s) or unstained slides from paraffin block(s)] from&#xD;
             the primary tumor and/or a metastatic site judged reasonably available prior to&#xD;
             initiating treatment, or willingness to undergo fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsy.&#xD;
             (Prior to initiating treatment, the screening team must have documentation that an&#xD;
             archival or fresh tumor specimen has been requested from a local or outside facility.&#xD;
             However, physical possession of requested tissue or waiting for histological analysis&#xD;
             or confirmation that an acquired specimen contains tumor tissue sufficient for&#xD;
             analysis is not a requirement prior to initiating treatment.) If no archival tissue is&#xD;
             available and patient consents to a fresh biopsy, but the patient's lesion is deemed&#xD;
             inaccessible to safe biopsy, the patient will be allowed to enroll if otherwise&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients able to father children&#xD;

             effective method of contraception (Appendix 4) from 15 days prior to first trial&#xD;
             treatment administration until at least 60 days after study participant's final dose&#xD;

                  sterile or post-menopausal (i.e. patient has not had a bilateral tubal ligation,&#xD;
                  a bilateral oophorectomy, or a complete hysterectomy; or has not been amenorrheic&#xD;
                  for 12 months without an alternative medical cause). Post-menopausal status in&#xD;
                  females under 55 years of age should be confirmed with a serum&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level within laboratory reference range for&#xD;
                  postmenopausal women.&#xD;

             re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented. Only the screening procedures performed&#xD;
             outside of protocol-specified timing must be repeated.&#xD;
