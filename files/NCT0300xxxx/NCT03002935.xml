  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I study of the bioavailability and safety of BPM31510&#xD;
      administered orally in healthy subjects dosed 3 times daily for 14 days. The last study dose&#xD;
      is administered on Day 15 (one morning dose only). The study will consist of 25 subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1. All subjects will self-administer&#xD;
      the Day 1 doses of study drug under supervision of the clinic staff. Doses of 3200 mg will be&#xD;
      administered three times per day before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will continue for an additional 14 days on an outpatient basis with Day 5 morning dose&#xD;
      and the last study dose on Day 15 to be administered at the clinic (one morning dose, is&#xD;
      given on Day 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 2, 5 and 15, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling will be&#xD;
      performed 30 minutes prior to the first dose, and 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the first dose&#xD;
      at all visits with an additional PK draw on Day 1 at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 after the second dose.&#xD;
      Urine for PK/PD will be collected pre-dose on Day 1, Day 2, Day 5 and Day 15. At all visits&#xD;
      (on Days 1, 2, 5 and at the final dose on Day 15), samples will be collected for chemistry,&#xD;
      Complete Blood Count (CBC), International normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT),&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (PTT), cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (HDL), and vitamin K level. Blood samples for PK/PD will be collected 30&#xD;
      minutes prior to the morning dose on Day 5 and Day 15 and also at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours&#xD;
      after dosing. Lab samples (chemistry, etc.), will also be drawn at the time of the first&#xD;
      PK/PD draw on Day 5 and Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone interview will be conducted no fewer than 25 days and no more than 35 days after the&#xD;
      last dose on Day 15 to collect information on concomitant medications and adverse events&#xD;
      Graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.&#xD;
