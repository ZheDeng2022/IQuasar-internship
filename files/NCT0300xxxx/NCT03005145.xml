  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Association&#xD;
      of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (AMMI) Canada, and Health Canada have all&#xD;
      declared antimicrobial resistance a global threat to health, based on rapidly increasing&#xD;
      resistance rates and declining new drug development. Up to 30-50% of antibiotic use is&#xD;
      inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to&#xD;
      inappropriate use. Shorter duration treatment (≤7 days) has been shown in meta-analyses to be&#xD;
      as effective as longer antibiotic treatment for a range of mild to moderate infections. A&#xD;
      landmark trial in critically ill patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia showed that&#xD;
      mortality and relapse rates were non-inferior in patients who received 8 vs 15 days of&#xD;
      treatment. Similar adequately powered randomized trial evidence is lacking for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with bloodstream infections caused by a wide spectrum of organisms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bloodstream infections are a common and serious problem, increasing length of hospital stay&#xD;
      by 2-3 weeks, adding $25,000-40,000 in excess hospital costs, and tripling the risk of death.&#xD;
      At the same time, antibiotic overuse is also a common and serious problem, in that 30-50% of&#xD;
      antibiotic use is unnecessary or inappropriate, and results in avoidable drug side effects&#xD;
      such as kidney failure, Clostridioides difficile infection, increased costs, and spiralling&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance rates. The greatest contributor to antibiotic overuse is excessive&#xD;
      durations of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive research has demonstrated that shorter duration antibiotic treatment (less or equal&#xD;
      to 7 days) is as effective as longer duration treatment for a variety of infectious diseases,&#xD;
      but this question has not been directly studied in the setting of bloodstream infection.&#xD;
      BALANCE team's systematic review of the medical literature, national survey of Canadian&#xD;
      infectious diseases and critical care physicians, multicentre retrospective study and BALANCE&#xD;
      pilot RCT, all support the need for a randomized controlled trial comparing shorter (7 days)&#xD;
      versus longer (14 days) antibiotic therapy for bloodstream infections. Prior to performing&#xD;
      the main trial, Investigators completed a pilot trial in ICU patients to establish the&#xD;
      feasibility of the research design, and to optimize the definitive trial. Investigators also&#xD;
      completed a pilot trial of non-ICUs patients to test the feasibility, compare the patient&#xD;
      population in two settings and to assess the reasonableness of expanding the main BALANCE&#xD;
      Trial to non-ICU wards. The overall recruitment rate of the non-ICU ward pilot RCT exceeded&#xD;
      the recruitment rate in the BALANCE ICU pilot RCT with a protocol adherence of 90%. The&#xD;
      results of this pilot were used to estimate the necessary sample size recalculation, after&#xD;
      merging the BALANCE ward trial with the BALANCE main trial, with the principle of maintaining&#xD;
      an equal to smaller non-inferiority margin by the trial's completion. With the completion of&#xD;
      this pilot RCT, the eligibility criteria for the BALANCE trial are also modified to broaden&#xD;
      the inclusion of all bacteremic patients admitted to hospital. By defining the duration of&#xD;
      treatment for bloodstream infections, BALANCE research program will help maximize the&#xD;
      clinical cure of individual patients, while minimizing their risk of drug side effects, C.&#xD;
      difficile, and antibiotic resistance. Since this intervention would require no new&#xD;
      technology, and would reduce (rather than increase) health care costs, it would offer&#xD;
      immediate benefits to patients and the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BALANCE RCT will randomize hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection to 7 versus&#xD;
      14 days of adequate antibiotic treatment; the antibiotic drugs, doses, routes and interval&#xD;
      will be left to the discretion of the treating team. Although placebo controls are not&#xD;
      feasible, prolonged allocation concealment to day 7 will be used to mitigate selection bias.&#xD;
      The primary analysis will assess whether 7 days is associated with non-inferior 90 day&#xD;
      survival as compared to 14 days of treatment. Participants from the vanguard BALANCE pilot&#xD;
      RCTs will be included in the BALANCE main RCT, and participating Canadian sites will continue&#xD;
      to enrol patients. BALANCE international collaborators include New Zealand, Australia, Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia, the United States, Israel and Switzerland.&#xD;
