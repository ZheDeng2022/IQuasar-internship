      This study was conducted to demonstrate the equivalence of wound outcomes between the&#xD;
      interrupted oblique intradermal suture (OIS) and conventional interrupted intradermal suture&#xD;
      (IS) methods&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bi-layered skin closure is one of the most common methods for closing cutaneous defects. The&#xD;
      deep layer is closed with a conventional interrupted intradermal suture using absorbable&#xD;
      materials, while the superficial layer is approximated with simple interrupted or simple&#xD;
      continuous suture using non-absorbable materials. The cosmetic result of bi-layered closure&#xD;
      is better than simple interrupted suture alone, because the interrupted intradermal suture&#xD;
      component plays a major role in reducing wound tension, which has the effect of minimizing&#xD;
      suture marks. Although the advantages of bi-layered closure are recognized, bi-layered&#xD;
      closure is often not used in favor of simple interrupted suture due to the fact that&#xD;
      interrupted intradermal suture is time consuming and more suture material is required. Thus,&#xD;
      if an intradermal suturing technique can be identified that takes less time and requires less&#xD;
      material while yielding a similar cosmetic result, patients would have more opportunity to&#xD;
      receive bi-layered closure and obtain a better wound outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several novel intradermal suturing techniques could be alternative to the conventional&#xD;
      interrupted intradermal suture technique, including buried butterfly suture, double butterfly&#xD;
      suture, subcutaneous inverted cross mattress suture, and interrupted oblique intradermal&#xD;
      suture. Among these novel techniques, interrupted oblique intradermal suture (OIS) is&#xD;
      recognized for its relative simplicity. OIS is easy to perform, even for beginners. The&#xD;
      simplicity and effectiveness of OIS increase its potential of becoming one of the standard&#xD;
      suturing techniques in medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OIS is very similar to conventional interrupted intradermal suture (IS), except that the&#xD;
      suture in OIS is canted or angled relative to the vertical plane. To perform OIS, the needle&#xD;
      is passed from deep to superficial dermis and canted 30째-60째 from the normal vertical plane.&#xD;
      The needle is then inserted into the opposite wound edge from superficial to deep dermis in a&#xD;
      mirror-image fashion. The thread is tied with a square knot to finish the suture. The key&#xD;
      characteristic that distinguishes OIS from IS is that OIS involves suturing on an angle to&#xD;
      the vertical plane and IS involves suturing on the vertical plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, OIS is a hybrid method that combines IS and buried horizontal butterfly suture.&#xD;
      OIS combines the ability of IS to reduce tension at the wound edge and the ability of&#xD;
      horizontal butterfly suture to provide good wound edge apposition and eversion. Because OIS&#xD;
      is canted, it can provide tension in both the vertical and horizontal planes. Moreover, 1&#xD;
      stitch of OIS should yield wound closure approximately equal to that of 2 stitches of IS due&#xD;
      to the same horizontal distance between 1 OIS stitch and 2 VIS stitches. Accordingly, it can&#xD;
      be inferred that OIS should result in a 50% reduction in both suturing time and suturing&#xD;
      material used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, OIS has the same obstacle as many other novel suturing techniques that there is very&#xD;
      little literature to support OIS clinically which makes usage and generalization of TIS&#xD;
      remain limited. It was hypothesized that OIS is equivalence to IS in wound outcome while&#xD;
      consumes less time and less suture material. This study aims to demonstrate the equivalence&#xD;
      of wound outcomes between the interrupted oblique intradermal suture (OIS) and conventional&#xD;
      interrupted intradermal suture (IS) methods.&#xD;
