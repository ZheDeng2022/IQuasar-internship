    <measure>Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of tazemetostat during Cycles 0 and 1</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 31 days</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as a toxicity related to study drug and can be categorized as a hematological, a non-hematological, or a medication compliance toxicity. The tolerability of tazemetostat will be determined based on the incidence of DLTs in Cycles 0 and 1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR) based on The Lugano Classification (CT-Based Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination, up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary anti-tumor activity will be defined by &quot;The Lugano Classification (CT-Based Response).&quot; ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a Best Overall Response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
