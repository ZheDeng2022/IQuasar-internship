      The BrainPort vision device is a visual prosthetic designed for those who are blind. It&#xD;
      enables perception of visual information using the tongue and camera system as a paired&#xD;
      substitute for the eye. Visual information is collected from a video camera and translated&#xD;
      into a gentle vibration that is presented to the subject on the tongue. With training users&#xD;
      perceive shape, size, location and motion of objects in their environment. It is a&#xD;
      functional, non-surgical device developed to demonstrate as an aid to the visually impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to evaluate a non-surgical visual prosthetic (BrainPort vision&#xD;
      device) that enables the blind to appreciate their immediate surroundings and determine the&#xD;
      way the brain interprets the information. Our goal is to determine if the device can be used&#xD;
      in a pediatric population by measuring the subjects' improvement over baseline in any of the&#xD;
      following areas: light detection, light localization, movement perception, and standardized&#xD;
      object recognition tasks after use of the BrainPort.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to determine if the functional improvements seen in blind subjects using the&#xD;
      BrainPort can be realized in a pediatric cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to evaluate a non-surgical visual prosthetic (BrainPort vision&#xD;
      device) that enables the blind to appreciate their immediate surroundings and determine the&#xD;
      way the brain interprets the information. Our main goal is to determine if the device can be&#xD;
      used in a pediatric population by measuring the subjects' improvement over baseline in any of&#xD;
      the following areas: light detection, light localization, movement perception, and&#xD;
      standardized object recognition tasks after use of the BrainPort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second aim, the investigators will use a multimodal MR scanning session to study the&#xD;
      neurophysiological basis of sensory substitution in children. Under this aim the&#xD;
      investigators will pursue two main objectives. First, the investigators will correlate the&#xD;
      behavioral data with the imaging data in order to detect regions of the brain where structure&#xD;
      and/or function are associated with successful use of sensory substitution devices. Second,&#xD;
      the investigators will utilize these data along with previously collected adult data to model&#xD;
      the effects of prior visual experience on visual cortex plasticity due to blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BrainPort vision device is a visual prosthetic designed for those who are blind. It&#xD;
      enables perception of visual information using the tongue and camera system as a paired&#xD;
      substitute for the eye. Visual information is collected from a video camera and translated&#xD;
      into gentle electrical stimulation patterns on the surface of the tongue. With training,&#xD;
      users perceive shape, size, location and motion of objects in their environment. It is a&#xD;
      functional, non-surgical device developed to demonstrate as an aid to the visually impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tactile sensory systems have proven capable of carrying information to the brain that is&#xD;
      usually acquired visually. Braille and the long cane have provided such information to blind&#xD;
      persons for decades, and in the 1960's it was clearly demonstrated that tactile inputs could&#xD;
      provide access to written print1 and visual images2. The main limitation to the development&#xD;
      of practical vision substitution has been the inadequacy of brain-machine interfaces.&#xD;
      Thirty-five years ago Paul Bach-y-Rita, MD wrote &quot;That a successful sensory substitution&#xD;
      system is not presently in use may not be due to limited functional capabilities of the&#xD;
      brain; it may be due to the fact that an artificial receptor system has not yet been&#xD;
      constructed to challenge the adaptive capacities of the human brain&quot;3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BrainPort Vision Device Since 1998, Wicab has focused on biomedical engineering research and&#xD;
      development of commercial devices based on its proprietary BrainPort® technology4. The&#xD;
      BrainPort vision device is a visual prosthetic designed for those who are blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous previous studies support using the tongue as a sensory substitution channel2,3,5-8.&#xD;
      Our and others' research has revealed that the brain can correctly interpret information from&#xD;
      a sensory substitution device, even when the information is not presented in the same pathway&#xD;
      as the natural sensory system. For example, the optical image actually received by the eye&#xD;
      travels no farther than the retina, which converts the image into spatio-temporal patterns of&#xD;
      action potentials along the optic nerve fibers. By analyzing these impulse patterns, the&#xD;
      brain recreates the image. These impulses are not unique for vision. In fact, all sensory&#xD;
      systems code information using the same 'language': neuronal action potentials. Using the&#xD;
      vision example as a paradigm, sensory substitution requires only that action potentials be&#xD;
      accurately entrained in the alternate sensory information channel. With training, the brain&#xD;
      may learn to appropriately interpret information from the alternate channel and then to&#xD;
      process that information much as it would data from the intact natural sense. Therefore, this&#xD;
      technology benefits users by stimulating the tongue with usable information about their&#xD;
      environment, which some users have described as resembling vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although BrainPort technology stimulates the tongue through the electrode array, the&#xD;
      stimulation is not at all painful; a BrainPort device emits only 11.85 µJ per pulse&#xD;
      (regulatory limit for cutaneously electrical stimulating devices: 300 mJ). In fact, users&#xD;
      often report the sensation as being like champagne bubbles effervescing on the tongue.&#xD;
      Participants using BrainPort devices, whether for several hours each day over the course of a&#xD;
      few weeks or for 20 minutes a day for up to one year, report no discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little work has been done using imaging to study blind children. Werth and Seelos used fMRI&#xD;
      to measure evoked activity in the visual cortex of children as evidence of visual function&#xD;
      improvement following field training (Neurpsychologica. 2005. 43(14): 2011). However, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, imaging of blind children to assess plasticity of the visual cortex at such a&#xD;
      young age has not been done. In the short term, imaging of these subjects may improve our&#xD;
      ability to screen for patients who would benefit from sensory substitution devices as well as&#xD;
      to evaluate training paradigms. In the long term, understanding plasticity due to visual&#xD;
      deprivation will be important not just for sensory substitution, but for all vision&#xD;
      restoration strategies in order to identify subjects still capable of processing visual&#xD;
      input. As the investigators attempt to model the effects of prior visual experience on&#xD;
      plasticity in the visual cortex following blindness, children represent a unique and&#xD;
      essential portion of the sample to tease apart the relative effects of blindness duration and&#xD;
      early versus late acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BrainPort device has been approved by the FDA since June of 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BrainPort vision device is a visual prosthetic designed for those who are blind. It&#xD;
      enables perception of visual information using the tongue and camera system as a paired&#xD;
      substitute for the eye. Visual information is collected from a video camera and translated&#xD;
      into gentle electrical stimulation patterns on the surface of the tongue. With training users&#xD;
      perceive shape, size, location and motion of objects in their environment. It is a&#xD;
      functional, non-surgical device developed to demonstrate as an aid to the visually impaired.&#xD;
      The BrainPort vision device is the only new technology likely available in the near term to&#xD;
      address safety and mobility issues resulting from blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our results have shown that the use of the BrainPort results in behavioral improvements as&#xD;
      well as activation in visual cortical regions using fMRI and PET scans in adults. A trial&#xD;
      which seeks to determine if functional abilities can also be improved in a pediatric cohort&#xD;
      is justifiable for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuroplasticity is highest in childhood, and the visually deprived brain is likely to be&#xD;
           most receptive to alternative sensory stimulation in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The BrainPort is non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other than gene therapy for Leber's Congenital Amaurosis, there are no alternatives to&#xD;
           restoring vision for the blind children at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The BrainPort already has CE Mark approval and pending FDA approval (final safety study&#xD;
           documents submitted to the FDA August 2013), and should be available for purchase by&#xD;
           2014, at least in Europe and Canada. Whether the device could be useful in a pediatric&#xD;
           population is an important clinical question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk presented by the study is at least&#xD;
           as favorable to the subjects as that provided by available alternative approaches (blind&#xD;
           training).&#xD;
