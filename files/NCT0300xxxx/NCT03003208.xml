  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common smoking-related lung disease.&#xD;
      Patients with COPD are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as heart&#xD;
      attacks and strokes. A simple measurement called arterial stiffness is a good assessment of&#xD;
      how likely people are to have cardiovascular disease, both in healthy populations and those&#xD;
      with COPD. Aortic Pulse wave velocity (aPWV) measures arterial stiffness,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) - a 6 week supervised group exercise and education class - is&#xD;
      an effective intervention in COPD to reduce symptoms, improve exercise performance and&#xD;
      prevent exacerbations. However, the effect of PR on cardiovascular risk in COPD is&#xD;
      controversial as two small positive studies suggested benefit and one larger study did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have recently shown that cardiovascular risk is higher in those COPD patients&#xD;
      who get the most infections (exacerbations). PR is an effective intervention for preventing&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations. Logically, the exercise component would be expected to reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to identify which patients with COPD get cardiovascular benefit from a PR&#xD;
      programme and why others do not. Investigators propose to measure aPWV before and after PR.&#xD;
      Investigators will then classify participants as responders or non-responders defined as the&#xD;
      presence or absence of a significant improvement in aPWV. Investigators will be collecting&#xD;
      demographic and clinical information including daily physical activity level and how&#xD;
      effective the PR has been to enable the investigators to identify the characteristics of&#xD;
      patients who do, and do not achieve cardiovascular risk reduction in response to PR in COPD.&#xD;
      This will inform on better design of PR programmes for people living with COPD.&#xD;
