      This study evaluates the use of the Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in adults with vascular&#xD;
      trauma below the neck who are undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery. There will be a&#xD;
      torso cohort and a limb cohort. All subjects will be implanted with a HAV as an interposition&#xD;
      vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical techniques. There is no control arm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi cohort, non-randomized phase 2 study in up to 40&#xD;
      adult patients with life or limb threatening vascular trauma which requires surgical repair.&#xD;
      There will be a limb cohort and a torso cohort. The limb cohort will include patients who&#xD;
      require repair of a vessel contained to the upper or lower extremity. The torso cohort&#xD;
      includes patients who require repair of vessels within the thorax (excluding the heart),&#xD;
      abdomen, and retroperitoneum. Subjects will be implanted with a Humacyte Human Acellular&#xD;
      Vessel (HAV) as an interposition vessel or bypass using standard vascular surgical&#xD;
      techniques. There is no control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active study duration for each study participant will be 36 months from HAV implantation&#xD;
      or until HAV failure/ removal/ death if earlier. Follow up after month 12 will involve the&#xD;
      capture of information on assessments performed at &quot;standard of care&quot; routine clinic visits&#xD;
      or by telephone follow up with the patient or his/her physician with physical exam and&#xD;
      ultrasound at month 24 and month 36&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total expected duration of the clinical study is 61 months (24 months of enrollment and&#xD;
      36 months of follow up).&#xD;

    <description>The investigational medicinal product (IMP) is a Humacyte Human Acellular Vessel (HAV), which is a tissue-engineered vascular prosthesis for arterial bypass or reconstruction in patients with peripheral arterial disease or peripheral arterial trauma. It is a sterile, non-pyrogenic acellular tubular vessel composed of human collagen types I and III and other extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and vitronectin. The vessel is 6 mm in diameter and approximately 42 cm in length. The product is supplied on a silicone mandrel immersed in sterile phosphate buffered saline in a sealed and labeled plastic container. The Humacyte HAV is implanted using standard vascular surgical techniques similar to placement of predicate peripheral vascular prostheses.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with life or limb threatening traumatic injury to an arterial vessel in the&#xD;
             limb or torso, other than the heart, which requires replacement or reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Preoperative imaging or clinical examination indicates the damaged vessel has a defect&#xD;
             length of â‰¤ 38cm and is appropriately size matched to the 6mm Human Acellular Vessel&#xD;
             (HAV) per the judgment of the treating surgeon taking into account vasoconstriction&#xD;
             and situational inflow and outflow considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Autologous vein graft is either not feasible in the judgment of the treating surgeon&#xD;
             (e.g. because of lack of availability of suitable conduit, presence of severe venous&#xD;
             insufficiency) or is not desirable because of the urgency of revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Aged 18 to 85 years old, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, and able to comply with&#xD;
             entire study procedures. If the patient is unconscious, then information from a&#xD;
             reliable witness indicates that the patient would normally be able to comply with&#xD;
             study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient or relative is able, willing and competent to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of at least 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) of â‰¥ 7&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Limb at high risk of amputation despite vascular reconstruction (e.g., because of&#xD;
             crush injury)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Catastrophic injuries that make survival unlikely (e.g. Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)&#xD;
             &gt; 5 or Injury Severity Score (ISS) &gt;60)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. HAV may not be used for coronary artery repair&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known medical condition which would preclude long term antiplatelet therapy after&#xD;
             resolution of acute injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude adequate&#xD;
             evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the HAV&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Previous exposure to HAV&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known participation in any investigational study within the last 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Employees of the sponsor or patients who are employees or relatives of the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
