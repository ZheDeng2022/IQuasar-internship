    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Successful Overall Colon Preparation, Assessed With the Cleansing Score (4-point Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Blinded overall assessment of preparation efficacy (Cleansing Score) was determined by the colonoscopist upon completion of the examination, based on a 4-point scale as follows:&#xD;
4 (Excellent) = No more than small bits of adherent faeces/fluid&#xD;
3 (Good) = Small amounts of faeces or fluid not interfering with examination&#xD;
2 (Fair) = Enough faeces or fluid to prevent a completely reliable examination&#xD;
1 (Poor) = Large amounts of faecal residue, additional cleansing required.&#xD;
Only perfect preparations graded as excellent (4) or good (3), which allowed full, reliable examination of the mucosa were considered as successful. The adjusted percentage of subjects with a successful preparation was determined using a logistic regression model, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Colon Cleansing Score (4-point Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The Cleansing Score was determined by the blinded colonoscopist, based on a 4-point scale as follows:&#xD;
4 (Excellent) = No more than small bits of adherent faeces/fluid&#xD;
3 (Good) = Small amounts of faeces or fluid not interfering with examination&#xD;
2 (Fair) = Enough faeces or fluid to prevent a completely reliable examination&#xD;
1 (Poor) = Large amounts of faecal residue, additional cleansing required.&#xD;
The adjusted mean score was estimated using a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), including treatment and country as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) Global Score and BBPS Scores by Colon Segment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The BBPS score for each colon segment (left, transverse, right) was determined by the blinded colonoscopist as follows:&#xD;
0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared&#xD;
1 = Portion of mucosa of the segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid&#xD;
2 = Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of segment seen well&#xD;
3 = Entire mucosa of segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid.&#xD;
Each segment score ranged from 0-3. Global score was sum of the 3 segment scores and ranged from 0-9 (worst to best). Successful colon cleansing was defined as a global BBPS score ≥6. The adjusted mean score was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Need for Rescue Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (colonoscopy visit, before colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects who needed rescue treatment (saline enema) prior to colonoscopy because of inadequate preparation intake was assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Need for Nasogastric Tube To Complete Preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1 (treatment visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects who needed placement of a nasogastric tube to achieve administration of the complete preparation was assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Colonoscopy Procedure Documented as Completed</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects with a complete colonoscopy, defined as a procedure that reached the caecum, was assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Caecal Intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>From colonoscope introduction to caecal intubation, assessed on Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to caecal intubation was defined as the time from colonoscope introduction to caecal intubation, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. In the event the procedure did not reach the caecum, the subject was censored at time of withdrawal of colonoscope.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Duration of Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>From caecum intubation to withdrawal of the colonoscope, assessed on Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of examination for colonoscopy (in minutes) was measured by the difference between the time of caecum intubation and the time of withdrawal of the colonoscope. The adjusted mean duration of examination was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates. Subjects for whom the caecum was not reached were excluded from the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Score for Overall Treatment Acceptability, Assessed Using Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1 (treatment visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire was completed by the caregiver or subject after the subject ended the intake of preparation. Subject acceptability was rated as follows:&#xD;
1 = Very badly accepted/unacceptable&#xD;
2 = Badly but accepted&#xD;
3 = Neither good nor bad&#xD;
4 = Well accepted&#xD;
5 = Very well accepted.&#xD;
Overall acceptability score is the average of scores from the 2 doses ranging from 1 - 5 (worst to best). The adjusted mean score was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Overall Treatment Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1 (treatment visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment compliance according the instructions of use provided in the prescription was assessed as the percentage of volume of fluid taken relative to the planned volume of fluid to be taken (measured by the caregiver and reported in the treatment questionnaire of subject's leaflet during treatment administration). Overall treatment compliance was derived from the total volumes of fluid (i.e. preparation + hydration for Eziclen®/Izinova® and preparation only for Klean-Prep®) and was assessed for dose 1, dose 2 and globally (accounting for both doses). The adjusted mean overall treatment compliance (%) was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Subject Tolerability Total Score, Assessed Using a Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1 (treatment visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was assessed using a Symptom Scale after each dose of treatment for stomach cramping, stomach bloating and nausea on a paediatric 5-point scale as follows:&#xD;
1 = No symptom&#xD;
2 = Mild&#xD;
3 = Bothersome&#xD;
4 = Distressing&#xD;
5 = Severely distressing symptoms.&#xD;
The total tolerability score is the sum of the scores for the 3 symptoms ranging from 3 to 15 (best to worst). Mean total tolerability scores after dose 1 and dose 2 are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Clear Effluent</measure>
    <time_frame>From first intake of prescription to first clear watery stool, assessed on Day 1 (treatment visit) and Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to clear effluent, as reported by the subject, was defined as the time between first intake of prescription and first clear watery stool, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. In the event of no clear watery stools, subjects with colonoscopy were censored at the time of colonoscope introduction, and subjects without colonoscopy were censored at time of start of treatment + 12 hours. Although time to clear effluent was pre-specified as a secondary endpoint in the study protocol, in a change to the planned analysis, it was subsequently analysed and reported as an 'other' efficacy endpoint.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Time Between Last Intake of Fluids and Start of Colonoscopy Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>From end of treatment administration to start of colonoscopy, assessed on Day 1 (treatment visit) and Day 2 (colonoscopy visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The time between the end of treatment administration (on Day 1) and the start of colonoscopy (on Day 2) was determined. The adjusted mean time between the last intake of fluids and the start of colonoscopy procedure was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted in adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years inclusive) who were undergoing a colonoscopy for a routinely accepted diagnostic indication. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to Eziclen®/Izinova® (¾ of adult dose; 750 millilitres [mL] of preparation plus 1500 mL of water) or Klean-Prep® (70 mL/kilogram [kg]; maximum of 4000 mL). Subjects were randomised at 22 study centres in 6 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a 1-day enrolment (Day 1, baseline) and investigator-blind label dosing period, a colonoscopy (Day 2) and a 30-day follow-up period (Day 32 [-5/+15, i.e. Day 27 to Day 47]). Subjects were expected to participate in the study for a minimum of 27 days and up to 47 days.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Subjects received Eziclen®/Izinova® oral sulphate salt solution, administered as ¾ of the adult dose, as a 1-day regimen on the evening of the day before colonoscopy (Day 1). The 750 mL preparation was administered in 2 half doses as follows: the first half of preparation (375 mL) was drunk slowly in 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by 750 mL of water over the next hour. Approximately 2 hours after starting the first half of preparation, the second half (375 mL) was drunk slowly in 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by 750 mL of water over the next hour. Overall total volume (preparation + water) was 2250 mL (1125 mL per dose).</description>

The whole solution was administered in 2 half doses (1 litre per hour), with a 1-hour pause between the 2 half doses. Approximately 2 hours after starting the first half of preparation, the second half was drunk. The maximum global volume administered was 4000 mL (2000 mL per dose).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Successful Overall Colon Preparation, Assessed With the Cleansing Score (4-point Scale)</title>
        <description>Blinded overall assessment of preparation efficacy (Cleansing Score) was determined by the colonoscopist upon completion of the examination, based on a 4-point scale as follows:&#xD;
4 (Excellent) = No more than small bits of adherent faeces/fluid&#xD;
3 (Good) = Small amounts of faeces or fluid not interfering with examination&#xD;
2 (Fair) = Enough faeces or fluid to prevent a completely reliable examination&#xD;
1 (Poor) = Large amounts of faecal residue, additional cleansing required.&#xD;
Only perfect preparations graded as excellent (4) or good (3), which allowed full, reliable examination of the mucosa were considered as successful. The adjusted percentage of subjects with a successful preparation was determined using a logistic regression model, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>

        <title>Mean Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) Global Score and BBPS Scores by Colon Segment</title>
        <description>The BBPS score for each colon segment (left, transverse, right) was determined by the blinded colonoscopist as follows:&#xD;
0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared&#xD;
1 = Portion of mucosa of the segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid&#xD;
2 = Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of segment seen well&#xD;
3 = Entire mucosa of segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid.&#xD;
Each segment score ranged from 0-3. Global score was sum of the 3 segment scores and ranged from 0-9 (worst to best). Successful colon cleansing was defined as a global BBPS score ≥6. The adjusted mean score was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>

          <title>Mean Overall Treatment Compliance</title>
          <description>Treatment compliance according the instructions of use provided in the prescription was assessed as the percentage of volume of fluid taken relative to the planned volume of fluid to be taken (measured by the caregiver and reported in the treatment questionnaire of subject's leaflet during treatment administration). Overall treatment compliance was derived from the total volumes of fluid (i.e. preparation + hydration for Eziclen®/Izinova® and preparation only for Klean-Prep®) and was assessed for dose 1, dose 2 and globally (accounting for both doses). The adjusted mean overall treatment compliance (%) was estimated using a 2-way ANOVA, including treatment and country as covariates.</description>

      <desc>The safety population included all randomised subjects who received even a partial dose of study drug. Subjects were assessed according to the treatment received (1 subject randomised to the Eziclen®/Izinova® group was mistakenly administered Klean-Prep®; this subject was therefore included in the Klean-Prep® safety population).</desc>

          <description>Subjects received Eziclen®/Izinova® oral sulphate salt solution, administered as ¾ of the adult dose, as a 1-day regimen on the evening of the day before colonoscopy (Day 1). The 750 mL preparation was administered in 2 half doses as follows: the first half of preparation (375 mL) was drunk slowly in 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by 750 mL of water over the next hour. Approximately 2 hours after starting the first half of preparation, the second half (375 mL) was drunk slowly in 30 minutes to 1 hour, followed by 750 mL of water over the next hour. Overall total volume (preparation + water) was 2250 mL (1125 mL per dose).</description>

The whole solution was administered in 2 half doses (1 litre per hour), with a 1-hour pause between the 2 half doses. Approximately 2 hours after starting the first half of preparation, the second half was drunk. The maximum global volume administered was 4000 mL (2000 mL per dose).</description>
