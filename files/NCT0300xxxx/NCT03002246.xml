      This trial is a collaborative study between 4 sites worldwide. A total of 600 research&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled. We will investigate the validity of using 5D Limb Volume software&#xD;
      to improve on estimated fetal weight predictions over a broad range of gestational ages. The&#xD;
      purpose is to compare the accuracy and precision of birth weight predictions based on this&#xD;
      new technology as compared to the current 2D birth weight prediction models.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ultrasound has been used for over 20 years to estimate fetal weight prior to birth. Sometimes&#xD;
      this estimation is not always similar to what the baby actually weighs. In addition to the&#xD;
      regular measurements taken at routine ultrasound exams, 3D ultrasound of the baby's arm and&#xD;
      leg soft tissue may give us more precise information on how much the baby weighs. This&#xD;
      measurement is called fractional limb volume. Fractional limb volume (FLV) is a soft tissue&#xD;
      measurement of the arm or thigh that can be used to evaluate body composition. This&#xD;
      measurement mostly reflects the fat and muscle development with a small amount of bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent introduction of 5D Limb Volume software (Samsung, Seoul, Korea) now makes it&#xD;
      possible to efficiently and reproducibly measure semi-automated FLV using a computer guided&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive one ultrasound scan 4-7 days before their delivery. Both 2D and 3D&#xD;
      measurements will be taken. These measurements will then be used to estimate fetal weight. We&#xD;
      will compare estimated weight to actual birth weight in order to determine the accuracy and&#xD;
      precision of the 5D Limb Volume technology. This data may also be used to develop new weight&#xD;
      estimation models that could provide better accuracy and/or precision than what is currently&#xD;
      provided using published methods.&#xD;
