      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a single intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of unrelated donor umbilical cord blood (UCB) for improving functional outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with ischemic stroke. Eligible subjects will receive an intravenous infusion of UCB&#xD;
      or placebo 3-10 days following stroke. Subjects will not receive immunosuppressive or&#xD;
      myeloablative medications prior to the infusion. Subjects will be followed for one year post&#xD;
      infusion for safety and efficacy. Assessments will examine safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      infusion, change in neurological symptoms, change in quality of life, and emotional and&#xD;
      cognitive status. Assessments will occur at 24 hours post infusion, and at 30, 90, 180 and&#xD;
      365 days post infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, placebo controlled, randomized, double blinded Phase 2 study in 100&#xD;
      subjects 18-90 years of age who have sustained a recent ischemic stroke. Potential subjects&#xD;
      can be screened and consented the day of their stroke (Day 1). Treatment with umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood (UCB) cells or placebo will be administered intravenously as a single infusion as early&#xD;
      as 3 days but no later than 10 days after the patient's stroke. UCB units will be selected&#xD;
      from an accredited U.S. public cord bank based on blood type, race and a targeted cell dose&#xD;
      ranging between 0.5 to 5 x 10^7 total nucleated cell count (TNCC)/kg. Study subjects will not&#xD;
      receive immunosuppressive or myeloablative medications prior to infusion of the cord blood or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects, families and medical staff will be blinded to treatment arm. When a subject is&#xD;
      randomized to study drug at a clinical site without a cord blood bank, the selected cord&#xD;
      blood units (CBU) will be shipped frozen overnight to the site. Once selected and available&#xD;
      on site, each CBU will be thawed, washed, tested, released and infused intravenously using&#xD;
      common standard operating procedures (SOPs) at all sites. For subjects randomized to placebo,&#xD;
      a diluent with the same appearance and odor as a CBU will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and will be assessed at 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months for functional outcomes. All patients will receive standard of care therapy&#xD;
      while enrolled in this study and all subjects will be strongly encouraged to participate in&#xD;
      rehabilitative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine, in a randomized, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial, the efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of unrelated donor UCB for&#xD;
      improving functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the safety and tolerability of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor UCB&#xD;
           in patients with ischemic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor UCB for improvement&#xD;
           of neurological symptoms following ischemic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the efficacy of a single IV infusion of unrelated donor UCB for improvement&#xD;
           in quality of life and emotional and cognitive status in patients with ischemic stroke&#xD;
