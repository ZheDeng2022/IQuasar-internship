    <textblock>
      Sodium (Na+) hemostasis is abnormal in CKD patients, and this element can be deposited in the&#xD;
      skin, muscle, and skeleton - to cope with long term sodium loading. It is known that sodium&#xD;
      stored in this non-osmotically active way, is profoundly inflammatory. Furthermore,&#xD;
      inflammation has been associated with several uremic symptoms. The investigators will use&#xD;
      novel Na+ MRI imaging to examine the Na+ deposition in the skin, muscle, and skeleton of five&#xD;
      groups:1) chronic in-center hemodialysis patients, 2) chronic peritoneal dialysis patients,&#xD;
      3) adult and paediatric patients with CKD stage 1-5 and 4) heart failure patients with and&#xD;
      without renal dysfunction 5) sex and age-matched healthy adult and paediatric controls.&#xD;
      Additionally, they will investigate the association between sodium deposition in these&#xD;
      tissues with uremic symptomatology and biochemical markers of metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidneys have a key role in sodium hemostasis through their excretory function. In patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney function is impaired; thus, suggesting that sodium&#xD;
      handling is abnormal in this setting with long-term sodium loading (from oral intake) and&#xD;
      lack of adequate urinary excretion. Yet, sodium concentration needs to stay relatively&#xD;
      constant to prevent fatal intra-cellular accumulation, which would result in cell injury and&#xD;
      death. In hemodialysis patients, at least a part of this extra sodium is non-osmotically&#xD;
      active and deposited in the skin, muscle, and skeleton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it has become increasingly recognized that sodium (once accumulated in tissues)&#xD;
      is directly pro-inflammatory, affecting the innate immune system by regulating the activity&#xD;
      of macrophages in skin. This linkage between sodium and inflammation indicates a potential&#xD;
      link between sodium deposition and uremic symptoms experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no studies to date examining the sodium deposition in the skin, muscle, and&#xD;
      skeleton of patients with different kidney function and renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study involving a single center recruiting patients from the prevalent&#xD;
      maintenance hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis , CKD stage 1-5, and heart failure populations&#xD;
      of London, Ontario, compared to healthy controls. Once recruited, participants will undergo&#xD;
      one study visit with the potential of up to two follow-up visits (on a non-dialysis day for&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients). Participants will be followed for up to two years after the first&#xD;
      study visit. Each session will include symptom questionnaires, the five times sit to stand&#xD;
      and 60-second chair stand test (excluding all children), blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      measurements, blood work (excluding healthy children and adolescents), urine sampling&#xD;
      (excluding those on dialysis), an echocardiogram (excluding healthy controls), and an MRI&#xD;
      scan of the lower leg detecting sodium content.&#xD;
