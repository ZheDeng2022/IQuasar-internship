      Background or rationale for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 million Patient's seek medical care for shoulder pain annually in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      250,000 patients receive rotator cuff surgery in the United States annually. Those rotator&#xD;
      cuff surgeries produce a societal savings of $3.44 billion per year; averaging $13,771.00 per&#xD;
      patient younger than age 61. In which case rotator cuff tears Increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Societal and Economic Value of Rotator Cuff Repair (AAOS) 2015 Rotator cuff repairs&#xD;
      result in a lifetime societal savings in the U.S. of approximately $3.44 billion annually.&#xD;
      Societal savings offset the direct costs of treatment in patients younger than age 61,&#xD;
      resulting in an average net savings of $13,771 per patient. This number significantly&#xD;
      increased to $77,662.00 for patients younger than 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common problem, a 55 year-old man injured his left arm. He uses a sling and has difficulties&#xD;
      performing simple activities. 1 week later he falls develops immediate pain in his shoulder.&#xD;
      On examination he is unable to move his left arm in any upward or sideways direction without&#xD;
      supporting it with his other arm. Radiographs he brought show no signs of shoulder&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, dislocation, or fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder pain is the third most common musculoskeletal reason for seeking medical care.&#xD;
      Although smaller tears are less likely to propagate, larger tears tend to progress with time&#xD;
      and eventually may become irreparable because of significant tendon retraction, muscle&#xD;
      atrophy, or both or when the tendons tissue quality does not allow repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1972-Neer proposed that 95% of rotator cuff injuries were caused by mechanical compression&#xD;
      under the coracoacromial arch, others argued cuff tear caused spur formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type I-flat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type II-curved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type III-hooked&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multifactorial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extrinsic factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subacromial impingement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glenohumeral instability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internal impingement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trauma (acute/repetitive) Intrinsic Factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tendon vascular supply&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collagen fiber abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive painful arc test result and positive external rotation resistance test result were&#xD;
      the most accurate finding for detecting Rotator Cuff Disease; whereas the presence of a&#xD;
      positive lag tests (external or internal rotation) result was most accurate for diagnosis of&#xD;
      a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Differentiating a full thickness tear from a partial&#xD;
      tear, the most sensitive test was the belly-press test (56.8%), and the most specific was the&#xD;
      lift-off test (96.95).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone microvascularization of the footprint plays a role in rotator Cuff healing. The use of&#xD;
      the Pinpoint may play a pivotal role in rotator Cuff healing, en lieu of Plasma Rich&#xD;
      platelets with variable results based on concentration levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 level randomized controlled trials showed no clinically significant differences in Constant&#xD;
      scores, University of California, Los Angles shoulder rating (UCLA), and American Shoulder&#xD;
      and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores between double-row and single-row rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
      Overall odds ratio (OR) of intact rotator cuff tendon healing was 1.93 in patients treated&#xD;
      with double-row versus single-row repair, and the difference was significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistically significant benefit of double-row repair in the ASES and UCLA scores was&#xD;
      observed in the subgroup with tears greater than 3cm. The take home point; Double row may&#xD;
      improve structural healing: Clinical Relevance?&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 studies in the meta-analysis, 5 of which were randomized prospective studies (LEVEL1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-row rotator cuff repair techniques have a significantly lower re-tear rate, higher&#xD;
      ASES score and greater range of motion of internal rotation compared with single-row repair&#xD;
      techniques. Point: Especially in those rotator cuff tears with a size &gt;30mm, the double-row&#xD;
      technique is recommended for repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a Level 4 study out of the Cleveland Clinic which showed the majority of the tears&#xD;
      occurred between 6 and 24 weeks. The role of a potential hand held device can assess the&#xD;
      tendon quality in the office and change the rehab protocols based on tendon retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role for study interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the bony vascularity at the footprint and the tendon integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroid injection as a non-operatively treatment option. Could the steroid injections be&#xD;
      affecting the tendon micro vascularization? Could using the Pinpoint assess tendon quality&#xD;
      and long term healing a potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystic osseous resorption and osteolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breakdown products (PLLA) cause synovitis and chondrolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breakdown products (PLLA) may interfere with healing-Complications of Bioabsorbable&#xD;
           Suture anchors in the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why Medical Row Knots?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhances Biology be sealing footprint from synovial fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compared to knotless medical row, better biomechanics incl. load to failure, stiffness,&#xD;
           less gap formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A biomechanical comparison of 2 technical of double-row rotator cuff fixation: the&#xD;
           importance of medical row knots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Implications and Surgeon's Role;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choice of a tissue-penetrating instrument; smaller penetrating devices resulting in&#xD;
           improves characteristics of stitch holding strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size of the tissue bite; bigger bite size being stronger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most critical variable under a surgeons control during a rotator cuff repair is the&#xD;
           choice of the stitch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role for Pinpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the re-tear and partial-repair groups, postoperative tendon preservation at the middle&#xD;
      fact significantly affected the Japanese Orthopaedic Assocation (JOA) and UCLA scores&#xD;
      (P=.014, respectively). Considering the patients with tendon healing had better clinical&#xD;
      factors, the Pinpoint may help identify the tendon and footprint vascularity at time of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals for the Pinpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To attempt to show that increased vascularity may have an effect of the muscle quality,&#xD;
      therefore improving the strength and function long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This prospective study aims to obtain the accurate level within a range of a 95% CI&#xD;
           imaging Rotator Cuff tendons and the footprint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure the Vascularity of the tendon after the footprint and the tendon have been&#xD;
           restored to the anatomic footprint. See if the level of the Rotator Cuff bite affects&#xD;
           the vascular flow of the tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does tying the medical row or excessive tension change the vascularity of the Rotator&#xD;
           Cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We would like to see if by using the Pinpoint system it may be more cost effective then&#xD;
           Plasma Rich Platelet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease the number of the re-tear rates in Rotator cuff repairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall goals: Improve long term patient function and outcomes. Increase Rotator Cuff healing&#xD;
      rates. Cost effective and time efficient method of Rotator Cuff evaluation during&#xD;
      arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures involved (Research Interventions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing a Rotator Cuff Repair:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operatively Questioners to be completed at pre-op American Shoulder and Elbow&#xD;
           Surgeons (ASES), University California Los Angeles (UCLA), Disabilities of the arm,&#xD;
           shoulder and hand (DASH), Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12) &amp; Short Form Health&#xD;
           Survey-36 (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative Collect OR information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative ASES, UCLA, DASH SF-12 &amp; SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultra sounds 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative intervention will proceed as current standard protocol dictates for the&#xD;
      described procedure. No changes in the operative technique will be undertaken apart from&#xD;
      injection of the dye and visualization with the camera. The idea would be to place the&#xD;
      Pinpoint probe within the subacrominal space, to check the vascular status of the tendon, and&#xD;
      then take a bite of the tendon and place the pinpoint back to check if the vascularity has&#xD;
      decreased. The Indocyanin Green dye kit will be used along with the PINPOINT system .&#xD;
      Patients with potential allergies or a history of allergies or sensitivity to sodium iodide&#xD;
      or iodinated contrast agents should not use this system, and will not be asked to&#xD;
      participate. The possible adverse reactions are, anaphylaxis, Hypotension, tachycardia,&#xD;
      dyspnea and urticarial. The duration of the procedure will be increased because of the study&#xD;
      imaging; this could be 15 to 30 minutes.&#xD;
