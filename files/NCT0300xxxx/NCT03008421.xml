      In the present study, the investigators aim to evaluate the potential of oral probiotics,&#xD;
      containing Lactobacillus strains, to eradicate and reduce the vaginal colonization with group&#xD;
      B Streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy. This could help to prevent neonatal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality by reducing the risk for neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, known as&#xD;
      early-onset or late-onset GBS infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae is a gram-positive bacterium that&#xD;
      is present in 10-30% of the healthy female population (1). Throughout pregnancy and the&#xD;
      intrapartum period, maternal colonization with GBS can lead to the vertical transmission of&#xD;
      the bacterium to the infant. This can result in neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis,&#xD;
      known as early-onset GBS infection, as well as in maternal urinary tract infections,&#xD;
      arthritis, and pneumonia (2). Various strategies were tested to prevent the GBS infection.&#xD;
      The antenatal GBS screening was successfully proven to identify colonized women, who should&#xD;
      receive the intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. This strategy led to a substantial&#xD;
      reduction of the incidence of neonatal sepsis of almost 80% (3). As a result, the general use&#xD;
      of a GBS screening was then integrated in the US-American recommendations, since the&#xD;
      screening was superior to the risk-related procedure, when comparing the rates of early-onset&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis (4). Later on, the GBS screening also became part of the recommendations of a&#xD;
      European Consensus Conference (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urogenital microflora of a healthy woman comprises approximately 50 species of organisms,&#xD;
      which differ in composition according to the exposure to several factors. The flora of&#xD;
      pregnant women is dominated by a variety of Lactobacillus species, which play an essential&#xD;
      role in protecting them from genital infections (5). A deficiency in lactobacilli can upset&#xD;
      the microbial balance in the vagina, which may result in an increased susceptibility for the&#xD;
      colonization with pathogens such as GBS (6). As demonstrated by Gardnerella vaginalis,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus strains can disrupt the biofilm of these pathogens in the in-vitro setting,&#xD;
      which inhibits their growth (7). This led to the use of probiotics to populate the vagina&#xD;
      with, in order to prevent or treat infections. The supplementation of probiotics that contain&#xD;
      Lactobacillus strains has later been proven to improve cure rates and prevent recurrent&#xD;
      infections (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our Department, pregnancy care includes a prenatal consultation, where women register for&#xD;
      a planned delivery between 10 + 0 (10 weeks plus 0 days) and 16 + 0 (16 weeks plus 0 days)&#xD;
      gestational weeks. During this consultation, they undergo routine screening for asymptomatic&#xD;
      vaginal infections by the Gram-stained analysis of their vaginal flora (9). In case of a&#xD;
      vaginal infection, they undergo follow-up smears after 4-6 weeks. Routine pregnancy care is&#xD;
      performed at outpatient gynecologists' offices, following the Austrian government's welfare&#xD;
      program, documented in the official mother-child booklet. This national pregnancy care&#xD;
      program is used for the health precautions of women and their fetuses including obligatory&#xD;
      examinations at predetermined points (10). European guidelines recommend the antenatal&#xD;
      screening for the vaginal colonization with group B Streptococcus (GBS) between 35 + 0 and 37&#xD;
      + 0 gestational weeks, which is performed on demand by the outpatient gynecologists, but not&#xD;
      routinely covered by social health insurance in Austria (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the routine registration for delivery at our Department, women will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in our study. Assessment for eligibility will be performed in women with a (i)&#xD;
      singleton pregnancy, (ii) without imminent miscarriage, (iii) without having recently&#xD;
      undergone antibiotic or probiotic treatment. After informed consent, study participants will&#xD;
      be asked to present between 34 + 0 and 36 + 0 gestational weeks for their first study visit.&#xD;
      At this visit, a CDC-recommended combined vaginal-to-rectal swab will be taken from the&#xD;
      introitus vaginae and anorectum. The combined incubation is known to increase the detection&#xD;
      rate of GBS by up to 30% (11). Sterile swabs will be obtained after vaginal fluid collection&#xD;
      from the lateral vaginal wall and posterior fornix vaginae, followed by the insertion into&#xD;
      the anal sphincter. For the culture based method, they will be applied to a transport medium&#xD;
      and subsequently inoculated in the microbiological laboratory. After inoculation, a selective&#xD;
      enrichment broth will be used (TransVag Broth), followed by the incubation for 18 to 24&#xD;
      hours. That will be followed by a subculture using selective media for another 18 to 24&#xD;
      hours. If colonies are present, they will undergo extraction to determine if Group A or B&#xD;
      streptococcus is present (12, 13). The threshold for GBS positive results will be considered&#xD;
      as greater than 102 colony-forming units (CFU) per swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a negative GBS screening result, women will be excluded from the study. In case of&#xD;
      a positive GBS screening result, women will be randomized to the verum or the placebo group.&#xD;
      The study will follow a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded mono-centric&#xD;
      design. Randomization will be performed using Randomizer® (Institute for Medical Informatics,&#xD;
      Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz), which is a web-based patient&#xD;
      randomization service for clinical trials. Women who are assigned to the verum group will&#xD;
      receive a patented dietary supplement of four viable lactobacilli strains (HSO Health Care&#xD;
      GmbH, Vienna, Austria), containing Lactobacillus crispatus Lbv88, Lactobacillus rhamnosus&#xD;
      Lbv96, Lactobacillus jensenii Lbv116, and Lactobacillus gasseri Lbv150. This supplementation&#xD;
      was proven to transmigrate from the intestinal lumen into the vaginal area, acting in the&#xD;
      microbial ecosystem through a barrier effect against pathogenic microorganisms, so that&#xD;
      symptoms related to dysbiosis and recurrent infections can be relieved or even prevented&#xD;
      (14-16). Supplementation will include twice daily (morning/evening) oral intake for 14 days.&#xD;
      Women in the placebo group will receive an identical-looking oral potato-maltodextrin-based&#xD;
      placebo, which will also be given twice daily (morning/evening) for 14 days. Patients,&#xD;
      investigators, and microbiological staff will be blinded to the treatment assignment. The&#xD;
      composition of the study medication is as follows: L.crispatus Lbv88 (DSM 22566) 1 x 10^9&#xD;
      Guaranteed viable cell count (CFU/dose), L. rhamnosus Lbv96 (DSM 22560) 1 x 10^9 CFU/dose, L.&#xD;
      jensenii Lbv116 (DSM 22567) 0.2 x 10^9 CFU/dose, L. gasseri Lbv150N (DSM 22583) 0.3 x 10^9&#xD;
      CFU/dose, Potato maltodextrin, Insoluble dietary fibre, and Silicium dioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each participant, a consecutive vaginal swab will be taken during the second study visit&#xD;
      between 36 + 0 and 38 + 0 gestational weeks (i.e., 2 weeks after the first study visit).&#xD;
      Sterile swabs will be obtained and inoculated as previously described. In case of a positive&#xD;
      GBS screening result, (i) patients will be subsequently informed, and the result will be&#xD;
      documented in (ii) the mother-child booklet and (iii) the PIA Fetal Database, version&#xD;
      5.6.16.917 (General Electric Company, GE Viewpoint, Munich, Germany). This procedure is&#xD;
      necessary to ensure intrapartum penicillin treatment, which will follow current guidelines&#xD;
      and routine practice (2). During both study visits, a vaginal swab will also be taken to&#xD;
      perform Gram-stained analysis of the vaginal flora, in order to exclude women with acute&#xD;
      infections (i.e., bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, candidiasis) at study visit 1, and to&#xD;
      gain further information on their flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of our study will be the recovery to the GBS negative state. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include (i) the rate of early-onset neonatal sepsis (postnatal age less than 7&#xD;
      days), (ii) the rate of late-onset neonatal sepsis (postnatal age at more than 7 days), (iii)&#xD;
      the gestational age at delivery, recorded as term delivery at or after 37 + 0 gestational&#xD;
      weeks, (iv) the rate of preterm delivery, defined as delivery at or before 36 + 6 gestational&#xD;
      weeks, (v) neonatal birthweight, defined as a the weight at the time of delivery, (vi) the&#xD;
      rate of live birth, defined as the term or preterm delivery of an infant that had an Apgar&#xD;
      score at 1 minute of &gt; 0, and (vii) the mode of delivery (i.e., spontaneous vaginal birth,&#xD;
      cesarean section, or instrumental vaginal delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per day, approximately 10 patients undergo routine registration for delivery at our&#xD;
      department. All of them will be assessed for eligibility for the study. Approximately 60% of&#xD;
      these patients will present with a normal vaginal flora without infection, which would lead&#xD;
      to the number of 6/10 potentially eligible patients per day. A systematic review on the&#xD;
      prevalence of maternal GBS colonization in Europe reported rates ranging from 6.5% to 36%.&#xD;
      The carriage rates varied with Eastern Europe 19.7% to 29.3%, Western Europe 11% to 21%,&#xD;
      Scandinavia 24.3% to 36%, and Southern Europe 6.5% to 32% (17). The investigators therefore&#xD;
      conclude that the GBS colonization rates within our obstetric population will be&#xD;
      approximately 25%. This will lead to the number of 1.5/6 potentially eligible patients per&#xD;
      day, who could then be assigned to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power for the present study was calculated using the dichotomized endpoint: recovery y/n.&#xD;
      (i.e., defined as GBS negative). For the sample size calculation, the investigators assume&#xD;
      that 43% of the women in the verum group will achieve the primary endpoint (i.e., recovery to&#xD;
      the GBS negative state). This calculation is based on previously published clinical and&#xD;
      preclinical data (18-20). The investigators expect a 18% recovery rate in the placebo group.&#xD;
      Under these assumptions, the Chi-Squared test at two-sided significance level α = 0.05 will&#xD;
      have 90% power to detect the group difference in a sample of N = 70 per group. With regard to&#xD;
      a drop-out rate of 10%, the investigators will therefore need to screen N = 1040 at study&#xD;
      visit 1, which would lead to 624/1040 (60%) patients without infection, of which 156/624&#xD;
      (25%) will be GBS-positive. Out of these, N = 78 per group will then be randomized, which&#xD;
      would lead to N = 70 per group after the estimated drop-out of 10%. The investigators will&#xD;
      need between 9-12 months to screen 1040 patients for study inclusion.&#xD;
