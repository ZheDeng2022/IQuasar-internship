      Background: The human gastrointestinal system is populated with a variety of symbiotic&#xD;
      microorganisms, namely microbiota. The microbiome is the total genetic data of the&#xD;
      microbiota. The human gut microbiota interacts extensively with the host through metabolic&#xD;
      exchange; thereby contribute to a variety of metabolic and immunologic mechanisms in the&#xD;
      human body. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide&#xD;
      and is a major field of interest in microbiota research. There have been several findings&#xD;
      that connect the gut microbiota to CAD pathophysiology, but these data relates solely to the&#xD;
      interaction between human gut microbiome and cardiovascular risk factors. As far as known ,&#xD;
      data regarding patients who already developed CAD is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To investigate gut microbiota of patients with CAD, thereby allowing the adjustment of&#xD;
      personalized treatment by changing the pro-atherosclerotic environment in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study participants will include patients arriving to Rabin Medical Center with&#xD;
      suspected CAD. Patients will provide medical, lifestyle, and nutritional questionnaires.&#xD;
      Vital signs measurements will be taken as well as fecal samples and/or rectal swabs. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn to measure blood chemistry including lipid profile and&#xD;
      trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels. Patients will undergo cardiac CT and/or cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization in accordance with the decision of the cardiologist to evaluate and/or treat&#xD;
      CAD. Genomic DNA will be extracted from stool samples for Microbiome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: The hypothesis is that there is a unique microbiota pattern in patients with&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or expression of CAD.&#xD;
      Knowing the unique microbiota in patients with coronary disease, would render it as novel&#xD;
      target for treatment, either primary or secondary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaboration: Between Cardiology department at Rabin Medical Center and the lab of Prof.&#xD;
      Eran Segal located at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The collaboration between these two&#xD;
      groups will combine the clinical expertise of treating cardiac patients with novel scientific&#xD;
      technology and concept.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human gastrointestinal system is populated with a variety of symbiotic microorganisms,&#xD;
      namely microbiota. Its total weight is approximately 2 kilograms, containing trillions of&#xD;
      microorganisms. The microbiome is the total genetic (metagenomic) data of the microbiota. In&#xD;
      recent years, the development of efficient methods for genome sequencing and bio-informatics&#xD;
      has enabled fast and accurate quantification and qualification of the microbiome, made&#xD;
      microbiome analysis leading method of microbiota research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounted for more than 8 million deaths yearly worldwide. In&#xD;
      particular, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      and is responsible for more than 1 million hospital admissions in the United States annually.&#xD;
      The pathophysiologic hallmark of ACS is coronary thrombosis caused by atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      injury, with two types of injuries being described. The first is plaque rupture, which&#xD;
      remains the most common cause of coronary athero-thrombosis, and the second is superficial&#xD;
      plaque erosion which is recognized with increasing frequency. As opposed to plaque rupture,&#xD;
      lesions that are caused by erosion do not have thin fibrous caps, abundant inflammatory&#xD;
      cells, or a large lipid core, but rather rich in extracellular matrix, such as proteoglycans&#xD;
      and glycosaminoglycans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies such as coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and diagnostic&#xD;
      coronary catheterizations with or without optical coherence tomography (OCT) are being used&#xD;
      increasingly in clinical practice in order to characterize the mechanism responsible for&#xD;
      unstable/vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human gut microbiota interacts extensively with the host through metabolic exchange and&#xD;
      co-metabolism of substrates; thereby contribute to a variety of metabolic and immunologic&#xD;
      mechanism in the human body. CAD is a major field of interest in microbiota research, and&#xD;
      there have been several findings that connect the gut microbiota to CAD pathophysiology.&#xD;
      First, microbiota was associated with metabolic syndrome, namely obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. It is hypothesized that gut microbiota may increase short-chain fatty acid, that&#xD;
      eventually increase appetite, thus causing obesity. Another hypothesis is that gut microbiota&#xD;
      endotoxins may translocate into the bloodstream, elicit inflammatory cascade that eventually&#xD;
      promote atherosclerosis. Second, microbiota may also have a role in the development of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. In patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis, there is a unique microbiome&#xD;
      pattern that may have pro-inflammatory characteristics. Recently, a unique microbial pattern&#xD;
      was found among patients with high cardiovascular risk profile. Third, gut microbiota&#xD;
      metabolize dietary phosphatidylcholine (lecitine) to produce the metabolite&#xD;
      trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data published so far relates solely to the interaction between human gut microbiome and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors. To the best of the investigator's knowledge and understanding,&#xD;
      the microbiome analysis of patients with an established diagnosis of CAD (including ACS) is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to investigate the gut microbiota of patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic CAD, both in stable and during acute phases. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the study participants would present with a unique microbiome signature that may provide a&#xD;
      novel insight into the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic CAD while affording putative&#xD;
      therapeutic implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After establishing the unique microbiome signature in a large cohort of CAD patients, the&#xD;
      investigators would correlate it to TMAO levels to further investigate its part in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of CAD. In the final stage, the investigators would try to find ways to&#xD;
      adjust personalized treatment options to change the &quot;pro-atherosclerotic&quot; gut microbiota. By&#xD;
      using data from the current study with the investigators' previous 1000 patient cohort with&#xD;
      known microbiome and nutritional profile, it would be able to search for a specific target&#xD;
      for nutritional intervention, such as probiotics. Then, the investigators would monitor the&#xD;
      patients with sequencing the microbiome after the nutritional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and recruitment. Study participants will be patients aged 30-80 arriving to&#xD;
      Rabin Medical Center with suspected CAD and able to provide informed consent. Participants&#xD;
      will provide medical, lifestyle, and nutritional questionnaires. Blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart-rate measurements will be taken during hospitalization as well as blood tests and fecal&#xD;
      samples and/or rectal swabs. In order to evaluate and/or treat suspected atherosclerotic&#xD;
      disease participants will undergo cardiac CT and/or cardiac catheterization in accordance&#xD;
      with the standard of care and based upon the decision of the treating cardiologist.&#xD;
      Diagnostics and treatment options will be based only on participants' medical condition and&#xD;
      regardless of the aforementioned study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be selected to represent an age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      -matched group without current CAD. Further exclusion criteria in the control group will be&#xD;
      antibiotic consumption in the following 3 months, inflammatory bowel disease, or other&#xD;
      significant chronic disease that may influence the microbiota (such as cancer, autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, and chronic immunosuppressive treatment). The control group will undergo cardiac CT&#xD;
      or coronary angiography according to clinical suspicion in order to rule-out CAD and&#xD;
      irrespective of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples. 10 ml venous blood will be collected into Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid&#xD;
      (EDTA) and gel with clot activator -containing tubes from the enrolled patients in all study&#xD;
      participants. The concentrations of serum creatinine, troponin, creatine phosphokinase (CPK),&#xD;
      hemoglobin, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoproteins (HDL),&#xD;
      low-density lipoproteins (LDL), glucose, c-reactive protein (CRP), b-type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (BNP) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) will be measured by automatic biochemistry analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the levels of TMAO will be measured from blood plasma by using Ultra-High&#xD;
      Performance Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometric - Multiple Reaction Monitoring&#xD;
      (UHPLC-MS/MRM) as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional profiling. All participants will report their habits of food consumption by&#xD;
      filling up the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac CT analysis. Selected participants will undergo CT angiography for the evaluation and&#xD;
      quantification of CAD using a 256-slice system (Brilliance iCT, Philips Healthcare,&#xD;
      Cleveland, Ohio). Data will be acquired with a collimation of 96 X 0.625 mm and a gantry&#xD;
      rotation time of 330 ms. Intravenous injection of 60 to 90 ml of nonionic contrast agent at a&#xD;
      flow rate of 5 ml/s will be followed by a 30-ml saline chase bolus (3 ml/s). Acquisition will&#xD;
      be performed during an inspiratory breath hold while the electrocardiogram will be recorded&#xD;
      simultaneously to allow, dependent from the heart rate, retrospective or prospective gating&#xD;
      of the data. All images will be reconstructed with a slice thickness of 0.67 mm and a slice&#xD;
      increment of 0.34 mm. The complete dataset will be transmitted to a dedicated CT workstation&#xD;
      with a 3-dimensional reconstruction tool specifically designed for coronary angiography&#xD;
      (Philips Intellispace Portal, version 7.0) to allow for multiplanar reformations and&#xD;
      quantitative plaque analysis. An independent reader will review all studies. Each vessel&#xD;
      containing significant stenosis will be analyzed in curved multiplanar reformatted images in&#xD;
      long-axis and cross-sectional views. Diameters at the site of maximum stenosis and at&#xD;
      proximal and distal references will be measured. Degree of stenosis will be calculated as the&#xD;
      ratio of the difference between the diameter at maximum stenosis and the mean of diameters at&#xD;
      the proximal and distal references divided by the mean of diameters at proximal and distal&#xD;
      references and expressed as percentage. Remodeling index will be calculated as the outer&#xD;
      vessel area at the site of maximum stenosis divided by the mean of outer vessel areas at&#xD;
      proximal and distal references. Positive remodeling will be defined as a remodeling index ≥&#xD;
      1.05. Plaque volume will be automatically calculated as the volume of all voxels segmented&#xD;
      between the luminal and outer vessel boundaries on curved multiplanar reformatted images.&#xD;
      Proximal and distal references will be used as the proximal and distal ends of the plaques.&#xD;
      The investigators will report the total volume of plaque and volumes of plaque subtypes:&#xD;
      calcified, non-calcified, and mixed plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients will be&#xD;
      admitted to the catheterization laboratory according to their clinical presentation, taking&#xD;
      into account the current ESC/AHA clinical guidelines. The cardiac catheterization procedure&#xD;
      will be performed using standard percutaneous techniques via the radial or femoral artery.&#xD;
      Coronary lesions will be evaluated by the operator in terms of stenosis by visual estimation&#xD;
      or other using objective measurements, such as quantitative coronary analysis (QCA). Coronary&#xD;
      intervention, including balloon angioplasty and stent implantation will be implemented as&#xD;
      needed and according to the severity of coronary stenosis i.e. (≥70% diameter stenosis).&#xD;
      Adjunctive coronary imaging (OCT or intravascular ultrasound) will be performed according to&#xD;
      operator's discretion and regardless of the study protocol. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      during the procedure with anticoagulation (mostly unfractionated heparin) using careful&#xD;
      monitoring of activated clotting time between 250-300 seconds. After the angioplasty&#xD;
      procedure, all patients will be treated with dual anti-platelet therapy combining aspirin and&#xD;
      P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, according to the clinical indication)&#xD;
      for 6-12 months, unless there will be contra-indication, such as treatment with oral&#xD;
      anti-coagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA Extraction and Filtering. Genomic DNA from stool samples will be purified using&#xD;
      PowerMag Soil DNA isolation kit (MoBio) optimized for Tecan automated platform. For shotgun&#xD;
      sequencing, 100 ng of purified DNA will be sheared with a Covaris E220X sonicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome analysis. Microbiome samples will be processed by an automated robotic pipeline in&#xD;
      96-well format. Each sample group collected will be processed robotically for both 16S and&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generating microbiome-based features. The investigators will employ and further extend a&#xD;
      computational pipeline that was developed for generating a rich set of features from a&#xD;
      metagenomic sample. These features will be the basis for models that identify&#xD;
      microbiome-based signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial and viral abundances - Mapping the metagenome sample to a reference bacterial&#xD;
      genome database, and then counting the number of reads mapping to each bacteria, resulting in&#xD;
      a vector of relative bacterial abundances for each sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial diversity - Using the relative bacterial abundances derived above, the&#xD;
      investigators will compute several measures of the diversity of bacteria and viruses in a&#xD;
      metagenome sample (e.g., Shannon entropy of the relative abundance vector, number of bacteria&#xD;
      above some minimal abundance level), as sample diversity was shown to be associated with&#xD;
      certain physiological aspects of the host such as overall adiposity and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial growth rates - For each metagenome sample, the investigators will compute a vector&#xD;
      that corresponds to the growth rate of each bacteria in the sample, using a novel method that&#xD;
      was recently developed for this purpose. Briefly, by examining the pattern of sequencing read&#xD;
      coverage (depth) across the length of different bacterial genomes, the investigators found&#xD;
      that many bacteria exhibit a prototypical coverage pattern, consisting of a single trough and&#xD;
      a single peak. Notably, the location of the peak coincides with the bacteria's known origin&#xD;
      of replication, suggesting that the added read coverage near the peak represents newly&#xD;
      replicated DNA. For any given bacteria, the ratio between the peak and trough coverage varies&#xD;
      greatly across samples from different human gut microbiomes, with high ratios being similar&#xD;
      to those obtained during exponential growth phase of bacteria grown in culture, and low&#xD;
      ratios being similar to growth in stationary phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene abundances - The investigators will compute the relative abundances of genes in&#xD;
      metagenome samples by applying a similar approach to that above for deriving relative&#xD;
      abundances of bacteria. To this end, rather than mapping the reads to the reference bacterial&#xD;
      genome database, the investigators will map them to a reference database of bacterial genes&#xD;
      which was recently extended and that collectively contain over 3 million distinct bacterial&#xD;
      genes. The derived gene abundance vectors are complementary to the bacteria abundance&#xD;
      vectors, with the advantage being mapping to genes whose embedding bacterial genome is&#xD;
      unknown and thus allowing more metagenome sequencing reads to be mapped, and with the&#xD;
      disadvantage of producing a much larger feature vector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological pathway abundances - As another set of features that provide information at the&#xD;
      functional level of the microbiota, the investigators will use the KEGG database of&#xD;
      biological pathways51 and the above vector of gene abundance of each sample to compute an&#xD;
      abundance score for each biological pathway. The key advantage of this set of features is&#xD;
      that its associations provide direct hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms through&#xD;
      which the microbiota may be involved with the correlated phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage. The samples as well as remaining DNA and frozen serums will be stored in -80C&#xD;
      freezers. Unprocessed stool samples (e.g., not all samples collected annually will be&#xD;
      processed initially) will also be stored in -800C freezers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Clinical data such as vital signs, cardiovascular risk factors (age,&#xD;
      gender, lipid profile, glycemic index, smoking status, previous CAD), chronic co-morbidities,&#xD;
      regular drug use, imaging findings on cardiac CT and/or cardiac catheterization as well as&#xD;
      cardiac enzymes levels will be collected at Rabin Medical Center. At the Weizmann institute&#xD;
      of science, in the computer science department by the Segal Lab, the investigators will&#xD;
      analyze the data. For each parameter an association analyses will be performed to identify&#xD;
      all of the microbiome parameters that are associated with these clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analyzing the microbiome signatures in those patients, where known probiotic and/or&#xD;
      nutritional interventions can lead to the desired change the investigators will intervene and&#xD;
      then monitor with sequencing the microbiome after the intervention.&#xD;
