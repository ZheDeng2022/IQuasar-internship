      Introduction: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disorder in the brain which makes the&#xD;
      control and execution of movements difficult. One of the possible ways to analyze motor&#xD;
      control in these individuals could be through analysis of movement speed and accuracy.&#xD;
      Objective: To verify the speed-accuracy trade-off in individuals with CP. Method: 96&#xD;
      individuals were evaluated, 48 with CP and 48 with typical development (TD), matched by age&#xD;
      and sex. The software used was the &quot;Fitts' Reciprocal Aiming Task v.1.0 (Horizontal)&quot;,&#xD;
      performed on a computer using an external optical mouse, with progressive indices of&#xD;
      difficulty (IDs): ID2, ID4a and ID4b. Each index of difficulty was performed three times and&#xD;
      the total time/touches captured.&#xD;

      The software used in this study was &quot;Fitts' Reciprocal Aiming Task v.1.0 (Horizontal)&quot;&#xD;
      developed by Okazaki, in the public domain and available on the Internet, which was performed&#xD;
      on a Toshiba notebook®, model Satellite A60-S1561 System Unit, with the use of an external&#xD;
      optical mouse, Fortrek® OM-302.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This instrument can be used to verify motor control through analysis of the speed and&#xD;
      accuracy of movement, which can be determined through the log-linear relation between&#xD;
      movement time and task difficulty using a mathematical equation, and analyzed by Fitts' law,&#xD;
      which describes the relation between movement accuracy and speed, associated with target size&#xD;
      and distance11. Thus, the task used in this study was composed of targets of different sizes,&#xD;
      being that the smaller targets require more time to execute due to the necessity of increased&#xD;
      accuracy and, if the distance between targets reduces, the speed of movement becomes greater&#xD;
      and the accuracy decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to target size (W) and distance between targets (D), the equation log2 (2D/W)&#xD;
      results in an index of difficulty (ID), where the higher the ID, the more difficult the task,&#xD;
      a fact that necessitates greater movement time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the speed and accuracy, two different indices of difficulty were used in this&#xD;
      study (ID2 and ID4). The difficulty level was increased by changing the width and distance&#xD;
      between the bars. In addition, ID4 was used in two different ways (ID4a and ID4b), for which&#xD;
      the distance between the bars and the width were different, but the ID was maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Procedure and design The experiment was composed of three trials at each of the two IDs: 2&#xD;
      and 4 (ID 4 had two kinds of measurement - ID4a and ID4b), and the participants performed the&#xD;
      tasks individually in a room, with only the evaluator present, seated on a chair (or their&#xD;
      own wheelchair), which was adjusted in height according to the needs of the individual. A&#xD;
      footrest was available, when necessary. The computer was placed on a table, and each&#xD;
      participant was given instructions and presented with the task, in which the individual,&#xD;
      after hearing an alarm from the computer, was required to click with an external mouse cursor&#xD;
      on two parallel bars which were arranged vertically, intermittently, with the greatest speed&#xD;
      and accuracy possible, for a period of 10 seconds, followed by a second alarm which indicated&#xD;
      the end of the attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly following the attempt, the total movement time was registered, by dividing the&#xD;
      seconds obtained in each attempt by the number of &quot;clicks&quot; on targets. If more than two&#xD;
      clicks were wrong, the individual repeated the task.&#xD;
