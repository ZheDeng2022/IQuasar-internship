    <textblock>
      In the last few years a new clinical entity has emerged which includes patients who consider&#xD;
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though&#xD;
      they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named&#xD;
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although in a recent article, the researchers suggested&#xD;
      the term &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS), because it is not known to date what&#xD;
      component of wheat actually causes the symptoms. The clinical picture of NCWS is&#xD;
      characterized by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or&#xD;
      constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and&#xD;
      extra-intestinal or systemic manifestations (headache, depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,'&#xD;
      tiredness, dermatitis or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,&#xD;
      and anemia). Lactose intolerance and cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are two medical&#xD;
      conditions with a very high prevalence in the general population, and there is a large&#xD;
      overlap between NCWS symptoms and lactose intolerance and CMPA symptoms. Therefore, the aims&#xD;
      of the present study are to investigate 1) the prevalence of positive lactose breath test and&#xD;
      DBPC cow's milk protein challenge in NCWS patients with self-reported gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms related to milk and/or milk derivates ingestion, 2) the clinical, serological, and&#xD;
      histological characteristics of NCWS patients with lactose intolerance and CMPA in comparison&#xD;
      to NCWS patients without lactose intolerance and CMPA.&#xD;

      In the last few years, a new clinical entity has emerged which includes patients who consider&#xD;
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though&#xD;
      they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named&#xD;
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although in a recent article, the researchers suggested&#xD;
      the term &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS), because it is not known to date what&#xD;
      component of wheat actually causes the symptoms. Other areas of doubt in NCWS regard its&#xD;
      pathogenesis, while some papers reported intestinal immunologic activation, others linked&#xD;
      NCWS to the dietary short chain carbohydrate (fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and&#xD;
      polyols, FODMAPs) load. The researchers recently demonstrated that higher proportions of&#xD;
      patients with NCWS develop autoimmune disorders, are antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive,&#xD;
      and show DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),&#xD;
      supporting an immunologic involvement in NCWS. The clinical picture of NCWS is characterized&#xD;
      by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea,&#xD;
      epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and extra-intestinal or&#xD;
      systemic manifestations (headache, depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,' tiredness, dermatitis&#xD;
      or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, and anemia). Lactose&#xD;
      intolerance and cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) are two conditions with a very high&#xD;
      prevalence in the general population and there is a large overlap between NCWS and lactose&#xD;
      intolerance and CMPA symptoms. Therefore, the aims of the present study are to investigate 1)&#xD;
      the prevalence of positive lactose breath test and DBPC cow's milk protein challenge in NCWS&#xD;
      patients with self-reported gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to milk&#xD;
      and/or milk derivates ingestion, 2) the clinical, serological, and histological&#xD;
      characteristics of NCWS patients with lactose intolerance and CMPA in comparison to NCWS&#xD;
      patients without lactose intolerance and CMPA.&#xD;

        The researchers prospectively will survey adult patients with functional&#xD;
        gastroenterological symptoms (Rome III criteria) and a definitive diagnosis of NCWS,&#xD;
        referred at the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital of Palermo,&#xD;
        Italy, and at the Department of Internal Medicine of the Hospital of Sciacca, Agrigento,&#xD;
        Italy, between January 2017 and January 2019, comparing the characteristics of the ones&#xD;
        suffering from lactose intolerance and CMPA with those who do not suffer from lactose&#xD;
        intolerance and CMPA.&#xD;
