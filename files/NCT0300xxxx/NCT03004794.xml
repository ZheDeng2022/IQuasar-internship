      Initial recruitment: 1717, 136 (7.92%) were excluded due to missing data that could not be&#xD;
      obtained. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) was revised according to the 2010 revision&#xD;
      of the McDonald criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients analyses: 1581 Every patient was registered by his/her 14-digit unique identity&#xD;
      numbers, (which is mandatory in Egypt since 1999) to make sure that every registered patient&#xD;
      in different centers were counted only once.&#xD;

      Patients' records review procedure and sampling strategies. The medical records,&#xD;
      administrative data, laboratory and diagnostic tests reports were screened by 3 authors (HS,&#xD;
      NS, AE) and these data were extracted in a standard electronic form according to Kasr Alaini&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Unit (KAMSU) registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assigned coordinator from each center was requested to facilitate data collection from&#xD;
      site-specific records. In cases of incomplete documentation or unclear information,&#xD;
      verification was done by on-site data coordinator either by phone contact or face-to-face&#xD;
      interview with the patients, whether during the routine follow up or in an unscheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measures were taken to ensure the confidentiality of the collected information. No&#xD;
      patient names were included in the database presented by site coordinator, and the study&#xD;
      staff signed a confidentiality agreement for non-disclosure.&#xD;

        The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) was revised according to the 2010 revision of the&#xD;
        McDonald criteria, and patients were classified according to the course of the disease into&#xD;
        relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis&#xD;
        (SPMS) and primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Patients with first demyelinating&#xD;
        event, before 2010, were re-assessed by on-site coordinators to label them clinically&#xD;
        isolated syndrome (CIS), whenever applicable, according to McDonalds 2010, and&#xD;
        neuromyelitis optica (NMO) cases diagnosis was verified according to the 2015 diagnostic&#xD;
        criteria. Those with typical brain Magnetic Resonant Imaging (MRI) MS like lesions without&#xD;
        related clinical manifestations were diagnosed as radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS).&#xD;
