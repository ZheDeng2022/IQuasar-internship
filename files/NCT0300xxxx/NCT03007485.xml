  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), also known as emphysema, is the leading cause&#xD;
      of hospitalization for older adults in the U.S., and a leading cause of death. Although there&#xD;
      is no cure for COPD, a program called pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), which combines exercise&#xD;
      and education, can help decrease re-hospitalizations and improve patients' quality of life.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, very few COPD Latino and African-American patients actually get PR. These&#xD;
      patients are unlikely to get referrals or to be able to attend PR due to lack of insurance,&#xD;
      lack of transportation, or lack of a PR center in their area. Telehealth is a way of using&#xD;
      computers to deliver healthcare long-distance, eliminating the need for a patient to travel&#xD;
      to receive care. By using telehealth for PR, the patient can exercise on a stationary bike in&#xD;
      his or her home, while being supervised by videoconference by a respiratory therapist (RT).&#xD;
      The RT can &quot;see&quot; the patient, and deliver education by videoconference, and the patient can&#xD;
      &quot;see&quot; the RT, so the patient does not need to leave home to get PR.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth-delivered PR has been shown to be as effective as standard PR (patients go to an&#xD;
      outpatient setting) at improving quality of life, and patients' exercise capacity. However,&#xD;
      this has not been studied in the Latino and African-American population and it is not known&#xD;
      how effective telehealth PR will be among this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators hope to see if they can help COPD Latino and&#xD;
      African-American patients with access to this needed resource through telehealth PR. They&#xD;
      will compare standard PR and telehealth PR to determine if telehealth results in better&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with moderate to severe COPD who were recently discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital for COPD. The primary outcome the investigators will assess will be change in&#xD;
      re-hospitalization rates. The secondary outcomes will include: change in quality of life,&#xD;
      preparation to make decisions about clinical care, improved functional capacity, decreased&#xD;
      dyspnea, anxiety, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve randomly assigning participants to make sure that they are just as&#xD;
      likely to be in one group as the other to receive either: 1) referral for&#xD;
      telehealth-delivered PR, or 2) referral to standard (outpatient) PR. Both PR programs consist&#xD;
      of exercise and education twice a week for 8 weeks. The investigators will give the patients&#xD;
      surveys to complete before they start the program and at the end of the program, to see if PR&#xD;
      had any effect on the outcomes that are being measured. Patients will also be asked to&#xD;
      participate in a qualitative interview and focus group to learn about the barriers they&#xD;
      encountered even after receiving a referral to PR. These qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted among a sample of participants representing those who withdrew, were&#xD;
      lost-to-follow-up, completed PR and decided to only complete the surveys (i.e. not&#xD;
      participate in PR).The investigators will enroll about 276 patients - with 138 patients in&#xD;
      each group (telehealth PR or standard PR), so they can compare outcomes to see if telehealth&#xD;
      PR was more, less, or equally effective as standard PR.&#xD;

The patient's vital signs are continually monitored and the RT is able to remotely alert 911 if a patient is in distress. Educational videos and stretching exercises are also incorporated into this session to mimic what a standard pulmonary rehabilitation session offers.</description>
