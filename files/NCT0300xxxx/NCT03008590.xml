  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 100 million Americans report chronic pain. Veterans are disproportionately affected for&#xD;
      multiple reasons, including injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for&#xD;
      chronic pain is a priority research area for the VA. One of the most common causes of chronic&#xD;
      pain is osteoarthritis (OA). OA is attributable to &quot;wear and tear,&quot; but reasons for pain are&#xD;
      complex. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) includes multiple severe diseases that affect 2-3% of&#xD;
      persons and require treatment with immune-suppressive drugs to prevent joint destruction.&#xD;
      Pain often persists despite effective treatment. Pain in arthritis results from multiple&#xD;
      sources: inflammation, perception of pain in the joint, and interpretation of pain by the&#xD;
      brain. Unfortunately, management of pain in arthritis remains a challenge. Low dose&#xD;
      naltrexone is a widely used but unproven &quot;alternative&quot; approach to chronic pain. It is&#xD;
      attractive for study because it is safe and is proposed to work on all three pathways that&#xD;
      contribute to pain. A small but high-quality clinical trial is needed to determine whether to&#xD;
      invest in definitive studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans, and arthritis is the most common cause.&#xD;
      Existing treatments for chronic arthritic pain are only mildly effective, and risks of&#xD;
      medications used to treat pain are numerous and continue to be discovered. Treatment of&#xD;
      chronic is a high priority research area for VA CSR&amp;D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is FDA approved in an oral daily dose of 50 mg to&#xD;
      prevent recidivism in alcoholics. At much lower doses of 4 - 4.5 mg daily, however, it has&#xD;
      been shown in small, blinded, randomized trials to improve pain in fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms in Crohn's disease, and quality of life in multiple sclerosis. The&#xD;
      only other published data are case reports in complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain,&#xD;
      and scleroderma. However, advocacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) by internet-based MDs and&#xD;
      patients is high, and since LDN can be prescribed off-label, its use greatly exceeds what is&#xD;
      justified by evidence. The drug can be prescribed only via compounding pharmacies, so its use&#xD;
      costs a patient ~$40/month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the many unproven treatments that are widely used, LDN is of particular interest&#xD;
      because results of surveys of patients are particularly impressive, because it is quite safe,&#xD;
      and because its benefit is plausible pharmacologically. There is evidence both for modulation&#xD;
      of central pain-processing pathways and for down-regulation of inflammatory pathways in&#xD;
      microglia. Considering the diversity of conditions proposed to benefit from LDN and the&#xD;
      unequivocal need for better approaches to pain relief in chronic conditions, high-quality&#xD;
      clinical trials are needed in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. This small&#xD;
      but placebo-controlled study, powered to detect an effect size as small as that seen with&#xD;
      NSAIDs or the most beneficial non-pharmacologic approaches, is proposed as a prerequisite for&#xD;
      considering a pivotal trial through the VA Cooperative Studies Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial in&#xD;
      adults with osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis and persistent pain. Sixty patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled for 16 weeks, during which they will receive LDN for 8 weeks and placebo for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Widely accepted patient-reported outcome measures will be used. The co-primary&#xD;
      endpoints are reduction in pain severity or pain's interference with function during 8 weeks&#xD;
      of LDN compared to 8 weeks placebo, using the Brief Pain Inventory. Other patient-reported&#xD;
      data will be used both as secondary outcomes and as covariates in analyzing determinants of&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;

          -  Veteran or otherwise eligible for VA benefits, able to travel to VA Boston&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more of the following chronic conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  non-axial spondyloarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average daily pain interference with function (average of the 7 parts of question 9 on&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No change in medication in the past 8 weeks made with the expectation of improving&#xD;
             pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No plan to start another medication or a non-pharmacologic treatment regimen likely to&#xD;
             affect pain during the next 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age at least 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Registered for medical care in the VA Boston Healthcare System&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of informed consent, and willingness to comply with study procedures,&#xD;
             including receipt of weekly phone calls from the study coordinator&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following requires exclusion from participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of opioids including tramadol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, breast feeding, or unwilling to engage in contraceptive practices if&#xD;
             sexually active and capable of conceiving&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or poorly controlled depression or anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of low-dose naltrexone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Back pain described by the patient as greater in severity than arthritic pain in a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Plan to have surgery during the next 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inconsistency in self-reporting at the screening visit. BPI, PainDETECT, WOMAC, and&#xD;
             PROMIS-29 all contain 0-10 scales of average pain intensity, although the times listed&#xD;
             vary from 1-4 weeks. The severity reported on these three scales cannot differ by more&#xD;
             than 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other qualitative circumstances that the investigator feels would make the patient a&#xD;
             poor candidate for this clinical trial, such as an unstable social situation or&#xD;
