  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at investigating social cognition outcomes of children born prematurely.&#xD;
      Social cognition can be briefly defined as a process which underlines people's social and&#xD;
      emotional behaviors. There are behavioral and cognitive evidences indicating that preterm&#xD;
      children have executive dysfunctions. Executive functions refer to multiple cognitive&#xD;
      processes that contribute to human higher order abilities, such as purposeful and&#xD;
      future-orientated behavior. The literature regarding development of term born children&#xD;
      indicates that executive functions are linked to the emergence of social cognition. Then, the&#xD;
      investigators asked if children born prematurely, as they commonly present executive&#xD;
      dysfunctions, would show an atypical development of social cognition. Additionally, as it has&#xD;
      been shown that parental anxiety is a key factor of preterm children development, the&#xD;
      investigators assumed that it should play a role in social cognition outcomes.&#xD;

      The present study examines the social cognition development of very preterm children at 7 to&#xD;
      10 years old. In the literature, there has yet to be any research on social cognition of&#xD;
      children born prematurely while preterm children are usually described as having difficulties&#xD;
      in social relations. The main hypothesis is that preterm children would present a deficit or&#xD;
      a delay in the social cognition development in comparison with that of matched term children,&#xD;
      and that this deficit or delay should be explained by executive dysfunctions and parental&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social cognition can be defined as the ability to understand the mind of other people and&#xD;
      more specifically to perceive emotion, to have empathy, to attribute false-belief, to&#xD;
      understand intended meaning, among others. In this study, the investigators will mainly focus&#xD;
      on the ability of 80 very preterm children to understand the mind of others, well known as&#xD;
      theory of mind in the literature, thanks to small stories involving the thinking and feelings&#xD;
      of characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The executive functioning, which refers to multiple processes underlying human higher order&#xD;
      abilities, will be assessed thanks to standardized neuropsychological tests. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators will focus on the three main well known executive functions: inhibition,&#xD;
      working memory and shifting. They expect, consistently with the literature, that preterm&#xD;
      children will have executive dysfunctions, and that these will be linked to children theory&#xD;
      of mind abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, given that parental anxiety affects child development, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      assess some psychological features of children's parents in our study, such the level of&#xD;
      parental anxiety. They assume that this level will also be linked to theory of mind abilities&#xD;
      of children.&#xD;
