      This study is an observational non-interventional study which will examine a) the accuracy of&#xD;
      biomarkers in predicting renal and cardiovascular outcomes after contrast-induced acute&#xD;
      kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will obtain de-identified human plasma &amp; urine samples and corresponding&#xD;
      de-identified research study data on subjects who are enrolled into the Prevention of Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Events Following Angiography (PRESERVE) study and Biomarker Collection and Analysis&#xD;
      in the PRESERVE Trial (VA CSP #578). Biomarker analyses will be performed on the&#xD;
      de-identified samples and merged with de-identified research study data.&#xD;

      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) is a serious complication occurring in patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease undergoing angiography and is associated with adverse renal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes. The investigators will address two key questions that remain in&#xD;
      high-risk patients undergoing angiography. First, early detection of CIAKI after contrast&#xD;
      exposure is problematic because rise in serum creatinine or decline in urine output occur&#xD;
      over several days and many cases are under-diagnosed. Second, early risk stratification for&#xD;
      long-term adverse events is also problematic because existing risk prediction models only&#xD;
      have a modest predictive value. Availability of a biomarker that detects subclinical CIAKI&#xD;
      before creatinine and also aids in risk stratification will change primary and secondary&#xD;
      prevention strategies. The FDA has recently approved two novel, highly sensitive, urinary&#xD;
      cell cycle arrest biomarkers for early detection of AKI. The investigators have shown that&#xD;
      these biomarkers: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and insulin growth factor&#xD;
      binding protein (IGFBP)7, detect AKI before serum creatinine in critically ill patients and&#xD;
      are associated with long-term adverse outcomes. Whether these markers can be used to predict&#xD;
      renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing angiography is yet unknown. The&#xD;
      investigators have been recently funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, clinical trial in 7,680 high-risk patients undergoing angiography to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of intravenous sodium bicarbonate with isotonic sodium chloride,&#xD;
      and oral N- acetylcysteine with placebo, for the prevention of serious adverse outcomes&#xD;
      associated with CIAKI. The NIDDK has funded an associated biorepository to examine known and&#xD;
      yet-to-be identified biomarkers for CIAKI. The investigators propose to leverage these&#xD;
      resources to conduct an ancillary observational study entitled Biomarker Effectiveness&#xD;
      Analysis in Contrast Nephropathy (BEACON). Using urine and plasma samples obtained before and&#xD;
      at four hours after angiography in 1,100 subjects, the investigators will address two&#xD;
      specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the accuracy of urinary TIMP-2, IGFBP7, and select other&#xD;
      plasma biomarkers in predicting the composite renal outcome of death, dialysis dependence, or&#xD;
      persistent renal injury at day 90 after contrast exposure (Aim 1a); biomarker&#xD;
      reclassification of risk for adverse renal outcomes and develop a risk score (Aim 1b); and&#xD;
      predicting the progression of chronic kidney disease (Aim 1c). Aim 2 will examine the&#xD;
      accuracy of urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 in predicting the composite outcome of hospitalization&#xD;
      with acute coronary syndrome; heart failure; cerebrovascular accident; or all-cause mortality&#xD;
      within 90 days (Aim 2a); and biomarker reclassification of risk for cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (Aim 2b). The proposed work will advance NIDDK's mission of early detection,&#xD;
      risk-stratification, and prognostication of CIAKI. It will provide new scientific knowledge&#xD;
      on using biomarkers to monitor patients undergoing angiography and will have a high impact on&#xD;
      clinical practice, physicians, and policy makers.&#xD;
