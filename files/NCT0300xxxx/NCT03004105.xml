      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if MEDI4736 given in combination with&#xD;
      selumetinib can help to control advanced lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no&#xD;
      one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is in Group 1, participant will take selumetinib 2 times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant is in Group 2, participant will take selumetinib 2 times each day on Days&#xD;
           1-7 and 15-22 of each study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also receive MEDI4736.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant should take each dose of selumetinib about 12 hours apart after fasting (having&#xD;
      nothing to eat or drink except water) for 1 hour before and 2 hours after taking selumetinib.&#xD;
      Participant will follow the dosing schedule to which participant has been assigned (as&#xD;
      described above under Study Groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant should record each selumetinib dose in the dosing diary that will be given to&#xD;
      participant. Participant should bring the diary to participant's study visits at the end of&#xD;
      every cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive MEDI4736 by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of every cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.&#xD;
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may receive the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks is in participant's&#xD;
      best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on the study will be over after the Follow-Up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 14 days before the first dose of the study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant and the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about ½&#xD;
           teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and at Week 16, participant will have an EKG. Participant will have&#xD;
      triplicate EKGs on Day 1 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 8 and about every 8 weeks after that, participant will have a CT scan or MRI to check&#xD;
      the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12 and about every 12 weeks after that, participant will have an ECHO or multigated&#xD;
      acquisition (MUGA) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 30 days and 90 days after participant's last dose of the study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant can become pregnant and the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about ½&#xD;
           teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 6 months, participant will be called by a member of the study staff to ask how&#xD;
      participant is doing and if participant has started any new treatments outside of the study.&#xD;
      These calls should last about 10 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant may return to the clinic for either a CT scan&#xD;
      or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MEDI4736 and selumetinib are not FDA approved or&#xD;
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study&#xD;
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 76 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
