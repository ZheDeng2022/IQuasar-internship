      Background and Objectives A recent systematic review investigating dimensional alveolar bone&#xD;
      changes after insertion of post-extraction implants reported that there is a lack of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials that would serve as a scientific base for building clinical&#xD;
      guidelines on alveolar site treatment after insertion of post-extraction implants. Different&#xD;
      studies suggest that insertion of post-extraction implants should be performed after fully&#xD;
      elevating a flap and inserting bone graft in the residual space between the implant surface&#xD;
      and the alveolar socket. Other investigations report insignificant differences between open&#xD;
      flap and flapless approaches, whereas the insertion of bone grafts remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a three-armed randomized clinical controlled trial conducted with the&#xD;
      following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of morphological and alveolar bone level differences (marginal bone loss) on&#xD;
           post-extraction implants inserted with the following techniques: 1) open flap surgery&#xD;
           alone; 2) open flap surgery and bone grafting; 3) flapless.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimation of effectiveness of the three surgical techniques through measurement of&#xD;
           secondary outcomes such as intra-operatory and post-operatory complications, pain and&#xD;
           discomfort, time and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a three-armed randomized controlled clinical trial where each arm will belong to&#xD;
           one of the treatments: 1) open flap surgery alone; 2) open flap surgery and bone&#xD;
           grafting; 3) flapless.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The randomizing sequence will be generated from a computer program (STATA 13) by a&#xD;
           statistician who will also conduct blind statistical analysis of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be recruited prior to trial commencement. They will be extensively&#xD;
           informed regarding the intervention and will sign a treatment consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be recruited according to the following inclusion criteria: absence of any&#xD;
           systemic disease that might compromise implant integration or wound healing, appropriate&#xD;
           periodontal health (measured through periodontal indexes), presence of premolars with&#xD;
           indications of extractions, presence of adjacent teeth, absence of fenestrations,&#xD;
           presence of vestibular alveolar wall with a minimum of 0.5mm of thickness. Patients who&#xD;
           have undergone CT scanning in the past 5 years and heavy smokers (more than 20&#xD;
           cigarettes per day) will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of sample size has already been performed by an experienced statistician,&#xD;
           accounting for a minimal predicted difference between groups of 1mm (SD 0.75mm) of&#xD;
           marginal bone loss, alpha error of 0.05 and 90% of power. Based on these calculations, a&#xD;
           total of 45 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventions will be performed in accordance with ethical standards as suggested by the&#xD;
           Helsinki Declaration (1975). Approval of Ethical Committee of the University of Bari has&#xD;
           already been obtained (reg.nr. 4987).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgical interventions will be performed by the same experienced surgeon who will be&#xD;
           informed of the type of intervention after tooth extraction (allocation concealment&#xD;
           through dark sealed envelopes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome is marginal bone loss (MBL) and alveolar bone dimensional changes&#xD;
           measured through CT Cone Beam performed immediately after implant insertion and 6 months&#xD;
           after. Secondary outcomes are intra-and post-operative complications, pain and&#xD;
           discomfort, time and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes will be measured by another clinician blinded in terms of treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis will be performed by an independent statistician. Statistical tests&#xD;
           will include: One-way Anova, Bonferroni tests and several linear and logistic&#xD;
           regressions in order to estimate potential predictive variables. Statistical&#xD;
           significance will be set at .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interruption of study will be considered in the following situations: 1.preliminary&#xD;
           observation of highly significant difference between techniques indicating one technique&#xD;
           highly superior; 2. big number of lost to follow-up (bigger than that considered during&#xD;
           sample size calculation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be excluded from the study in the following cases: missing follow-up&#xD;
           hygiene controls at 1 and 3 months post-intervention, missing 6 months follow-up&#xD;
           control, poor cooperation in terms of domestic oral hygiene (periodontal indexes&#xD;
           measured), income of systemic or local diseases that might compromise outcomes.&#xD;
