  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the safety and response to the combination of two&#xD;
      investigational drugs, tremelimumab and durvalumab, when given after radiation therapy for&#xD;
      patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer. Tremelimumab and&#xD;
      durvalumab recognize specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells and trigger the immune&#xD;
      system to destroy the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to learn more about certain characteristics of colorectal cancer tumors, this study&#xD;
      includes special research tests using samples from diagnostic tumors, fresh tumor samples&#xD;
      from an area where the cancer has spread, and blood samples.&#xD;

      The FC-9 study is designed as a phase II, open label, single arm study of the dual immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade with the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab following&#xD;
      hypofractionated palliative radiation in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have progressed on chemotherapy. The primary aim is to determine&#xD;
      the anti-tumor efficacy of the dual immune checkpoint blockade with durvalumab plus&#xD;
      tremelimumab. The secondary aims are to determine the clinical benefit rate, duration of&#xD;
      response, tolerability and correlates of response. Tumor response at unirradiated target&#xD;
      lesions will be measured at baseline and every 2 cycles using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following three doses of hypofractionated palliative radiation (Days -2, -1, and Day 0 prior&#xD;
      to Cycle 1), patients will receive the combination of tremelimumab (75 mg IV infusion) and&#xD;
      durvalumab (1500 mg IV infusion) on Day 1 for 4 cycles. Beginning with Cycle 5 through Cycle&#xD;
      12, patients will receive durvalumab alone (1500 mg/IV infusion) on Day 1 of each 28 day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be between 12 and 21 evaluable patients. Twelve evaluable patients will&#xD;
      be treated in the first stage of the study. If there are no responses among the 12 evaluable&#xD;
      patients, the study will be terminated. If the study goes on to the second stage, a total of&#xD;
      21 evaluable patients will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submission of tumor tissue and blood samples for FC-9 correlative science studies will be a&#xD;
      study requirement for all patients. Requirements will include archived tumor samples from the&#xD;
      diagnostic biopsy; additional biopsies of fresh tissue from an accessible lesion prior to&#xD;
      radiation therapy and after 2 cycles of study therapy; and blood sample collections.&#xD;
