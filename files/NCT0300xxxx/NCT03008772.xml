      To define the long-term incidence and frequency of ISR follow DES implantation. Compare the&#xD;
      clinical presentation, treatment and intervention success among de novo coronary artery&#xD;
      stenosis and DES ISR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare short- and long-term outcomes of de novo coronary artery stenosis and DES ISR,&#xD;
      assessed by incidence of mortality, MACE, MI, and TLR/TVR at index hospitalization, 30 days,&#xD;
      6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years, if available.&#xD;

      Drug-eluting coronary stents (DES) significantly reduced the rate of neointimal hyperplasia&#xD;
      and in-stent restenosis (ISR) compared to bare metal stents (BMS) for the treatment of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. In addition, the continued evolution in scaffold and polymer design&#xD;
      with concomitant improvements in antiplatelet therapy has improved the rates of late and very&#xD;
      late stent thrombosis. However, despite novel metal scaffold technology, increasing operator&#xD;
      experience, and improvement in adjunctive implantation techniques, the incidence of ISR in&#xD;
      durable-polymer DES remains a problem, with 1-year rates as high as 12 to 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes associated with ISR highlight the fact that this is by no means a benign process&#xD;
      and studies report MI rates as high as 19.4% with one study demonstrating a total rate of&#xD;
      death or nonfatal MI of 3.5%. In addition, ISR presenting as acute coronary syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      has an independent effect on major adverse cardiac events. The emergence of fully&#xD;
      bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) has provided an exciting alternative to combat the&#xD;
      long-term structural and functional effects on the coronary vessel seen with implantation of&#xD;
      a permanent metal scaffold, regardless of the drug coating. Initial studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of BVS compared to contemporary DES in regards to death, MI, and MACE. In&#xD;
      addition, intravascular imaging has confirmed complete resorbtion of the BVS by 3 years time.&#xD;
      The long-term benefits of such technology have yet to be fully assessed. However, based on&#xD;
      literature outlining the complicated course of ISR in short-term and that seen in the bare&#xD;
      metal stent era, it is projected that complete resorbtion of the vascular scaffold should&#xD;
      improve long-term outcomes of patients with ischemic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the clinical presentation, incidence, and outcomes of ISR in contemporary DES are&#xD;
      not completely understood. The goal of this particular study is to retrospectively evaluate&#xD;
      the long-term impact of ISR over a 10-year period in current contemporary DES. The data can&#xD;
      be compared to de novo coronary artery lesions with similar characteristics and complexity to&#xD;
      highlight the significant differences in the clinical course of each disease. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      investigators will hopefully demonstrate the need for improvement in this arena, which the&#xD;
      BVS will potentially provide.&#xD;
