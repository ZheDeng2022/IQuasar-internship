      Objective:The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of&#xD;
      pediatric urolithiasis in Kashgar area in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators carry out a cross-sectional survey among children aged 0 to14&#xD;
      years across Kashgar area in China. The participants are selected by a two-stage and&#xD;
      clustered random sampling method. Participants are asked to undergo urinary tract&#xD;
      ultrasonographic examinations, provided blood and urine samples to analyze. Their parents or&#xD;
      guardians are asked to fill out the questionnaires. Children those who are found with any&#xD;
      abnormalities of their urinary system by ulrtasonography will undergo a low-dose computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) to confirm the abnormalities. The end point of this study is to calculate the&#xD;
      prevalence rate, distribution and associated factors of pediatric urolithiasis in Kashi area.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Urolithiasis in children is a painful and costly disease that may also have&#xD;
      detrimental long-term effects on kidney function. Although urolithiasis is rarely found in&#xD;
      the pediatric population, several studies indicated that the incidence and inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalization rates were sharply increased. The incidence of nephrolithiasis for children&#xD;
      aged 18 years in South Carolina was 18.5 per 100,000 children in 2007, much higher than 7.9&#xD;
      per 100,000 in 1996. Data from Iceland revealed an incidence of 5.6 per 100,000 children aged&#xD;
      0 to 18 years on the basis of 26 new diagnoses of renal stone during a 6-year period among a&#xD;
      national population of approximately 78,000 children. The composition analysis of stone in&#xD;
      children revealed that the calcium stone was the most common one, accounted for 72% to 88%,&#xD;
      and the uric acid stone accounted for 2% to 3% while the infective stone (included ammonium&#xD;
      acid urate and magnesium ammonium phosphate) was rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kashgar area lies in the southwest of Xinjiang province in China, with a climate of less&#xD;
      annual rainfall, long hours of sunshine, high temperature and dry air. The population of&#xD;
      Kashgar area is about 4 million and the Uighur residents account for about 90%.Pediatirc&#xD;
      urolithiasis is a very common disease in Kashgar area. From August 2014 to July 2016, there&#xD;
      were 708 pediatric patients with urolithiasis were treated in the department of urology in&#xD;
      the First People's Hospital of Kashgar area which is a central hospital. The stone analysis&#xD;
      of these pediatric patients by infrared spectroscopy indicated that ammonium acid urate&#xD;
      accounted for 66%, magnesium ammonium phosphate accounted for 2.5%, uric acid accounted for&#xD;
      11%, and calcium stone accounted for 19% (these data has not been published ).This was very&#xD;
      different from previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we wonder urolithiasis maybe a very common disease among children in Kashgar area, even in&#xD;
      south Xinjiang province. And maybe there are some special reasons for pediatric urolithiasis&#xD;
      formation in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design and participants: A cross-sectional survey is carried out among children&#xD;
      aged 0 to 14 years in Kashgar area in China. Before designed the study, we have conducted a&#xD;
      pre-survey in a village which had 418 children by randomness clustered selected in Kashgar&#xD;
      area. And ten children were found with urinary stone by ultrasonography. So we estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of pediatric urolithiasis (p) in this area is about 2.4% (10/418), with α of 0.05,&#xD;
      a margin of error of less than 0.5%, 3599 children would needed by the formula of sample size&#xD;
      caculation.Consider a relative sampling error of 10%, a predicted 20% refusal rate, and at&#xD;
      least 4751 target children will be needed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A two-stage and clustered random sampling method is used to select a&#xD;
      representative sample of children across Kashgar area. The sampling process is initially&#xD;
      stratified the 12 regions of Kashgar area (Kashi, Taxian, Shule, Zhepu, Yuepu, Bachu,&#xD;
      Maigaiti, Yuecheng, Jiashi, Shufu, Shache, and Yingjisha) in descending order by Gross&#xD;
      Domestic Product (GDP) 2014. The first tier is selected two regions by simple random sampling&#xD;
      in the first six regions and the last six regions separately. Then the selected regions are&#xD;
      stratified by the degree of urbanization (urban area vs rural area), and one community in&#xD;
      urban area and one village in rural area is selected by randomization. At last four&#xD;
      communities in urban area and four villages in rural area are selected across Kashgar area.&#xD;
      Children those aged 0 to14 years in these selected communities and villages were all our&#xD;
      target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data include urinary tract ultrasonography (UTU), a standard questionnaire, urine&#xD;
      examines and blood species. All of examinations are free of charge. All data are collected by&#xD;
      investigators of our research group in community clinics of participant's residential area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Appointment: After obtaining the population information from the local government, we&#xD;
           will visit every family or household accompanied by staffs of the selected communities&#xD;
           or villages, to obtain pediatric information of each family, explain the aim of the&#xD;
           study, and invite the parents to take their kids to participate in the study which is&#xD;
           held at the community of village clinic. Also we will give a notice that include the aim&#xD;
           of the study, contents, date, and matter need attention of this survey to the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inform consent form: When the parents and children coming to the clinic, the&#xD;
           investigators will explain the details of consent form to the parents again. If the&#xD;
           parents are fully understand the aim of the study and agree to let their kids to&#xD;
           participant in this study, they will be asked to sign their name and the date on the&#xD;
           consent form. Also, the investigators will be required to sign the name and date on the&#xD;
           same page.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anthropometric indexes: Height (cm) and weight (kg) is measured using weighting-scale.&#xD;
           Circumference of head, chest, arm and forearm is measured by a same tape. Subcutaneous&#xD;
           fat thickness of triceps, biceps, scapular region, and abdominal wall is measured by a&#xD;
           subcutaneous fat meter. All values are recorded on the first page of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood specimen collecting and analysis: All children are invited to collect vein blood&#xD;
           to analysis. The standard blood analysis protocol includes complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
           serum creatinine, urea, and uric acid. Blood samples for CBC analysis are collected&#xD;
           using tubes with EDTA-K2 as preservative and are frozen at 4℃.Blood samples for serum&#xD;
           chemistries analysis are collected using tubes without any preservative. All blood&#xD;
           samples are delivered to the First People's Hospital of Kashgar area for analysis by&#xD;
           automated analyzers. All blood samples are analyzed in 12 hours after collection. Also,&#xD;
           we will preserve a blood sample of each child in a -80℃refrigerator for further analysis&#xD;
           of etiology which include genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Questionnaire: All parents are invited to fill out a pre-designed and standardized&#xD;
           questionnaire by face to face interview of our Uygur staffs. Information on demographic&#xD;
           data, feeding patterns, lifestyle, information of parents and family, possible symptoms&#xD;
           of urinary stone, co-morbidities of kids, history of medicine, family history are&#xD;
           recorded. Completeness and accuracy of questionnaires are checked up on site by special&#xD;
           quality controller.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. UTU: UTU is conducted by using same model of ultrasound machines with a 3.0-5.0 MHz&#xD;
           frequency probe throughout this study. We will provide enough water to drink and all&#xD;
           participants are required to have moderate bladder filling. Initially, participants lay&#xD;
           in a prone position for scanning of bilateral kidneys and upper ureters. Then&#xD;
           participants will turn to a supine position to have lower ureters and bladder scanned.&#xD;
           The position is adjusted if necessary to achieve successful scanning. Details of the&#xD;
           abnormalities are record including stone size, number, location, depth of hydronephrosis&#xD;
           (mm). The longest axis of the stone in millimeter (mm) is used for the stone size. And&#xD;
           also all the children which are found with urinary abnormalities are asked to undergo a&#xD;
           Non-enhanced helical CT scans with two-mm slices in the First People's Hospital of&#xD;
           Kashgar area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Urine samples of children are collected after finishing UTU. All urine samples are&#xD;
           analyzed by semi-automatic analyzers with dry chemical method on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Dietary record of case-control study: When one child is found with urinary stone, we&#xD;
           will ask his/her parents to make a dietary record for three consecutive days by weight&#xD;
           method. And also we will select four healthy children which have the same age and gender&#xD;
           and ask their parents to make a dietary record with the same method. We will provide a&#xD;
           weigh for each family. The table of dietary record is printed in Uygur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Quality control: The investigators involved in this study have completed a training&#xD;
           program on the methodology and data acquisition procedures. Each of them have a&#xD;
           procedure manual that detailed the administration of the questionnaires, operation of&#xD;
           the UTU, measurements of the anthropometric indexes, along with collecting and handling&#xD;
           the blood specimens. The same doctor and machine of ultrasound is used during the whole&#xD;
           study. All collected data will be registered and treated with the Epidata software&#xD;
           (version 3.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. End points evaluation: Prevalence is separately calculated for all participants and for&#xD;
           their subgroups according to age, sex, urban or rural residence, BMI and family history&#xD;
           of urinary stones, which is expressed as an unadjusted rate with 95% confidence&#xD;
           intervals (CIs). Difference between the categorical variables is compared using the&#xD;
           chi-square test. The association between urinary stone and relevant covariates is&#xD;
           calculated using binary logistic regression models.&#xD;
