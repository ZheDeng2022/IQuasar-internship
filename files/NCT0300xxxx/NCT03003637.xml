  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB/II trial to examine feasibility and safety of checkpoint blockade (aPD1&#xD;
      with or without aCTLA4) neoadjuvant to standard of care (SOC) in advanced stage head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a patient population in need for improved clinical outcome&#xD;
      and in tumors likely to respond to neoadjuvant aPD1 and aCTLA4. In addition, with this&#xD;
      research protocol the potential impact of intratumoral hypoxia on tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocyte (TIL) abundance, differentiation and effector function will be assessed, and the&#xD;
      potentially divergent effects of T cell checkpoint blockade in areas of hypoxia and normoxia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase Ib is designed as 3 + 3, with primary objective feasibility and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of Note: endpoints must be reached in all 6 patients of cohort 1 and 2, before start of the&#xD;
      next cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II is designed as a single arm design with primary endpoint efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase Ib, two cohorts will be used (cohort 1: nivolumab only and cohort 2: nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab neoadjuvant to surgery) to define which neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimen will be&#xD;
      taken towards the expansion cohort 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two patients will be treated with nivolumab (240 mg flat dose, week 1 and week 3,&#xD;
      twice in total) as a single agent OR the combination of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) + nivolumab&#xD;
      (240mg flat dose) in week 1, and nivolumab 240mg flat dose in week 3, neoadjuvant to SOC&#xD;
      (surgery with or without adjuvant (C)RT).&#xD;

             antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or&#xD;
             immune checkpoint pathways;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they are positive test for hepatitis B virus surface&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab&#xD;
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatotoxicity should be used with&#xD;
             caution in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In those patients who have a contraindication for cisplatin chemotherapy, Cetuximab&#xD;
             might be used as a radiosensitizer for radiotherapy if adjuvant treatment is deemed&#xD;
             necessary.&#xD;
