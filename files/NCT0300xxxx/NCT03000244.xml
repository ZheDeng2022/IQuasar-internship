  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have had an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) have bone marrow&#xD;
      or an immune system that is damaged. They get stem cells from a donor who is a relative.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study stem cell donors and recipients to learn about the long-term&#xD;
      effects of HCT. They want to learn how the stem cells change and how to improve their ability&#xD;
      to fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide long-term follow-up care for people who underwent or will undergo HCT. To collect&#xD;
      data, blood, and tissue samples to learn about late complications after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who will undergo HCT or underwent HCT and are surviving one year or&#xD;
      more from the date of HCT. The stem cell donors for these recipients are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have 1 visit each year. They will have a physical exam. They will answer&#xD;
      questions about their medical history and health. They will receive screening and&#xD;
      surveillance testing. They will complete brief questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have blood tests. They may have tissue biopsies or specimens (such as tissue&#xD;
      in their cheek or skin or bone marrow biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will give their current address and phone number, and the same data for one or two&#xD;
      other people, who can get in contact with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first visit at the clinic, some recipients may see a doctor close to home to get&#xD;
      the necessary information and send it to NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will come to the clinic for 1 visit. They will answer questions about their medical&#xD;
      history. Blood samples will be taken.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who survive more than 3 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation (HCT) have a high probability of being cured from their underlying&#xD;
           disease; however, mortality rates remain 4 to 9-fold higher than the general population&#xD;
           for at least 30 years after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most common causes of late mortality in HCT survivors include second malignancies,&#xD;
           relapsed/recurrent disease, infections, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),&#xD;
           respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guidelines for recommended screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors&#xD;
           after HCT have been developed, and can be implemented to detect or prevent late&#xD;
           complications after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding the pattern of immune reconstitution and immune dysregulation after HCT&#xD;
           may help to elucidate the root mechanisms of late complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To collect clinical data on patients and late complications after HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who underwent HCT for any indication and are surviving one year or more from&#xD;
           the date of HCT OR patients who will be undergoing HCT on an ETIB protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Related stem cell donors of patients meeting the above criteria who participated or will&#xD;
           be participating as a donor of stem cells or leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 4 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any active disease relapse or new hematologic malignancy including post-transplant&#xD;
           lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) are excluded from protocol enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective, longitudinal study of the natural history of long-term survivors after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data on post-transplant complications and peripheral blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected at yearly evaluations by the Principal Investigator, LAI, AI or representative&#xD;
           investigator of the original HCT protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient develops complications such as new cancers, relapsed disease, new hematologic&#xD;
           malignancy or PTLD they are exempt from required evaluations, and followed for survival&#xD;
           and causes of death (management of complications as per primary team).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As this is a longitudinal registry study without any planned intervention, there is no&#xD;
           formal statistical analysis plan or accrual goal; descriptive data will be reported.&#xD;
