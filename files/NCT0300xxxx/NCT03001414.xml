    <textblock>
      The SAPPHIRE clinical trial seeks to establish the efficacy and safety of repeated monthly&#xD;
      dosing of autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS (heNOS) in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      severe PAH on available PAH-targeted medical therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SAPPHIRE will use autologous progenitor cell-based gene delivery to enhance lung&#xD;
      microvascular repair and regeneration in patients with severe symptomatic PAH. A total of 45&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in this multi-centre, phase II, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, 3-arm protocol. Up to nine centres across Canada will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented study participants who meet all eligibility criteria during the screening period&#xD;
      will be scheduled to undergo apheresis. Following successful apheresis collection and receipt&#xD;
      of the cell samples by the cell manufacturing facility, randomization will take place though&#xD;
      a web-based system. Manufacturing of the cell therapy product will then be performed by the&#xD;
      cell manufacturing facility according to the assigned treatment allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Placebo (Plasma-Lyte A; 4 monthly IV infusions) in Course 1 (1st 6 months) followed by&#xD;
      Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 2 (2nd 6 months; 4 monthly IV&#xD;
      infusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 1 (1st 6 months; 4 monthly IV&#xD;
      infusions) followed by Placebo (Plasma-Lyte A) in Course 2 (2nd 6 months; 4 monthly IV&#xD;
      infusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in Course 1 (1st 6 months; 4 monthly IV&#xD;
      infusions) followed by a repeat dosing with Autologous EPCs transfected with human eNOS in&#xD;
      Course 2 (2nd 6 months; 4 monthly IV infusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5-9 days later, the study product will be transported to the investigative site&#xD;
      where the initial treatment will be delivered to the study participant in an outpatient&#xD;
      setting which is equipped for continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
      Participants will subsequently be monitored for a minimum of 1 hour and discharged from the&#xD;
      clinic once judged by the study investigator to be clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow-up assessments will take place over a 12-month period (11 study visits&#xD;
      in total). Once the 12-month trial data collection is completed, the trial will convert to a&#xD;
      registry with the goal of collecting long-term safety information through annual telephone&#xD;
      contacts for 10 years. Participants will be permitted to enroll in other clinical trials&#xD;
      during the registry period.&#xD;

             stable parenteral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to walk unassisted (oxygen use allowed). Aids for carrying oxygen (such as a&#xD;
             wheel chair or walker) are permitted provided they are not also required as mobility&#xD;

             barrier methods [such as a condom or diaphragm] used with a spermicide, or an&#xD;
             intrauterine device). Subjects must have a negative ß-hCG pregnancy test during the&#xD;
