  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of nerve ultrasound for the diagnosis and monitoring of neuromuscular diseases is a&#xD;
      promising growing field (1). Non-invasive and painless, ultrasound provides additional data&#xD;
      electroneuromyography (EMG), with a spatial resolution at least as good as MRI, while being&#xD;
      easily accessible and inexpensive.The polyradiculoneuritis Inflammatory Demyelinating&#xD;
      Chronicles (IPDC), Neuropathies Motrices in Multifocal Conduction Blocks (NMMBC) and&#xD;
      neuropathy associated with anti-MAG antibodies are among the major chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      neuropathies with an autoimmune etiology. The diagnosis of these pathologies is based on the&#xD;
      clinic, diagnostic tests and EMG. The interest not only in the diagnosis, but also for&#xD;
      monitoring these pathologies using ultrasound analysis nerves has been demonstrated recently&#xD;
      in several studies. However the limited resolution of current ultrasound images do not allow&#xD;
      detailed study of the internal structure of the nerves which could later help deepen&#xD;
      knowledge in this innovative field and can better understand the pathophysiological mechanism&#xD;
      of the evolution of these pathologies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, the investigators have available a UHF ultrasound in the ultrasound department of&#xD;
      the Nice University Hospital Pasteur Hospital 2 The investigators realize a descriptive&#xD;
      analysis study, pilot, mono-centric, multi and prospective on patients followed in the center&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of IPDC, a NMMBC or neuropathy with anti-MAG antibodies and control subjects&#xD;
      matched by age and sex. All the patients and controls in this study will receive a briefing&#xD;
      and must sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They realize an ultrasound study of the nerve, using an ultra high frequency ultrasound&#xD;
      system that will allow the assessment of anatomical structures of nerve (size, structure,&#xD;
      vascularisation and assessment booklets). Ultrasound data will, in a second stage, compared&#xD;
      with the data obtained with the EMG and clinical scores obtained using clinical rating&#xD;
      scales. 40 subjects will be included, divided into four subgroups: 10 subjects with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of IPDC (1), 10 subjects with a diagnosis of NMMBC (2), 10 subjects with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of neuropathy antibody-anti MAG (3) and 10 control subjects with no signs of&#xD;
      neuropathy at the EMG examination.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The main objective of this pilot study is to provide a descriptive analysis of the morphology&#xD;
      of the nerves with an ultra high frequency ultrasound in subgroups of CIDP patients, anti-MAG&#xD;
      antibodies and neuropathy NMMBC and controls. The thickness of the epineurium, the hallmarks&#xD;
      of fascicular organization, Doppler vascularity, the nerve-sectional area, the specification&#xD;
      of the section surface, nerve hypertrophy, the thickness of the perineurium and&#xD;
      ultrastructural characterization of the different fascicular organization typologies will be&#xD;
      well analyzed in order to better understand the specific sonographic characteristics of each&#xD;
      disease compared with controls, no data exist at present in the literature with such image&#xD;
      resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the morphological characteristics obtained by ultra high frequency ultrasound&#xD;
           between different subjects subgroups according to the morphological data collected and&#xD;
           sonographic scores: evaluation of nerve hypertrophy (intra- and inter-ratio nerve nerve)&#xD;
           (4 ) and intra-fascicular nerve and nerve cross-ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the correlation between sonographic and clinical scores scores in different&#xD;
           subjects subgroups using functional assessment scales: MRC score, R-ODS score, INCAT,&#xD;
           ONLS, ataxia Score and a torque rating of grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the correlation between sonographic scores and electrophysiological scores by&#xD;
           making a Ã©lectroneurogramme (ENG) in the different subjects of subgroups: the amplitude&#xD;
           and distal motor latency for distal motor conduction, the motor conduction velocities,&#xD;
           the presence of time dispersion or of a conduction block to the stepped motor&#xD;
           conduction, the latency of the waveform F to the proximal motor conduction and the&#xD;
           amplitude of the sensory potential for sensory conduction.&#xD;
