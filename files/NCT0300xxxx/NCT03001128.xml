    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about what happens when people pause, or&#xD;
      temporarily stop taking, ART, and to collect blood samples from these people at frequent&#xD;
      intervals. We will also study the safety of pausing ART under close observation.&#xD;
