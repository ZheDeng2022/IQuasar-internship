    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of olaparib monotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) harboring HR pathway gene mutations not limited&#xD;
      to BRCA 1/2 mutations, ATM deficiency or MRE11A mutations as second or third line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target subject population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with small cell lung cancer that have progressed following first-line platinum-based&#xD;
      therapy. Patients must have imaging confirmed progression on 1st line chemotherapy for SCLC&#xD;
      treatment, which must have contained platinum-based regimen, with at least one measurable&#xD;
      lesion per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
