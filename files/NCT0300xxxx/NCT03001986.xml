  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a major pathogen causing hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) worldwide,&#xD;
      is a member of the Human Enterovirus species A, family Picornaviridae. Its infection&#xD;
      occasionally leads to severe diseases and death, with central nervous system (CNS) damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inactivated EV71 vaccine (Human Diploid cell, KMB-17 Cell) has been finished phase I, II&#xD;
      and III clinical trials and licensed by CFDA in China at Dec. 3, 2015. Based on the results&#xD;
      of clinical trials, the protective efficacy of inactivated EV71 vaccine is 97% against HFMD&#xD;
      caused by EV71. The target population is determined to be susceptible children aged 6 to 71&#xD;
      months; this target population is well known as a major global population with strict&#xD;
      requirements for safety and efficacy of vaccines in implementing the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) . Thus, it is necessary and&#xD;
      significant to conduct a postmarketing phase IV trial in large populations for long-term&#xD;
      observation to evaluate the distinctive effectiveness and to identify potential safety issues&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label and controlled postmarketing phase IV trial on children aged 6-71&#xD;
      months who resided in 3 districts of Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, China.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of EV71 vaccine after mass vaccination in a&#xD;
      large population (Chinese healthy children aged 6-71 months) for preventing against&#xD;
      EV71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety of EV71 vaccine after mass vaccination in a large&#xD;
      population (Chinese healthy children aged 6-71 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The children aged 6-71 months in the study area registered in August 2016 in&#xD;
      the Childhood Immunization Information Management System (CIIMS) in Hubei Province are&#xD;
      designated as study population. Of these children, 39189 will be recruited in the vaccine&#xD;
      group for receiving 2 doses of EV71 inactivated vaccine at an interval of 1 month. The&#xD;
      remaining children will be used as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling size: The total sample size is primarily calculated based on the previous HFMD&#xD;
      monitoring data of the study sites from 2010 to 2015 by stratifying the data into 6 age&#xD;
      groups as follows: 6-11 months, 12-23 months, 24-35 months, 36-47 months, 48-59 months and&#xD;
      60-71 months, respectively. Prior to the identification of minimum annual HFMD incidences&#xD;
      caused by EV71 infection are 0.08%-6.05% (data not shown). Assuming a vaccine effectiveness&#xD;
      of 90% , power of 0.80 with a 0.05 significance level (two-tailed), and drop-out rate of 20%&#xD;
      , the sample size would be 39189 in the vaccine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment among the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruit the study participants, and the children's guardians sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participants receive the 1st dose EV71 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Observation for 30 minutes after vaccination in the vaccination clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow up the enrolled participants by using contact card for recording any occurred AEs&#xD;
           of for a period of 30 days p.i. through home visits (in villages) or telephone visits&#xD;
           (in urban communities) within 30 days p.i. the first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The participants receive the 2nd dose EV71 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Observation for 30 minutes after vaccination in the vaccination clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up the enrolled participants by using contact card for recording any occurred AEs&#xD;
           of for a period of 30 days p.i. through home visits (in villages) or telephone visits&#xD;
           (in urban communities) within 30 days p.i. the second injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Twenty-eight days p.i.of the 2nd vaccination dose, conduct HFMD case surveillance on all&#xD;
           participants in the vaccine and control groups for a follow-up period of up to 14 months&#xD;
           through the database of Notifiable Infectious Diseases Network in Hubei, and detect EV71&#xD;
           in associated feces or anal swab specimens that are collected at hospitals or Community&#xD;
           Healthcare Service Centers by real-time PCR (RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary statistical analysis will be to calculate the vaccine effectiveness against&#xD;
      EV71-associated HFMD, and to compare incidence density of EV71-associated HFMD between&#xD;
      vaccine group and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will be to calculate the vaccine effectiveness against EV71-associated&#xD;
      severe HFMD and EV71-associated hospitalized HFMD, and to describe adverse events in the&#xD;
      vaccine recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training Investigators: Administrative and technical personnel at all levels in study&#xD;
           areas are required to participate in training on the study objectives, enrollment&#xD;
           procedures, follow-up requirement, data collection, quality control measures, sample&#xD;
           handling and transport, and all other operations involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supervision and Monitoring: Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical&#xD;
           Science (IMBCAMS) and the Hubei province Center for Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC )&#xD;
           will supervise and monitor vaccination clinic during the implementation period according&#xD;
           to the progress of study; and the Xiangyang City Center for Control and Prevention will&#xD;
           supervise and monitor each vaccination clinic on selected appointment days. The focus of&#xD;
           supervision and monitoring will be to observe whether the vaccination clinics strictly&#xD;
           follow protocols and procedures and any problems found can be quickly resolved with&#xD;
           timely feedback. Any serious and consistent problems will be reported to the higher&#xD;
           level, so that corrections can be made timely.&#xD;
