      This study is the second phase of a trial examining decision making about vaccines. For this&#xD;
      phase of this study, the researchers will conduct a 3-arm randomized trial to compare the&#xD;
      current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) human papillomavirus (HPV) message,&#xD;
      a new cervical cancer focused message developed by the study team, and a non-vaccine related&#xD;
      control passage among parents of adolescent females. The goal of the trial will be to&#xD;
      determine if the new cervical cancer framed message has an increased impact on intent to have&#xD;
      daughters receive the HPV vaccine over the trial period as compared to the current CDC&#xD;
      message used in the field. Additionally, the researchers will examine the impact both the CDC&#xD;
      message and the new message individually have on intent to vaccinate when compared to the&#xD;
      non-vaccine related control message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's vaccine beliefs and intent to vaccinate will be assessed through an online&#xD;
      survey at baseline. Two weeks later, participants will be randomized to view one of the three&#xD;
      messages: the current CDC message, the cervical cancer framed message, or a non-vaccine&#xD;
      related control message. Immediately afterwards, vaccine beliefs and intent to vaccinate will&#xD;
      be assessed to determine the impact of the message.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the&#xD;
      United States. Most HPV infections are asymptomatic and clear on their own within 2 years but&#xD;
      persistent infections can lead to diseases, including several cancers. Cervical cancer is the&#xD;
      most common cancer caused by HPV infection, and virtually all cervical cancers can be&#xD;
      attributed to HPV infection. There is no cure for HPV, but HPV can be prevented through&#xD;
      vaccination. Current recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&#xD;
      (ACIP) state that the HPV vaccine may be given starting at 11-12 years of age for boys and&#xD;
      girls, through age 26. Despite the safety and efficacy of this vaccine, the coverage among&#xD;
      adolescents aged 11-17 years old remains low. Attaining high vaccination rates among&#xD;
      adolescents is essential to decreasing the burden of disease due to cervical cancer, and&#xD;
      other cancers caused by HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental decision to vaccinate their children, specifically with the HPV vaccine, can be tied&#xD;
      to multiple constructs of the Health Belief Model. These include perceived susceptibility of&#xD;
      HPV infection (is my child at risk of infection), perceived benefit, and perceived severity&#xD;
      (of disease, and of vaccine related adverse events). This would suggest that messaging&#xD;
      surrounding the HPV vaccination should be highly salient within these constructs. The current&#xD;
      message tied to the HPV vaccine presented by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has a&#xD;
      focus on HPV as an infection and is clinical in nature. In a randomized trial, parents given&#xD;
      information about HPV were no more likely to be accepting of an HPV vaccine and no more&#xD;
      likely to get their child vaccinated. Based on this literature, the researchers hypothesize&#xD;
      that reframing the message to promote HPV vaccination as a means of protection against&#xD;
      cervical cancer will impact intent to vaccinate among parents of adolescent females (aged&#xD;
      11-17 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of this study the researchers assessed how appealing to different moral&#xD;
      foundations impacted attitudes towards vaccination and intent to vaccinate. For this phase of&#xD;
      this study, the researchers will conduct a 3-arm randomized trial to compare the current CDC&#xD;
      HPV, a cervical cancer focused message developed by the study team, and a non-vaccine related&#xD;
      control passage among parents of adolescent females. The goal of the trial will be to&#xD;
      determine if the new cervical cancer framed message has an increased impact on intent to have&#xD;
      daughters receive the HPV vaccine over the trial period as compared to the current CDC&#xD;
      message. Additionally, the researchers will examine the impact both the CDC message and the&#xD;
      new message have on intent to vaccinate when compared to the non-vaccine related control&#xD;
      message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's vaccine beliefs and intent to vaccinate will be assessed through an online&#xD;
      survey at baseline. Two weeks later, participants will be randomized to view one of the three&#xD;
      messages: the current CDC message, the cervical cancer framed message, or a non-vaccine&#xD;
      related control message. Immediately afterwards, vaccine beliefs and intent to vaccinate will&#xD;
      be assessed to determine the impact of the message.&#xD;
