      This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of maintenance therapy with continuous&#xD;
      bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) compared to maintenance therapy that&#xD;
      alternates VRD with Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Elo RD) every eight weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past studies conducted at the Myeloma Institute have shown that many patients with low-risk&#xD;
      disease (as determined by gene array studies - studies that look at specific genes using&#xD;
      special equipment) respond very well to treatment. However, about 15% of low-risk patients&#xD;
      still relapse during the first three years of treatment, which means that better treatments&#xD;
      are still needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of maintenance therapy with continuous&#xD;
      bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) compared to maintenance therapy that&#xD;
      alternates VRD with Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Elo RD) every eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elotuzumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone are all approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. VRD is the standard maintenance regimen&#xD;
      prescribed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Myeloma Institute for&#xD;
      patients with low risk disease. The investigators want to learn if alternating VRD with Elo&#xD;
      RD during maintenance therapy will result in better outcomes.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
                  of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, post-vasectomy) must agree to one of&#xD;

          -  Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has not&#xD;
             received treatment for one year prior to enrollment. Other cancers will be acceptable&#xD;
             if the patient's life expectancy exceeds five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human&#xD;
             proteins or any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the&#xD;
