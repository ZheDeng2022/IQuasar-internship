  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patient education, the amount of information that is not proper with the individual&#xD;
      patient, such as too much or too little, can increase anxiety to patient. Needs-based patient&#xD;
      education has been developed to determine the proper amount of information and provide the&#xD;
      education based on patient needs. This study aims to compare needs-based patient education to&#xD;
      traditional patient education in how they affect preoperative anxiety and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety can compromise surgical outcome. Anxiety increases serum cortisol,&#xD;
      adrenaline, and noradrenaline. This results in postoperative pain, increased postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic requirements, prolonged hospital stay and patient dissatisfaction. However, this&#xD;
      anxiety can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education has been widely used to reduce operative anxiety; however, some patients&#xD;
      have more anxiety after patient education. This incident could be explained by different&#xD;
      individual's coping styles that patients use to deal with their anxiety. There are four major&#xD;
      coping style: vigilant, avoidant, fluctuating, and flexible. Vigilant coper desires extended&#xD;
      information to reduce anxiety. Avoidant coper desires minimal amount of information as too&#xD;
      much will cause anxiety. Fluctuating coper generally desires small amount of information but&#xD;
      desires greater detail in certain area. Flexible coper is able to adapt to whatever&#xD;
      information available. Thus, if patient education with extended information is given to&#xD;
      patients with avoidant coping style, they will have more anxiety. One study found that&#xD;
      avoidant coping style is 31% of surgical patients in the study population. This is also&#xD;
      supported by another study that one-third of patients reported to be worried after receiving&#xD;
      an informative booklet. Therefore, to be able to deal with all types of coping style, patient&#xD;
      education with different levels of information regarding patient needs is proposed to be&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Needs-based patient education has become more promising with increased supporting literature.&#xD;
      It uses the principle of shared decision making, which is the pinnacle of patient-centered&#xD;
      care. Needs-based patient education is also consistent with adult learning theory, which&#xD;
      learning should be matched with different individual background and needs. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial was conducted to compare needs-based patient education with traditional&#xD;
      patient education in rheumatoid arthritis and found a superior result. However, there is&#xD;
      still lack of evidence in using needs-based patient education in surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates needs-based patient education in reducing preoperative anxiety. To&#xD;
      assess patient needs, a questionnaire is used as a tool. After receiving completed&#xD;
      questionnaire, the physician provides information based on patient needs. Not only patients&#xD;
      will benefit from this questionnaire but also physicians. The questionnaire enables physician&#xD;
      to cut unnecessary information and pay more attention to the fact that patients need. Less&#xD;
      information needed is less time spent in patient education session. As the most important&#xD;
      reason why patient education is omitted is shortness of time. This needs-based patient&#xD;
      education can contribute tremendously to the way we educate surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives This study aims to compare needs-based patient education to traditional patient&#xD;
      education in how they affect preoperative anxiety, patient satisfaction, and time&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
