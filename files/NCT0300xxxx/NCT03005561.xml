  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last 50 years the use of growth hormone (rhGH, somatropin) has become commonly to&#xD;
      treat problems such as GH deficiency, chronic renal failure and Turner syndrome and&#xD;
      Prader-Willi. Giving the hormone in childhood and adolescence is designed to accelerate&#xD;
      growth to close the gap in the average population and reach a final height is normal, while&#xD;
      minimizing risks and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noncompliance to treatment with GH is common; Other estimates are that one third to one half&#xD;
      of patients do not comply with the provisions as require. This may result in linear growth&#xD;
      depreciation, unnecessary diagnostic tests, unnecessary change of dosage and treatment and&#xD;
      higher costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been devoted to locating factors make it difficult to adhere to their&#xD;
      chronic diseases in children, including conditions that require treatment with GH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is the primary cause for difficulties. In recent decades, many resources were devoted to&#xD;
      research and development of ways of dealing with pain in all aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to implement all of the information collected, appropriate interventions medium&#xD;
      should be found; In this study we intend to use the method of playback. Playback define that&#xD;
      improvisation as a theater facilitator asks the audience to share moments, feelings and&#xD;
      stories of his daily life, and a group of actors improvise their stories in front of the&#xD;
      stage as a kind of &quot;play-back&quot;. Unlike hobbies such as sports or singing, the method allows&#xD;
      not only to unload the tensions but also communication and collaboration. It is very&#xD;
      reminiscent of psychodrama, but unlike, is not considered a therapeutic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention of two playback meetings during the year will uncover the difficulties and&#xD;
      engage ways of dealing with pain. That will reduce the difficulties caused by GH injections&#xD;
      and improve compliance to treatment.&#xD;

      In the last 50 years the use of growth hormone (rhGH, somatropin) has become commonly to&#xD;

      depreciation, unnecessary diagnostic tests, unnecessary change of dosage and treatment and&#xD;
      higher costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GH therapy in all non-yielding satisfactory results, it is recommended first of all to&#xD;
      consider noncompliance before turning to look for other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been devoted to locating factors make it difficult to adhere to their&#xD;
      chronic diseases in children, including conditions that require treatment with GH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is the primary cause for difficulties. Despite the pain seems fairly simple phenomenon,&#xD;
      it is actually very complex. Untreated pain is manifested prominently course and immediate&#xD;
      distress to the child and the parent, but it has other deep effects; It seems that pain not&#xD;
      receiving treatment at early stages in children's lives adversely affects the central nervous&#xD;
      system development. This assumption is supported by various studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is a force in shaping behavior; In recent decades, many resources were devoted to&#xD;
      research and development of ways of dealing with pain in all aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to implement all of the information collected, appropriate interventions medium&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention of two playback meetings during the year will uncover the difficulties and&#xD;
      engage ways of dealing with pain. That will reduce the difficulties caused by GH injections&#xD;
      and improve compliance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This is a pilot study in with a total of 200 participants treated with GH therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention group - 100 participants that will be participating in the Play Back&#xD;
           meetings.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Patients who completed growth, closed epiphysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected in the study will be typed in encoder. The list that links the&#xD;
      subject and the code given to them will be kept in the ISF, that will be be accessible only&#xD;
      to the study team. The questionnaires of the participants will be identified through a&#xD;
      personal code given to each of the participants and will be stored in a dedicated research&#xD;
      folder in the Endocrinology and diabetes at Soroka Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit no.1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parents and patient will sign the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Height and Weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient / parent will answer questionnaires regarding their compliance to GH treatment,&#xD;
           their difficulties and the way the deal with pain - if patient is below age of 8, his&#xD;
           parent will complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. IGF-1 blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients and parents will be guided to bring their empty ampoules for the next study&#xD;
           visit and also to the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients that randomized to the intervention group will meet the Play Back team for the&#xD;
           first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit no.2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take place one month after the first visit. Patients that randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group will meet the Play Back team for the first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meeting will be divided for 2 age groups: the first for 7-9 years old participants, and&#xD;
      the second one for 10-12 years old participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit no.3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take place 3 months after the first visit. Patients that randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group will meet the Play Back team for the second session.&#xD;

      Visit no.4:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. IGF-1 blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient / parent will answer questionnaires regarding their compliance to GH treatment,&#xD;
           their difficulties and the way the deal with pain - if patient is below age of 8, his&#xD;
           parent will complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Drug accountability. System analysis and processing results Descriptive statistics&#xD;
           quantitative variables (such as age)that distribute normally are shown as averages ± SD.&#xD;
           Quantitative variables that do not show normal distribution (the number of days of&#xD;
           hospitalization) will be presented as median values between quarterly domain.&#xD;
           Categorical variables (such as gender) will be out of proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analyzes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of different variables between groups will be carried out according to the&#xD;
      following rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables (such as age)that distribute normally will be compared using the t&#xD;
      test for independent samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables that do not show normal distribution as the number of days of hospitalization&#xD;
      between the two groups will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables&#xD;
      such as sex, will be compared using the chi-squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of correlations between different variables will be using Pearson and Spearman&#xD;
      correlations based on the distribution and type of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight and height data IGFI will be compared between subgroups according to a change in HtSDS&#xD;
      since the start of growth hormone therapy to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate model Checking the compliance level logistic regression model was constructed&#xD;
      multivariate where the dependent variable will be high responsiveness and low responsiveness&#xD;
      dichotomous variable (if the patient has more than 80% response variable will receive the 1&#xD;
      or not (less than 80%) then receives a value of 0). Independent variables will be different&#xD;
      risk factors which have passed the initial data analysis phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests of significance level will alpha = 0.05 two-sided unless stated&#xD;
      otherwise. All pv values shall be rounded to two decimal places.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed in Microsoft SPSS version 22.&#xD;
