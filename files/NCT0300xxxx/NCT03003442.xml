    <textblock>
      Investigation of the acute and chronic effects of Supradyn® Energy 3RDA on subjective ratings&#xD;
      of 'fatigue/stress', substrate metabolism and blood biomarkers of recovery, as a consequence&#xD;
      of exercise and metabolically demanding cognitive tasks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplementation with vitamins and minerals has been shown to enhance energy production,&#xD;
      metabolism, and mood state. It is thought that they may also aid recovery from challenging&#xD;
      physical and psychological tasks following both acute and chronic supplementation. The&#xD;
      present study will investigate the effects of a multivitamin/mineral supplement (Supradyn®&#xD;
      Energy 3RDA) following a single intake and following daily intake for 4-weeks on subjective&#xD;
      ratings of 'fatigue/stress', metabolism and blood biomarkers of cell damage following both&#xD;
      exercise and demanding cognitive tasks, in healthy young male and female volunteers.&#xD;
