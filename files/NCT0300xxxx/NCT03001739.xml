      Aortic dissection (AD) aneurysm is a common catastrophic aortic disease in clinical setting.&#xD;
      Conservative therapy of heart rate and blood pressure control in the acute phase is the&#xD;
      essential treatment as guidelines recommended. Nevertheless, there is no unanimous optimal&#xD;
      target for blood pressure in patients with AD so far. The American Heart Association and the&#xD;
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend the blood pressure should be controlled to lower&#xD;
      than 140/90mmHg, while for patients with diabetes or chronic renal failure, the blood&#xD;
      pressure target should be no less than 130/80 mmHg. Recently, the Japanese Circulation&#xD;
      Society recommended that the blood pressure should be controlled to no less than 130mmHg.&#xD;
      However, there was few large-scale, randomized, controlled studies reported on the effect of&#xD;
      different blood pressure control levels on the prognosis of patients with AD. Hence, the&#xD;
      intensive control of blood pressure to &lt;120 mmHg, compared to &lt;140 mmHg, may improve the&#xD;
      patients' outcome. Thus, in this study, the effect of intensive blood pressure control&#xD;
      (&lt;120mmHg) with conventional blood pressure control (&lt;140mmHg) on the prognosis of ABAD&#xD;
      patients will be compared, and to identify the therapeutic efficacy of intensive blood&#xD;
      pressure control on the ABAD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection (AD) aneurysm is a common catastrophic aortic disease in clinical setting.&#xD;
      In the U.S., the prevalence is approximate 2.9-3.5 cases/100000 persons per year, with recent&#xD;
      evidence showing an increasing incidence of up to 14 cases per 100000 patients per year. AD&#xD;
      aneurysm can be classified into the types of Stanford A and B based on whether the ascending&#xD;
      aorta was being involved. For acute type B aortic dissection (ABAD), which is generally&#xD;
      accounted for one thirds of all aortic dissection and is especially more common among Chinese&#xD;
      due to the suboptimal control of blood pressure. Optimal treatment of ABAD from symptom onset&#xD;
      remains uncertain. Conservative therapy of heart rate and blood pressure control in the acute&#xD;
      phase is the essential treatment for patient without serious complications such as concurrent&#xD;
      mesenteric artery or lower limb arterial embolism. The long-term survival of ABAD is still&#xD;
      low though great improved in medication optimization and surgical repair technique in the&#xD;
      past decades. It was reported that 5-year and 10-year survival rates for ABAD were 60% and&#xD;
      35% respectively. As the development of minimally invasive techniques in recent years, the&#xD;
      endovascular repair procedure has become a routine procedure in the treatment of patient with&#xD;
      ABAD, this rendered an improved prognosis with a 5-year survival rate close to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension is well known as the most common cause for AD. The statistics from International&#xD;
      Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) demonstrated that 72.1% of AD patients had a&#xD;
      history of hypertension. The hypertension may aggravate hematoma expansion and results in&#xD;
      serious consequences. Therefore, effectively blood pressure control may alleviate the severe&#xD;
      pain caused by acute AD and lessen the progression of arterial dissection. The control of&#xD;
      hypertension is the primary treatment for acute aortic dissection, and should be maintained&#xD;
      throughout the entire treatment. Currently, all guidelines recommended to decline the&#xD;
      transaortic pressure via controlling the heart rate and blood pressure for AD patient in&#xD;
      acute phase. Theoretically, to control the blood pressure to the minimal level meeting the&#xD;
      sufficient end-organ perfusion can decrease the risk of vessel rupture as much as possible.&#xD;
      Whereas, too much low blood pressure target may increase the mortality of patients. Powell&#xD;
      and his colleague found when the minimum blood pressure increased by 10mmHg (vs. &lt;70 mmHg,&#xD;
      maximal to 120 mmHg) for AD patients, the risk of death decreased by 12% (OR = 0.88, P&#xD;
      &lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is no unanimous optimal target for blood pressure in patients with AD so&#xD;
      far. The American Heart Association and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend the&#xD;
      blood pressure should be controlled to lower than 140/90mmHg, while for patients with&#xD;
      diabetes or chronic renal failure, the blood pressure target should be no less than 130/80&#xD;
      mmHg. Recently, the Japanese Circulation Society recommended that the blood pressure should&#xD;
      be controlled to no less than 130mmHg. Hence, the intensive control of blood pressure to &lt;120&#xD;
      mmHg, compared to &lt;140 mmHg, may improve the patients' outcome. Thus, in this study, the&#xD;
      effect of intensive blood pressure control (&lt;120mmHg) with conventional blood pressure&#xD;
      control (&lt;140mmHg) on the prognosis of ABAD patients will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design and setting The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      will recruit a maximal of 360 patients in eight tertiary Chinese hospitals over 2 years. All&#xD;
      patients with new diagnosed ABAD in the participating hospitals will be screened for&#xD;
      potential eligibility. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the hospitals&#xD;
      (20160920-9). Written informed consents will be signed by the patients or their legally&#xD;
      authorized representatives. The study was registered in the website of ClinicalTrial.gov .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites and patients Doctors from eight hospitals attended the kick-off meeting held in&#xD;
      Courtyard Marriott, Hangzhou, March 19th, 2016, and discussed the research protocol and&#xD;
      details. The amended research protocol was passed according to revised discussion results and&#xD;
      the agreement of all participating units. The methods of blood pressure measurement and the&#xD;
      apparatus used are unified. All hospitals will adopt similar non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring method and unified monitoring frequency to observe whether the blood pressure is&#xD;
      controlled within the target range in two groups. Likewise, the blood pressure target after&#xD;
      discharge was maintained at the same levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with AD from the participating hospitals who conform to the following inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be randomized. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were shown in&#xD;
      other parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Blocked randomization was adopted and the intensive and conventional blood&#xD;
      pressure control treatments were allocated at random in a ratio of 1:1 in blocks of sizes of&#xD;
      4,6,8, and 10 to 360 subjects. The study is an open label trial. After investigators in each&#xD;
      participating centers screened the potential patients within 4 hours after acute onset, a&#xD;
      number from a pre-allocated envelope will be gotten and which denotes which group the patient&#xD;
      will be allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments All the patients were admitted to ICU or general wards at the discretion of&#xD;
      doctors. Based on the guidelines of aortic management, all patients received analgesic&#xD;
      therapy and standard control of heart rate and blood pressure treatments. Intravenous esmolol&#xD;
      was used for continuous control of heart rates. Choice of intravenous antihypertensive agents&#xD;
      was at the discretion of the in charge physicians. After the stabilization of the situation,&#xD;
      the intravenous medications were shifted to the oral treatments. The target blood pressure&#xD;
      for the intensive and conventional groups were &lt;140mmHg and &lt;120mmHg respectively. For most&#xD;
      patients, they will undergo an endovascular treatment approximate two weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints The primary outcome is a composite in-hospital adverse outcome, including&#xD;
      death, permanent paraplegia or semi- paralysis during the hospitalization, and renal failure&#xD;
      requiring hemodialysis at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes include the mortality in 6-month and 1-year, ICU length of stay, total&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, postoperative renal injury, and re- intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Research coordinators of individual participating hospital will collect the&#xD;
      required data on the case report form. However, the data was de-named and special security&#xD;
      code was required to access the data. To facilitate the communications between investigators,&#xD;
      the case report form was written in Chinese. The primary research institute is responsible&#xD;
      for collecting and checking the data of all centers; and will contact the co-investigators in&#xD;
      various centers for checking or revising should they had any question. The primary research&#xD;
      institute has established an independent study quality control group to implement the&#xD;
      disposal plan for all unexpected circumstances that may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and interim analysis The primary outcome was a composite in-hospital&#xD;
      adverse outcome, including the death, stroke, permanent paraplegia or semi- paralysis during&#xD;
      the hospitalization, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis at discharge. Bashir et al&#xD;
      reported that the incidence of comprehensive nosocomial severe prognostic adverse events of&#xD;
      ABAD was 45.2%. Assume that the incidence of severe prognosis adverse event in comprehensive&#xD;
      hospital after intensive blood pressure control could be reduced to 30%, so a total of 322&#xD;
      subjects enrolled in the study are sufficient to find the difference statistically between&#xD;
      two groups through the appropriate software calculation under the power of 0.8 and at the&#xD;
      two-side test with α = 0.05. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, it is proposed to include 360&#xD;
      cases totally into the study. A formal interim analysis was conducted halfway during study&#xD;
      enrollment. The overall type I error was controlled using an O'Brien-Fleming spending&#xD;
      function, with a final significance level of 0.05 for the primary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive data were reported as either mean ± SD, median&#xD;
      (interquartile range) or number and percentage. With respect to the differences between two&#xD;
      groups, categorical variables were compared using chi-square analysis. Continuous variables&#xD;
      were compared using Independent Sample T test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test for non-normally distributed data. For survival analyses, Kaplan-Meier estimates were&#xD;
      generated to assess differences between groups using the log-rank test, and expressed the&#xD;
      data as cumulative mortality curves. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 16.0&#xD;
      (Chicago, Ill, USA) and PASS 11.0. Statistical significance was defined as a P value &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion ABAD comprises approximately 30% of all aortic dissection cases. In contrast with&#xD;
      type A aortic dissection, patients with type B dissection are tend to be older, have higher&#xD;
      rates of atherosclerosis. Initial goals for acute aortic dissection management are directed&#xD;
      at control of blood pressure and heart rate, which subsequently limiting propagation of the&#xD;
      false lumen by controlling aortic shear stress. Whilst medical management has demonstrated an&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality rate less than 10%, post-discharge the acute type B aortic disease&#xD;
      continues to evolve eventually resulting in complicated type B disease. Moreover, complicated&#xD;
      acute type B aortic dissection shows even more striking mortality as high as 30%,&#xD;
      particularly in the elderly. Poor control of blood pressure was believed to be one of the&#xD;
      main reasons for the progress of the type B aortic dissection into complications or even the&#xD;
      laceration extended to the ascending aorta. Dalsart and colleague demonstrated that a&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure more than 130 mmHg was associated with a bigger aortic enlargement in&#xD;
      type B aortic dissection (P=0.02) . In another study of 25 years follow-up in 252 patients&#xD;
      who received repair of acute type A aortic dissection, patients who maintained a systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure &lt;120 mm Hg had improved freedom from reoperation, compared to those target&#xD;
      blood pressure 120-140 mm Hg or &gt;140 mm Hg. Hence, most guidelines recommended a reasonable&#xD;
      initial target for systolic blood pressure is between 100 and 120 mm Hg. However, this target&#xD;
      is based on the hypothesis that all the end-organs blood supply is not compromised. Data from&#xD;
      International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) has shown that approximately one&#xD;
      quarter of patients presenting with acute type B aortic dissection are followed into&#xD;
      complicated category, including malperfusion of spinal arteries leading to paresis, and&#xD;
      paraplegia or malperfusion of visceral arteries leading to abdominal pain. Thus, how to&#xD;
      balance the decrease of blood pressure to the lowest amount and maintain adequate end-organ&#xD;
      perfusion is a challenge. Given vast majority patients with type B aortic dissection had a&#xD;
      history of hypertension, a too lower target of blood pressure may comprise the cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion or complicated organ perfusion, which consequently caused stroke or other morbidity&#xD;
      such as ischemic intestinal necrosis. On the other hand, a much strict blood pressure target&#xD;
      and sometimes constrain on the patients daily activities may aggravate patients' worry, which&#xD;
      inversely increased increase the blood pressure. Unfortunately, there is no empirical data or&#xD;
      trials to guide the optimal blood pressure target setting for various patients. Hence, the&#xD;
      study was designed to bridge the gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the investigators believe that the study will provide new insight into the of&#xD;
      blood pressure management of patients of acute Type B aortic dissection and subsequently&#xD;
      improve the outcomes.&#xD;
