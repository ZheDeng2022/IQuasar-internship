      Understanding Daily Fluctuations in Self-Regulation, also known as the Digital Marshmallow&#xD;
      Test (DMT), is a collaboration by Northwell Health, Cornell Tech, and Sage Bionetworks.&#xD;
      Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, this is a pioneering study to advance the&#xD;
      science in identifying and helping individuals who act on short-term temptations, despite&#xD;
      long-term consequences. Using Apple's ResearchKit(™) and Android's ResearchStack&#xD;
      applications, the Digital Marshmallow Test will leverage the powerful capabilities of the&#xD;
      smartphone to examine impulsivity using a range of game-like tasks and sensor capabilities&#xD;
      within the mobile phone. Across studies, more impulsive individuals are significantly more&#xD;
      likely to suffer from obesity, Type II Diabetes, substance abuse, gambling problems, suicidal&#xD;
      behaviors, and increased criminality among many other problems. Early self-report studies&#xD;
      reveal a relationship between the inability to delay gratification and different patterns of&#xD;
      mobile phone use. This will be the first study to develop non-invasive mobile methods to&#xD;
      identify and help those at greatest risk for impulsive responding before serious problems&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor self-regulation and impulsivity are underlying symptoms of numerous mental health&#xD;
      problems such as obesity, substance abuse, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),&#xD;
      gambling, binge eating, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and suicidal&#xD;
      behaviors. This makes it one of the most important personal and public health intervention&#xD;
      targets. The classic Marshmallow Test done by Mischel and colleagues determined that the&#xD;
      inability to delay gratification in childhood was predictive of lower Scholastic Aptitude&#xD;
      Test (SAT) scores and higher BMI in adulthood. However, assessments of impulsivity and poor&#xD;
      self-regulation are rarely included in routine medical care because of time and financial&#xD;
      constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile phone has changed our ability to assess and intervene with individuals remotely,&#xD;
      providing an avenue for ambulatory diagnostic testing and just-in-time adaptive interventions&#xD;
      that can be accessed by billions of people. Newer methods of assessment using the mobile&#xD;
      phone, including Apple's ResearchKit, provide the opportunity for powerful assessments of&#xD;
      impulsivity beyond simple self-report. To date, there have been no measures of impulsivity&#xD;
      integrated into ResearchKit or any mobile application, aside from the beta version that the&#xD;
      investigators recently built, nor has the research community explored the possibilities of&#xD;
      passive impulsivity assessment using mobile analytics embedded in all phones. There is&#xD;
      preliminary evidence that mobile analytics, such as latency to respond to a text, can predict&#xD;
      personality traits associated with impulsivity such as extroversion and neuroticism, and&#xD;
      self-report studies reveal that there is a direct relationship between the inability to delay&#xD;
      gratification and different patterns of mobile phone use. These studies highlight potential&#xD;
      power of mobile phenotyping as a ubiquitous measure of health determinants in billions of&#xD;
      people by using passive data that doesn't require user participation. However, foundational&#xD;
      research is needed to validate assessments, build adaptive tools, and include individual&#xD;
      differences self-regulation capacity as well as interventions to improve regulation in the&#xD;
      discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test a new diagnostic self-regulation mobile assessment tool&#xD;
      app. The application built in Apple's ResearchKit(™) and Android's ResearchStack(™) includes&#xD;
      a self-report assessment, three continuous performance tasks, and passive data collection&#xD;
      developed for in-person use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is that by differentiating between high and low impulsive people using mobile&#xD;
      assessment tools, the investigators identify those at greatest risk for self-regulation&#xD;
      problems. Individuals higher in impulsivity have less self-control when faced with short-term&#xD;
      temptations regardless of their knowledge of the consequences of these choices. This would be&#xD;
      the first step in developing a completely remote measurement tool for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this exploratory project is to develop and validate a mobile application&#xD;
      to test impulsivity remotely, and test how self-report indicators of impulsivity via mobile&#xD;
      assessment correlate with objective impulsivity tests on the mobile phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is an exploratory study, the investigators are looking at how often participants&#xD;
      use the mobile app in the real-world and how the tasks perform over time once they leave the&#xD;
      laboratory. In addition, the investigators will test the validity of the measures over time.&#xD;
