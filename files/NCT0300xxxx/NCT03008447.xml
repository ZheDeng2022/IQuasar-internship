  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E2006-A001-108 is a 4-period crossover study designed to demonstrate that the mean change&#xD;
      from baseline in postural stability (worsening) when participants are awakened at&#xD;
      approximately 4 hours postdose is significantly less after lemborexant than after zolpidem&#xD;
      tartrate extended release following a single-dose administration at bedtime.&#xD;
