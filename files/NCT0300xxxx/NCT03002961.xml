    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open-label, single ascending dose study to enroll opioid dependent&#xD;
      treatment-seeking subjects. Subjects to be enrolled into 3 cohorts receiving low, medium and&#xD;
      high doses of depot buprenorphine. A fourth cohort will be enrolled to evaluate the PK of&#xD;
      RBP-6000 after receiving suboxone tablets for 7 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will undergo screening period of up to 7 days. Eligible subjects in Cohorts 1-3&#xD;
      will receive RBP-6000 doses on at the conclusion of screening. Subjects in Cohort 4 will&#xD;
      receive sublingual (SL) Suboxone for 7 days prior to receiving an injection of RBP-6000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all cohorts, subjects will be admitted to the clinic 2 days prior to beginning any&#xD;
      dosing, and will remain in the clinic through Day 21. Blood collection for hematology,&#xD;
      chemistry and serology analysis will be drawn at screening, and intermittently for safety&#xD;
      assessments during the study period. Subjects in Cohorts 1-3 will have a PK sample collected&#xD;
      pre-dose and serial PK collection post-dosing. Subjects in Cohort 4 will have daily PK&#xD;
      collections while admitted during Suboxone dosing and serially after RBP-6000 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic for PK sample collection through Day 140 or until&#xD;
      buprenorphine concentrations fall below 100 pg/mL. Subjects will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      safety assessments through Day 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects experiencing signs and symptoms of withdrawal prior to RBP-6000 during the&#xD;
      residential phase may receive non-opioid rescue medications. Subjects who experience signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of withdrawal may receive hydromorphone beginning on Day 11 if necessary.&#xD;
      Methadone dosing can begin, if clinically indicated, on Day 16 only for subjects who have not&#xD;
      been administered hydromorphone. Subjects will not be allowed to use buprenorphine at any&#xD;
      time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also receive psychosocial and behavioral counseling as specified by the PI. The&#xD;
      End of Study visit will occur 1 week after Day 84 or 1 week after the monthly follow-up&#xD;
      visits after Day 84, given a subject's buprenorphine plasma concentration has fallen below&#xD;
      100 pg/mL. For subjects with plasma concentrations of buprenorphine above 100 pg/mL at Day&#xD;
      140, Day 150 will be the End of Study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be enrolled into the next cohort until safety data for at least the first 6&#xD;
      subjects has been reviewed.&#xD;
