  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1:1 randomized double-blind Placebo-controlled moncenter Phase IV study to&#xD;
      investigate whether a successful interferon-free treatment of HCV-infection with&#xD;
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) in combination with dasabuvir (DSV) improves&#xD;
      the patients' attention ability as compared to placebo as measured with the Att Test Sum&#xD;
      Score change from baseline to week 12. A total of 30 patients with non-cirrhotic genotype 1b&#xD;
      HCV infection will be randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks verum followed by 12 weeks&#xD;
      Placebo (arm A) versus 12 weeks Placebo followed by 12 weeks verum (arm B). Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for 48 weeks.&#xD;

             assessment or compliance with the protocol; subjects currently under evaluation for a&#xD;
             potentially clinically-significant illness (other than HCV) are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Positive result of a urine drug screen at the Screening Visit for opiates,&#xD;
             barbiturates, amphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepines, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of uncontrolled seizures, cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin), or&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes, as defined by a hemoglobin A1C level &gt; 8.0% or other systemic&#xD;
             diseases that affect directly the CNS and brain metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Gastrointestinal disorder or post operative condition that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption of the study drug (for example, gastric bypass or severe ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Chronic liver disease of a non-HCV etiology (e.g., hemochromatosis, autoimmune&#xD;
             hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, Wilson's disease, α1 antitrypsin deficiency,&#xD;
             cholangitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Difficulty with blood collection and/or poor venous access for the purposes of&#xD;
             phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Clinical hepatic decompensation (i.e., clinical ascites, encephalopathy or variceal&#xD;
             hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Significant pulmonary disease or significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or hepatotoxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Contraindications for MRI study&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Screening laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 10 × upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 10 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (using CKD-EPI equal) &lt; 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Albumin &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR &gt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &lt; LLN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &lt; 90,000 cells per mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HCV RNA levels that are above the upper level of assay quantification&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Screening ECG with clinically significant abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Consideration by the Investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable&#xD;
             candidate to receive the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Donation or loss of more than 400 ml blood within 2 months prior to Baseline/Day 1&#xD;
