    <description>The MADRS was a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicated more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more severe depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

    <description>HAM-D subscales were: Core, symptoms: depressed mood (DM), feelings of guilt (FG), suicide, work and activities (WA), and retardation (RE); Anxiety, symptoms: anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (SS) (gastrointestinal and general), hypochondriasis, and loss of weight; Bech-6, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, anxiety psychic (AP), and SS general; and Maier, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, agitation, and AP. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. Subscale scores were calculated as sum of individual rating scores related to each subscale, divided by total possible score within subscale, multiplied by 100, and rounded to a whole number. Therefore, subscale scores would be within range of 0-100 and might be larger than total score. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression.

    <description>The 14-item HAM-A was used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety. Each of the 14 items was defined by a series of symptoms, and measured both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM-A was calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where 0-13=Normal, 14-17 Mild Anxiety, 18-24 Moderate Anxiety, &gt;=25 Severe Anxiety, per the Psych Congress Network. The HAM-A total score was calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicated less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicated more anxiety.

    <description>The CGI-I item employed a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a CGI-I global improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS was a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicated more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more severe depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-D Subscale Scores at All Time Points - Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D subscales were: Core, symptoms: depressed mood (DM), feelings of guilt (FG), suicide, work and activities (WA), and retardation (RE); Anxiety, symptoms: anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (SS) (gastrointestinal and general), hypochondriasis, and loss of weight; Bech-6, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, anxiety psychic (AP), and SS general; and Maier, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, agitation, and AP. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. Subscale scores were calculated as sum of individual rating scores related to each subscale, divided by total possible score within subscale, multiplied by 100, and rounded to a whole number. Therefore, subscale scores would be within range of 0-100 and might be larger than total score. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of study.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (CFB) in HAM-D Individual Item Scores at All Time Points - Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D comprised individual ratings of the following symptoms scored in a range of 0 to 2: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (GI and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following symptoms were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-A Total Score at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item HAM-A was used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety. Each of the 14 items was defined by a series of symptoms, and measured both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM-A was calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where 0-13=Normal, 14-17 Mild Anxiety, 18-24 Moderate Anxiety, &gt;=25 Severe Anxiety, per the Psych Congress Network. The HAM-A total score was calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicated less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicated more anxiety. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CGI-I Response - Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 2, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I item employed a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study. Data is reported for participants who had CGI-I response.</description>

          <title>17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score - Part B</title>
          <description>The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression.</description>
          <population>The efficacy set included all participants who were randomized and received at least one dose of the double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation in Part B.</population>

        <description>The C-SSRS scale consisted of a baseline evaluation (at screening) that assessed the lifetime experience of participants with suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior and a postbaseline evaluation that focused on suicidality since the last study visit. The C-SSRS included &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;' responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe). The C-SSRS SI items involved wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active SI with any methods, active SI with some intent and active SI with specific plan. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) Score at Day 15 - Part A</title>
        <description>The SSS was participant-rated scale designed to quickly assess how alert a participant was feeling. Degrees of sleepiness and alertness were rated on a scale of one to seven, where the lowest score of 'one' indicated the participant was 'feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake' and the highest score of 'seven' indicated the participant was 'no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream-like thoughts'. A negative change from baseline indicated less sleepiness. A positive change from baseline indicated more sleepiness. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score at Day 15 - Part B</title>
        <description>The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Response of &quot;Yes&quot; to Any C-SSRS Suicidal Ideation (SI) Item - Part B</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS scale consisted of a baseline evaluation (at screening) that assessed the lifetime experience of participants with suicidal ideation and behavior and a postbaseline evaluation that focused on suicidality since the last study visit. The C-SSRS included &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;' responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe). The C-SSRS SI items involved wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active SI with any methods, active SI with some intent and active SI with specific plan. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study. SCLR = screening: lifetime recall.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HAM-D Response - Part A</title>
        <description>HAM-D response was defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score. The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study. Data is reported for participants who had HAM-D response.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HAM-D Remission - Part A</title>
        <description>HAM-D remission was defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part A</title>
        <description>The MADRS was a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicated more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more severe depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAM-D Subscale Scores at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part A</title>
        <description>HAM-D subscales were: Core, symptoms: depressed mood (DM), feelings of guilt (FG), suicide, work and activities (WA), and retardation (RE); Anxiety, symptoms: anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (SS) (gastrointestinal and general), hypochondriasis, and loss of weight; Bech-6, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, anxiety psychic (AP), and SS general; and Maier, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, agitation, and AP. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. Subscale scores were calculated as sum of individual rating scores related to each subscale, divided by total possible score within subscale, multiplied by 100, and rounded to a whole number. Therefore, subscale scores would be within range of 0-100 and might be larger than total score. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) in HAM-D Individual Item Scores at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part A</title>
        <description>The HAM-D comprised individual ratings of the following symptoms scored in a range of 0 to 2: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms [gastrointestinal (GI) and general], genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following symptoms were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) Total Score at All Time Points - Part A</title>
        <description>The 14-item HAM-A was used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety. Each of the 14 items was defined by a series of symptoms, and measured both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM-A was calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where 0-13=Normal, 14-17 Mild Anxiety, 18-24 Moderate Anxiety, &gt;=25 Severe Anxiety, per the Psych Congress Network. The HAM-A total score was calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicated less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicated more anxiety. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Response - Part A</title>
        <description>The CGI-I item employed a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a CGI-I global improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The analysis was performed in participants included in Part A of the study. Data is reported for participants who had CGI-I response.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) in the SSS Score - Part B</title>
        <description>The SSS was participant-rated scale designed to quickly assess how alert a participant was feeling. Degrees of sleepiness and alertness were rated on a scale of one to seven, where the lowest score of 'one' indicated the participant was 'feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake' and the highest score of 'seven' indicated the participant was 'no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream-like thoughts'. A negative change from baseline indicated less sleepiness. A positive change from baseline indicated more sleepiness. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study. H = Hour(s).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 17-item HAM-D Total Score at All Time Points - Part B</title>
        <description>The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HAM-D Response - Part B</title>
        <description>HAM-D response was defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score. The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study. Data is reported for participants who had HAM-D response.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HAM-D Remission - Part B</title>
        <description>HAM-D remission was defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. The HAM-D total score comprised a sum of the 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 included: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following items were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score could range from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the MADRS Total Score at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part B</title>
        <description>The MADRS was a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM-D, to be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment. Each item yielded a score of 0 to 6. The MADRS total score was calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores, which ranged from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS scores indicated more severe depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less severe depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more severe depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAM-D Subscale Scores at All Time Points - Part B</title>
        <description>HAM-D subscales were: Core, symptoms: depressed mood (DM), feelings of guilt (FG), suicide, work and activities (WA), and retardation (RE); Anxiety, symptoms: anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (SS) (gastrointestinal and general), hypochondriasis, and loss of weight; Bech-6, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, anxiety psychic (AP), and SS general; and Maier, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, agitation, and AP. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. Subscale scores were calculated as sum of individual rating scores related to each subscale, divided by total possible score within subscale, multiplied by 100, and rounded to a whole number. Therefore, subscale scores would be within range of 0-100 and might be larger than total score. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of study.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42</time_frame>
        <population>The efficacy set included all participants who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of the double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation. Number analyzed: Number of participants in efficacy set with a non-missing value at both baseline and visit within each treatment group.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in HAM-D Subscale Scores at All Time Points - Part B</title>
          <description>HAM-D subscales were: Core, symptoms: depressed mood (DM), feelings of guilt (FG), suicide, work and activities (WA), and retardation (RE); Anxiety, symptoms: anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (SS) (gastrointestinal and general), hypochondriasis, and loss of weight; Bech-6, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, anxiety psychic (AP), and SS general; and Maier, symptoms: DM, FG, WA, RE, agitation, and AP. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 2 or 0 to 4. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. Subscale scores were calculated as sum of individual rating scores related to each subscale, divided by total possible score within subscale, multiplied by 100, and rounded to a whole number. Therefore, subscale scores would be within range of 0-100 and might be larger than total score. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) in HAM-D Individual Item Scores at All Time Points - Part B</title>
        <description>The HAM-D comprised individual ratings of the following symptoms scored in a range of 0 to 2: insomnia (early, middle, late), somatic symptoms (GI and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. The following symptoms were scored in a range of 0 to 4: agitation, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. Higher scores indicated a greater degree of depression. A negative change from baseline indicated less depression. A positive change from baseline indicated more depression. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAM-A Total Score at Day 15 and All Other Time Points - Part B</title>
        <description>The 14-item HAM-A was used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety. Each of the 14 items was defined by a series of symptoms, and measured both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM-A was calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where 0-13=Normal, 14-17 Mild Anxiety, 18-24 Moderate Anxiety, &gt;=25 Severe Anxiety, per the Psych Congress Network. The HAM-A total score was calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicated less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicated more anxiety. The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With CGI-I Response - Part B</title>
        <description>The CGI-I item employed a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The analysis was performed in participants included in Part B of the study. Data is reported for participants who had CGI-I response.</description>

          <description>The CGI-I item employed a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the participant's condition post-treatment. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.
