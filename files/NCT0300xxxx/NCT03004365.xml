  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-blind study is to evaluate whether C16G2 Varnish administered in&#xD;
      multiple doses can effectively kill the bacteria in the oral cavity that cause dental caries.&#xD;

      A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and oral&#xD;
      microbiology of C16G2 Varnish application in male and female dental subjects 12-75 years of&#xD;
      age. This multi-center study will evaluate multiple study drug administrations of C16G2&#xD;
      Varnish or Placebo Varnish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll subjects into up to three study arms. Up to 33 subjects will receive&#xD;
      multiple doses of study drug applied with a small brush typically used in dental varnish&#xD;
      administration. Subjects will be enrolled in an 8:3 ratio. The Sponsor will perform unblinded&#xD;
      microbiology review on an ongoing basis to determine whether to enroll additional 11 subjects&#xD;
      into the next dose cohort or to terminate enrollment based on microbiology data.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Advanced periodontal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active caries lesion(s) within 30 days prior to study drug administration (confirmed&#xD;

             days prior to study drug administration (depending on the specifics, participation in&#xD;
             an observational study is not necessarily excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of any condition or concurrent illness, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would compromise normal immune function (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, lupus, liver disease, organ transplant, etc.), interfere with the use of&#xD;
             study dentifrice and oral care products, or interfere with the ability to comply with&#xD;
             study requirements, or jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the&#xD;
             study results&#xD;
