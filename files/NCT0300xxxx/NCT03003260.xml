    <textblock>
      Rationale: IBS is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder with a prevalence&#xD;
      worldwide ranging from 9-23%. Complaints include abdominal discomfort or pain and altered&#xD;
      bowel habits. Although the condition is not life-threatening, it strongly impairs quality of&#xD;
      life and up to now there is no cure for IBS. It is assumed that IBS symptoms are related to a&#xD;
      combination of altered gut motility and secretion, and visceral hypersensitivity. However,&#xD;
      its primary cause still remains largely unknown. The endocannabinoid system, together with&#xD;
      some functionally related receptors is among the biological targets considered promising for&#xD;
      treatment. Modulation of the CB1 , CB2 and related receptors or enzymes of the&#xD;
      endocannabinoid system in a broader sense by (endo) cannabinoids or (and) structurally&#xD;
      related lipid mediators can influence motility, secretions and decrease hypersensitivity in&#xD;
      the gut. Among the plant-derived cannabinoids or so called 'phytocannabinoids', cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD) is of special interest as it has shown therapeutic potential in preclinical studies and&#xD;
      a growing number of case-reports. CBD is a non-specific phytocannabinoid displaying a broad&#xD;
      but weak receptor interaction profile. In contrast to the well-known THC from Cannabis&#xD;
      sativa, CBD is not psychoactive and often also present in those Cannabis varieties that are&#xD;
      not used for their psychoactive properties but for industrial (fibre) or food properties&#xD;
      (oil, flour and seeds) instead. Based on preclinical studies and in vitro data we hypothesize&#xD;
      that CBD might be able to relieve symptoms of IBS, including pain in patients with IBS. The&#xD;
      chewing gum is to be taken 'on demand' and may have some additional perceived positive&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate whether the use of a CBD-containing preparation in the form of&#xD;
      CanChew速 chewing gum can contribute to a reduction of IBS symptoms and an improvement of&#xD;
      perceived wellbeing in patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial of 8 weeks in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adults, aged 18-65, diagnosed according to the ROME III criteria with&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will, in this cross-over study, receive a maximum 6&#xD;
      chewing gums per day, either containing 50 mg of cannabidiol per chewing gum in case of the&#xD;
      CanChew chewing gum, or a placebo chewing gum. This first intervention period will last 3&#xD;
      weeks. Next, participants will undergo a one week wash-out and then switch intervention to&#xD;
      either placebo or the CanChew chewing gum for another 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is a change in pain reduction&#xD;
      perception experienced and measured by the patient using VAS-scales before and after taking&#xD;
      the chewing gum, to be recorded in a diary. Next to this a patient is asked to provide one&#xD;
      VAS score for each completed week. Furthermore, the adequate relief will be measured every&#xD;
      day. At the end of each week patients will also be asked (from their diary) whether they&#xD;
      noticed a change in stool frequency or (and) experienced any side-effects. For the&#xD;
      disease-related quality of life the IBS-QOL will be used. This questionnaire will be filled&#xD;
      out in week 1, 4, 5, and 8.&#xD;
