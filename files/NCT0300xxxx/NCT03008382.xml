  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) afflicts 3 to 8 million women in the US.&#xD;
      Symptoms of IC/BPS reduce quality of life, suppressing both social well-being and physical&#xD;
      function. The chronic pain, voiding dysfunction, sleep deprivation and associated co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions interfere with relationships and employment with significant direct (doctor&#xD;
      visits, medication, surgery) and indirect (loss of productivity) economic impact, currently&#xD;
      exceeding $100 million per year.This proposal aims to move the science of chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      (CPP) from simple associations towards an investigation of cause and effect relationships.&#xD;
      The investigators will determine whether the striking changes in autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      responsiveness (ANS-R) contribute meaningfully to the pathogenesis of IC/BPS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site trial will recruit 3 groups of female subjects ages 18-80 years, evenly&#xD;
      distributed across decades (10 or 20 per decade as appropriate): Interstitial&#xD;
      Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS), Myofascial Pelvic Pain (MPP) and Healthy Controls&#xD;
      (HC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to move the science of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) from simple associations&#xD;
      towards an investigation of cause and effect relationships. We will determine whether the&#xD;
      striking changes in ANS-R contribute meaningfully to the pathogenesis of Interstitial&#xD;
      Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome IC/BPS through 3 aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Careful longitudinal repeated measures in individual subjects to determine if ANS-R&#xD;
           changes precede clinical changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessing the impact of an intervention designed to change ANS-R on the clinical course&#xD;
           of IC/BPS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluating changes in brain connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the&#xD;
           periaqueductal gray (PAG) associated with changes in ANS-R and improved disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be pre-screened in person or on the phone. An in-person pre-screen takes place&#xD;
      in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms at Froedtert Hospital. If the subject is able to&#xD;
      participate, subject will sign the informed consent form before completing a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation. The baseline evaluation occurs either following consent or at another date&#xD;
      convenient for them. Subjects must complete all baseline activities within 2 weeks, or before&#xD;
      their Week 4/Visit 2. The baseline evaluation is comprised of a general examination, a set of&#xD;
      questionnaires, background history documenting date of diagnosis, medications tried, duration&#xD;
      of each treatment and dosing, surgeries and therapeutic and exploratory procedures performed.&#xD;
      A pelvic examination will be performed with CPP subjects patients only. Active Change in&#xD;
      Posture (ACP) is administered to the subject. Subjects will complete the uroflow (urine)&#xD;
      measurement and Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the&#xD;
      research team present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This substudy is identical to the above with the exception of not taking a beta-blocker or&#xD;
      placebo and is only 12 weeks long instead of 24. This is strictly an observational study to&#xD;
      monitor subjects who have been diagnosed with IC or MPP. If the screening information shows&#xD;
      that the subject meets the requirements, then they will be able to start. If the screening&#xD;
      information shows that they cannot be in the research, the research doctor will discuss other&#xD;
      options with them and/or refer them back to their regular doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is able to participate, they will complete 3 regular on-site long-visits at&#xD;
      weeks 0, 4, and 12. The first long-visit (baseline evaluation) may occur either today&#xD;
      following consent or at another date convenient for them. The baseline evaluation comprises a&#xD;
      general and pelvic examination (no speculum), psychological questionnaires and a background&#xD;
      history questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Home Checks will occur for 24 weeks (or 12 weeks if in observational sub-study)&#xD;
      following consent. Once each a week, subjects will complete a 24-hour heart rate (HR)&#xD;
      recording and the ACP recording using the eMotion Faros 360° portable EKG device. A member of&#xD;
      the research team will contact the subject each week while they complete the weekly&#xD;
      questionnaires and ACP recording. This will ensure compliance and will give the subject the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask any questions.The researcher will remain on the phone or via Skype to&#xD;
      monitor the subject while the ACP recording is completed from home just prior to the&#xD;
      subject's bedtime. The HR recording will be uploaded to MCW's secure server at the subject's&#xD;
      next hospital visit. Throughout the study, subjects flare activity will be monitored via&#xD;
      phone calls and recording flares in the EMA application on the smartphone. This will be a&#xD;
      Daily Flare Question in the EMA which is a set alarmed time to sound as a reminder for the&#xD;
      duration of the subject's participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following weeks after each site visit and the night before visit 5, subjects will repeat&#xD;
      complete the 24-hr HR recording to ensure comparability of the HRV recording at home to the&#xD;
      one performed at the matching on-site visit., Subjects will also complete the 24-h voiding&#xD;
      diary, a set of questions using the ICECAN mobile App installed on a pre-loaded smartphone&#xD;
      and questionnaires. Deidentified 24-hour HRV and ACP recordings will be sent to Ohio State&#xD;
      University for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits: Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, Visits 2-5 (weeks 4 and 12 (Visits 2 and 3) for the&#xD;
      observational substudy) Subjects will arrive to MCW Neurology Research Rooms to repeat the&#xD;
      following: review of comorbidities, tender points exam, questionnaires, ACP and DNIC tests.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete the Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a&#xD;
      member of the research team present. Chronic Pelvic Pain patients subjects will complete a&#xD;
      repeat pelvic examination at Weeks 12 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPP and IC/BPS patients subjects will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either placebo (a&#xD;
      pill with no active agent), or metoprolol (a pill that reduces the impact of the brain's&#xD;
      &quot;fight or flight&quot; circuits). Metoprolol is in the class of &quot;beta-blockers&quot; commonly used for&#xD;
      mild blood pressure control, and also commonly used for migraine. Subjects will be&#xD;
      administered 8 weeks of metoprolol or placebo starting at their Week 4 Visit. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete a 4-week washout period (Week 12-16) and will be administered 8 weeks of crossover&#xD;
      (Weeks 16-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn (~ 50 mL, a little more than 3 tablespoons) at each in-person visit at&#xD;
      weeks 0, 4, 12, 16, and 24 for chronic pelvic pain subjects (healthy control only at Baseline&#xD;
      and Final visits; 2 draws total). A portion of the blood plasma/serum will be sent to the&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh for additional related analysis. The sample will be labeled by a&#xD;
      number and will not contain any information that can be used to directly identify subject.&#xD;
      This portion of the study is critical to gather new information about pelvic pain, which is&#xD;
      very poorly understood and we highly encourage subjects to participate in this portion of the&#xD;
      study; however, it is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 healthy control subjects will also complete this study in 24 weeks that include 4 long&#xD;
      site visits and 6 weekly home check visits. During this first long visit they will complete a&#xD;
      general exam and physician evaluation, DNIC, ACP, Valsalva maneuver, and questionnaires.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 24-hour HR recording from home once a week for 6 weeks total.&#xD;
