  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of Expanded Natural Killer (ENK) cells to treat multiple&#xD;
      myeloma when administered as part of a regimen consisting of Elotuzumab and a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. Natural killer cells are a special type of white blood cells that are already&#xD;
      present in the body which have the ability to kill myeloma cells. In this study, natural&#xD;
      killer cells will be collected and then treated in a laboratory to activate and 'expand' the&#xD;
      number of cells to increase the dose and the anti-myeloma activity of the cells before they&#xD;
      are transfused back into the subject. Elotuzumab is a protein drug approved by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with previously treated multiple&#xD;
      myeloma and works by activating natural killer cells already present in the body and&#xD;
      targeting a protein called SLAMF7 which is present on both natural killer cells and myeloma&#xD;
      cells. The investigators hope that administering Elotuzumab in combination with ENK cells&#xD;
      will enhance the anti-myeloma activity of the ENK cells.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple myeloma patients that have completed induction chemotherapy and peripheral&#xD;
             blood stem cell collection (PBSC) in preparation for ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have high-risk disease as defined by Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) 70&#xD;
             risk score of ≥ 0.66 or GEP 80 gene score of ≥ 2.48 or metaphase cytogenetic&#xD;
             abnormalities or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 360 U/L (Rule out hemolysis, infection&#xD;
             and contact PI for clarification if any doubt).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed prior treatment for their multiple myeloma (MM) including a&#xD;
             proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug (so-called 'double refractory').&#xD;
             Patients who have received prior salvage combination chemotherapy after failure of&#xD;
             proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug are eligible (frank relapse at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment is not required)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod ≤ 2, unless solely due to symptoms of MM-related (bone) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a platelet count of ≥ 20,000/μL within 30 days of enrollment,&#xD;
             unless lower levels are explained by extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis or extensive&#xD;
             prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and not older than 75 years of age at the&#xD;
             time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  must have preserved renal function as defined by a serum creatinine level of ≤ 3 mg/dL&#xD;
             within 30 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have an ejection fraction by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated&#xD;
             acquisition (MUGA) scan ≥ 40% within 90 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate pulmonary function studies ≥ 50% of predicted on&#xD;
             mechanical aspects and diffusion capacity (DLCO) ≥ 50% of predicted within 90 days&#xD;
             prior to registration. If the patient is unable to complete pulmonary function tests&#xD;
             due to MM-related pain or condition, exception may be granted if the principal&#xD;
             investigator documents that the patient is a candidate for high-dose therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg stored for transplant. In addition,&#xD;
             there will be a 'back-up' available of 2x106 CD34+ cells/kg2x106 CD34+ cells/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent and&#xD;
             HIPAA authorization form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allo-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior auto-transplantation is permitted provided the patient is still presently a&#xD;
             transplant candidate and at least 2 months should have passed since last&#xD;
             auto-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of poorly-controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or any other serious&#xD;
             medical illness or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the&#xD;
             completion of treatment according to this protocol or could be considered to be an&#xD;
             exclusion criterion deemed by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have prior malignancy, except for adequately-treated basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the&#xD;
             patient has not received treatment for one year prior to enrollment. Other cancers&#xD;
             will only be acceptable if the patient's life expectancy exceeds three years as&#xD;
             determined by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test documented within one week of registration. Women/men&#xD;
             of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject may not be positive for HIV I/II or HTLV-I/II.&#xD;
