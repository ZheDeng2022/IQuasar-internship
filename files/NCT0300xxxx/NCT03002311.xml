    <textblock>
      This study's purpose is to test the effects of an electronic health intervention platform&#xD;
      developed by Epharmix (also known as CareSignal), which features two-way SMS text messages&#xD;
      and phone calls intended to improve clinical outcomes compared to the standard of care. This&#xD;
      was a randomized open, blinded end-point (PROBE) trial of adult patients discharged from the&#xD;
      ED and referred to a provider for follow-up care. Participants in the intervention arm&#xD;
      received a self-scheduling text or phone message that automatically connected them to their&#xD;
      referral provider to schedule a follow-up appointment and sent them appointment reminders.&#xD;
      Those in the control arm received standard of care written instructions to contact listed&#xD;
      referral providers. The primary outcome was time to the follow-up appointment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine is a modern field of clinical medicine that strives to incorporate&#xD;
      telecommunication and information technology for diagnosing and managing health care at a&#xD;
      distance. Interventions range from telephone reminders to remote physician consultation by&#xD;
      streamed by webcam. Simple technology such as telephone and SMS texting are becoming common&#xD;
      forms of communication and may improve patient adherence and engagement. Automated telephone&#xD;
      appointment reminders have improved adherence with follow-up appointments in some settings,&#xD;
      but have mixed results in patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). Increasing&#xD;
      adherence to follow-up care has been a priority in the ED to improve patient outcomes and&#xD;
      reduce unnecessary future visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic intervention platform has been developed by Epharmix (now HealthSignal), uses&#xD;
      SMS text messaging for adherence tracking and data collection applications, to supplement&#xD;
      clinical care. Specific messages include: proactively asking patients or a designated patient&#xD;
      advocate if the patient has experienced a medical event; requesting specific care-related&#xD;
      information; and providing health care education. Patients receiving the messages are also&#xD;
      provided with key contact information for their designated health care provider to promote&#xD;
      patient engagement, as well as prompt and appropriate medical follow-up care. The service&#xD;
      will maintain both a dedicated SMS and phone line for recording events or adverse reactions.&#xD;
      Events designated as critical prompt a phone call from nursing staff. Overall, this study&#xD;
      aims to determine whether an electronic intervention system that sends SMS text messages will&#xD;
      improve adherence to follow-up appointments after an ED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age 18 years or older at Barnes Jewish Hospital are included in this study. We&#xD;
      conducted a prospective randomized open, blinded end-point (PROBE) trial of 278 adult&#xD;
      patients discharged from the ED and referred to a provider for follow-up care. Participants&#xD;
      in the intervention arm received a self-scheduling text or phone message using the Epharmix&#xD;
      (now HealthSignal) platform that connected them to their referral provider to schedule a&#xD;
      follow-up appointment and sent them appointment reminders. Those in the control arm received&#xD;
      standard-of-care written instructions to contact listed referral providers. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was time to appointment. The secondary outcome was time to return visit to the ED.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome was the effect of the intervention on time to follow-up appointment using an intention-to-treat analysis and plotting the cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). Follow-up adherence was defined as a recorded visit in the EMR to the referral primary or specialty care provider within 120 days after ED discharge to address a similar diagnosis (or complaint) at the index ED visit.</description>

    <description>The self-scheduling text and phone messaging system was built by Epharmix/CareSignal. Participants in the intervention group began receiving text or voice messages (for landlines) starting 1 hour following ED discharge if during normal business hours, or at 1000 the next business morning. Automated messages were sent up to 3 days in a row or until the participant responded or opted out. The phone system would ultimately connect them directly to their referral provider or clinic to schedule an appointment. Once participants hung up with the referral clinic, the intervention texted or called back to solicit the appointment date. If a date was entered, the system sent reminders at 14 days, 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before the appointment. After the appointment, the intervention texted or called participants to confirm if they attended.</description>

Follow-up adherence was defined as a recorded visit in the EMR to the referral primary or specialty care provider within 120 days after ED discharge to address a similar diagnosis (or complaint) at the index ED visit.</description>

Participants in the intervention group began receiving text or voice messages (for landlines) starting 1 hour following ED discharge if during normal business hours, or at 1000 the next business morning. Automated messages were sent up to 3 days in a row or until the participant responded or opted out. The phone system would ultimately connect them directly to their referral provider or clinic to schedule an appointment. Once participants hung up with the referral clinic, the intervention texted or called back to solicit the appointment date. If a date was entered, the system sent reminders at 14 days, 7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before the appointment. After the appointment, the intervention texted or called participants to confirm attendance.</description>
