      Background: Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce breakthrough narcotic consumption following orthopaedic, neurosurgical, and&#xD;
      obstetrical procedures. The morphine-sparing effect of ketorolac may reduce respiratory and&#xD;
      central nervous system depression post operatively, while still providing adequate pain&#xD;
      control for patients. Patients undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast&#xD;
      reconstruction may particularly benefit from ketorolac postoperatively, and ultimately be&#xD;
      safely discharged from hospital sooner than their counterparts receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: In adult women post-mastectomy, undergoing abdominally based microsurgical&#xD;
      breast reconstruction, does a postoperative regimen of intravenous ketorolac tromethamine, in&#xD;
      addition to standard of care, reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay compared with&#xD;
      an intravenous sham saline regimen?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A single center, explanatory, placebo-controlled, 1:1 allocation, 2-arm,&#xD;
      parallel group, superiority, randomized, and double blinded, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The study population includes all females &gt;18 years old post mastectomy&#xD;
      consenting to abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Comparator: The intervention will be ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively for 72 hours. The comparator will be a sham intravenous administration of&#xD;
      normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome is hospital length of stay postoperatively. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include visual analog scale for pain, breakthrough narcotic consumption, surgical drain&#xD;
      outputs, hematoma, and other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Available data provided estimates for average length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      standard deviation. A minimally clinically significant difference of 1 day was decided on due&#xD;
      to expert opinion. Based on a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05, and inflated to account for&#xD;
      attrition and efficiency losses, a total of 50 patients (25 per group) will be required for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction (BR) is commonly requested following mastectomy, and recent measures&#xD;
      have been taken to ensure patient access is universal. Transferring autologous tissue from&#xD;
      the abdomen using microvascular surgical techniques provides a reliable reconstruction method&#xD;
      with high levels of patient satisfaction, and is routinely performed. However, the surgery is&#xD;
      relatively complex and lengthy; operative times can exceed six hours and hospital stay ranges&#xD;
      from 5-9 days. During each patient's postoperative course she must meet certain milestones&#xD;
      before discharge. It has been shown that beyond the necessary monitoring of the viability of&#xD;
      the free flap, pain and a patient's ability to mobilize are important modifiable barriers to&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain control following autologous BR is multimodal, but predominantly relies on opioids.&#xD;
      Narcotics provide effective analgesia, but have a well-known side effect profile that&#xD;
      includes drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, sedation, central nervous system and respiratory&#xD;
      depression. Each of these potential adverse effects limits patients' mobility after surgery.&#xD;
      Respiratory depression is particularly disadvantageous, as these patients have undergone&#xD;
      major abdominal musculature dissection that also disrupts their mechanics of breathing 10 .&#xD;
      This may have the counterproductive effect of limiting patient mobilization, and ultimately&#xD;
      delay discharge. In a health care system where resources are at a premium and costs are&#xD;
      climbing, any inexpensive intervention that allows for an earlier and safe discharge is&#xD;
      worthy of consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No standard approach to postoperative pain control in free flap BR exists. Most protocols are&#xD;
      institution dependent, and variably incorporate narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen and other agents. In addition, these medications are given via&#xD;
      oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. Recent studies have investigated the use of&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane blocks as an analgesic adjunct, and patients are often provided&#xD;
      with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps in the early postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketorolac tromethamine is an NSAID, which is approved by Health Canada for short-term pain&#xD;
      control (Toradol, Hoffmann-La Roche Limited, 7070 Mississauga Road Mississauga, Ontario).&#xD;
      Ketorolac provides better pain control than the most commonly used NSAIDs, and its potency is&#xD;
      comparable to that of morphine. However, it does not have the same listed side effects of&#xD;
      drowsiness and respiratory depression as do narcotics. Surgeons often cite concern regarding&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding when using NSAIDs, however recent reviews have convincingly&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety for use of NSAIDs in plastic surgery. A previous observational study&#xD;
      has also shown the safety of ketorolac specifically following autologous BR. The routine&#xD;
      addition of ketorolac following surgery has been shown to reduce patients' narcotic&#xD;
      requirements in other fields of surgery, such as orthopaedics and gynaecology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the abovementioned advantages of ketorolac, and the particular propensity for&#xD;
      abdominally based free flap BR patients to be negatively affected by narcotic side effects,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that the addition of ketorolac to a routine multimodal postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      regimen will reduce hospital stay by a day or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator for this study will be a placebo. Patients randomized both to the control&#xD;
      group and those randomized to the intervention group will receive standard of care&#xD;
      postoperatively, which will include pain control with scheduled acetaminophen and pro re nata&#xD;
      oral and subcutaneous hydromorphone. In addition, control patients will receive a placebo&#xD;
      with the same scheduling as the study drug, ketorolac. The rationale for this choice is to&#xD;
      limit potential sources of bias, such as the patient and her care team, and maximize the&#xD;
      accuracy of the primary outcome and patient-completed questionnaires that will serve as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome. Other authors have previously successfully used placebos for ketorolac in&#xD;
      their study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of surgeons at our institution currently do not employ ketorolac in their&#xD;
      postoperative pain control regimen. Thus, there exists clinical equipoise for patients&#xD;
      considering participating and potentially being randomized into the control group, when&#xD;
      compared with declining participation and receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be single-centered and conducted in Nova Scotia, Canada. The Halifax&#xD;
      Infirmary is a level III trauma center with multiple board certified Plastic surgeons who&#xD;
      have undertaken extra training in microsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be removed from the study upon request. Her data up until that point will&#xD;
      be used for statistical analysis, however she would no longer receive the intervention.&#xD;
      Modifications to intervention dosing would occur if a participant develops any drug&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally any major harm attributed to ketorolac will prompt a&#xD;
      termination of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will undergo uni- or bilateral abdominally based free flap harvest,&#xD;
      microsurgical anastomoses, and flap inset. Following randomization, the study drug will be&#xD;
      sent to the main operating theatre, and attached to the patient's medical chart. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of surgery, each patient will be administered their first dose of the study drug.&#xD;
      Its content will depend on the patient's randomized group. If randomized to the ketorolac&#xD;
      intervention group, the IV minibag will contain 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine, or if in the&#xD;
      control group it will be a sham normal saline IV minibag. They then will continue to receive&#xD;
      their assigned drug every 6 hours for 72 hours. Patients all receive 1:1 care from nursing&#xD;
      staff in the early postoperative period, and their nurse will administer all drugs given on&#xD;
      the surgical ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have enrolled will receive the usual care for the postoperative period. The&#xD;
      study drug will be in addition to usual flap monitoring, patient vital sign monitoring,&#xD;
      progression of mobilization, drain management, along with the other care provided for these&#xD;
      patients. Patients also will have the same background analgesic and anti-emetics medications&#xD;
      ordered postoperatively, which is included on a standardized pre-printed order form at the&#xD;
      Halifax Infirmary for this particular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will first be introduced to the study following their initial&#xD;
      consultation for BR. If the patient consents for abdominally based microsurgical BR, then the&#xD;
      study will be reviewed, allowing time for any questions to be asked, and the risks and&#xD;
      benefits to be discussed. The patient will be sent home with a study package that includes a&#xD;
      copy of the study consent form and protocol. The study will be reviewed again at a&#xD;
      preoperative appointment, allowing time for any follow up questions to be asked. This is a&#xD;
      routine appointment intended for markings and patient questions regarding surgery, and the&#xD;
      patient will officially be enrolled in the study if she wishes to participate at either&#xD;
      time-point - the initial consultation or the preoperative appointment. Following the surgery,&#xD;
      each patient will remain active in the study until her discharge from hospital. No follow up&#xD;
      appointments or data will be scheduled or recorded for the purposes of the study (although&#xD;
      follow up will occur as per usual with these patients and their respective surgeon).&#xD;
      Therefore total enrolment time for each patient will be from the appointment immediately&#xD;
      before surgery to her discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated algorithm will be used to randomize patients in a 1:1 allocation into&#xD;
      the intervention or control group during surgery. Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      laterality of the reconstruction (i.e. bi- or unilateral) because this could affect&#xD;
      participant pain levels. Randomization will be managed and maintained by a third party&#xD;
      service, not otherwise involved in the study, in the hospital pharmacy department. Allocation&#xD;
      methods will not be disclosed to study investigators. Following randomization, the study drug&#xD;
      will be sent to the main operating theatre, and given at the conclusion of the surgery. Both&#xD;
      the intervention and control drug will be of the same storage and opacity to prevent&#xD;
      identification by the patient or care providers. From there, the patient will then be&#xD;
      administered the same drug according to the randomization result, based on delivery by the&#xD;
      third party pharmacy service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out within the pharmacy department placing patients into either&#xD;
      the intervention or control group. The intervention and control intravenous drugs will be&#xD;
      prepared in the same style IV minibag with the same volume and opacity of fluid. The fluids&#xD;
      will be of similar viscosity. Once similar appearances and features are confirmed the&#xD;
      prepared drug will be sent to the operating theatre or the ward as required depending on the&#xD;
      time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the conduction of this study all involved trial participants, clinicians, data&#xD;
      collectors, event adjudicators, and data analysts will be blinded to the grouping of&#xD;
      patients. All study medications will be stored in the hospital pharmacy department by a third&#xD;
      party. Following randomization, treatment drugs will be dispensed by the pharmacy and then&#xD;
      administered by nursing staff. The third party service will maintain records linking a&#xD;
      patient unique identifier to her study group. Post hoc analysis to assess whether staff could&#xD;
      identify between the intervention and placebo will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms will be classified as either minor or major. Minor harms will include surgical site&#xD;
      infection and those listed from prior clinical trials on the drug monograph, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common Clinical Trial Adverse Drug Reactions (&gt;1%): Dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea,&#xD;
