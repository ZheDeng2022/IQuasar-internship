      This is a prospective open-label, randomized trial for the use of Fecal Microbiota&#xD;
      Transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC), in combination with or&#xD;
      without antibiotic pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial involves 11 study visits at UCSF in San Francisco, CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routes of administration will be via colonoscopy for all subjects with maintenance&#xD;
      therapy administered orally (i.e. using encapsulated FMT) for half of the subjects and per&#xD;
      rectum by enema in the other half of the subjects. Additionally, the utility of pretreatment&#xD;
      antibiotics will be assessed.&#xD;
