      This study will compare patients with low back pain (LBP) to age and gender matched controls&#xD;
      to determine if there are differences between the two groups related to: range of movement,&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (level of disability, quality of life, evidence of depression, anxiety or&#xD;
      stress), movement patterns and demographic characteristics. The first phase will include a&#xD;
      baseline and 3 month follow-up assessment of the LBP patients and controls, including&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, outcome measures, and a physical assessment. The second phase is&#xD;
      an ongoing phase with continued interim assessments of LBP patients only, at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of the study will use a non-randomized two-group prospective longitudinal&#xD;
      study design (Group A subjects with LBP, Group B subjects without LBP). The second phase of&#xD;
      the study will use a single-group prospective longitudinal study design (Group A, subjects&#xD;
      with low back pain). A timeline and step-by-step detail of the study procedures for these&#xD;
      phases are also described in Appendix B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A which will include subjects with LBP, members of the research team will screen and&#xD;
      attempt to consecutively enroll all patients who undergo assessment for low back pain at two&#xD;
      clinical locations (International Spine Pain &amp; Performance Center, and Synergy Manual&#xD;
      Physical Therapy). The enrollment and baseline visit can occur at the same time. During&#xD;
      enrollment each subject will privately be briefed on the purpose and involvement in the study&#xD;
      and be allowed to ask questions and opt out if not interested. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      reviewed and signed and each subject will be given a copy of the consent form (15 minutes).&#xD;
      Since collection of &quot;baseline data&quot; (outcome measures and ViMove Assessment) is already&#xD;
      considered standard clinical practice for subjects with low back pain at these clinical&#xD;
      settings, providing informed consent would allow the researchers to access this information&#xD;
      for purposes of the registry. A summary of the information collected at baseline will&#xD;
      include: patient demographics/medical history (age, gender, pain episode duration, BMI,&#xD;
      employment, marital status, comorbidities, co-interventions, ICD-10 LBP diagnosis), outcome&#xD;
      measures (LBP movement pattern classification, LBP Classifier Questionnaire, QVAS for back&#xD;
      and leg, Oswestry Disability index, START-Keele, Fear Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire,&#xD;
      EuroQol-5D, DASS-21, patient perception of movement contribution to pain) (20 minutes), and&#xD;
      an assessment (ViMove standard assessment, 30 sec chair test, 40m walk test) (25 minutes).&#xD;
      See Appendix C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B which will include subjects without LBP, members of the research team will recruit&#xD;
      volunteers within the DC metro area using flyers posted on campus at the George Washington&#xD;
      University, local DC metro gymnasiums and recreational centers, word of mouth and email list&#xD;
      serves associated with educational programs within The George Washington University School of&#xD;
      Medicine and Health Sciences. Subjects will be screened by phone for the presence or history&#xD;
      of low back pain as well as other exclusion criteria. If the subject agrees to move forward&#xD;
      with participation they will be asked to come to The George Washington University Program in&#xD;
      Physical Therapy located at 2000 Pennsylvania Ave Suite 2000, NW Washington DC 20006, or&#xD;
      International Spine Pain &amp; Performance Center or Synergy Manual Physical Therapy. Enrollment&#xD;
      and baseline visits can occur at the same time. During enrollment each subject will privately&#xD;
      be briefed on the purpose and involvement in the study and be allowed to ask questions and&#xD;
      opt out if not interested. Informed consent will be reviewed and signed and each subject will&#xD;
      be given a copy of the consent form (15 minutes). Baseline data will then be collected which&#xD;
      will include: subject demographics/medical history (age, gender, BMI, employment, marital&#xD;
      status, comorbidities, co-interventions) and QVAS for back and leg, EQ-5D, DASS-21 (10&#xD;
      minutes) and ViMove standard assessment, 30 sec chair test, and 40m walk test (25 minutes).&#xD;
      See Appendix C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ViMove Testing (Groups A &amp; B): The ViMove system (dorsaVi, Australia) which will be used to&#xD;
      assess movement patterns and lumbar muscle activity in both groups during the ViMove standard&#xD;
      assessment, 30 sec chair test, 40m walk test, is an inertial measurement system comprised of&#xD;
      two wireless motion sensors containing a triaxial accelerometer, a triaxial gyroscope and a&#xD;
      magnetometer, two wireless surface electromyography (EMG) sensors, and a small wireless&#xD;
      recording device (RFD) that can be worn by the subject. The manufacturer reports average&#xD;
      differences of &lt; 1 degree for single plane, through range movements when comparing matched&#xD;
      measurements from the ViMove and a Fastrak opto-electronic device (Charry, Umer et al. 2011).&#xD;
      The ViMove motion sensors collect data at approximately 20 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ViMove testing is performed for both groups, 4 sensors will be adhered to the subject's&#xD;
      skin using customised biocompatible adhesives. The placement of the sensors is determined&#xD;
      through the use of templates which have been validated as part of the FDA 510K application.&#xD;
      During testing, the sensors communicate data wirelessly to the RFD which is connected to a&#xD;
      computer running dorsaVi (ViMove software). Customised algorithms convert data generated by&#xD;
      the software to meaningful biomechanical information, including measures such as range of&#xD;
      movement, peak angles, speed of movement and muscle activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group A will follow-up with their healthcare provider based on standard clinical&#xD;
      care practices. Enrolled subjects in Group A will undergo follow up at 3 months, 6 months and&#xD;
      12 months (45 minutes each session); these follow up visits may or may not coincide with a&#xD;
      regular clinical office visit with their healthcare provider. Subjects in Group B will follow&#xD;
      up at 3 months only (35 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will include completing outcome measures and an assessment as collected at baseline&#xD;
      as well as collection of patient status, events, and protocol deviations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may exit from the research project under the following circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject chooses to withdraw (e.g. consent withdrawal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of their follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator deems withdrawal is necessary (e.g. medically justified, failure of patient&#xD;
           to maintain adequate registry compliance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is no longer available for follow-up&#xD;
