      Previous findings have shown that a biomarker comprised of the three microRNAs (miRs)&#xD;
      miR-451, miR-151-5p and miR-1290 can independently predict precursor B-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (B- ALL) patients' risk for relapse when measured in cells from a bone&#xD;
      marrow (BM) aspiration taken at diagnosis (Avigad et al., 2016: Genes, Chromosomes &amp; Cancer&#xD;
      55:328-339). Curewize Health recognizes that the development of a minimally invasive blood&#xD;
      test for frequent long-term monitoring can greatly benefit pediatric precursor B-ALL&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, the current study will investigate the monitoring ability of miR-451,&#xD;
      miR-151-5p and miR-1290 measured in blood samples. The study will be performed in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1-Cross-Sectional Study: Blood samples will be collected from relapsed pediatric B-ALL&#xD;
      patients and B-ALL patients in remission. Blood will be collected from each patient in three&#xD;
      tubes, for serum, plasma and whole blood analysis, in order to interpret the best blood&#xD;
      source for measuring miR-451, miR-151-5p and miR-1290. The level of the miRs in blood will be&#xD;
      compared between relapsed B-ALL patients to B-ALL patients in remission. If the Stage 1&#xD;
      Cross-Sectional study is successful, the investigators will continue the clinical trials to&#xD;
      the Stage 2 Prospective Monitoring study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2-Prospective Monitoring Study: Blood will be collected from patients at diagnosis and&#xD;
      at routine clinical follow-up. Patients can be up to five years from diagnosis. The source of&#xD;
      blood found to be most optimal for measuring the miR levels is Stage 1 will be collected. The&#xD;
      final design of the Stage 2 study will be decided after completion of the Stage 1 study.&#xD;

      1. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Risk Based Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children with ALL are usually treated according to risk groups defined by both clinical&#xD;
           and laboratory features. This approach allows children with signs of historically very&#xD;
           good outcome to be treated with modest therapy and to be spared more intensive and toxic&#xD;
           treatment, while allowing children with a historically lower probability of long-term&#xD;
           survival to receive more intensive therapy that may increase the ALL patients' chance of&#xD;
           cure. Study groups use varying criteria, with a strong emphasis on minimal residual&#xD;
           disease (MRD) measurements that quantify the number of leukemic cells that remain in the&#xD;
           patient during and after treatment. The most widely used MRD assays are based on&#xD;
           polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antigen-receptor genes, and on flow&#xD;
           cytometric detection of abnormal immunophenotypes (Campana, 2010). These techniques&#xD;
           identify the patients' specific leukemia clone in bone marrow before induction treatment&#xD;
           and measure the number of residual leukemic cells post-induction. Two widely used&#xD;
           examples of Risk stratification protocols are the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)&#xD;
           Protocol in Europe and the Children's Oncology Group Protocol in USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous ProALL miR Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ProALL prototype assay microRNAs (miRNAs) (Avigad et al., 2016) were discovered by&#xD;
           microarray analysis by hybridization of BM aspirates taken at diagnosis of 48 ALL&#xD;
           patients to 979 different miRNAs. The down-regulated expression levels of miR-451 and&#xD;
           miR-151-5p and the up-regulated expression level of miR-1290 associated with adverse&#xD;
           prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second study focused on measuring the three miRs in BM samples taken from B-ALL&#xD;
           patients at diagnosis treated by the BFM protocol. ProALL miRs predicted high risk to&#xD;
           relapse (p&lt;0.0001, n=127). ProALL miRs were found to be an independent predictor when&#xD;
           tested with prognostic factors known at diagnosis and when tested with PCR-MRD. Similar&#xD;
           findings were found for patients treated by the DCOG protocol (n=32, p&lt;0.0001). In a&#xD;
           small feasibility study the investigators showed that ProALL miRs measured in blood&#xD;
           correlated with ProALL miRs measured in bone marrow (Avigad et al. Mir Expression&#xD;
           Profile of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes Predicts Relapse in Pediatric Acute&#xD;
           Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Blood. 2016;128:1736 - Poster presentation at ASH 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Though MRD has greatly contributed to the substantial increase in ALL patients' survival&#xD;
           and outcome, nearly 15% to 20% of young ALL patients eventually succumb to relapse,&#xD;
           resulting in relapsed ALL as being the 4th most common childhood malignancy (Locatelli&#xD;
           et al., 2012, Pui et al., 2012, Hunger and Mullighaan, 2015). Once relapse occurs only&#xD;
           30% to 50% of relapsed patients can be cured even with intensive chemotherapy and bone&#xD;
           marrow transplantation (Nguyen et al. 2008 and Locatelli et al., 2012). Relapsed ALL&#xD;
           patients with high MRD prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a&#xD;
           significantly worse probability of disease-free survival 10 years after relapse&#xD;
           treatment begins (Eckert et al., 2015). Therefore, it stands to reason that early&#xD;
           detection of relapse before a large increase in MRD can improve relapse patients&#xD;
           disease-free survival. Yet, many oncology groups don't incorporate monitoring in ALL&#xD;
           treatment protocols because of the labor intensity of MRD measurement; and the&#xD;
           invalidation of the feasibility of routine MRD monitoring. This is due to factors such&#xD;
           as variable kinetics of leukemic cell regrowth (van Dongen et al., 2015), and that&#xD;
           nearly 50% of ALL patients succumb to relapse from a new leukemia clone not identified&#xD;
           at diagnosis (Choi et al., 2007). The frequency of monitoring may also be limited,&#xD;
           especially in children, due to discomfort and practical difficulties posed by BM&#xD;
           aspiration (Coustan-Smith E. et al., 2002). A simple predictive test for ALL in blood&#xD;
           would increase the practicality of testing ALL patients more frequently and may&#xD;
           eventually lead to prevention of relapse by means of preemptive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigating if ProALL miRs can be measured in blood, in addition to BM, for predicting&#xD;
           relapse risk of ALL patients is vital due to the many advantages of such a blood test.&#xD;
           If ProALL levels can be tested more frequently in blood the probability of successfully&#xD;
           treating the patients' leukemia will increase by potentially enabling the physician to&#xD;
           take preemptive measures to prevent predicted relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be performed in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 1-Cross-Sectional Study: Blood samples will be collected from relapsed pediatric&#xD;
           B-ALL patients and B-ALL patients in remission. Three Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
           from each patient in tubes in order to interpret the best blood source for measuring&#xD;
           miR-451, miR-151-5p and miR-1290. The sources that will be tested are serum, peripheral&#xD;
           blood lymphocytes and whole blood. The level of the miRs in blood will be compared&#xD;
           between relapsed B-ALL patients and B-ALL patients in remission (n=30). If the &quot;Stage 1&#xD;
           Cross-Sectional&quot; study is successful, the investigators will continue the clinical trial&#xD;
           to the &quot;Stage 2 Prospective Monitoring&quot; study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 2-Prospective Monitoring Study: Blood will be collected from patients at diagnosis&#xD;
           and/or at routine clinical follow-up. Patients can be up to five years from diagnosis&#xD;
           (nâ‰ˆ65 *3 samples). One source of blood will be collected. Patients will be followed for&#xD;
           3 years. The final design of the Stage 2 study will be after the completion of Stage 1&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample Size Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 1 Cross-Sectional Study: For the sample size calculation the Primary end-point is&#xD;
           to test the ability of ProALL miRs measured in blood to differentiate B-ALL patients at&#xD;
           remission from patients at relapse. The sample size calculation is according to&#xD;
           Sampling: comparison of proportions of MedCalc (MedCalc Statistical Software version&#xD;
           16.1 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium; https://www.medcalc.org; 2016). Type 1&#xD;
           error was 0.05 and Type 2 error was 0.20. Data for the sample size calculation was&#xD;
           obtained from the DCOG cohort in Avigad et al., 2016, which was chosen as a model for&#xD;
           the feasibility study due to its small size (n=32). Cross sectional analysis of the DCOG&#xD;
           cohort showed that there were significantly more patients with relapse event (p=0.001,&#xD;
           Fisher Exact test) positive for at least one miR (78%) compared to patients with no&#xD;
           relapse event (13%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data is taken from Figure 6 (from Avigad et al., 2016):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients at Relapse - At least one miR positive rate 0.78&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients at Remission - No miR positive rate 0.13&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relapse/Remission was 0.39&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The minimum number of enrollees needed are: a. Patients at Relapse - n=8 and b.&#xD;
                Patients at Remission - n=21.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B-ALL patients can be included in the study up to five years from diagnosis. After&#xD;
           completing the enrollment of the cross-sectional study, PI will be queried on&#xD;
           Remission/Relapse status of patients. Above is the minimum number of patients to be&#xD;
           enrolled. Up to 12 patients at relapse and 31 patents at remission can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 2 Prospective Study: The sample size calculation is according to Sampling:&#xD;
           survival analysis (Time-to-Event) of MedCalc. Type 1 error was 0.05 and Type 2 error was&#xD;
           0.20. Data for the sample size calculation was obtained from Figure 3A Kaplan Meir curve&#xD;
           (Avigad et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Survival rate Profile B was 0.77&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Survival rate Profile A was 0.29&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Profile B/Profile A was 17&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of enrollees needed is 62&#xD;
&#xD;
           At least 3 samples from 3 time points should be taken from each patient. A sample can be&#xD;
           taken at relapse if it is the 2nd or 3rd sample. Patients from Stage 1 can continue to&#xD;
           Stage 2. The final design of the study will be after Stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood Extraction and Handling of Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
           No more than 0.8 mL of blood per kilogram of the enrollee's weight will be collected at&#xD;
           one visit. The total amount of blood to be collected for Stage 1 is between 7.5 mL to&#xD;
           10.5 mL according to the following:.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PaxGene Tube - 2.5 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tube for Plasma - 2.5 mL to 4 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tube for Serum - 2.5 mL to 4 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Biomarker Results and Clinical Data Flow:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The blood samples will be screened for the ProALL miRs by Curewize Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Curewize will receive clinical data corresponding to the visit that the screened&#xD;
                blood sample was taken only after sending the clinical site the blood sample's miR&#xD;
                values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for Stage 1-Cross Sectional Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood Biomarker Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  miR-451 relative expression (ddCt) level&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  miR-151-5p relative expression (ddCt) level&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  miR-1290 relative expression (ddCt) level&#xD;
&#xD;
           Covariates:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MRD-PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BFM risk&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  White blood cell count at diagnosis and at blood collection if routinely tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Steroid response&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cytogenetic variables&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cross-Sectional Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage-1 is considered exploratory and will be used to design the analysis of Stage-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variables will be tested for normality with Shapiro Wilk's test. The level of expression&#xD;
           of miR-451, miR151-5p and miR-1290 will be compared between patients during remission&#xD;
           and patients during relapse by Mann-Whitney U test. Continuous data will be depicted in&#xD;
           box plots showing median and interquartile range. Logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
           test the miR values [nominal (positive/negative) and continuous] with each other and&#xD;
           with other variables comparing between patients at remission and patients at relapse.&#xD;
           The optimal combination Classifier will be created according to the above analysis.&#xD;
           Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency tables, indicating numbers and&#xD;
           frequencies of miR status (positive versus negative). Data will be compared by Fisher&#xD;
           exact for dichotomous (2x2 tables) values or chi-square or chi-square for trend for&#xD;
           tables. Odds ratios and likelihood ratios will be calculated. Receiver operating&#xD;
           characteristic curves will be created, the independent variables are miR-451 or&#xD;
           miR-151-p, miR-1290 and dependent variable is relapse or remission. Receiver operating&#xD;
           characteristic curves will be created for the combined Classifier. Additional analyses&#xD;
           will be performed if results from planned analyses give reasonable warrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for Stage 2-Prospective Study Will be created after&#xD;
           report of results of Stage-1 Cross Section Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Ethical Considerations The study will be conducted according to the principles of the&#xD;
           World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical&#xD;
           Research Involving Human Subjects JAMA. 2013Í¾310(20):2191-2194 and in accordance with&#xD;
           local GCP regulations.&#xD;
