    <textblock>
      AntibioTx is developping ATx201 as a topical product for treatment of skin infections,&#xD;
      including infected atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of skin infections, including infected atopic dermatitis, is plagued by inactivity&#xD;
      of or resistance towards the main topical antibiotics. Accordingly, the infections are either&#xD;
      not effectively treated or harsher systemic antibiotics with side effects are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections in atopic dermatitis are predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and various&#xD;
      species of Streptococcus. ATx201 is a potent antibiotic against these and other organisms.&#xD;
      ATx201 overcomes current resistance problems such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) as well as resistance towards all&#xD;
      topical antibiotics. ATx201 also exhibits an extraordinarily strong ability to delay the&#xD;
      onset of de novo resistance compared to currently marketed antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a combined Phase I/II study with 36 healthy volunteers and 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of new topical&#xD;
      formulations of ATx201 in healthy volunteers, and in a population of patients with infected&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis. Efficacy of ATx201 in eradicating S. aureus compared to vehicle after 4&#xD;
      and 7 days of treatment will be evaluated. In Phase I of the study, three formulations of&#xD;
      ATx201 including the respective Placebos will be applied to healthy volunteers. One&#xD;
      formulation will advance into Phase II, where patients will be treated with the respective&#xD;
      formulation or Placebo.&#xD;
