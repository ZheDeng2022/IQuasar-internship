    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary data regarding the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib, in adults with active, treatment-refractory&#xD;
      dermatomyositis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare, progressively debilitating disorder that affects the muscle&#xD;
      (causing weakness) and skin (causing a rash) in most affected patients. DM can also involve&#xD;
      multiple body systems including the lungs, joints, gut and heart. Therapy for DM involves&#xD;
      administering corticosteroids, typically with an immunosuppressive agent, but treatment&#xD;
      options for refractory DM are very limited. This research is being done to determine the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor called Tofacitinib in adults with&#xD;
      active, treatment-refractory dermatomyositis. The investigators will also look for specific&#xD;
      biomolecular changes in blood, skin, and muscle when it is exposed to Tofacitinib.&#xD;
      Tofacitinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. The study aim is to conduct a 12-week, open-label, pilot study with up&#xD;
      to 10 patients who have refractory DM to assess whether a JAK inhibitor effectively and&#xD;
      safely reduces the symptoms of DM in both the skin and muscle. This study consists of up to 9&#xD;
      study visits over 6 months. There is an optional treatment extension period of 4 weeks. All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo follow-up assessments 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Results from&#xD;
      this study will contribute to the design of future trials that will further define the role&#xD;
      of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of patients with dermatomyositis.&#xD;
