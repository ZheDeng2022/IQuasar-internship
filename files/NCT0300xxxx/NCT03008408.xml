  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well everolimus and letrozole with or without ribociclib work&#xD;
      in treating participants with endometrial cancer that has spread to other areas of the body&#xD;
      or has come back. Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs such as everolimus and letrozole have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective at stopping tumor growth either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib, everolimus, and letrozole&#xD;
      may work better than everolimus and letrozole in treating participants with endometrial&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the addition of ribociclib (LEE011) to everolimus and letrozole improves&#xD;
      progression free survival in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine clinical benefit and the median duration of progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma&#xD;
      treated with ribociclib (LEE011), everolimus and letrozole versus everolimus and letrozole&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with ribociclib&#xD;
      (LEE011), everolimus (RAD001), and letrozole in this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the presence of a CTNNB1 mutation is associated with response to ribociclib&#xD;
      (LEE011), everolimus (RAD001), and letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if liquid biopsies at baseline and 8 weeks correlate with presence of a&#xD;
      tissue mutation or response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ribociclib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD), everolimus PO QD, and&#xD;
      letrozole PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus PO QD and letrozole PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has signed the informed consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being&#xD;
             performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically-confirmed endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid and&#xD;
             mixed endometrioid tumors, any grade).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have advanced or recurrent disease that is refractory to curative&#xD;
             treatment based on imaging or clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must consent to allow for a baseline tumor biopsy. Tumor material from&#xD;
             biopsies done before the screening period are acceptable if the biopsy was performed&#xD;
             within 3 months prior to the planned treatment start and no other systemic cancer&#xD;
             therapy was administered in the interim. If a biopsy is performed and the specimen is&#xD;
             considered non-diagnostic, does not have enough tissue, or the biopsy is deemed&#xD;
             infeasible to perform, this does not prevent the patient from proceeding with the&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for recurrent&#xD;
             endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation&#xD;
             as a radio-sensitizer is not counted as a prior treatment for recurrent or advanced&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy of any kind is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with letrozole is allowed if the patient meets the washout period of&#xD;
             10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
             Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 defined as at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (&gt;= 10 mm longest dimension to be&#xD;
             recorded; Lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm per short axis). Each lesion must be &gt; 20 mm&#xD;
             when measured by palpation or conventional imaging techniques (computed tomography&#xD;
             [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] - based on primary physician preference) or &gt;&#xD;
             10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice&#xD;
             thickness in millimeters. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be&#xD;
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented. Ascites and&#xD;
             pleural effusions are not considered measurable disease. If the measurable disease is&#xD;
             confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by&#xD;
             cytology/histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant, breastfeeding or of child-bearing potential. Patients&#xD;
             are considered not of child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they&#xD;
             have undergone a total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for greater than 12 months (if patient is&#xD;
             uncertain of amenorrhea for 12 months, a pregnancy test will be done to confirm&#xD;
             pregnancy status). Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously&#xD;
             menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol &lt; 10 pm/mL to&#xD;
             confirm ovarian senescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be off all other anti-tumor therapies (including immunologic agents) for&#xD;
             at least four weeks prior to study registration. Patients on hormonal agents require a&#xD;
             washout for 10 days.&#xD;

             according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the absence of liver metastases, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). If the patient has liver&#xD;
             metastases, ALT and AST &lt; 5 x ULN (at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; ULN; or total bilirubin =&lt; 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x&#xD;
             ULN in patients with well-documented Gilbert's syndrome (at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting serum cholesterol =&lt; 240 mg/dL or =&lt; 7.75 mmol/L and fasting triglycerides =&lt;&#xD;
             2.5 x ULN (at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only&#xD;
                  be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with available standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) with the following&#xD;
             parameters at screening: a. Corrected QT interval by Fridericia's formula (QTcF)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to&#xD;
             National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not&#xD;

             immunosuppressive agent. Topical, short duration (&lt; 5 days) of systemic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week&#xD;
             of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received&#xD;
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples&#xD;
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,&#xD;
             bacillus Calmette-guerin (BCG), yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
