    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b study designed to evaluate the tolerability and safety of&#xD;
      lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC). The study will evaluate objective response rate and duration of response by modified&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) for HCC and Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on independent imaging review (IIR).&#xD;

Results in this summary are reported based on the primary completion date (31 October 2019) of study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 104 participants were enrolled and received treatment. Of these, 6 participants were enrolled in DLT part and 98 were enrolled in the expansion part.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>In DLT part, participants received lenvatinib 12 milligram (mg) or 8 mg capsules, orally, once daily, in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg, infusion, intravenously, every 3 weeks, in Cycle 1 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Participants with body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 60 kilogram (kg) received lenvatinib 12 mg, participants with body weight less than (&lt;) 60 kg, received lenvatinib 8 mg. Participants who discontinued treatment in Cycle 1, entered the follow-up phase. Participants who were still receiving treatment at the end of Cycle 1, continued to receive same treatment until progressive disease (PD), development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by sponsor. Upon confirmation of the tolerability of the tested combination regimen of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in in Cycle 1, expansion part was opened for participant's enrollment.</description>

        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 assessed by IIR analysis. Responses (PR or CR) were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the initial response. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions (a short diameter is &lt;10 millimeter [mm] if it exists in a lymph node). PR defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter (LD) (hereafter referred to as sum of LD) of all target lesions, as compared with Baseline summed LD.</description>

Participants with body weight &gt;=60 kg received lenvatinib 12 mg, participants with body weight &lt;60 kg, received lenvatinib 8 mg. Participants who discontinued treatment in Cycle 1, entered the follow-up phase. Participants who were still receiving treatment at the end of Cycle 1, continued to receive same treatment until PD, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by sponsor. Upon confirmation of the tolerability of the tested combination regimen of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in in Cycle 1, expansion part was opened for participant's enrolment.</description>
