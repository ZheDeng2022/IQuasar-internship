    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies efficacy of extracorporeal photopheresis and low dose aldesleukin&#xD;
      (interleukin-2) in treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) that does&#xD;
      not respond to upfront treatment with steroids. In graft-vs-host disease, patients have a&#xD;
      small quantity of a white blood cell called T regulatory cells or T-reg cells that helps to&#xD;
      control the immune system. Extracorporeal photopheresis is a procedure where patient's blood&#xD;
      is removed and treated with ultraviolet light and drugs that become active when exposed to&#xD;
      light. The treated blood is then returned to the patient and may be effective in increasing&#xD;
      T-reg cells in patients with cGVHD. Aldesleukin increases the activity and growth of white&#xD;
      blood cells, and it has shown to enhance T-reg cells in patients with cGVHD and may be&#xD;
      effective improving GVHD symptoms.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-cGVHD activity of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) when combined&#xD;
      with low dose IL-2 (interleukin 2) (aldesleukin), in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD,&#xD;
      as assessed by overall cGVHD response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response&#xD;
      [PR]+stable disease [SD]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution,&#xD;
      time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate overall and failure-free survival, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse,&#xD;
      through 1 year after initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Characterize chronic GVHD Symptom Scale scores -self-report (with assistance from&#xD;
      register nurses [RNs] and medical doctors [MDs]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the immunologic effects of low-dose daily subcutaneous (SC) IL-2 + ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlate clinical endpoints of response with ECP performance parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo&#xD;
      ECP twice weekly on weeks 1-4 and then receive 2 ECP treatments every 2 weeks on weeks 5-12.&#xD;
      Patients responding to upfront therapy with aldesleukin and ECP have the option to continue&#xD;
      combination therapy per the discretion of the treating physician until clinical benefit is&#xD;
      maintained or toxicities develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
