  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The promotion of language and communicative development in the early years is extremely&#xD;
      important. Children who enter school with good language skills have better educational and&#xD;
      economic success. This study is part of a large project across Liverpool, Manchester and&#xD;
      Sheffield Universities to determine how shared reading promotes child language development,&#xD;
      and use this knowledge to make it an effective language boosting tool for children across the&#xD;
      whole socio-economic spectrum. The overall project includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  observational studies to identify what language boosting behaviours are responsible for&#xD;
           shared reading's effectiveness, and how parents from different socio-economic groups use&#xD;
           these behaviours during shared reading;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intervention studies to evaluate packages designed to train parents in the use of&#xD;
           specific language boosting behaviours during reading;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a qualitative exploration of the reasons people may not read with their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide training to parents on how to develop their children's attention to&#xD;
      the features of words while reading books with them. The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Is specific training focused on the sound properties of words during shared reading more&#xD;
      effective at developing children's phonological awareness and language than general advice on&#xD;
      the importance of reading with children? ii) Do children with speech sound disorder and&#xD;
      typically developing children respond differently to intervention? iii) To what extent are&#xD;
      differences in training implementation and effects explained by socio-economic status?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our participants will be parents and their children, aged 30-54 months, with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      speech sound disorder. They will be recruited via speech and language therapy services in the&#xD;
      North West. Data collection will be carried out by the research team in participants' homes,&#xD;
      taking 3-4 hours in total over 2-3 appointments. The sessions will be audio-recorded; parents&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires, and children's language and speech will be assessed with&#xD;
      standardised and in-house tests.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participants Approximately 60 parent/child dyads will be recruited, where the child has a&#xD;
      speech sound disorder. Legal guardians other than parents will be eligible; for simplicity we&#xD;
      use the term 'parents'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expressions of interest from potential participants will be gained by the study team and&#xD;
      consent procedures will be administered by the study team only. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited in the North West of England and in North Wales. In order to recruit enough&#xD;
      participants of low SES, areas of disadvantage will be more heavily targeted for the first&#xD;
      three strategies listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be made aware of the study, and asked to indicate expressions of interest, via&#xD;
      the following routes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SLT services who will be approached to identify children and families from their current&#xD;
           and recently discharged caseloads who may be suitable for inclusion in the project*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advertisements in the media, with the help of University Press Officers, and&#xD;
           distribution of leaflets and posters (see attached) in the community (nurseries,&#xD;
           playgroups, mother and toddler groups, libraries and sports centres that host activities&#xD;
           for young children, baby sign language groups, General Practitioner (GP) surgeries,&#xD;
           pre-school libraries, health visitors, baby clinics, Children's Centres and similar).&#xD;
           All posters and flyers will include the same text, including contact details for the&#xD;
           research team (work details only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  direct liaison with local community groups and professionals interacting with parents&#xD;
           and children in the community&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  personal visits to local community centres and groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  word of mouth recruitment of participants' friends/families&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recruitment of volunteers who have directly contacted the University of Manchester to&#xD;
           express an interest in this or other research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  internet-based recruitment (including social media) with online sign-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  parents who have already volunteered to participate at collaborators' and colleagues'&#xD;
           laboratories, and have indicated their willingness to be contacted about other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following expressions of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the information sheet and sample consent form will be sent through the post or via email&#xD;
           to potential participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least 48 hours later, follow-up phone calls will be made to answer queries and check&#xD;
           ongoing interest. During this phone call the researcher will discuss in detail with the&#xD;
           family what the study involves, including their right to withdraw from the study, and&#xD;
           reassure parents on procedures for data collection and storage that ensure&#xD;
           confidentiality and anonymity. If the participant is happy to be involved, the&#xD;
           researcher will run through an eligibility checklist to ensure the family are suitable&#xD;
           for the study based on the exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the researcher will recap this information the first testing session and the parent&#xD;
           will, if willing, sign the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during this initial testing session, the family's suitability for the study will be&#xD;
           checked again from the Family Questionnaire, and speech production screen for children&#xD;
           with SSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procedure for recruitment via SLT services SLT services will be approached to&#xD;
                identify children and families potentially suitable for inclusion in the project.&#xD;
                They will be provided with information sheets (standard and child-friendly) and&#xD;
                consent sheets to give to families who are suitable. Families will be invited to&#xD;
                read the materials and indicate willingness to hear more about/take part in the&#xD;
                project by either a) responding directly to the researchers via contact details on&#xD;
                the form or b) responding via their local SLT contact who will pass on contact&#xD;
                details to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On contact, the research team will answer by telephone or email any queries raised by&#xD;
      parents, and will run through an eligibility checklist to ensure the family are suitable for&#xD;
      the study based on appropriate items from the inclusion/exclusion criteria set out above. If&#xD;
      parents agree, researchers will arrange a visit to the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Consent will be sought at the beginning of the first assessment session. If signed&#xD;
      consent is obtained, data collection will commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the adults taking part in this study (parents/guardians) will be able to give informed&#xD;
      consent on their own behalf (see exclusion criteria above). The children taking part in this&#xD;
      study will be aged between 3;6 and 4;6 years of age and are thus not deemed able to give&#xD;
      informed consent; their parents or legal guardians will give consent on their behalf.&#xD;
      Children will be asked to give verbal assent. Indications of distress will also be taken as&#xD;
      non-consent during assessment; in such cases tasks will be re-commenced or re-scheduled or&#xD;
      the child withdrawn from the study, according to parental preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal If the assessments show the children/ parents do not meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      they will be withdrawn from the study and their data not used. Families themselves will be&#xD;
      told and reminded that they are free to withdraw from the study at any point without giving a&#xD;
      reason. Families can withdraw in writing, in person, by email or by phoning any member of the&#xD;
      research study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding Randomisation will be determined using a computerised random&#xD;
      number generator with equal randomisation to intervention and attention control, and a block&#xD;
      randomisation design to ensure equal numbers of participants in each condition in rolling&#xD;
      recruitment. The allocation sequence will be held by an administrative member of staff and&#xD;
      the two researchers will call that person to obtain the group allocation when they have&#xD;
      enrolled a participant in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be blind to the arm of the study they are in. Both groups will receive a&#xD;
      training session of similar length, one focusing specifically on sounds in words and the&#xD;
      other offering general advice on reading with children. The researcher enrolling and training&#xD;
      the participants will obviously know which group the participant is in. However, the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment will be carried out by a different researcher who is blinded to&#xD;
      group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and training Assessments and training will take place by one of the named&#xD;
      researchers, either in the family home or the University according to room availability and&#xD;
      family preference. The assessments and questionnaires to be completed are listed below (not&#xD;
      all of them require the child's involvement). It may be possible to complete everything on&#xD;
      one long visit (estimated two hours). However , more likely, at parent request or with their&#xD;
      agreement, assessments and training will take place over two appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLS-5: A standardized measure of language development. The investigators will use both the&#xD;
      Auditory Comprehension and Expressive Communication scales to confirm language ability.&#xD;
      Completion time: 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIPA: a standardised assessment of phonological awareness. Completion time 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Family Questionnaire: records relevant demographic information (e.g. socio-economic&#xD;
      status, parents' education, family language use, ethnicity), devised for the ESRC-funded&#xD;
      UK-CDI study. This allows the investigators to create a composite socio-economic variable in&#xD;
      order to identify high and low SES families. Completion time: 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Life Questionnaire: a parent report questionnaire including frequency of storybook&#xD;
      reading, library visits, number of children's books in the home, parental reading habits etc.&#xD;
      Completion time: 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's Title and Author Checklists: These checklists indirectly measure a child's&#xD;
      storybook exposure by assessing the parent's knowledge of children's book titles and authors&#xD;
      (Children's Author Checklist). They each contain a mixture of real authors/title and foils.&#xD;
      Completion time: 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech production screen: a 20 item picture-naming task to confirm presence/absence of speech&#xD;
      sound disorder. Completion time: 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syllable segmentation screen: a custom-designed assessment to assess the ability of a child&#xD;
      to segment words into constituent syllables. Completion time: 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training in reading strategies or habits: an interactive 45-minute session in which parents&#xD;
      are trained in either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. how to draw children's attention to the sound structure of words during the&#xD;
           shared-reading of books which emphasise word form, and generalizing this into everyday&#xD;
           conversation; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the importance of reading with children, how language develops in children during the&#xD;
           3;6-4;6 period, and strategies for fitting reading into the daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of involvement in the study Seven weeks, including assessment sessions and&#xD;
      intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse events are not considered to be above the level of&#xD;
      everyday risk. Participants are not being recruited on the basis of any medical condition and&#xD;
      the study does not involve any procedure that might cause an untoward or unexpected adverse&#xD;
      event. All the methodologies used are established, standard tasks in the field of language&#xD;
      acquisition research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording and reporting adverse (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) All adverse events will&#xD;
      be recorded. Participants will be provided with contact details of the Chief Investigator and&#xD;
      the Research Governance Office at the University of Manchester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All non-serious AEs will be reported to the Chief Investigator (CI), Dr Anne Hesketh, and&#xD;
      will be recorded by the study team. NHS Research Ethics Committee will be notified of AEs&#xD;
      online via the IRAS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of an SAE, details will be recorded and emailed to the CI within 24 hours, who&#xD;
      in turn will immediately report them to the University's Research Governance Officer and the&#xD;
      NHS Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS The statistics and data analysis for the overall project were&#xD;
      subject to internal review at the University of Liverpool and scrutinised in detail by the&#xD;
      ESRC reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant numbers are based on power calculations for the intervention studies of the&#xD;
      over-arching project which are based on the following assumptions: Power = .80; Alpha = .05;&#xD;
      Medium effect size: d = 0.5, f2= .15. The intervention studies are powered to check for an&#xD;
      effect of intervention compared to control and to check whether, for participants in the&#xD;
      intervention condition, socio-economic status (SES) explains intervention effect. To test for&#xD;
      this, 55 participants per group are needed (to compare mean difference scores for&#xD;
      intervention and control conditions with an independent t-test, and to run a regression model&#xD;
      with difference scores as the outcome measure and SES as a continuous predictor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of statistical tests will be carried out depending on the nature of the hypotheses.&#xD;
      ANOVAs, regression models, mixed effects models, and correlations will be used. Statistics&#xD;
      will be performed in Excel, SPSS and R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGULATORY ISSUES Ethics approval The study is being submitted to the NHS REC (families with&#xD;
      children with SSD) for ethics approval. Ethics approval has already been gained from the UREC&#xD;
      for families/children with typical speech development. It will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the recommendations for research on human subjects adopted by the 18th World Medical&#xD;
      Assembly, Helsinki 1964 and later revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The overall grant CI (Liverpool) will oversee the confidentiality of&#xD;
      participants taking part in the study and is registered under the Data Protection Act. A data&#xD;
      management plan is in place which conforms to the requirements of the ESRC and all&#xD;
      participating Universities; it is the responsibility of the CI at each participating&#xD;
      University to adhere to the Data Management Plan for their studies. All data will be&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymised. Each participant will be given a participant identification code and all&#xD;
      data (case report form, test scoresheets, video/audio files, questionnaires transcripts) will&#xD;
      be identified using this code. A separate, password-protected datafile will allow members of&#xD;
      the immediate study team only (but no others) to match participant code with participant&#xD;
      identification information. Video data will be transferred from the camera to secure&#xD;
      University servers on return to base. Data recorded on encrypted laptops will transferred to&#xD;
      secure University servers on return to base. Paper copies of questionnaires will be labelled&#xD;
      by code and kept securely according to ESRC and University data retention policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance The University of Manchester will arrange insurance for research involving human&#xD;
      subjects that provides cover for legal liabilities arising from its actions of those or its&#xD;
      staff or supervised students, subject to policy terms and conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audits and inspections The study may be subject to inspection and audit by the University of&#xD;
      Manchester under their remit as sponsor and other regulatory bodies to ensure adherence to&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice and the NHS Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care&#xD;
      (2nd edition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      END OF STUDY The study will end on 31/03/2018 when the funding comes to an end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARCHIVING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be shared with the UK Data Archive in accordance with the funder's (ESRC) data&#xD;
      sharing guidelines http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/. Data will be managed on three tiers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data that will be made fully publically accessible. This will include new anonymised&#xD;
           corpora of transcripts that will be donated to CHILDES&#xD;
           (http://talkbank.org/share/ethics.html) and the UK Data Archive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data that will be made publically accessible in fully anonymised summary form via the UK&#xD;
           Data Archive (e.g. experimental datasheets in Excel or SPSS that allow others to&#xD;
           replicate the analyses in published papers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data that will only be available to the immediate research team (e.g. raw uncoded data,&#xD;
           video &amp; audio recordings that do not have permission for data sharing, consent forms,&#xD;
           any other data that allows the identification of participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISSEMINATION POLICY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study contribute to the overall project dissemination plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outputs for academic users in high impact interdisciplinary and specialist journals and via&#xD;
      academic conference presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outputs for non-academic users to include newsletters for parents, reports for early years&#xD;
      practitioners and policy makers, press releases, and invited conference talks. All these will&#xD;
      be produced in collaboration with the ESRC LuCiD Centre (Manchester, Liverpool and Lancaster&#xD;
      Universities) and will follow the LuCiD Centre's Communications Agenda. The Policy&#xD;
      Implementation Strategy will communicate best practice and crucial findings to the local and&#xD;
      central government bodies responsible for early years and health policy; The LuCiD for&#xD;
      Professionals programme will establish a comprehensive communication strategy for the&#xD;
      dissemination of findings to healthcare and education professionals; the Discovering BabyTalk&#xD;
      programme will establish a comprehensive public outreach agenda for families and the wider&#xD;
      public, to provide them with the best evidence-based advice, and the tools they need to&#xD;
      promote language growth; the media strategy, co-produced with University press offices, will&#xD;
      disseminate the current research to the general, scientific and trade press for health and&#xD;
      education professionals.&#xD;
