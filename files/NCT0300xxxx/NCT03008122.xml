      This study is randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1, dose de-escalation&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Alum Adjuvanted Zika&#xD;
      Virus Purified Inactivated Vaccine (ZPIV) administered to healthy male and non-pregnant&#xD;
      female adult subjects. This study will enroll 90 healthy male and non-pregnant female&#xD;
      subjects between the ages of 21 and 49 and will be conducted at Ponce Medical School&#xD;
      Foundation, Inc.-CAIMED in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The duration of each subject's participation&#xD;
      is approximately 26 months from recruitment through the last study visit. The entire study is&#xD;
      expected to take approximately 49 months to complete. Two dose levels will be evaluated. Each&#xD;
      subject will receive either placebo or 5 mcg (Group 1) or 2.5 mcg (Group 2) of ZPIV&#xD;
      administered by intramuscular (IM) injection on Days 1 and 29. Solicited local and systemic&#xD;
      reactogenicity data will be collected from all subjects through Day 8 after each vaccination.&#xD;
      All subjects will be monitored for occurrence of unsolicited adverse events until 28 days&#xD;
      after the second vaccination. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days,&#xD;
      a vaccination period in which subjects will receive a prime dose of vaccine on Day 1 followed&#xD;
      by a boost on Day 29, and a follow-up period of 24 months post boost vaccination. Primary&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) Assess the safety and reactogenicity of a homologous prime boost regimen&#xD;
      of ZPIV given at two different dose levels. 2) Compare the safety and reactogenicity of ZPIV&#xD;
      after each vaccination, between dosage groups, and by pre-vaccination flavivirus immune&#xD;
      status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1, dose&#xD;
      de-escalation study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a purified&#xD;
      inactivated, alum-adjuvanted ZIKV vaccine (ZPIV) administered in a homologous prime-boost&#xD;
      regimen to healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects living in a flavivirus-endemic&#xD;
      area. This study will enroll 90 subjects between the ages of 21 and 49 and will be conducted&#xD;
      at Ponce Medical School Foundation, Inc.-CAIMED in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The entire duration of&#xD;
      each subject's participation is approximately 26 months including recruitment and collection&#xD;
      of data on the safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccine and collection of samples for&#xD;
      the assessment of immunogenicity. This study is expected to take approximately 49 months to&#xD;
      complete. Two dose levels will be evaluated. Each subject will receive either placebo or 5&#xD;
      mcg (Group 1) or 2.5 mcg (Group 2) of ZPIV administered by intramuscular (IM) injection on&#xD;
      Days 1 and 29. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination&#xD;
      period in which subjects will receive a prime dose of vaccine on Day 1 followed by a&#xD;
      homologous boost on Day 29, and a follow-up period of 24 months post boost vaccination. The&#xD;
      study will begin with enrollment of 2 sentinel subjects in Group 1 who will receive 5 mcg&#xD;
      ZPIV open label. One sentinel subject will be vaccinated, followed for one day for safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and if no halting rules are met per determination of the PI and co-PI, then&#xD;
      the second sentinel subject will receive 5 mcg ZPIV open-label. Both sentinels will be&#xD;
      followed for safety through Day 8 and if no predefined halting rules are met and no safety&#xD;
      concerns are identified, then enrollment of the Group 1 non-sentinel subjects will proceed in&#xD;
      double-blind fashion. The same procedure will be used for administration of the boost&#xD;
      vaccination to the Group 1 sentinels: 1 sentinel (can be either) will receive 5 mcg ZPIV&#xD;
      open-label, be followed for one day for safety and reactogenicity, and if no halting rules&#xD;
      are met, then the 2nd sentinel will receive the boost vaccine. Both sentinels will be&#xD;
      followed until Day 8 after 2nd vaccination for safety and reactogenicity and if no halting&#xD;
      rules are met, then boost vaccination of the Group 1 non-sentinel subjects can proceed.&#xD;
      Enrollment of the 2.5 mcg ZPIV group (Group 2) can begin after or at the same time&#xD;
      non-sentinel subjects in Group 1 receive the 1st dose of vaccine. As of December 18, 2017,&#xD;
      the majority of non-sentinel subjects in Group 1 have already received the 1st dose and have&#xD;
      been followed until Day 8 for safety and reactogenicity, and no halting rules have been met&#xD;
      or safety concerns identified. As this is a dose de-escalation study, concurrent enrollment&#xD;
      of some remaining non-sentinel subjects in Groups 1 is permitted after enrollment of Group 2&#xD;
      subjects has begun; also, no sentinel subjects will be used in Group 2. All subjects in Group&#xD;
      2 will receive study product or placebo in double-blind fashion. The original study design&#xD;
      planned to enroll 40 ZPIV recipients and 5 placebo recipients in each Group. However, due a&#xD;
      natural disaster (hurricane Maria), 11 subjects enrolled in Group 1 had loss of samples at&#xD;
      key timepoints. To rebalance the number of evaluable subjects between Groups, Group 1&#xD;
      enrollment will be increased by 5 subjects and Group 2 enrollment will be decreased by 5&#xD;
      subjects, for a total enrollment of 50 subjects in Group 1 and 40 in Group 2. Treatment&#xD;
      assignments for both groups will be assigned according to the originally planned 8:1 ratio of&#xD;
      ZPIV: placebo. Without compromising the blind of the study, we can anticipate approximately&#xD;
      35 evaluable ZPIV recipients and approximately 5 evaluable placebo recipients in each group.&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a homologous boost of ZPIV or placebo 28 days post-prime if no&#xD;
      halting rules precluding second vaccination are met (Section 9). All subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored for occurrence of unsolicited AEs until 28 days after the second vaccination SAEs,&#xD;
      AESIs, and history of new medical conditions with onset after the first vaccination will be&#xD;
      collected for the duration of the study. Blood for evaluation of antibodies to ZIKV by ELISA&#xD;
      and neutralizing antibody assays will be collected at Visit 00, prior to each vaccination,&#xD;
      and at multiple timepoints afterward. Primary objectives are: 1) Assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of a homologous prime boost regimen of ZPIV given at two different dose levels&#xD;
      in a dose de-escalation format in healthy adult subjects who live in Puerto Rico, a&#xD;
      flavivirus endemic area. 2) Compare the safety and reactogenicity profile of ZPIV after each&#xD;
      vaccination, between dosage groups, and by pre-vaccination flavivirus immune status.&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are: 1) Assess the humoral immune response to a homologous prime-boost&#xD;
      regimen of ZPIV after each dose of vaccine as determined by kinetics of the immune responses,&#xD;
      seroconversion rates, and Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) overall, and compare results between&#xD;
      dosage groups and by pre-vaccination flavivirus immune status. 2) Assess the durability of&#xD;
      the humoral immune response to ZPIV at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the second vaccine&#xD;
      administration overall, and compare results between dosage groups and by pre-vaccination&#xD;
      flavivirus immune status.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: If laboratory screening tests are out of acceptable range, repeat of&#xD;
                  screening tests is permitted once, provided there is an alternative explanation&#xD;
                  for the out of range value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be in good health based on the investigator's clinical judgment when considering&#xD;
             findings from past medical history, medication use, vital signs, and an abbreviated&#xD;
             physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 1: Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in&#xD;
             the exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical exam and vital&#xD;
             signs. If the subject has a preexisting condition not listed in exclusion criteria, it&#xD;
             cannot meet any of the following criteria: 1) first diagnosed in last 3 months; 2)&#xD;
             worsening in terms of clinical outcome in last 6 months; or 3) involves need for&#xD;
             medication that may pose a risk to subject's safety or impede assessment of adverse&#xD;
             events or immunogenicity if they participate in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 2: An abbreviated physical exam differs from a complete exam in that it does not&#xD;
             include a genitourinary and rectal exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 3: Vital signs must be normal by protocol toxicity grading scale or determined to&#xD;
             be normal-variant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood&#xD;
             pressure due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10&#xD;
             minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be re-measured.&#xD;
             Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential* must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately prior to each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: All female subjects are considered of childbearing potential unless&#xD;
             postmenopausal or surgically sterilized and &gt; /= 3 months have passed since&#xD;
             sterilization procedure. Postmenopausal is defined as amenorrhea for &gt; /= 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause. Permanent female sterilization procedures&#xD;
             include tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
             or successful Essure placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception* from&#xD;
             one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Acceptable methods of contraception include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use highly effective contraceptive methods, defined by &lt; 1% failure rate per year&#xD;
                  independent of user adherence, including long-acting reversible contraception&#xD;
                  (LARC): progestin-releasing subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUD), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use effective contraceptive methods, defined by 5-9% failure rate with typical&#xD;
