  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of OncoSil™ in a patient population undergoing standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment for pancreatic cancer. This study has been designed to satisfy regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 15 sites in Australia, the&#xD;
      United Kingdom and Europe (Belgium) involving 40 patients.&#xD;

      Detailed description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety of an active implantable&#xD;
      (radiological) medical device OncoSil™, when implanted into patients with pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      in conjunction with Standard of Care (SOC) chemotherapy. OncoSil™, is an experimental&#xD;
      treatment and carries the active treatment &quot;radioactive Phosphorous (32P)&quot; inside inactive&#xD;
      silicon particles. Once implanted, the OncoSil™ Microparticles will stay in the tumour&#xD;
      permanently. The purpose of OncoSil™, is to deliver the action of 32P directly into a&#xD;
      targeted tumour to destroy cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 Patients will be taking part in a single arm open label research study - which means that&#xD;
      everyone in the research study will receive the investigational treatment OncoSil™, plus&#xD;
      their prescribed standard chemotherapy regimen which will be either; FOLFIRINOX (FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      is the name of a combination of chemotherapy drugs used to treat advanced cancer of the&#xD;
      pancreas) or gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Safety and Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local Disease Control Rate at 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local Progression Free Survival (LPFS), within the pancreas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS), all sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impaired function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain Scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening period will be performed within a 2 week period, followed by a treatment period&#xD;
      of investigational visits which will occur weekly from Day 0 (Visit 1) until week 12, then 4&#xD;
      weeks later at week 16, and then at 8-weekly intervals until study participants reach&#xD;
      documented progression of disease criteria for both LPFS and PFS which marks the end of study&#xD;
      participation i.e. EOS visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8-weekly review of medical records will be used to monitor possible device or late&#xD;
      radiation related adverse events, and oncology treatments/procedures administered for up to&#xD;
      12 months post OncoSil™ implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival will be conducted via 8-weekly medical record reviews until study&#xD;
      participant death, or until 104 weeks post the last study participant enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity (Dose): The intended average absorbed radiation dose per treated tumour is 100 Gy&#xD;
      (+20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks associated with OncoSil™ and/or implantation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following adverse events, considered to have a causal relationship with OncoSil™ or&#xD;
      procedure, were recorded during previous clinical studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure-related pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal pain and discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lethargy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal liver function tests&#xD;

             post enrolment, with OncoSil™ implantation to occur during the fourth (4th) week of&#xD;
             the first chemotherapy cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Provide signed Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing and able to complete study procedures within the study timelines.&#xD;
&#xD;

         10. Adequate liver function: serum liver transaminases ≤ 3 × ULN and serum bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≤ 1.5 × ULN*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *For study participants with recent biliary obstruction treated by drainage (e.g.&#xD;
             stent), serum bilirubin of &gt; 1.5 x ULN will be accepted for study entry provided that&#xD;
             serial levels demonstrate clear improvement. In addition, chemotherapy should not be&#xD;
             commenced until serum bilirubin is ≤ 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate bone marrow function: white blood cells (WBCs) ≥ 3,000/mm3, absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, haemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Life expectancy of at least 3 months at the time of screening as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Treated with or eligible to commence prophylactic treatment with a proton-pump&#xD;
             inhibitor prior to implantation, and to continue to receive treatment for at least 6&#xD;
             months post implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Not pregnant, and if of childbearing potential, agrees to use adequate birth control&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of distant metastases, based on review of baseline CT scan, as determined by&#xD;
             the central reading centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. More than one primary lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of other investigational agent at the time of screening, or within 30 days or five&#xD;
             half-lives of Screening Visit 1, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In the opinion of the investigator, EUS directed implantation posing undue study&#xD;
             participant risk. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  where previous EUS-FNA was considered technically too difficult to perform;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  imaging demonstrates multiple collateral vessels surrounding or adjacent to the&#xD;
                  target tumour within the pancreas;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  presence (or significant risk) of varices near to the target tumour. Note: The&#xD;
                  feasibility of implantation of the target tumour and assessment of risk can be&#xD;
                  conducted at any time between Screening Visit 1 and the implantation date. A&#xD;
                  study participant should be considered for withdrawal prior to and including at&#xD;
                  the time of OncoSil™ treatment, if any of the above risk features become apparent&#xD;
                  following subject screening and/or enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of malignancy, treated or untreated, within the past five years whether or not&#xD;
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of radiographic invasion into stomach, duodenum or peritoneum (if not certain&#xD;
             confirmation must be obtained prior to enrolment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A known allergy or history of hypersensitivity to silicon, phosphorous or any of the&#xD;
             OncoSil™ components.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any other health condition that would preclude participation in the study in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: T1-T3 is determined as per The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)&#xD;
        tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) classification and staging system for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
