  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyper polarized xenon-129 MRI (HXe MRI) is a unique imaging test which can detect how air is&#xD;
      flowing in and out of lungs and how oxygen can move from inhaled air into the blood. Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease in which patients develop narrowing of&#xD;
      airways, thus, having difficulties breathing air in and out their lungs and also damaging the&#xD;
      lung tissues which patients need to move oxygen from the air into blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, two drugs which are already approved by FDA (Anoro and Arnuity) will be&#xD;
      administered to patients who are already known to have COPD. While patients are being treated&#xD;
      with these two drugs (one drug at a time over a month), lung health by using usual testing&#xD;
      methods (CT scan of the lung, pulmonary function test, and blood test) will be assessed in&#xD;
      addition to HXe MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to prove that the HXe MRI is an excellent imaging test to show the&#xD;
      state of lung health among COPD patients and also to obtain new informations on how lung&#xD;
      health changes with drugs that are already approved by US FDA. This work is anticipated to&#xD;
      help develop HXe MRI as a new clinical test which can guide how to treat patients with COPD&#xD;
      and if new therapies can improve lung health of patients with COPD.&#xD;

    <description>In vivo lung physiology measurement obtained by HXe MRI pre and post drug intervention.&#xD;
In vivo lung physiology is measured by % of the lung that does not ventilate (dead space ventilation), among of the dissolved xenon-129 gas location among airways, interstitial tissues, or circulating red blood cells. These measures will be reported as continuous variables for data analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>First baseline only=day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Quantification of emphysematous lung tissues and abnormally thickened airways in correlation with changed detectable by HXe MRI.&#xD;
% of lung tissues with emphysema will be quantified by measuring tissue density using Hounsfield Unit (HU). Based on COPDgene and other studies, we will use HU &lt; -950 as emphysematous lung tissue. The lung CT scan will then be processed to yield % of lung tissue with emphysema. The airway thickness will be measured by standardized imaging algorithm developed by VIDA imaging.</description>

    <description>Measurement of in vivo lung physiology using clinical standard testing in correlation with HXe MRI changes pre and post drug intervention.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>At the conclusion of the study, correlation data between COPD phenotypes and changes in MRI characteristics will be shared. Data from individuals will be complied with unique study-generated subject ID after removing all personal identifiers. Once this is completed, the data may be shared with hyper polarized MR imaging network currently being formed in collaboration with University of WI, U Penn, Duke, U of Cincinnati, and U Missouri. The data will be accessible by these investigators after the data sharing plans are reviewed by the IRB of the record (at the University of Virginia).</ipd_description>
