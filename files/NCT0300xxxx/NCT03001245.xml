      The aim of this cluster randomized trial is to investigate whether the brief, 1+6 session&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention, Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) is more effective than standard&#xD;
      professional treatment (ST) in the treatment of mild or moderate depression among 12 to&#xD;
      17-year-old adolescents in services provided by school health care and counseling&#xD;
      professionals (school nurses, school psychologists and school social workers). The clients&#xD;
      are identified from the pool of adolescents routinely seen in school health care and&#xD;
      counseling services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 54 school nurses, social workers, and psychologists from all public secondary&#xD;
      schools in the standard education system of City of Espoo, Finland will be trained in IPC in&#xD;
      a three-day workshop in two waves. Each school (plus the one primary care level health care&#xD;
      unit for adolescents in Espoo) is represented by 1-3 trial IPC counselors. In the first wave&#xD;
      the schools are cluster randomized to provide either A) 1+6 sessions of IPC, or B) 1+6&#xD;
      sessions of standard treatment (ST), which consists of psychosocial work as guided by the&#xD;
      workers' own standard professional principles and methods. The workers randomized to deliver&#xD;
      IPC get the IPC training immediately. In the second wave those who delivered ST in the first&#xD;
      wave will be trained in IPC. The data for this trial will be collected from the first wave.&#xD;
      The data collection period is one school year plus follow-up of clients after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clients are adolescents who have either self-referred themselves, are referred by other&#xD;
      school personnel, or by parents to the services offered in the school due to emotional&#xD;
      symptoms in the school year 2016 -2017 in the participating schools. They are screened with&#xD;
      the BDI at the initial visit to identify depressive symptoms. A diagnostic interview will be&#xD;
      administered to those exceeding a clinical cutoff. Main inclusion criterion is DSM-5&#xD;
      depressive disorder of either mild or moderate severity. Those with current harmful alcohol&#xD;
      use, acute suicidal ideation or behavior, severe depression or anxiety disorder, psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms or very low global level of functioning are excluded and offered other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clients will complete self-report questionnaires (BDI) as outcome measures. Their level&#xD;
      of depression symptoms will also be assessed with ADRS scale and their level of global&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning with the CGAS by the project IPC counselors / ST providers.&#xD;
      Moreover, the clients will complete the Young Person's Clinical Outcomes for Routine&#xD;
      Evaluation (YP-CORE) as a measure of global symptomatology after each session. A follow-up&#xD;
      interview at 3 months and 6 months after treatment termination will be arranged. The&#xD;
      K-SADS-PL will be used for diagnostic evaluation, the ADRS and the C-GAS to assess level of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and global functioning, and the adolescent completes both the BDI and&#xD;
      YP-CORE as self-reports of symptomatology.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of depression increases in adolescence. Depression is one of the most common&#xD;
      and clinically mental health disorder in this age group. In total, 5-10 % of adolescents&#xD;
      experience depression episodes, and among 1-2% of the age group depressive symptoms are&#xD;
      persistent and long-term (Costello et al., 2011; Marttunen &amp; Karlsson, 2010). Depression&#xD;
      causes significant distress and functional impairment to those affected by it. Furthermore,&#xD;
      depressions symptoms with onset in adolescents tend to predict symptom continuation or new&#xD;
      episodes in adulthood, and they associate with increased risk of suicide, hospital treatment,&#xD;
      psychosocial problems and concurrent anxiety, substance use, and conduct disorders (Weissman&#xD;
      et al., 1999; Marttunen et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only a minority of adolescents with mental health disorders seek help. Possible&#xD;
      reasons include lack of recognition of symptoms, stigma related to being referred to mental&#xD;
      health services, and lack of expertise in treating hold mental health resources. Research&#xD;
      also shows that intervening in the early phases of symptom expression is important (Horowitz&#xD;
      &amp; Garber, 2006) and that the longer the duration of a depressive episode is the poorer the&#xD;
      outcome to even an evidence based treatment is (Curry et al., 2006). Thus, many factors&#xD;
      support developing brief and effective interventions for treating mild/moderate depression in&#xD;
      the immediate surroundings of adolescents, e.g. schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A; see Mufson, 2004a) is one of the evidence&#xD;
      -based treatments for adolescent depression (Zhou et al., 2015). It is a 12-session&#xD;
      treatment, which focuses in the interpersonal relationships of adolescents and their&#xD;
      significance in relation to symptoms of depression. It has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      school-based mental health clinics (Mufson et al., 2004b). IPT-A is a 12-session treatment&#xD;
      focusing on problems on one problematic area in interpersonal relationships (grief,&#xD;
      interpersonal/role disputes, role transition, or interpersonal deficits/social isolation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short form of IPT, the one plus six-session interpersonal counseling (IPC) has been&#xD;
      developed to address needs of depressive individuals in contexts where a brief intervention&#xD;
      offers advantages (Weissmann et al., 2014). It has been shown to be effective when treating&#xD;
      depressive symptoms of adults in primary level of care (Kontunen et al., 2015; Menchetti ym.&#xD;
      2014). IPC can be provided by healthcare workers and counseling personnel without mental&#xD;
      health training (Weissman et al., 2014). IPC may also be suited especially well for&#xD;
      adolescents with milder symptoms depression. Due to its brevity it may be especially suitable&#xD;
      to be implemented in schools, where barriers formed by school curriculum and multiple tasks&#xD;
      required of the school health care workers must be taken in account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, few studies have investigated the efficacy and effectiveness of IPC in adolescent&#xD;
      samples. Mufson et al. (2015) examined the feasibility of a brief, six-session version of&#xD;
      IPT-A in a group of 12-19 in an open study finding support for its utility and feasibility in&#xD;
      this age group. Currently, a pilot trial of IPC in an adolescent sample is ongoing in the UK&#xD;
      (see: http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/interpersonal-counseling-evaluation/).&#xD;
      More data is needed about the feasibility of IPC among adolescents in school settings and its&#xD;
      effectiveness as compared with routine care offered by school nurses, school social workers&#xD;
      and school psychologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The purpose of this cluster randomized trial is to investigate whether the brief 1+6&#xD;
      session-long Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) is effective in the treatment of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms among 13 to 16-year-old adolescents in the routine care provided by school health&#xD;
      care professionals (consisting of school health care nurses, school psychologists and school&#xD;
      social workers) who have been trained in IPC. The participants are adolescents who either&#xD;
      seek help from these school heath care professionals or are referred to them by other school&#xD;
      workers or their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, and training and supervision of the trial counselors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personnel working in school health care and counseling services from all of the 27 public&#xD;
      upper secondary schools in the standard education system of the City of Espoo, and the&#xD;
      personnel working in the only low-treshold primary level healthcare unit for adolescents in&#xD;
      Espoo were invited to participate in the project as project IPC counselors. Altogether, 54 of&#xD;
      them were willing to participate, i.e., to be trained in IPC and to deliver the treatment.&#xD;
      The schools (and the one primary level clinic) were each represented by 1-3 workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, the schools (i.e. the workers working in each of them) were randomized to deliver&#xD;
      either A) 1+6 sessions of IPC, or B) 1+6 sessions of standard treatment (ST), which consists&#xD;
      of psychosocial intervention guided by the worker's routine professional's principles and&#xD;
      standard work methods. The workers who were randomized to deliver IPC got the IPC training&#xD;
      immediately. Those who were randomized to the ST group were instructed to deliver treatment&#xD;
      by their normal professional standards and routine methods. The data collection period is one&#xD;
      school year. After this time the participants in the RC group will be given IPC training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IPC training consists of one day basic training in IPT-A main principles plus two days of&#xD;
      targeted IPC training by experienced experts in the field. The staff belonging to the arm who&#xD;
      received IPC training (the project IPC counselors) are clinically supervised by clinicians&#xD;
      working in secondary level psychiatry services who have both IPT-A and IPC training,&#xD;
      throughout the data gathering period with the frequency of once in every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of clients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clients of this trial are adolescents who either self-refer themselves, are referred by&#xD;
      other school personnel, or by their parents to the services offered in the school by school&#xD;
      nurses, school social workers or school psychologists because of emotional symptoms in the&#xD;
      school year 2016 -2017 in each of the participating schools. They are first screened on their&#xD;
      first visit with a self-report instrument, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-21; Beck et&#xD;
      al., 1961) to identify symptoms of depression. If they are present above the clinical cutoff&#xD;
      for mild depressive symptoms, a clinical interview (K-SADS-PL adapted to DSM-5; see Kaufman&#xD;
      et al., 1997) by a trained research coordinator follows. In this stage, the main inclusion&#xD;
      criterion for the study, a diagnosis of a DSM-5 depressive disorder, severity either mild or&#xD;
      moderate, is ascertained. As an exclusion criterion, current harmful alcohol use as assessed&#xD;
      by AUDIT (Babor et al, 2001) is ruled out. Also the presence of acute suicidal ideation or&#xD;
      behavior, severe depression or anxiety disorder, psychotic symptoms or very low global level&#xD;
      of functioning are exclusion criteria, and if present these adolescents are offered other&#xD;
      treatment. Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria are referred to either a project IPC&#xD;
      counselor, or a project worker delivering ST, depending on the status of the school in the&#xD;
      cluster randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPC consists of one evaluation session, where symptoms of depression are reviewed and&#xD;
      evaluated, and treatment is being offered, and six treatment sessions following the IPC&#xD;
      protocol specified by Wilkinson et al. (personal notification). This manual is also used in a&#xD;
      UK pilot trial of IPC for adolescents (see:&#xD;
      http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/interpersonal-counseling-evaluation/). It is&#xD;
      compatible with Weissman's IPC manual (2014), and is developmentally tailored to reflect&#xD;
      themes relevant to adolescents. Quite similarly, ST consists of one evaluative session,&#xD;
      followed by six treatment sessions, which are guided by standard professional principles of&#xD;
      the treating project worker and methods routinely used and available to her/him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary outcome measures, the clients complete the BDI-21 (Beck et al., 1961) as a measure&#xD;
      of the severity of depressive symptoms after first, fourth and sixth treatment session and&#xD;
      the Young Person's Clinical Outcomes for Routine Evaluation (YP-CORE; Twigg et al., 2010) as&#xD;
      a measure of global symptomatology after each session. As primary observer-rated outcome&#xD;
      measures the project IPC counselor / project worker providing ST assess the severity of&#xD;
      adolescent's depressive symptoms with the Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS,&#xD;
      Revah-Levy ym. 2007) and the level of adolescent's global psychosocial functioning with the&#xD;
      Child Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) after first, fourth and sixth&#xD;
      treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up interview after 3 months and 6 months after treatment termination is arranged. A&#xD;
      research coordinator administers the K-SADS-PL (adapted for DSM-5, see Kaufman et al., 1997)&#xD;
      the ADRS (Revah-Levy ym. 2007), the C-GAS (Shaffer et al., 1983) and the adolescent completes&#xD;
      both the YP-CORE (Twigg et al., 2010) and the BDI-21 (Beck et al., 1961) questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use standard statistical methods for comparing IPC and RC groups. We will perform&#xD;
      estimation of between-groups effect sizes between adolescent groups receiving IPC and ST on&#xD;
      the primary outcome measures. A clinically significant change in the main outcome measure&#xD;
      scores will be defined according to standard procedures. Given we also perform diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation at the onset of the treatment and at 3 months and 6 months follow-up, we estimate&#xD;
      recovery and possible relapse in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
