  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays the association between radiotherapy and the anti- Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor&#xD;
      (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibody Cetuximab represents a valid option in the treatment of head&#xD;
      and neck locally advanced squamous neoplasm and, particularly, of oropharynx carcinoma. Up to&#xD;
      date we have only indirect comparison with the standard curative treatment (i.e. concurrent&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy) and the preliminary data show equivalent efficacy of both regimens. For&#xD;
      this reason, concurrent Cetuximab and radiotherapy is administered in patients not eligible&#xD;
      to chemoradiotherapy. The introduction of Cetuximab has been associated to new kind of&#xD;
      toxicities, especially cutaneous, that have increasingly reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to improve the toxicity/benefit ratio in patients receiving&#xD;
      concurrent radiotherapy and cetuximab for locally advanced head and neck neoplasm. Hence,&#xD;
      this improvement could be achieved by modulating radiation therapy dose per fraction&#xD;
      following Cetuximab pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

      Radiobiological rationale Overexpression of EGFR has been found to be involved into two&#xD;
      different mechanisms of response to ionizing radiations: the former is related to the&#xD;
      increased cell proliferation rate, the latter leading to lower radiosensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increasing of cell proliferation rate From an analysis of the already reported&#xD;
           evidences, we quantified the effect of a higher cell proliferation rate due to&#xD;
           overexpression of EGFR. These findings were reported in patients affected with squamous&#xD;
           carcinoma of head and neck district and evaluated for EGFR status. In those patients,&#xD;
           local recurrence was compared in patients with different length of treatment but at the&#xD;
           same fractionation. Consequently, the real doubling time in the subgroups with high and&#xD;
           low EGFR expression was extrapolated . From these extrapolated values, equivalent doses&#xD;
           of each day of non-delivered treatment have been calculated for patients who received&#xD;
           accelerated schedule. Furthermore, doses were reported in relation to the different&#xD;
           primary sites (oropharynx, larynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Modification of doubling time (TD) of neoplastic cell population in patients with Low&#xD;
           and High EGFR expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction of radiosensitivity Unfortunately, how radiosensitizing drugs can modify&#xD;
           radiosensitivity cannot be evaluated retrospectively. Actually, the efficacy is&#xD;
           evaluated on the basis of an overall effect of the treatment but radiosensitivity&#xD;
           changes day by day in radiation and pharmacological concurrent treatment. However, these&#xD;
           changing in radiosensitivity can be analysed in pre-clinical setting. In many reports, a&#xD;
           progressively higher radiosensitivity has been shown in cellular survival curves by&#xD;
           increasing EGFR inhibitor concentration. Nevertheless, the concentrations of EGFR&#xD;
           inhibitor do not correspond to in vivo concentration during radiotherapy delivery.&#xD;
           Fortunately, this data is obtainable from Cetuximab pharmacokinetic curve. Therefore,&#xD;
           cell survival curves corresponding to drug concentration were obtained by performing a&#xD;
           graphic interpolation. From these curves, daily radiosensitivity parameters were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, daily doses with respect to daily radiosensitivity were identified by&#xD;
      radiobiological calculation model. This fractionation, designed on Cetuximab&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, have been calculated to be equivalent to curative treatment (70Gy given&#xD;
      with conventional schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, lower cutaneous toxicity is expected with this &quot;modulated&quot; schedule due to&#xD;
      the possibly increased cellular repair. Pharmacokinetics data of Cetuximab we found on the&#xD;
      population: Vmax 4.38mg/h (15.4%), Km 74g/ml, central compartment volume Vl 2.83 l (18.6%),&#xD;
      peripheral compartment volume 2.43 l (56.4%) and intercompartmental clearance 0.103 l/h&#xD;
      (97.2%). Those parameters remain unmodified also during prolonged therapies. Administrated&#xD;
      doses have been found to be adequate to cell wall receptors saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A definition of overexpression of EGFR is still lacking. Different cut-offs have been&#xD;
      proposed to distinguish patients with &quot;high expression&quot; from patients with &quot;low expression&quot;&#xD;
      of EGFR. In a recent study the adoption of accelerated fractionation showed an advantage for&#xD;
      those patients with an expression of EGFR&gt;50%. Thus, we adopted this cut-off in our study.&#xD;
