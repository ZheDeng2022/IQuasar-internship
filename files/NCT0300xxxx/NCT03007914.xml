      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the treatments in two cohort for&#xD;
      COPD patients: one, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) cohort, which have been evaluated and&#xD;
      have certain effect; the other, conventional medicine treatments cohort, based on 2015 Global&#xD;
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD, with high prevalence, morbidity, mortality and economic burdens, affects millions&#xD;
      worldwide. Although many therapies exist and are being developed to relieve symptoms and&#xD;
      reduce mortality in COPD, most have only been studied in placebo-controlled efficacy studies&#xD;
      in highly selected populations. There are few clinical trials to compare therapeutic&#xD;
      alternatives in real world. Furthermore, some randomized controlled trials on comprehensive&#xD;
      TCM interventions, especially based on the TCM patterns, have been the certain evidence for&#xD;
      showing definite effect for COPD patients. In addition, studies in real world populations of&#xD;
      COPD that received different therapies that do have efficacy evidence was found wide&#xD;
      variations in care delivery. In short, there is a need for cohort study in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, prospective, cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM on&#xD;
      COPD patients. The cohort study will enroll approximately 2540 patients that in two cohort,&#xD;
      one, TCM cohort, which have been evaluated and have certain effect; the other, conventional&#xD;
      medicine treatments cohort, based on 2015 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung&#xD;
      Disease (GOLD).Subjects in two cohort will be followed-up 2 years.The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is the frequency of exacerbations. The secondary efficacy measures include mortality rate and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, FEV1, dyspnea (MMRC), exercise capacity( 6MWD), quality of life ( CAT,&#xD;
      SF-36 and COPD-PRO), and effectiveness satisfaction with treatment(ESQ-COPD).&#xD;
