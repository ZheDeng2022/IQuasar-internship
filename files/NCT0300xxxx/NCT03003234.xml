    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is an extremely common disorder of gastrointestinal function.&#xD;
      Recently, impaired duodenal mucosal integrity was reported as a potential pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism in FD. However, the factors controlling duodenal mucosal integrity remain unknown.&#xD;
      In this study, we evaluated whether the luminal bile salt content could play a role in&#xD;
      impaired duodenal permeability in FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duodenal biopsies were obtained from 25 healthy volunteers (HV) and 25 FD patients. Biopsies&#xD;
      were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure transepithelial resistance (TEER) and paracellular&#xD;
      permeability using fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dx4, MW 4kDa). Expression of bile&#xD;
      acid-sensing receptors (TGR5, VDR, PXR, FXR and CAR) in duodenal biopsies was measured by&#xD;
      western blot and real time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate eosinophil and&#xD;
      mastcell infiltration in duodenal biopsies of FD patients and HV. Duodenal fluid aspirates&#xD;
      were collected at fixed time points during 1 hour in fasted state and 1.5 hours after a&#xD;
      liquid meal (Nutridrink, 200ml). Concentration and composition of the bile salt pool&#xD;
      (including glycocholic acid (GC), taurocholic acid (TC), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC),&#xD;
      taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDC), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDC), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDC),&#xD;
      glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDC) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDC)) in these aspirates was&#xD;
      evaluated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring analysis&#xD;
      (LC-MS/MS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Rome III criteria defined functional dyspepsia (FD) as the presence of symptoms thought&#xD;
      to originate in the gastroduodenal region, in the absence of any organic, systemic or&#xD;
      metabolic disease that readily explains the complaints. FD is extremely common, affecting up&#xD;
      to 15-20% of the population and is associated with significantly decreased quality of life&#xD;
      and substantial healthcare costs. The available treatment options for FD are of limited&#xD;
      effectiveness, which reflects the poorly understood pathogenesis. Studies indicate that FD is&#xD;
      a heterogeneous disorder, in which different pathophysiological mechanisms underlie specific&#xD;
      symptom patterns. Traditionally, gastric abnormalities such as impaired accommodation,&#xD;
      delayed emptying and hypersensitivity have been believed to be involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of FD. More recent studies have suggested that also a number of duodenal&#xD;
      abnormalities can be responsible for the generation of symptoms, like increased sensitivity&#xD;
      to duodenal acid, increased sensitivity to duodenal lipids and low-grade mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently showed that FD patients display impaired duodenal mucosal&#xD;
      integrity. The trigger of increased permeability is unknown, but it is possible that&#xD;
      increased exposure to duodenal bile acids or an altered composition of bile acids leads to&#xD;
      impairment of the intestinal barrier. This sustained enhancement of paracellular permeability&#xD;
      could facilitate the constant passage of luminal antigens through the mucosa and lead to&#xD;
      local mucosal immune responses that manifest as inflammation and finally result in generation&#xD;
      of dyspeptic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that increased duodenal bile acid exposure or a change in the&#xD;
      composition of bile acids lead to impaired duodenal mucosal integrity in FD, allowing luminal&#xD;
      substances to pass through the mucosa and result in immune responses and finally in dyspeptic&#xD;
      symptom generation. The general aim of this project is to assess if FD patients display&#xD;
      increased endogenous duodenal bile acid exposure and a different bile acid composition. In&#xD;
      addition, it will be tested whether duodenal mucosal permeability of FD patients with an&#xD;
      endogenous duodenal bile acid exposure above the normal range and an altered bile acid&#xD;
      composition is higher than in FD patients with a normal endogenous duodenal acid exposure and&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be expected on the department endoscopy of the UZ Gasthuisberg after they&#xD;
      have fasted overnight. Before the study, they are asked to fill in a bundle of questionnaires&#xD;
      concerning physical complaints, depression, anxiety (disturbances), pain/disease,&#xD;
      body/interoceptive awareness, trauma/abuse and personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroduodenoscopy will be performed by an experienced endoscopist (Jan Tack). Hereby, 12&#xD;
      duodenal biopsies (2 biopsies at a time) (Radial Jaw™3 with needle; outside diameter 2.2mm;&#xD;
      Boston Scientific, 302 Parkway, Global Park, Heredia, Costa Rica) will be obtained. To&#xD;
      measure the in vitro transepithelial resistance, 4 biopsies will be examined using an adapted&#xD;
      mini-Ussing chambers system. After equilibration, the mucosal side of the tissue will be&#xD;
      exposed to 4kDa FITC-dextran as a measure of paracellular permeability. A sample will be&#xD;
      taken from the serosal side during 2h at 30min interval. The concentration of fluorescein&#xD;
      will then be measured using a fluorescence plate reader. Also, 2 biopsies will be used for&#xD;
      mRNA extraction and subsequent cDNA synthesis. This cDNA will be used to measure the gene&#xD;
      expression of cell-to-cell adhesion proteins and acid-sensing receptors by means of real-time&#xD;
      PCR. In addition, 2 biopsies will be prepared for immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      and 2 will be used for western blot to measure changes in distribution/expression of the&#xD;
      cell-to-cell adhesion proteins and of bile acid-sensitive receptors. Two biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained to study ultrastructural alterations by transmission electron microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recovery, a catheter will be introduced in the second duodenum via the nose and the&#xD;
      position of the catheter will be checked fluoroscopically. This catheter allows collection of&#xD;
      intestinal fluids by means of a syringe to collect duodenal fluid aspirates and&#xD;
      characterization of the bile acid composition of those samples (8). After 30 minutes, the&#xD;
      participants will be given a specified amount of water (250 mL) (fasted state) and another 30&#xD;
      minutes later a nutritional drink (fed state). Intestinal fluids will be sampled every 15 min&#xD;
      for a period of 1 h before the liquid meal intake and until 90 minutes after the liquid meal&#xD;
      intake. So, after the total collection period, 7 fractions for the fed state and 4 fractions&#xD;
      for the fasted state will be obtained per participant in a time frame of 2 hours and a half.&#xD;
      The composition of bile acids of the intestinal samples will be determined by GC-MS-selected&#xD;
      ion monitoring analysis.&#xD;
