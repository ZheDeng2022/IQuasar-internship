  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies for a variety of reasons and&#xD;
      have an increased demand for many of these micronutrients. Multivitamin/multimineral&#xD;
      supplement offer a simple way for adults to improve nutrient intake, but their ability to&#xD;
      measurably affect micronutrient status in older adults has never been explored. This study&#xD;
      intends to recruit healthy, non-smoking men aged 65 years or older. After meeting entry&#xD;
      criteria, subjects will be required to restrict the use of supplements and/or fortified&#xD;
      foods. Two months after these restrictions have begun, subjects will come to the clinical&#xD;
      research center to take cognitive tests, undergo activity monitoring, provide blood samples&#xD;
      for nutrition testing, and take food frequency questionnaires. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups - one consuming a multivitamin/multimineral supplement&#xD;
      (Centrum Silver Mens Formula); another consuming an inert placebo tablet. Subjects will&#xD;
      consume 1 tablet each day for six months. After this period, subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinical research center and repeat cognitive tests, activity monitor, blood sampling, and&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaires. These data will be assessed to determine if multivitamin&#xD;
      consumption results in changes in various nutrients versus taking a placebo (primary&#xD;
      outcomes), and may results in changes lipid and lipoprotein profiles, metabolic health,&#xD;
      inflammation, blood pressure or cognitive function (secondary outcomes). The investigators&#xD;
      expect that results of this study will add to the general understanding if&#xD;
      multivitamin/multimineral formulas can improve nutrition status of older adults, and&#xD;
      therefore have the capacity of altering markers of health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at increased risk of various chronic diseases, in which inadequate levels of&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals may play a significant role, including cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, liver disease, and cancer. Most adults in the United States do not meet&#xD;
      the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Adequate Intake (AI) of many vitamins and&#xD;
      nutritionally-essential minerals from diet alone, including vitamins A, C, D, E and K,&#xD;
      calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Older adults are particularly susceptible to micronutrient&#xD;
      inadequacies because of limited absorption, increased requirements, or - in the case of&#xD;
      vitamin D - decreased synthetic capacity in the skin. Thus, there is a strong rationale for&#xD;
      supplementing the diets of older adults with a multivitamin/multimineral supplement, such as&#xD;
      Centrum® Silver®. However, little is currently known about the bioavailability of the&#xD;
      Centrum® Silver® formula in this age demographic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies and recent clinical trials have shown that use of&#xD;
      multivitamin/mineral supplements has beneficial effects on disease risk in men, including&#xD;
      those of advanced age. It is assumed that these benefits of multivitamin/mineral supplements&#xD;
      are achieved through changes in nutrition status. However, it has never been documented if&#xD;
      there are concomitant changes in micronutrient levels in individuals who consume these&#xD;
      supplements. Furthermore, changes in nutritional status in older individuals taking&#xD;
      multivitamin/multimineral supplements are a subject that has yet to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study seeks to recruit men who are in generally good health, 65 years of age&#xD;
      or older, to assess their vitamin and mineral status before and after six months&#xD;
      (approximately 24 weeks) of supplementation with Centrum® Silver®. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that consuming multivitamin/multimineral supplements everyday will result in&#xD;
      measurable increases in the status of one or more vitamins or minerals in the body.&#xD;
      Concentrations of several vitamins and minerals in blood samples will be performed, along&#xD;
      with a general assessment of micronutrient status in white blood cells (primary outcomes). To&#xD;
      see if these changes in nutrition status impact other aspects of human health, changes in&#xD;
      lipid and lipoprotein profiles, antioxidant status, metabolic health, and inflammation and&#xD;
      treatment differences in cognitive function will be assessed (secondary outcomes). Centrum®&#xD;
      Silver® supplementation may or may not have any effect on these secondary outcomes, when&#xD;
      compared to a placebo, unless there are measurable changes in the primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that the results of this research will add to a general understanding of&#xD;
      multivitamin/mineral supplements and how well they can improve the nutritional status of&#xD;
      older adults. By employing direct and functional methods to assay for nutritional content,&#xD;
      this study will determine how well these methods correlate and by using both assay methods&#xD;
      unique insight into the mechanism(s) whereby multivitamin/multimineral supplements might or&#xD;
      might not lead to improvements in health may be ascertained.&#xD;

Plasma levels of beta carotene, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), cobalamin (vitamin B12), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), 25-hydroxy vitamin D, α- tocopherol (vitamin E), and phylloquinone/menaquinones (vitamin K) will be determined. Analyses will be performed for absolute values and values corrected for total lipids where necessary. Folate will be assessed in red blood cells. Minerals analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) will be performed in plasma or lymphocytes.</description>

    <time_frame>Between cognitive baseline (visit 2) and 6 months after intervention begins (visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive abilities will be assessed by the following NIH Toolbox measures: Picture Vocabulary, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, Sorting Working Memory Test, Dimensional Change Card Sort Test, Pattern Completion Processing Speed Test, Picture Sequence Memory Test, and Oral Reading Recognition Test. The individual test scores are based on time and accuracy, will be normalized to scaled scores, and averaged to obtain a Fluid Cognition Composite score, as calculated by the NIH Toolbox scoring algorithms. Significant changes in total score after intervention, or between intervention and control groups will be recorded. Logical Memory will be tested with recall of narrative story both immediate and delayed as described in Wechsler Memory Scale-IV Protocol. Additionally, a &quot;Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders Task&quot; that combines physical activity with processing speed and accuracy will also be assessed at the completion of each session.</description>

    <description>A computerized environment will be presented for the subject that can be navigated with a joystick. The goal is to find a hidden platform based on spatial clues. Search accuracy for the target platform in the environment will be assessed between trials. Changes in proximity to the platform will be compared between successive trials in an individual, and also between individuals in the placebo control and multivitamin intervention groups.</description>
