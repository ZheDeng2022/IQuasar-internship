  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain pressure measurements, fine wire EMG and real time imaging ultrasound will be used to&#xD;
      determine the relationships between motion, pain perception, and mobility in the glenohumeral&#xD;
      joint. Muscle activity, joint motion, and pain will be measured pre-post randomized&#xD;
      interventions to determine the response to various physical therapy techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the study aims, 88 adults (44 controls, 44 with stiff shoulders) between the ages&#xD;
      of 18-65 will be recruited. The investigators will apply a protocol based on current evidence&#xD;
      for effectiveness of mobilizations (4 bouts of 30 sec, oscillatory gr III mobilization @1 Hz&#xD;
      vs. 4 bouts of 30 seconds, static gr III mobilization), with interventions determined by&#xD;
      randomized blocked assignment. Before and after the intervention, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess levels of EMG activity of the posterior rotator cuff during a posterior glide, the&#xD;
      force required for the mobilization to reach end range stretch, the amount of humeral head&#xD;
      translation on the glenoid via US, and pain pressure thresholds (PPT). The data collected&#xD;
      will allow investigators to determine the mechanisms involved in range of motion (ROM)&#xD;
      changes and hypoalgesia produced by glenohumeral (GH) joint mobilization in both normal and&#xD;
      stiff shoulders by evaluating the main and interaction effects of: the type of mobilization&#xD;
      (static vs oscillatory), the magnitude of joint translation via imaging ultrasound, the EMG&#xD;
      response of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, and changes in local and central&#xD;
      pain processing observed via PPT testing. These data will allow investigators to evaluate&#xD;
      whether motion improvements occur due to mechanical factors (stretch of the capsule observed&#xD;
      via change in translation), neurophysiologic factors (change in translation associated with&#xD;
      reduction in EMG activity), or both. Concurrent measurements of pain processing by the&#xD;
      nervous system (local and central mechanisms) will allow evaluation of whether changes in&#xD;
      pain processing occur following oscillatory movements, sustained movements, or both. This&#xD;
      information will result in improved understanding of the mechanisms of action of joint&#xD;
      mobilization, determination of the efficacy of various modes of mobilization to improve joint&#xD;
      translation, and determination of the efficacy of various modes of mobilization to decrease&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed in aggregate form using quantitative statistics. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be utilized for demographic data including age, height, weight, gender,&#xD;
      handedness, and side of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups will be measured using tests of difference based on group assignments (normal vs stiff&#xD;
      shoulder; sustained vs oscillatory mobilization) comparing peak and root mean squared EMG&#xD;
      activity, pain pressure thresholds, force of mobilization, and amount of translation measured&#xD;
      via US as well as analysis of interaction effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed using an intention to treat model, and any missing data points were&#xD;
      replaced using imputation via means of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outliers, defined as data points beyond the 95th percentile and identified as outliers&#xD;
      during analysis in SPSS, will be Winsorized to minimize the effect of potentially spurious&#xD;
      outliers via replacement with the highest non-outlier obtained value for the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics including means, ranges and standard deviations will be assessed for&#xD;
      each group condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be assessed for the required assumptions for parametric testing/ Analysis of&#xD;
      variance(ANOVA) including Mauchly's test of sphericity and the Shapiro-Wilk test of&#xD;
      normality. Data not meeting the required assumptions will be assessed with the appropriate&#xD;
      non-parametric equivalent test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will investigate the relationships and within and between group differences in rotator&#xD;
      cuff activity (EMG) and posterior glide mobility and mobilization force in the glenohumeral&#xD;
      joint in individuals with stiff and normal shoulders based on joint mobilization type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze within subjects main effects, interaction effects, and second order interaction&#xD;
      effects of group and mobilization condition on the DV, three-way between-between-within mixed&#xD;
      ANOVAs will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV: shoulder condition stiff vs normal; oscillation vs static posterior glide; time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X Repeated measure Dependent variables(DV)s: EMG, US translation, force In the presence of&#xD;
      significant three way interactions, post hoc testing to determine simple two way interaction&#xD;
      effects will be performed using separate two way ANOVAs Univariate testing will be utilized&#xD;
      to determine the presence of simple main effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post hoc analysis will utilize pairwise comparisons in the presence of significant main&#xD;
      effects. Bonferroni correction will be utilized due to multiple tests, with comparisons&#xD;
      within each simple-simple main effect considered a family of comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the relationships between rotator cuff activity (EMG) and posterior glide&#xD;
      mobility in individuals with stiff and normal shoulders, point bi-serial correlation will be&#xD;
      utilized to assess for meaningful relationships between the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization condition x change in EMG, US, force Group (stiff vs control) assignment x&#xD;
      change in EMG, US, force Aim 2 will investigate the within and between group differences and&#xD;
      relationships between changes in PPT and type of mobilization (static, oscillatory) in&#xD;
      individuals with stiff and normal shoulders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between group differences will be assessed via ind. t-tests, using the dichotomous&#xD;
      independent variables (IV) static vs. oscillatory mobilization, and the DV of PPT measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within group differences will be assessed via paired t-tests, using the dichotomous IV static&#xD;
      vs. oscillatory mobilization, and the DV of PPT measures.&#xD;
