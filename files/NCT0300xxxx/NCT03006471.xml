  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes is defined as an intermediate metabolic state that leads to the development of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the prehypertension is a category assigned to identify&#xD;
      patients who are at risk of developing hypertension (AH), in both pathologies the&#xD;
      abnormalities in the variation of blood pressure (BP) has been related to organ damage, its&#xD;
      evaluation is performed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter&#xD;
      type 2 (SGLT-2), which reduces renal reabsorption of glucose and promotes the excretion of&#xD;
      glucose through the urine, in the way that glucose blood. Another reported effects is the&#xD;
      decrease on BP, so it would be interesting to evaluate this effects in patients with&#xD;
      prediabetes and prehypertension, as a potential therapy to treat disorders and to prevent&#xD;
      progression to DM2 and Hypertension, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Dapagliflozin on variability of blood&#xD;
      pressure in patients with prediabetes and prehypertension without pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that the administration of dapagliflozin decreases&#xD;
      variability of blood pressure in patients with prediabetes and prehypertension without&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 30 patients with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of prediabetes and prehypertension without treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be assigned randomly two groups of 15 patients each to receive 10 mg of&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin (Forxiga, Astra Zeneca) or placebo, one per day before breakfast during 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be calculated body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure variability. This protocol&#xD;
      it's already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent it's going&#xD;
      to be obtained from all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,&#xD;
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for&#xD;
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2/ exact fisher test, will&#xD;
      be used for differences inter-group Mann-Whitney U Test and coefficient of variation,&#xD;
      Wilcoxon Test and index of variability for the within-groups differences. It will be&#xD;
      considered statistical significance p â‰¤0.05.&#xD;
