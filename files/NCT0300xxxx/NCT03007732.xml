      This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral&#xD;
      SD-101 in patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist&#xD;
      SD-101 in treating patients with prostate cancer and cancer in all oligometastatic sites that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body. Androgen can cause the growth of tumor cells.&#xD;
      Androgen deprivation therapy, such as leuprolide acetate, prednisone, and abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the&#xD;
      tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
      Colony-stimulating factors, such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, may increase the production of blood&#xD;
      cells. It is not yet known whether giving androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without TLR9 agonist SD-101 may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with prostate cancer and cancer in all oligometastatic sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (No longer recruiting)&#xD;
&#xD;
           --To assess the safety associated with giving RT and pembrolizumab with or without&#xD;
           intratumoral SD-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To continue to assess the safety associated with giving RT and pembrolizumab with&#xD;
                or without intratumoral SD-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess if the rate of PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL at 15 months in patients with&#xD;
                non-castrate levels of testosterone is greater than the historical control in each&#xD;
                study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling in each study arm in cohort 2.&#xD;
           Testosterone-PSA uncoupling is defined as PSA &lt; 50% baseline and &lt; 20ng/mL for at least&#xD;
           3 months after testosterone recovers to &gt;150 ng/dL. In patients with metastatic hormone&#xD;
           sensitive prostate cancer off hormonal therapy, &gt;90% patient are expected to have PSA&#xD;
           increase to &gt; 50% baseline after 3 months of testosterone recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate time to clinical progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in each study arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess peripheral and tumor-based biomarkers of response and resistance in both&#xD;
           cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the treatment-induced effects on circulating immune cells in both cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore remodeling of circulating T cell repertoire in both cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the concordance of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) - Positron&#xD;
           Emission Tomography (PET) scanning with conventional imaging in oligometastatic prostate&#xD;
           cancer patients in both cohorts.&#xD;

    <description>Only patients in cohort 2, who achieve testosterone recovery to non-castrate levels (&gt;150 ng/dL) at 15 months, will be analyzed for the primary endpoint. The rate of PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL at 15 months from the start of radiotherapy and cycle 1, day 1 of pembrolizumab, among patients whose testosterone recovers to non-castrate levels (&gt;150 ng/dL). The point estimate of the rate of PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL will be obtained with its 95% confidence interval for participants by arm in cohort 2 and compared to the historical control rate by one sample binomial test. All patients who receive any part of a dose of RT, SD-101 or pembrolizumab will be analyzed for efficacy</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling (Cohort 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Testosterone-PSA uncoupling is defined as PSA &lt; 50% baseline and &lt; 20ng/mL for at least 3 months after testosterone recovers to &gt;150 ng/dL. In patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer off hormonal therapy, &gt;90% patients are expected to have PSA increase to &gt; 50% baseline after 3 months of testosterone recovery. Therefore, the presence of PSA testosterone uncoupling in this study may serve as a surrogate of immunotherapeutic responses induced by pembrolizumab combined with RT (arm 1), or RT with SD-101 (arm 2), if a prolonged PSA &lt; nadir + 2 ng/mL is not achieved. The point estimate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling rate will be obtained with its 95% confidence interval for each arm in cohort 2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to clinical progression (Cohort 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The time to clinical progression in each study arm in cohort 2 is defined as the time to radiographic progression by Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group-2 (PSAWG2) criteria, time to symptomatic progressive disease, or PSA progression, whichever comes the first. Kaplan-Meier estimate will be obtained for the time to clinical progression in each study arm in cohort 2</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) (Cohort 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be &gt;=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
             Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Oligometastatic disease. In order to be eligible, the patient must have a total of &lt;4&#xD;
             metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node sites based on bone and/or soft tissue&#xD;
             lesions as defined by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Bone metastases will be defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium&#xD;
                  bone scan, and/or sodium fluoride (NaF) PET performed, either study may be used&#xD;
                  for documenting metastases; both scans do not need to show the number of&#xD;
                  metastases required for study entry. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA&#xD;
                  avid lesions that are consistent with metastasis will be counted as a site of&#xD;
                  metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Distant metastatic lymph node disease. A lymph node ≥1 cm in shortest dimension&#xD;
                  will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be&#xD;
                  determined as any lymph nodes outside the confines of the true pelvis. For&#xD;
                  patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with&#xD;
                  metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any other soft tissue lesion deemed by the physician to be consistent with&#xD;
                  distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid&#xD;
                  lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate consistent with metastasis will be&#xD;
                  counted as a site of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Radiographic imaging performed as standard of care prior to obtaining&#xD;
                       informed consent and within 60 days of initiating study treatment may be&#xD;
                       used to assess oligometastatic disease during screening, rather than&#xD;
                       repeating scans. For patients who have started on ADT, they must have had&#xD;
                       imaging prior to initiation of hormonal therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment naïve, defined as less than 2 months of standard of care ADT (e.g. GnRH&#xD;
             agonist or antagonist with or without antiandrogen, including abiraterone) for&#xD;
             metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer prior to enrollment (at the time of&#xD;
             consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Not a candidate for or refuse chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No prior prostatectomy or prostatic radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. PSA &gt;2 ng/mL at baseline or prior to initiation of hormonal therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Baseline testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL if patient has not initiated hormonal therapy, for&#xD;
             those patients who have already initiated hormonal therapy, baseline testosterone is&#xD;
             not required&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Consent to undergo mandatory prostatic core biopsies at the time of fiducial marker&#xD;
             placement and 1-3 weeks after Cycle 1 Day 1 of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study participation, and for 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study therapy. Their partners should also be encouraged to use&#xD;
             proper method of contraception. Their partners should also be encouraged to use proper&#xD;
             method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
