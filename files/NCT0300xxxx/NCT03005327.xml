    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study with an initial 24-week Treatment Period and an Extension Phase. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this Phase 2 study are to determine the safety, tolerability, and dose&#xD;
      selection of mavorixafor in participants with WHIM syndrome. Participants are allowed to&#xD;
      continue treatment in an Extension Phase, if regionally applicable, until it becomes&#xD;
      commercially available or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.&#xD;

    <description>Initial Treatment Phase: Participants will initiate treatment with mavorixafor at 50 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) orally or a higher dose, with potential escalation based on area under the curve for absolute neutrophil count and absolute leukocyte count (AUCANC/ALC) values to a maximum total daily dose of 400 mg. Participants are expected to receive treatment for 24 weeks in the initial Treatment Period or until development of a treatment-limiting toxicity (TLT).&#xD;
Extension Phase: All participants will receive mavorixafor; the dose will not exceed 400 mg. In the Extension Phase, treatment may continue until mavorixafor becomes available via an alternative mechanism (for example, drug is commercially available, an expanded access program, etc.) or until the study is terminated by the sponsor.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with any of the following will be excluded from participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has a known history of a positive serology or viral load for human immunodeficiency&#xD;
