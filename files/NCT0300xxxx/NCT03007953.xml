  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of the study is to test a nurse-led telephone-based palliative care intervention on&#xD;
      improving the delivery of care for patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. The study is a&#xD;
      three site randomized control trial to determine the efficacy of the intervention on&#xD;
      improving patients' quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction of care. Additionally,&#xD;
      the study will test an innovative care delivery model to improve patients' access to&#xD;
      palliative care. The investigators will also determine the effect of the intervention on&#xD;
      patient activation to discuss treatment preferences with their clinician and on clinician&#xD;
      knowledge of patients' goals of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Patients meeting entry criteria will be randomized to the intervention arm, palliative care&#xD;
      plus usual care, or the usual care arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive usual oncologic care and phone calls from a nurse. Outcome measures will be collected&#xD;
      at baseline and at the end of the patients' primary cancer treatment. The study will be&#xD;
      performed at the Puget Sound Health Care System, Birmingham VA and Portland VA. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit individuals (n=138) with lung cancer over 2.5 years. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the efficacy of the nurse-led telephone-based palliative&#xD;
      intervention on improving patients' quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction of&#xD;
      care. In addition, using validated instruments, the investigators will assess the effect of&#xD;
      the intervention on patient activation to discuss treatment preferences with their clinician&#xD;
      and on clinician knowledge of patients' goals of care. The results of this study will inform&#xD;
      a future effectiveness/implementation study.&#xD;

    <description>Patient Quality of Life including symptoms as measured by the FACT-L (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Scale). The FACT-L outcome measure reported is the mean change in the TOI subscale (Total Outcome Index) of the instrument, computed as the differences between final and baseline visit scores. The TOI subscale range is 0-84, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life. Among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, provision of a telephone-based palliative care intervention will be associated with a change in FACT-L TOI score. The investigators will assess the difference in FACT-L TOI scores between the intervention and control subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Satisfaction of Care at Final Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with care will be assessed by using the FAMCARE-Patient Survey 13 (full unabbreviated scale name). The FAMCARE is a 13 item, 5 point likert-scale validated questionnaire measuring patient satisfaction with cancer care and assessing interactions with health care providers, performance status and symptom burden. Only total score are reported (no subscales). Scores range from 13-65 with scores of 52 &gt; being satisfied with care. In full randomized clinical trials the estimated MID is 5 points from baseline to 12 weeks. Among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, provision of a telephone-based palliative care intervention will be associated with a change in FAMCARE-P13 score. The investigators will assess the difference in FAMCARE-P13 scores between the intervention and control subjects.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We identified lung cancer patients at the Puget Sound Health Care System, the Birmingham VA, and the Portland VA. Virtually all patients undergoing evaluation for lung cancer were presented at the Tumor Board and/or were evaluated in the chest (thoracic surgery and pulmonary), oncology, radiation oncology, or lung cancer clinics. All patients were screened weekly to determine study eligibility. Recruitment began when the first patient enrolled on December 2016 and lasted to June 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>If consented participants became ineligible, they were not randomized into one of the two study arms.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Patient Quality of Life including symptoms as measured by the FACT-L (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Scale). The FACT-L outcome measure reported is the mean change in the TOI subscale (Total Outcome Index) of the instrument, computed as the differences between final and baseline visit scores. The TOI subscale range is 0-84, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life. Among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, provision of a telephone-based palliative care intervention will be associated with a change in FACT-L TOI score. The investigators will assess the difference in FACT-L TOI scores between the intervention and control subjects.</description>

Palliative Care: Care delivered by a nurse, including symptom assessment and management, patient education on lung cancer and treatment options, discussion and communication about preferences for care, psychosocial assessment (including referrals to ancillary services), and patient-centered resources. A personalized treatment plan based on the patient's lung cancer stage, treatment, symptoms and psychosocial needs will be developed by the palliative care team (physician, study nurse) with input from the patient and family member. The study nurse will assess patient's symptoms, implement and monitor the treatment plan applying established End-of- Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) for Veterans protocols.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Satisfaction of Care at Final Visit</title>
        <description>Patient satisfaction with care will be assessed by using the FAMCARE-Patient Survey 13 (full unabbreviated scale name). The FAMCARE is a 13 item, 5 point likert-scale validated questionnaire measuring patient satisfaction with cancer care and assessing interactions with health care providers, performance status and symptom burden. Only total score are reported (no subscales). Scores range from 13-65 with scores of 52 &gt; being satisfied with care. In full randomized clinical trials the estimated MID is 5 points from baseline to 12 weeks. Among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, provision of a telephone-based palliative care intervention will be associated with a change in FAMCARE-P13 score. The investigators will assess the difference in FAMCARE-P13 scores between the intervention and control subjects.</description>
