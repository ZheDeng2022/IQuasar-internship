      The aim of this phase II trial is to assess progress-free survival, local control, overall&#xD;
      survival, safety and tolerability of SBRT to treat patients with oligometastases in&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who have received initial&#xD;
             treatment for the primary site including surgery or chemoradiotherapy. Primary tumor&#xD;
             site without progression at registration. The sites of allowed metastases are:&#xD;
             peripheral lung, central lung, medistinal/cervical lymph node, liver,&#xD;
             spinal/paraspinal, osseous, and abdominal-pelvic lymph node. All metastases not&#xD;
             resected must be amenable to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 1-4 radiographically distinct metastases of any distribution in 2 or less allowed&#xD;
             anatomical sites. The diameters of lesions should be less than or equal to 5cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Initial treatment should be completed at least 3 months prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All the metastases treated with SBRT should not be treated with surgery, radiation,&#xD;
             radio frequency ablation or other regional therapeutic modalities prior to study&#xD;
             registration. The other (s) lesions should have been surgically removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age ≥ 18. PS ECOG 0-2，wight loss&lt;30% during the latest 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evaluation by a radiation oncologist that the patient could tolerate the treatment of&#xD;
             SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For females of child-bearing potential, negative serum/urine pregnancy test within 14&#xD;
             days prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Progression of primary tumor site at time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metastases with indistinct borders making targeting not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior palliative radiotherapy to metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metastases located within 3 cm of the previously irradiated structures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a).Spinal cord previously irradiated &gt;80Gy(Biological equivalent dose with α/β=2),&#xD;
             b).Brachial plexus previously irradiated to &gt; 100Gy(Biological equivalent dose with&#xD;
             α/β=2), c).Small intestine, large intestine, or stomach previously irradiated to &gt;&#xD;
             90Gy (Biological equivalent dose with α/β=2), d).Whole lung previously irradiated with&#xD;
             prior V20Gy &gt; 30% (delivered in ≤ 3 Gy/fraction), e)Metastasis irradiated with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or breast-feeding women or people during the birth-period who refused to take&#xD;
             contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Drug addiction,Alcoholism or AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with severe organ dysfunction or Acute bacterial or fungal infection who are&#xD;
             considered not suitable to enroll the study at the time of registration.&#xD;
