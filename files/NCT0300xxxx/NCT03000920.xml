  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year in France, breast cancer affects about 48,000 women and is the first cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in women with 11,900 deaths estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2004, there is a national organized breast cancer screening (OBCS) programme for&#xD;
      asymptomatic women aged 50-74 and with a medium-risk. Every two years, the local cancer&#xD;
      screening department sends a personalized invitation mail to eligible women to perform a&#xD;
      mammogram and a breast clinical examination. One to two reminder mails are sent to women who&#xD;
      have not done the screening after an initial invitation. Despite this programme, almost 47%&#xD;
      of women in France do not participate to organized breast cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Short Message Service (SMS) is an innovative communication tool in the field of health,&#xD;
      immediate, reliable delivery, low cost and ecological. The use of SMS could be an innovative,&#xD;
      low-cost, personalized and ecological way to support the OBCS invitation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to preserve or even better increase participation in&#xD;
      organized breast cancer screening while decreasing the associated costs by including SMS in&#xD;
      our screening invitation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two SMS interventions will be tested which will correspond to different phases of the OBCS&#xD;
      invitation procedure. This sequence of interventions leads us to perform three interlinked&#xD;
      trials: a trial of superiority for the first phase (intervention 1: sending an SMS a few days&#xD;
      before the initial mail invitation), then two non-inferiority trials for the second phase (&#xD;
      two trials=one for each context of phase 1 _ intervention 2: sending an SMS in place of the&#xD;
      first postal reminder).&#xD;

      Each year in France, breast cancer affects about 48,000 women and is the first cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in women with 11,900 deaths estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2004, there is a national organized breast cancer screening (OBCS) programme for&#xD;
      asymptomatic women aged 50-74 and with a medium-risk. Every two years, the local cancer&#xD;
      screening department sends a personalized invitation mail to eligible women to perform a&#xD;
      mammogram and a breast clinical examination. One to two reminder mails are sent to women who&#xD;
      have not done the screening after an initial invitation. Despite this programme, almost 47%&#xD;
      of women in France do not participate to organized breast cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Short Message Service (SMS) is an innovative communication tool in the field of health,&#xD;
      immediate, reliable delivery, low cost and ecological. The use of SMS could be an innovative,&#xD;
      low-cost, personalized and ecological way to support the OBCS invitation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In databases, there is currently about 10 to 15% of the women with a mobile phone number&#xD;
      registered in the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be carried out throughout the Region &quot;Centre-Val de Loire&quot; with six local&#xD;
      cancer screening departments The overall objective of this study is to preserve or even&#xD;
      better increase participation in organized breast cancer screening while decreasing the&#xD;
      associated costs by including SMS in our screening invitation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two SMS interventions will be tested which will correspond to different phases of the OBCS&#xD;
      invitation procedure. This sequence of interventions leads us to perform three interlinked&#xD;
      trials: a trial of superiority for the first phase (intervention 1: sending an SMS a few days&#xD;
      before the initial mail invitation), then two non-inferiority trials for the second phase&#xD;
      (intervention 2: sending an SMS in place of the first postal reminder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of methodological choices&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st phase: Addition of the intervention &quot;sending an SMS&quot; (and the associated cost) to&#xD;
           what is currently done (versus classical intervention). To be of interest, the tested&#xD;
           intervention, the sending of an SMS few days before the initial mail invitation, should&#xD;
           allow to significantly increase participation in OBCS (here superiority trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd phase: This phase will involve women who have had or not the phase 1 intervention and&#xD;
           who have not yet participated to the OBCS. Since the contexts in phase 1 are different,&#xD;
           a trial for each one must be carry out. In this second phase, the conventional&#xD;
           intervention (sending reminder mail 1) will be compare to a cheaper one (sending&#xD;
           reminder 1 by SMS). The new strategy will prove interesting if it is not inferior in&#xD;
           terms of participation to the OBCS. The analysis of this non-inferiority will be carried&#xD;
           out for each context of phase 1 (invitation mail alone OR SMS then invitation mail).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 groups of the study are the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (usual procedure): at least an invitation mail and then one or two reminder by&#xD;
           mail if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 : Invitation by mail then reminder 1 by SMS if necessary then reminder 2 by mail&#xD;
           if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 : One SMS a few days before the Invitation by mail and then one or two&#xD;
           reminder(s) by mail if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 : One SMS a few days before the Invitation by mail then reminder 1 by SMS if&#xD;
           necessary then reminder 2 by mail if necessary&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1: Compare the participation rates in organized breast cancer screening (and the cost by screened woman) in response to a strategy of sending an SMS before the invitation letter (vs sending the invitation letter alone = usual strategy).</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the sending time of the reminder 1 (letter or SMS) : from 3 months to 8 months after the invitation letter depending to periods of the concerned local cancer screening department</time_frame>
    <description>For this first phase, the study aims to demonstrate that the addition of the SMS is superior in terms of participation and participation costs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Compare participation rates in organized breast cancer screening (and the cost by screened woman) in response to a strategy of replacing the reminder 1 by mail with a reminder 1 by SMS ( reminder 1 mail = usual strategy).</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the sending time of the reminder 2 : from 3 months to 6 months after the reminder 1 depending to periods of the concerned local cancer screening department</time_frame>
    <description>For this second phase, the study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the strategy including the SMS in terms of participation and cost-participation according to the two contexts:&#xD;
women who have already received an invitation letter alone.&#xD;
women who have already received one SMS and the invitation mail.</description>
