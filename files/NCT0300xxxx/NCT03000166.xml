  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of a physical activity intervention on&#xD;
      the self-management of fatigue in young adults receiving chemotherapy. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will receive an intervention which includes education and resources to set&#xD;
      physical activity goals and monitor progress toward goals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to increase physical activity have been shown to relieve fatigue in patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy, but no studies have tested a physical activity intervention to&#xD;
      improve fatigue in young adults receiving chemotherapy. This study will determine the impact&#xD;
      of a physical activity intervention on the self-management process variables of self-efficacy&#xD;
      and self-regulation and their relationships to physical activity and fatigue severity in&#xD;
      young adults receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;

          <title>Fatigue</title>
          <description>PROMIS Fatigue Short form. Participants self-report their fatigue over the past 7 days using the 8-item PROMIS Fatigue Short Form. The response scale is a 5-point Likert scale (1-never to 5-always). Raw scores can range from 8-40. Raw scores are converted to standardized T-scores, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue severity. T-Scores range from 33.1 - 77.8. A T-score of 50 represents the average fatigue severity of a national sample of the general US population. A score over 50 represents a person with more than average fatigue while a score under 50 is less than average fatigue.</description>

          <description>As measured with a waist-worn accelerometer. The accelerometer counts the number of times a person moves forward in a certain time period (counts per minute). Accelerometer data was analyzed using the ActiLife software (v13.3). Freedson adult cutpoints in counts per minute (cpm) were applied to assess time spent in sedentary (0-99 cpm), light (100-2019 cpm), moderate (2020-5998 cpm), and vigorous (&gt;5999 cpm) physical activity. The intensity of physical activity corresponds to the energy expended by that individual. Light intensity physical activity requires the least amount of effort.</description>

          <title>Self-efficacy for Physical Activity</title>
          <description>As measured by the Physical Activity Assessment Inventory (PAAI).The PAAI is a 13-item scale and was developed to measure confidence to be physically active under various conditions. Responses are measured on a 100-point scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;cannot do at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;certain can do&quot;). An average score is calculated, and a higher score indicates greater self-efficacy. Higher scores that mean more confidence in the ability to be physically active in various conditions would be a positive outcome.</description>

          <description>As measured by the Index of Self-Regulation (ISR).The ISR is a 9-item scale that measures levels of self-regulation, which includes ability to process information, monitor performance, and take action in relation to goals. Responses are measured on a 6-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 6=strongly agree), and scores can range from 9-54. An average score is calculated, and a higher score indicates a higher level of self-regulation. Higher scores indicating a higher level of self-regulation is a positive outcome.</description>

Step-Up Intervention: Intervention group participants will meet with a study facilitator during 5 regularly scheduled visits for chemotherapy. The facilitator will provide education about the benefits of physical activity and strategies to overcome barriers to physical activity, help the participants to set physical activity goals based on ability and preferences, and educate the participant on using a physical activity tracker.</description>

      <time_frame>Data related to adverse events were collected over the duration of the time each participant was on study. Participants were considered on study from the date of enrollment through the completion of completion of post-study data collection. The average time for each participant to be on study was 15 weeks, but ranged from 10-23 weeks due to variations in the timing of their chemotherapy as well as completion of post-study measures.</time_frame>
