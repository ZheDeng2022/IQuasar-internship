  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute dehydration in the elderly is a well-known clinical condition, although situations that&#xD;
      lead to chronic dehydration in the elderly may be quite frequent, but they are poorly&#xD;
      studied. Metabolic changes in body water homeostasis can influence and provide chronic&#xD;
      dehydration status as reduced sensitivity to thirst, antidiuretic hormone and renal inability&#xD;
      to concentrate urine and the presence of chronic diseases and the use of polypharmacy may&#xD;
      also predispose states of chronic dehydration. Due to these facts, a study to detect the&#xD;
      existence of chronic dehydration states in a population of elderly people is highly&#xD;
      justifiable. In addition, understanding whether increased water intake, improving chronic&#xD;
      dehydration, may improve renal function in this population seems to be of great value, since&#xD;
      it is a simple and inexpensive intervention and, if confirmed, it can be taken to&#xD;
      institutions, by family members and health promoters who care for and cohabit with elderly&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to evaluate the effect of stimulated and calculated water intake (per&#xD;
      kg of patient weight) on the state of hydration and renal function in a population of elderly&#xD;
      individuals. It is also within the scope of this project to evaluate the presence of chronic&#xD;
      dehydration in elderly patients as well as in a subgroup of diabetic patients, and to compare&#xD;
      different methods of evaluation of renal function. Design: Clinical trial Randomized for the&#xD;
      main objective and cross-sectional study for secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal hypothesis is that guided water intake improve renal function in elderly&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal and written guidelines will be given for the patient to ingest the daily volume of&#xD;
      water calculated by the weight (30 ml / kg / day) for 14 days. Patients will receive an&#xD;
      acrylic glass with a mark in 200 ml and will be instructed to take the number of glasses a&#xD;
      day corresponding to the calculated volume (30 ml / kg). Patients will also receive a leaflet&#xD;
      indicating how many glasses of water they will need to take. They will also be instructed to&#xD;
      mark with an &quot;X&quot; the number of glasses of water that they actually drank daily during the&#xD;
      fourteen days of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements tools (applied on the first and second visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests: serum and urinary osmolality, sodium, urea and serum creatinine. To&#xD;
           evaluate the effect of hydration on the glycemic control of diabetic patients, the&#xD;
           measurement of fasting glycaemia and glycated hemoglobin (enzymatic method and HCLP)&#xD;
           will also be performed. These dosages will be performed at the HCPA Clinical Pathology&#xD;
           Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive test: electrical bioimpedance (BIA) InBody 370® will be used to evaluate&#xD;
           the amount of free water, since it is simple, low cost and easy to perform in the&#xD;
           outpatient clinics of elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional assessment: the MAN questionnaire (Mini nutritional assessment) will be&#xD;
           applied to patients selected for the study at the first and second visits. Since a valid&#xD;
           questionnaire to evaluate only water intake was not found, the MAN questionnaire was&#xD;
           chosen because it contains questions related to water intake and because it is easy and&#xD;
           quick to apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MiniMental: The MiniMental cognitive function test will be applied on the first visit&#xD;
           and after the observation period (second visit). The questionnaire is valid for the&#xD;
           screening of cognitive disorders and it is a simple and quick method to evaluate the&#xD;
           mental abilities of the patients under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food record: these are sheets with space designated for filling with food and liquids&#xD;
           and quantities consumed throughout the day. Patients are advised to make a four-day food&#xD;
           diary out of the 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function will be assessed by estimation formulas (as recommended by NKF and KDIGO) that&#xD;
      use serum creatinine (CKD-EPI, MDRD and BIS2) and formulas that use cystatin C (CKD- EPI-cys&#xD;
      and BIS 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of GFR by 51Cr-EDTA will be performed in a subgroup of 15 patients from each&#xD;
      arm of the study in a parallel manner before and after the intervention using the 51Cr-EDTA&#xD;
      intravenous single injection technique at a dose of 150μCi with blood samples taken at 2, 3&#xD;
      and 4 hours later. Samples will be centrifuged and 2 ml of plasma will be pipetted in&#xD;
      duplicate for gamma counter counting. An exponential equation evaluates the plasma decay of&#xD;
      51 Cr-EDTA, providing the value of GFR .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine will be determined by the calibrated Jaffe method (Roche), traceable to&#xD;
      isotopic dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS), with kinetic reading to minimize interference by&#xD;
      bilirubin. The dosage of cystatin C will be performed by the immunoturbidimetry method&#xD;
      (Roche). The coefficients of intra and interassay variation are 2.2% and 5.3%, respectively.&#xD;
