      This phase I/Ib trial will assess the dose, safety and side effects of the combination of the&#xD;
      cancer drugs afatinib (GILOTRIF®) and nivolumab (OPDIVO®) and to assess the anti-cancer&#xD;
      effects of this combination of drugs when used to treat patients with advanced head and neck&#xD;
      cancers that did not respond to previous treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To determine dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      afatinib when given in combination with nivolumab for subjects with recurrent/metastatic&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck not previously treated with immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IB: To determine long term safety of afatinib in combination with nivolumab when&#xD;
      administered to subjects with recurrent/metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and&#xD;
      Neck who had experienced disease progression during or after platinum- and cetuximab-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess progression free survival and overall survival of afatinib in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab when given to subjects with recurrent/metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the&#xD;
      Head and Neck not previously treated with immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate HPV stratified ORR as assessed by irRECIST in recurrent/metastatic Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the Head and Neck not previously treated with immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of key molecular alterations that may confer treatment resistance.&#xD;
           Specifically, we will examine key somatic mutations in ERBB1 (exons 18-21), ERBB2 (exon&#xD;
           20), and BRAF (V600) genes. We will further characterize the expression levels of ErbB2&#xD;
           and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of active CD8+ T-cell density and PD-L1 expression levels in the tumor&#xD;
           parenchyma pre- and on-treatment. Immunogenicity will be assessed by expression and&#xD;
           localization of key molecules PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3 and OX40 within the&#xD;
           tumor parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (m-MDSCs)&#xD;
           frequency from pre-treatment peripheral blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of HBD3 expression in the tumor parenchyma from pre-treatment tumor&#xD;
           tissue samples.&#xD;
