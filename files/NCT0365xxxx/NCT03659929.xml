    <textblock>
      The purpose of the AR19.004 study is to assess the efficacy of AR19 compared to placebo using&#xD;
      the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, fixed-dose, double-blind, multicenter trial to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of AR19 in the treatment of ADHD in adults from 18 through 55 years of age.&#xD;
      Safety parameters and therapeutic effect will be evaluated throughout the trial. A target of&#xD;
      312 subjects is set for enrollment. Once subjects are determined to meet all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and were screened, they will be randomized to 20 or 40 mg AR19 daily or placebo.&#xD;
