    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers (caregivers, often family or friends) play an integral role in managing&#xD;
      patients with complex, chronic diseases. It is estimated that caregivers provide $470 billion&#xD;
      of uncompensated care. Despite their impact, healthcare systems largely neglect caregivers.&#xD;
      Long distance caregivers of older adults (who make up 15% of caregivers in America) are at a&#xD;
      particular disadvantage. In the current healthcare system, health information technology&#xD;
      (HIT) has not been optimized to support the needs of caregivers and patients. Providing HIT&#xD;
      that supports enhanced communication between patients, caregivers, and clinicians can improve&#xD;
      patient safety by increasing the accuracy of patient data and by reducing&#xD;
      miscommunication(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited knowledge concerning best practices to promote caregivers' and patients'&#xD;
      activation and engagement, especially with HIT. Access to personal health information through&#xD;
      the personal health record (PHR) has the potential to improve chronic health care management,&#xD;
      and encourage patient engagement. Although caregivers and patients express a willingness to&#xD;
      adopt PHRs, in practice, multiple barriers hinder PHR adoption. A properly designed PHR can&#xD;
      help caregivers and patients manage their health and become partners in the healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's overall objective is to identify caregivers and cardiovascular patients'&#xD;
      communication and technology needs and to build and test an optimized PHR design that&#xD;
      promotes active participation of patients and their caregivers in their health. The overall&#xD;
      hypothesis is that an optimized PHR will expand the role of caregivers to improve the&#xD;
      patient's health and improve the satisfaction of both patients and caregivers with their&#xD;
      care. The investigators will employ an agile, user-centered design process involving&#xD;
      caregivers and older cardiovascular patients.&#xD;
