    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, side effects and benefits of autologous&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(TIL) specific to personalized Neo-antigens in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with recurrent, metastatic and advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing progress is&#xD;
      originally developed by the NCI for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic&#xD;
      cervical cancer. TILs specific to personalized neo-antigens will be expended in vitro and&#xD;
      given back to the patients through vein. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      single-arm, open label, interventional study.&#xD;

          2. Must have recurrent, metastatic, or persistent carcinoma that is not amenable to&#xD;
             curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy and for which no other&#xD;
             therapies are expected to have significant benefit, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have at least 1 lesion that is resectable for TIL generation. The resected TIL&#xD;
             generating lesion(s) should yield at least 1.5 cm in diameter post-resection of tumor&#xD;
             tissue. Following resection for TIL generation, must have a remaining measurable&#xD;
             target lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;

          5. Any prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least 28&#xD;
             days prior to tumor resection. Radiation therapy may have been received up to 28 days&#xD;
             prior to tumor resection for lesions not expected to be used for TIL generation or&#xD;
             target lesions.&#xD;
