  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate whether non-invasive acupuncture - NIA (i.e. acupuncture&#xD;
      without needles) will help reduce pain for babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#xD;
      during their routine weekly eye-exam for Retinopathy of prematurity. Retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease most commonly affecting premature babies born weighing&#xD;
      less than 1250 grams. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs because these premature babies&#xD;
      require oxygen because of their immature lungs. The oxygen then stimulates the growth of&#xD;
      blood vessels in the retina, causing the retina to be detached from the eye, which causes&#xD;
      vision impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine if the vessels grow at the back of the eye, an eye-doctor visits bi-weekly once&#xD;
      the baby is 32 weeks corrected age to assess if the blood vessels change. If there is a lot&#xD;
      of growth, the eye-doctor would use a laser to treat the eye to prevent further growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the bi-weekly eye-exam, the premature infant receives sucrose (a type of sugar) for&#xD;
      pain management. The investigator will assess pain a premature babies experience during this&#xD;
      exam and found that there are extremely high scores of pain despite sucrose and the&#xD;
      investigator believe this pain and stress caused by these procedures could be reduced by&#xD;
      adding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Acupuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, untreated pain causes stress (lower oxygen levels, higher heart rates), discomfort and&#xD;
      poorer long term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding the best treatment and prevention for the pain caused by procedures in the NICU is&#xD;
      therefore extremely important for any baby.&#xD;

      Background: Infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) may experience as many as 14&#xD;
      painful and stressful procedures every day. Even common and seemingly innocuous procedures&#xD;
      like routine eye exams can cause relatively severe pain that is only marginally alleviated by&#xD;
      powerful analgesics like morphine. Infants subject to severe and repeated episodes of pain&#xD;
      are at risk of immediate and long-term sequelae, including intraventricular hemorrhage,&#xD;
      impaired neurodevelopment, poor postnatal growth, cognitive and motor dysfunction and&#xD;
      emotional dysregulation. Pharmacological analgesia is often used in the NICU to either&#xD;
      prevent or alleviate procedural pain but none are completely effective and almost all have&#xD;
      potentially detrimental side-effects. Non-pharmacological measures (e.g., kangaroo care and&#xD;
      breastfeeding) are also used but these methods may not be feasible in very sick infants or if&#xD;
      pain is extremely severe. Methods to provide safe and effective analgesia for babies in the&#xD;
      NICU are therefore needed. Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years to prevent and&#xD;
      treat pain and various health conditions. There are many forms of acupuncture, including&#xD;
      needling, electrical currents, laser, and pressure, all of which aim to modulate activity of&#xD;
      key nociceptive structures, neurotransmitter secretions and parasympathetic function. The&#xD;
      investigator have reported about the safety and efficacy of auricular magnetic acupuncture&#xD;
      (MA) in the NICU environment during heel pricks or neonatal withdrawal. One of the most&#xD;
      common and painful procedure preterm infants experience during their NICU stay is their&#xD;
      weekly eye-exam to assess for Retinopathy of Prematurity. Currently, during the eye exam&#xD;
      infants receive sucrose for analgesia, which has very limited effects on pain release. The&#xD;
      investigator propose to examine if using auricular MA will reduce pain during their eye-exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Does auricular MA decrease pain in preterm infants compared to placebo&#xD;
      with control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine if auricular MA will reduce pain compared to placebo with control in&#xD;
      preterm infants during their eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigator hypotheses that auricular MA will reduce pain compared to&#xD;
      placebo with control in preterm infants during their eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Infants who will require their routine eye exam (beginning at 32 weeks corrected&#xD;
      age) will be randomized to either auricular MA or auricular placebo/sucrose after parental&#xD;
      informed consent. Five auricular MA or placebo stickers will be placed on acupuncture sites&#xD;
      on both ears for 1 hour prior to the eye-exam by a non-blinded investigator. Pain responses&#xD;
      will be assessed with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) by blinded clinicians before,&#xD;
      during and after each eye-exam. The study will be conducted in the NICU at the Royal&#xD;
      Alexandra Hospital as a single-blinded randomized, placebo controlled study to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of using magnetic stickers in the NICU environment. The&#xD;
      randomization sequence will be pre-specified, computer generated into block sizes of 2-4.&#xD;
      Allocations will be concealed in sequential opaque envelopes stored in a secure location. A&#xD;
      single unblinded investigator will complete randomization, administer the intervention, but&#xD;
      will not be involved in data collection. Infants will be randomized to receive either MA or&#xD;
      placebo stickers that are to be applied bilaterally to the 5 auricular acupuncture points as&#xD;
      per the Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) protocol at least 1 hour prior to the eye-exam by the&#xD;
      unblinded investigator. Placebos will be constructed by removing the magnet ball from pre&#xD;
      commercially-available MA plasters (Sakamura, Helio Acupuncture, Japan). The magnet site on&#xD;
      placebo and magnetic stickers will then be concealed with a thick application of white,&#xD;
      opaque correction fluid. Stickers will be removed 1 hour after the eye-exam. Sucrose for pain&#xD;
      management can be given as per NICU policy. The ROP eye exams are performed by a dedicated&#xD;
      group of five physicians therefore consistency will be maintained. Primary outcome: Infant's&#xD;
      response to the pain during the eye-exam, measured by the PIPP score, a validated,&#xD;
      quantitative pain assessment tool for use in premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The proposed study aims to examine if auricular MA compared to placebo&#xD;
      will decrease pain in premature infants. If validated, the results of the study could be&#xD;
      translated into NICUs around the world and might benefit a large number of babies each year.&#xD;
