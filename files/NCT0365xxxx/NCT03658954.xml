  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining three different components of a mobile sleep intervention:&#xD;
      web-based sleep hygiene advice, sleep and alcohol diary self-monitoring, and personalized&#xD;
      sleep and alcohol consumption feedback. The study is designed to find out which of these&#xD;
      components are most effective for mitigating alcohol use disorders and improving sleep&#xD;
      quality among young adults. The study has three parts: 1) an intake session; 2) a 2-week&#xD;
      treatment phase; and 3) three follow-up visits over the next 10 weeks.&#xD;

      Targeting sleep concerns may be a novel strategy for reducing increased risk of alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders in young adults. The current study will develop and test a mobile intervention&#xD;
      addressing sleep concerns in 120 heavy-drinking young adults. All participants will wear&#xD;
      sleep and alcohol trackers daily. Participants will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      interventions. The primary intervention (60 participants) will include web-based sleep&#xD;
      hygiene advice + sleep/alcohol diary self-monitoring + sleep/alcohol data feedback. The&#xD;
      comparison interventions will be compared to matched control conditions only including these&#xD;
      components: (1) web-based sleep hygiene advice (30 participants) or (2) web-based sleep&#xD;
      hygiene advice + sleep/alcohol diary self-monitoring (30 participants). The primary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate sleep intervention component feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy on alcohol outcomes to inform a Stage II randomized trial comparing the final sleep&#xD;
      intervention with a standard alcohol intervention.&#xD;
