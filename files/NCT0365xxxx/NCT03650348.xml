      A Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation study of PRS-343 in combination with atezolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b study to determine the MTD and RP2D and to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of PRS-343 administered in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1&#xD;
      antibody, in previously treated advanced or metastatic HER-2 positive solid tumors (e.g.,&#xD;
      bladder, breast and gastrointestinal). The study will include a dose escalation period&#xD;
      followed by an expansion period. PRS-343 and atezolizumab will be given intravenously once&#xD;
      every three weeks (Q3W).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All available safety data, emerging PK, pharmacodynamic data, and dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs) will be considered in guiding the Safety Committee's decisions regarding subsequent&#xD;
      doses to be tested during the escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD and RP2D have been&#xD;
      established, an expansion cohort will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One treatment cycle is defined as 21 days (3 weeks).&#xD;
