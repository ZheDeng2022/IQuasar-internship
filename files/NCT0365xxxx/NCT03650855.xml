      Finding a way to use Vertebral CT scan will help to predict screw loosing risk in spinal&#xD;
      fusion for degenerative spine disease. Patients who will undergo at least two spine fusion&#xD;
      levels for degenerative spine disease will be enrolled in. Before surgery, patients will&#xD;
      undergo a spinal QCT scan with a calibrated phantom. The calibrated bone density, at&#xD;
      bone-implant interface, will be assessed using dual energy CT scan immediately after surgery,&#xD;
      and six months later. The primary outcomes will be the difference between the two values of&#xD;
      the bone implant interface. The difference between density values will be correlated to the&#xD;
      pre-op bone density value.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screw loosening is a real problem in degenerative spine surgery because of the morbidity of&#xD;
      secondary surgery sometimes needed for elderly patients. Today, there is no real possibility&#xD;
      to know before surgery if cemented screws are needed or not. The use of cemented screws has&#xD;
      its morbidity. In fact, bone densitometry is not a good exam to predict the bone quality in&#xD;
      degenerative spine because of the arthritis. T-score in degenerative spine can be&#xD;
      overestimated. The goal of our study is analyze the bone-implant interface after spine fusion&#xD;
      using dual-energy CT scan technology which can provide pictures without artifact compared to&#xD;
      standard CT scan. This is a prospective observational monocentric study. Patients over 18&#xD;
      years old and have undergone at least two primary spine fusion levels will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are the use of cemented screws, secondary surgery and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease. The primary outcome will be the change in the bone-implant interface at six months&#xD;
      post-surgery compared to the interface after surgery. The change will be assessed by&#xD;
      calibrated dual CT scan. The interface bone density will be assessed using calibrated scans,&#xD;
      and correlate to the true vertebral bone density measured before surgery with a QCT. We hope&#xD;
      that this study can provide a simple and reproducible help for surgeons to choose between&#xD;
      uncommented and cemented screws for their spine fusions surgeries.&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited by their surgeon during the current consultation 3 months before&#xD;
        the surgery where the decision must support an arthrodesis of at least 2 levels between T3&#xD;
        and S1. The surgeon checks the inclusion criteria and offers the patient to participate.&#xD;
        Inclusion will be done during this consultation. Patients will be informed by the surgeon&#xD;
        of the nature of the study. They are intended to provide information to this effect and a&#xD;
        certificate of non-opposition to the participation will be.&#xD;
