  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, phase I clinical research study with TT-00420, an investigational,&#xD;
      oral, multi-target, dual mechanism kinase inhibitor targeting both mitosis and tumor&#xD;
      micro-environment, for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation part followed by a MTD&#xD;
      expansion part.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose Escalation Cohorts: Eligible adult patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled&#xD;
      into Dose Escalation cohorts. Starting dose of TT-00420 mono-therapy will be 1 mg p.o., q.d.&#xD;
      TT-00420 capsule will be administered once daily on a continuous schedule. A treatment cycle&#xD;
      consists of 28 days. An ABLRM guided by the EWOC principle will evaluate the risk of&#xD;
      under-dose or over-dose for the dose tested in each cohort and provide the recommendation&#xD;
      dose for next cohort. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated per the pre-defined DLT&#xD;
      criteria and managed by the pre-defined rules detailed in the protocol. Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD) and/or Dose Recommend for Dose Expansion (DRDE) will be determined in Dose&#xD;
      Escalation cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNBC Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNBC Dose-Expansion cohort will be opened to enroll the patients with advanced TNBC and&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of TT-00420 to identify the optimal&#xD;
      biological dose (OBD), when feasible, in patients with advanced TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAT Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel basket SAT Dose Expansion Cohort will be open to enroll patients with selected&#xD;
      advanced tumors (SAT) to evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of TT-00420 to&#xD;
      identify the optimal biological dose (OBD), when feasible, in patients with SATs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment in dose expansion cohorts may be put on hold if any significant safety finding(s)&#xD;
      that was not observed in dose escalation cohorts is identified. Bayesian modeling will be&#xD;
      updated with the new findings to evaluate if the previously determined MTD or DRDE still&#xD;
      suitable for further enrollment.&#xD;
