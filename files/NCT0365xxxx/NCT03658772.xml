  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with any form of an advanced or&#xD;
      progressive MSS CRC for which 1st and 2nd line standard therapy (at least one of which&#xD;
      contained fluorouracil) is no longer effective or is intolerable. This is a phase 1b,&#xD;
      multi-center, open label study designed to assess safety and tolerability of grapiprant in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab, to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, and to evaluate and characterize the PK of grapiprant alone and in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab. Disease response, pharmacodynamics, and response biomarkers will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
