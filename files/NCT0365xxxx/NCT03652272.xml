  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a well-documented need for effective interventions that can help patients understand&#xD;
      and safely adhere to prescribed medications, particularly those with greater potential for&#xD;
      harm if not taken correctly. The investigators will leverage health and consumer technologies&#xD;
      with their EHR-based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) Strategy to: 1) inform patients&#xD;
      about medication risks and safe use, 2) promote provider education and counseling about&#xD;
      prescribed drugs and 3) monitor patient adherence outside of visits. The EMC2 Strategy could&#xD;
      be feasible, sustainable, and readily available to ambulatory care practices.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, multi-site, physician-randomized pragmatic trial to evaluate the impact and&#xD;
      scalability of the EMC2 strategy to promote safe medication use and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arms and Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care. Usual care includes 1) variable provider counseling with limited or variable EHR&#xD;
      notifications or counseling support; 2) no distribution of print medication information&#xD;
      materials, including FDA Medication Guides in clinics and variable distribution in&#xD;
      pharmacies; and 3) limited or no active surveillance of medication use post-visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: EMC2 Strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, there are several components to this strategy that will be embedded into the&#xD;
      workflow via EHR/patient portal platforms, mostly automating their implementation. Following&#xD;
      patient movement through a provider visit, the following activities will occur for a select&#xD;
      list of pre-specified medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physician Medication Alert: If a prescribing physician attempts to place a new order or&#xD;
           change to an existing study medication prescription, an EHR-generated alert will notify&#xD;
           the provider that the medication requires patient counseling. Physicians can opt to&#xD;
           ignore this alert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provider Counseling Support: Content from the 1-page, Med Guide Summary will appear on&#xD;
           the screen, if selected by the provider, to orient and inform provider-patient&#xD;
           discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Automated Delivery of Med Guide + Summary: When patients leave an encounter, the&#xD;
           medication order in Epic will automatically cue printing of both the 1-page, health&#xD;
           literate Med Guide Summary for study medications and a full Med Guide, if applicable&#xD;
           (latter is required by FDA for certain medications only, the former designed to enhance&#xD;
           comprehension).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-Up Portal Questionnaire: Within 1 week post-visit, patients will receive an&#xD;
           automated email prompting them to log on to the patient portal. Patients' will be asked&#xD;
           to fill out a short set of questions related to medication adherence, and other&#xD;
           medication-related concerns (i.e. cost, side effects). If patients have not completed&#xD;
           the questionnaire within 2 days, another email reminder will be sent. The information&#xD;
           submitted back by the patient will be stored in the EHR. A second questionnaire will be&#xD;
           sent 1 month later.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The addition of the patient portal will provide opportunities to have ongoing&#xD;
           communications with their clinic, access to regimen-specific medication information, and&#xD;
           to provide a feedback loop informing healthcare providers of safety and&#xD;
           adherence-related behaviors and concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EHR Inbox Message to Clinic: The results of the patient portal questionnaire will be&#xD;
           sent back to the EHR, populating an inbox message notifying the nurse/clinic staff&#xD;
           and/or physician if a patient has a medication risk alert, detailing the nature of the&#xD;
           issue (i.e. education needed, adherence problem, side effect concerns, etc.). The system&#xD;
           will be flexible and allow the clinic to specify actions to be taken according to their&#xD;
           workflow preferences; the default plan is that patient contact will be undertaken by&#xD;
           nurses/clinic staff involved with care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinic Counseling: If a problem/concern is flagged during the review of the portal&#xD;
           questionnaire, there will be an expectation for a clinic staff member to respond to the&#xD;
           concern by calling the patient. A general orientation to staff at the clinic will&#xD;
           provide guidance on how to perform brief counseling based on each specific clinic&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the expected sample size for this pragmatic study is 300, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 330 patients (n=165 per site, the investigators anticipate 90% retention among the&#xD;
      recruited sample by 3 months (n=297). The investigators therefore will over sample to&#xD;
      accommodate some attrition.&#xD;
