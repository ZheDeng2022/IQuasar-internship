  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, medical termination of pregnancy represent 64% of total abortions in France. Thus,&#xD;
      it is a frequent act involving a large majority of women and a health-care public subject.&#xD;
      The two medicines used in medical abortion are mifepristone and misoprostol. The efficacy of&#xD;
      mifepristone-misoprostol combination is very high, greater than 90% up to 7 SA. Medical&#xD;
      abortion may be performed in outpatient basis or in short-terme hospitalization. One of the&#xD;
      limits of this technique development is the pain caused by the drugs intake mainly due to the&#xD;
      uterine contractions induced by misoprostol intake. Thus it is recommended a systematic&#xD;
      analgesics intake but despite these guidelines, pain level reported by the patients remains&#xD;
      significant. There is very limited data on the misoprostol influence or mifepristone dose on&#xD;
      pain. In a recent observational multicenter study, mifepristone 600 mg was reported to be&#xD;
      associated with decreased pain compared with mifepristone 200 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, it is important to confirm by a higher level evidence of study that the&#xD;
      protocol using mifepristone 600 mg decreases the pain level of medical abortion compared to a&#xD;
      protocol using mifepristone 200 mg. In the absence of benefit, we will not be able to&#xD;
      conclude to a benefit on the prevention of pain with a protocol associating 600 mg of&#xD;
      mifepristone and 400 μg of misoprostol. If the benefit on pain is confirmed, it will be&#xD;
      interesting to evaluate the efficacy / pain ratio of the 200 mg and 600 mg dose in terms of&#xD;
      quality of care or medical and economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study is interventional, prospective, comparative, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      multi-center, conducted in 11 French hospitals carrying out voluntary medical termination of&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected by the physician during the 4 consultations (initial consultation&#xD;
      of abortion request, inclusion consultation with Mifegyne® intake, consultation of&#xD;
      misoprostol intake (short-terme hospitalization), follow-up consultation from the available&#xD;
      data in the patient's medical file and from the questionning and clinical examination data&#xD;
      made during these 4 consultations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and purpose of the study: In 2015, the voluntary interruption of medication&#xD;
      pregnancy represented 57% of the total number of abortions in metropolitan France, ie 116,000&#xD;
      annual acts. Thus, it is a frequent act involving a very large majority of women and a&#xD;
      subject of public health. The two molecules used in drug-induced abortion are mifepristone&#xD;
      and misoprostol. The efficacy of mifepristone-misoprostol combination is very high, greater&#xD;
      than 90% before 7 SA. One of the limits of the diffusion of this technique is the pain caused&#xD;
      by the drug intake mainly at the time of the uterine contractions induced by the taking of&#xD;
      misoprostol. Thus it is recommended a systematic taking of analgesics but despite these&#xD;
      recommendations the level of pain reported by the patients remains high. There is very little&#xD;
      data on the influence of the dose of misoprotol or mifepristone on pain. In a recent&#xD;
      multicenter observational study, mifepristone 600 mg was reported to be associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in pain compared with 200 mg while the misoprostol dose had no influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, it is important to confirm by a higher level of evidence study whether the&#xD;
      protocol using 600 mg mifepristone decreases the pain level of drug-induced abortion compared&#xD;
      to a protocol using 200 mg, at the same dose of misoprostol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study,&#xD;
      conducted in metropolitan France, in 11 hospital centers performing drug-induced abortion&#xD;
      involving 320 patients. The inclusion criteria will be patients requesting a drug-induced&#xD;
      abortion, agreeing to participate in the study and not having a contraindication to both&#xD;
      study drugs. The main criterion will be the pain felt within 5 hours after taking&#xD;
      misoprostol. The secondary criteria will be the pain felt and painkillers consumed during the&#xD;
      various stages of drug induced abortion, the failure rate, the number of intermediate&#xD;
      consultations, tolerance and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and consequences: In the absence of benefit, the investigators will not be&#xD;
      able to conclude to a benefit on the prevention of the pain with a protocol associating 600&#xD;
      mg of mifepristone and 400 μg of misoprostol. In the event of confirmation of benefit on&#xD;
      pain, it will be interesting to evaluate the efficacy / pain ratio of the 200 mg and 600 mg&#xD;
      dose in terms of the quality of care or the medical and economic impact.&#xD;
