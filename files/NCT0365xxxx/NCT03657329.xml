  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of apnea detection and automated sleep analysis by&#xD;
      the Dreem dry-EEG headband and deep learning algorithm in comparison to the consensus of 5&#xD;
      sleep technologists' manual scoring of a gold-standard clinical polysomnogram (PSG) record in&#xD;
      adults during a physician-referred overnight sleep study due to suspicion of sleep-disordered&#xD;
      breathing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll up to 70 adults who are referred to the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center&#xD;
      by their physician for an overnight polysomnographic sleep study due to suspicion of&#xD;
      sleep-disordered breathing, with the aim of collecting 60 usable data sets (i.e., eligible&#xD;
      subjects with high-quality PSG and Dreem recordings). Upon arrival to the clinic, patients&#xD;
      provide informed consent, are interviewed to determine eligibility, and complete a detailed&#xD;
      demographic, medical, health, sleep, and lifestyle questionnaire (Alliance Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire; ASQ). After the ASQ, participants are fitted with the PSG and the Dreem&#xD;
      headband by the sleep technologist. During the PSG sleep study, the Dreem headband records&#xD;
      EEG, pulse, oxygen saturation (SO2), movement, and respiratory rate. Many participants may&#xD;
      undergo a split-night study with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device during&#xD;
      their participation, as deemed necessary by the clinical staff pursuant to the sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSG data from the first 30 eligible participants will be manually scored by 5 sleep&#xD;
      technologists. These manually-scored PSG data files (referred to as the training dataset)&#xD;
      will be synchronized with Dreem data files from the same night and the synchronized files&#xD;
      will be used to train Dreem's deep learning algorithms. Following training, the algorithms&#xD;
      will be deployed to automatically score the final 30 participants' Dreem datasets (testing&#xD;
      dataset). Finally, PSG records for the second 30 participants will be provided to the sponsor&#xD;
      and manually scored by 5 sleep technologists. The manual scoring results will be compared to&#xD;
      the Dreem automatic analysis to determine the accuracy of Dreem's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)&#xD;
      severity detection and sleep staging algorithms.&#xD;
