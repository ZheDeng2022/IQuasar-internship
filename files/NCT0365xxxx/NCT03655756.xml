  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Six patients will receive IFx-Hu2.0 on an outpatient basis at a single time point in a single&#xD;
      lesion, two lesions, or three lesions, as a monotherapy (a maximum of three lesions could be&#xD;
      injected). These patients will be assessed for any immediate adverse reactions and at Week 4&#xD;
      (Day 28+/-7 business days for any delayed adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six male and/or female adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years old), of any&#xD;
      ethnicity and race, with unresectable stage III or stage IV cutaneous melanoma with&#xD;
      accessible lesions, will be eligible for enrollment and treatment with IFx-Hu2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for this study, patients with unresectable metastatic disease must have&#xD;
      failed, refused or been deemed not candidates for at least one form of systemic&#xD;
      anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy as well as BRAF inhibition, if BRAF V600 mutated. Talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec (IMLYGIC®) is indicated for local treatment of unresectable cutaneous,&#xD;
      subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients with unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal melanoma lesions&#xD;
      recurrent after initial surgery must have failed, refused or been deemed not candidates for&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec to be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollees will receive IFx-Hu2.0 at a single time point. Depending on the number of&#xD;
      accessible lesions, a patient could receive up to three doses across three lesions (one dose&#xD;
      per lesion). Forty milliliters of peripheral blood will be collected from these patients&#xD;
      prior to treatment administration and at the follow-up visit four weeks later. The target&#xD;
      dose will be 100 μg of plasmid DNA per lesion injected at a final dose volume of 200 μL per&#xD;
      lesion. To allow for the observation of any acute toxicity in the first subject enrolled and&#xD;
      prevent any occurrence of excessive toxicities in subsequent subjects, the first subject&#xD;
      enrolled will receive a single dose of IFx-Hu2.0. Subsequent subjects will be administered&#xD;
      the product after at least seven days. Beyond the first subject, the maximum number of&#xD;
      lesions to be injected at any given time point in the study phase proposed is three lesions.&#xD;
      These samples will be used to perform complete blood counts (CBC) and clinical chemistry&#xD;
      tests. A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood at the same&#xD;
      frequency. Blood samples will be drawn for immune response evaluation as well. At the end of&#xD;
      the study period, a biopsy of the lesion injected and a non-injected lesion (if applicable)&#xD;
      will be collected. If the patient has a response to therapy, the patient will have the option&#xD;
      of continuing the study at three-week intervals so long as they have not progressed. Optional&#xD;
      tumor biopsies and peripheral blood collections may be obtained on subsequent treatment&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

    <description>Therapeutic Classification:&#xD;
Noncellular, Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine &gt; Immunomodulator&#xD;
Route of Administration:&#xD;
Intratumoral injection of cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal lesions&#xD;
Mechanism of Action:&#xD;
Injection of the IFx-Hu2.0 plasmid DNA construct into the target lesion facilitates the localized expression of the highly immunogenic Emm55 protein by the tumor cells on their cell surface.&#xD;
Physiological Effect:&#xD;
This expression then primes a cascade of immune events that exposes the patient-specific abnormal tumor antigens to the effector mechanisms of the immune system. The immune response becomes systemic as inter-antigenic epitope spreading produces neoantigens to naïve T cells. Therefore, injected lesions are targeted along with non-injected lesions (abscopal effect). This is especially important in conditions where the mutational phenotype varies greatly among individual lesions.</description>
