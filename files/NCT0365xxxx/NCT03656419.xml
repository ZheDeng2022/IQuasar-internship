  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Halitosis is the term used to describe any unpleasant odor relative to expired air regardless&#xD;
      of its source. The prevalence of halitosis in the population is approximately 30%, of which&#xD;
      80-90% of the cases originate in the oral cavity resulting from proteolytic degradation by&#xD;
      gram negative anaerobic bacteria. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been widely&#xD;
      used and with very satisfactory results in the health sciences, it involves the use of a&#xD;
      non-toxic dye, called photosensitizer (FS), and a light source of a specific wavelength in&#xD;
      the presence of the oxygen in the medium. This interaction, is capable of creating toxic&#xD;
      species that generate cell death. The advantages of this approach are to avoid resistance to&#xD;
      target bacteria and damage to adjacent tissues as the antimicrobial effect is confined only&#xD;
      to areas covered by the dye and irradiated by light acting on the target organism rapidly,&#xD;
      depending on the dose of light energy and power output. The objective of this controlled&#xD;
      clinical study is to verify the effect of aPDT in the treatment of halitosis by evaluating&#xD;
      the formation of volatile sulfur compounds with gas chromatography and microbiological&#xD;
      analysis before and after treatment. Will be included in this research young adults in the&#xD;
      age group between 18 to 25 years with diagnosis of halitosis. The selected subjects will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups, G1 aPDT, G2 Scraper and G3 aPDT and scraper. All subjects will be&#xD;
      submitted to microbiological analysis and evaluation with Oral ChromaTM before, after&#xD;
      treatment and followed up of 7, 14 and 30 days For the evaluation of the association of the&#xD;
      categorical variables will be used Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact Test, to compare the&#xD;
      means will be used tStudent test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and to analyze the&#xD;
      correlation between the continuous variables will be applied the correlation test by Pearson.&#xD;
      In the analyzes of the experimental differences in each group the Wilcoxon test will be used.&#xD;
      For all analyzes a level of significance of 95% (p &lt;0.05) will be considered.&#xD;

      The study will follow the regulatory norms of research in humans with favorable opinion of&#xD;
      the Research Ethics Committee of the University Nove de Julho number, and the responsible&#xD;
      ones of the participants will sign the consent form free after clarifications for&#xD;
      authorization of the participation in the research, according to Resolution 466/12 of the&#xD;
      National Health Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: A controlled, quantitative cross-sectional clinical study. Hypothesis Null&#xD;
      hypothesis: There is no alteration of halitosis after the use of photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      employing the use of blue dye and red LED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no microbiological alteration after antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental hypothesis: There is a decrease in halitosis after the use of photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy using blue dye and red LED associated or not with the tongue scraper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is microbiological alteration after antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Research Subjects For this study will be evaluated young adults of both sexes, enrolled&#xD;
      regularly in the Dentistry Clinic of the University Nove de Julho - São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Included in this study are young adults between the ages of 18 and 25,&#xD;
      with an informed consent form and authorization for the diagnosis and treatment of halitosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adults diagnosed with halitosis presenting Oralchroma S2H ≥ 112 ppb and / or CH3SH ≥&#xD;
      26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected subjects will be divided into 3 groups. There will be 1 session for each group.&#xD;
      All samples from the subjects will be submitted to microbiological analysis and evaluation&#xD;
      with Oral ChromaTM before and after treatment followed by controls of 7, 14 and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of the lingual plaque will be collected using a sterile swab that will be passed on&#xD;
      the surface of the tongue back with unique movement and light pressure. Samples will be&#xD;
      deposited in sterile tubes that will be identified and stored at -80 ° C until analyzed.&#xD;
      After thawing, the samples will be vortexed for one minute. For extraction of the bacterial&#xD;
      DNA samples will be boiled for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.&#xD;
      The supernatant will be placed in a new microtube containing 100μL phenol / chloroform /&#xD;
      isoamyl alcohol (25: 24: 1), followed by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA will be&#xD;
      resuspended in TE buffer. The levels of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and T. denticola will be&#xD;
      analyzed by quantitative PCR. The quantitative analysis will be performed using real-time PCR&#xD;
      using the Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) and&#xD;
      fluorescently detected products using the Quantimix Easy SYG Kit (Biotools, Madrid, Spain),&#xD;
      following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. To the reaction 10 l will be used&#xD;
      SYBR Green 0.5 ul DNA template, 200 mM of each primer (P. gingivalis CATAGATATCACGAGGAACTCCGA&#xD;
      TT and AAACTGTTAGCAACTACCGATGTGG; T.forsythia GGGTGAGTAACGCGTATGTAACCT and&#xD;
      ACCCATCCGCAACCAATAAA, T. denticola CGTTCCTGGGCCTTGTACA and TAGCGACTTCAGGTACCCTCG; Universal&#xD;
      bacteria CCATGAAGTCGGAATCGCTAG and GCTTGACGGGCGGTGT) in total volume of 20 μl. For the&#xD;
      standard curve, reactions containing template DNA 2 to 2X105 copies of the analyzed gene (16S&#xD;
      rRNA) will be performed using pTOPO plasmids in which the 16S genes of the 14 different&#xD;
      organisms will be cloned. As a negative control will be added sterile milliQ water instead of&#xD;
      DNA template. Reactions to 16S rRNA will be performed with initial denaturation at 95 ° C for&#xD;
      2 minutes followed by 36 cycles of 94 ° C for 30 seconds, 55 ° C for 1 minute and 72 ° C for&#xD;
      2 minutes and final extension at 72 ° C for 10 minutes 46. Fluorescence will be detected&#xD;
      after each cycle and plotted using Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System software (Applied&#xD;
      Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). To ensure the specificity of the products detected by&#xD;
      fluorescence and to avoid detection of primer dimers, the detection will be performed to a&#xD;
      degree below the dissociation temperature of the amplicons. All samples will be analyzed in&#xD;
      duplicate and each dilution of the plasmids to the standard curve in triplicate. The purpose&#xD;
      of the microbiological evaluation will be to verify the effectiveness of the photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of halitosis, complementing the clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of halitosis level The air collection will follow the OralChromaTM Manual&#xD;
      Instruction, where the participant is instructed to make a mouthwash with cysteine (10 mM)&#xD;
      for 1 minute to differentiate the CSV origin and remain mouth closed for 1 minute. A&#xD;
      manufacturer's own syringe for collection of mouth air will be introduced into the patient's&#xD;
      mouth with the plunger fully inserted. The patient closes his mouth, breathes through his&#xD;
      nose and waits with his mouth closed for 1 minute. You will be asked not to touch the tip of&#xD;
      the syringe with your tongue. The plunger will be pulled out, re-empties air from the syringe&#xD;
      into the patient's mouth and again pulls the plunger to fill the syringe with the breath&#xD;
      sample. Clean the tip of the syringe to remove moisture from the saliva, place the gas&#xD;
      injection needle in the syringe, adjust the plunger to 0.5 ml. It is injected into the door&#xD;
      of the appliance in a single movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OralChromaTM allows the capture of gas concentration values by measuring the CSV thresholds&#xD;
      (from 0 to 1000 ppb), very accurately after 8 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are stored on the device itself and can be retrieved and viewed at any time for&#xD;
      comparison before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the analysis of CSV captured by the system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sulfide: originates mainly from the bacteria present on the back of the tongue. Values&#xD;
           above 112 ppb are indicators of halitosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylmercaptan: predominantly higher in the periodontal pockets. Values up to 26 ppb&#xD;
           are considered normal. Periodontal disease typically results in a high ratio of&#xD;
           methylmercaptan / sulfhydride (&gt; 3: 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dimethyl sulphide: both may be of periodontal origin or systemic (intestinal, hepatic,&#xD;
           pulmonary) origin. It can also be caused, temporarily, by the ingestion of certain foods&#xD;
           and beverages. The perception threshold of dimethylsulphide is the lowest, 8 ppb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid changes in halimetry, the examination will be conducted in the morning and&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to follow the following guidelines: 48 hours before the&#xD;
      evaluation avoid ingesting food with garlic, onion and strong seasoning, alcohol consumption&#xD;
      and use of oral antiseptic. On the day of the evaluation, in the morning, you can eat up to 2&#xD;
      hours before the exam, abstain from coffee, candies, chewing gum, oral hygiene products and&#xD;
      perfumed personnel (aftershave, deodorant, perfume, creams and / or tonic) and the brushing&#xD;
      will be only with water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the photodynamic therapy will be used an equipment developed for this project with&#xD;
      emission of red LED (660nm) and tip of 2.84 cm² in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment of application of the aPDT will be present only the volunteer to be treated and&#xD;
      the professional responsible, both using specific eye protection glasses. The active tip of&#xD;
      the laser will be coated with clear disposable plastic (PVC) (avoiding cross contamination&#xD;
      and hygiene) and the professional will be properly dressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One session of the Chimiolux® photosensitizing aPDT will be performed, at a concentration of&#xD;
      0.005% (165μm), to be applied enough to cover the middle third and back of the tongue for 5&#xD;
      minutes for incubation, the excess will be removed with sucker in order to maintain the wet&#xD;
      surface with the photosensitizer itself, without the use of water. Four points will be&#xD;
      irradiated with a distance of 1cm between the points, considering the scattering halo and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of aPDT (figure 5). Based on previous studies carried out with the aPDT for the&#xD;
      treatment of halitosis the apparatus will be previously calibrated with wavelength 660 nm,&#xD;
      with energy of 72 J, power of 800 mW for groups 1 and 3 that will be irradiated for 90&#xD;
      seconds per point, creep of 282mW / cm².&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization and Statistical Processing of Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be tabulated and treated in the program Bioestat 5.0 The descriptive statistics&#xD;
      of the data will be performed. For the evaluation of the association of categorical&#xD;
      variables, the Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact Test will be used to compare the means will&#xD;
      be used Student's t test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and to analyze the correlation&#xD;
      between the continuous variables will be applied the test of Pearson correlation. In the&#xD;
      analyzes of the experimental differences in each group the Wilcoxon test will be used. For&#xD;
      all analyzes a level of significance of 95% (p &lt;0.05) will be considered.&#xD;
