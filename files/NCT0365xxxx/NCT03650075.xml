  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I stage to investigate the safety and tolerability of MG-S-2525 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The proposed trial consists of 3 study parts to be conducted at Tri-Service&#xD;
      General Hospital and includes Single Ascending Dose (SAD), Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and&#xD;
      Food Effect parts. This study will enroll up to 16 evaluable subjects in the SAD part, 36&#xD;
      evaluable subjects in the MAD part and enroll up to 20 evaluable subjects for the Food Effect&#xD;
      part.&#xD;
