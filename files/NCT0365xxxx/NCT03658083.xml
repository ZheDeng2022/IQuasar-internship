      Background Surgery for lung cancer can be performed using open (thoracotomy) or minimally&#xD;
      invasive techniques (Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS)). Despite being associated with&#xD;
      fewer postoperative complications (PPCs) VATS is difficult to perform and is only used by&#xD;
      20-44% of thoracic surgeons in the UK. Robotic-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS) maybe a more&#xD;
      attractive minimally invasive approach. To date, no studies have explored the impact of RATS&#xD;
      on exercise capacity or physical activity and although 1 study has looked at Heath Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (HRQOL) post-RATS compared to an open technique indicators of surgical&#xD;
      technique were not controlled for. Furthermore, investigators have little understanding of&#xD;
      patients' experience of RATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the variability of change in exercise capacity and health-related quality of&#xD;
           life (HRQOL) between those who receive thoracotomy V RATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the difference in post-operative physical activity (step and activity count),&#xD;
           across 7 days, in those who receive thoracotomy V RATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the manner in which patients appraise their experience of undergoing RATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed-method, multi-center study will be undertaken, utilizing a prospective&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study design and an interpretive phenomenological approach. 80&#xD;
      individuals, referred for a lung lobectomy with a primary or secondary diagnosis of lung&#xD;
      cancer, will complete outcomes assessed at 4 time-points. The Incremental Shuttle Walk Test&#xD;
      (ISWT) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) and the EORTC Lung Cancer module (EORTC QLQ LC13) will be&#xD;
      completed at: baseline, 3-6 days post surgery, 6-weeks post-surgery and at 3-month follow up.&#xD;
      Patients will wear an activity monitor immediately post-surgery until 1-week post-discharge.&#xD;
      Step and activity counts will be recorded. In-depth interviews will be conducted with up to&#xD;
      15 patients who underwent RATS to explore the manner in which patients appraise their&#xD;
      experience of RATS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cause of cancer in the UK and the most common cause of&#xD;
      cancer death. Surgery is currently the most effective treatment for curing lung cancer and it&#xD;
      can be performed using open (thoracotomy) or minimally invasive techniques (Video Assisted&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgery (VATS)). Despite VATS being associated with fewer postoperative&#xD;
      complications (PPCs), faster recovery and better survival at 4 years compared to thoracotomy&#xD;
      it is only used by 20-44% of thoracic surgeons in the UK and just 5% of surgeons in Europe&#xD;
      report using minimally invasive techniques for lung resection. Rigid, restrictive instruments&#xD;
      and suboptimal vision means a steep learning curve is necessary to conduct VATS successfully.&#xD;
      RATS maybe a more attractive minimally invasive approach as it offers 3DHD vision, a 360&#xD;
      degree view of the chest, and a fully articulated arm. JCUH and the Barts Hospital are two of&#xD;
      the few centers in the UK performing RATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on RATS has been largely limited to single retrospective case series reports&#xD;
      focusing on safety (PPCs and mortality) and cost effectiveness outcomes. Little research has&#xD;
      been conducted exploring the effect of RATS on patient-centered outcomes that are also&#xD;
      important quality measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no studies have explored the impact of RATS on exercise capacity, yet investigators&#xD;
      know that individuals who undergo a thoracotomy have a 16% reduction in exercise capacity at&#xD;
      6 months follow up. Exercise capacity has been shown to be an important predictor for&#xD;
      long-term prognosis and length of stay following thoracic surgery, which can have substantial&#xD;
      implications for cost. Furthermore, percentage VO2 max has been shown to be the best&#xD;
      predictor of PPCs within 30 days of undergoing a lung resection (predictive value 85.5%),&#xD;
      which is an important indicator of patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies have looked at HRQOL post-RATS and compared it to an open technique. Balduyck and&#xD;
      colleagues reported that whilst significant reductions from baseline were seen 1 month&#xD;
      post-surgery in those who underwent an open procedure (sternotomy), HRQOL had returned to&#xD;
      baseline values by 1 month post-surgery in those who underwent RATS. However, indicators of&#xD;
      whether individuals received RATS or an open procedure were not controlled for which is&#xD;
      likely to be important as individuals who have large tumors are not eligible to receive RATS.&#xD;
      Instead RATS is usually assigned to older, frailer individuals. The second study did conduct&#xD;
      between-groups comparisons between those who underwent a robotic lobectomy V those who&#xD;
      received an open rib and nerve sparing lobectomy. The mental-component of the SF-12 was&#xD;
      significantly higher in the robot group at 3 weeks post-surgery, indicating better mental&#xD;
      quality of life, although there were no significant between-group differences detected for&#xD;
      the physical-component. By 4 months follow up neither the mental nor the physical HRQOL&#xD;
      scores differed between the two groups. The SF-12 in a general measure of health status and&#xD;
      to date the impact of open surgery V RATS on disease-specific HRQOL has not been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is associated with improved HRQOL in patients with lung cancer and&#xD;
      increased survival post-diagnosis of cancer. However, 2 months following a lung resection,&#xD;
      performed via a thoracotomy or VATS, physical activity levels were still reduced.&#xD;
      Unfortunately comparisons between surgical groups were not possible in this study due to the&#xD;
      small number of patients who underwent VATS (14), therefore postoperative physical activity&#xD;
      in those who have undergone thoracotomy compared to minimally invasive surgery is still&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) outcome indicator set 2015/16 includes enhancing quality&#xD;
      of life and ensuring patients have a positive experience of care (NHS England, 2015). To&#xD;
      date, no qualitative research exploring the patients' experience of RATS has been conducted&#xD;
      and investigators have little understanding of patients' experience of thoracic surgery in&#xD;
      general. Interestingly, a very recent study exploring preoperative nurses work experience&#xD;
      with robotics found that feelings of uncertainty and concerns about safety were common due to&#xD;
      a lack of education about the robot system. It is likely, these feelings of unease are&#xD;
      translated to patients during their preoperative consultation leading to heightened anxiety.&#xD;
      Furthermore, if nurses do not feel they have sufficient information about the robot system&#xD;
      they are unlikely to be educating patients fully about their procedure. A study exploring the&#xD;
      appraisals of patients' experience of RATS is important to identify ways in which both pre&#xD;
      and postoperative care can be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would seem literature is scare exploring the impact of RATS on outcomes that are likely to&#xD;
      be meaningful to patients. Therefore the overall aim of this study is to examine the impact&#xD;
      of RATS compared to thoracotomy on patient-centered outcomes and to explore the individuals'&#xD;
      experience of undergoing RATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed-method, multi-center study will be undertaken, utilizing a prospective&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study design and an interpretive phenomenological approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals referred for a lung resection with a primary or secondary diagnosis of lung&#xD;
      cancer will be eligible, although those with a tumor &gt;7cm will be excluded. Individuals&#xD;
      referred for a lung resection via thoracotomy will be recruited from James Cook University&#xD;
      Hospital (JCUH), Middlesbrough and those referred for RATS will be recruited from JCUH or St&#xD;
      Bartholomew's hospital, London (Barts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a referral for a lung resection via thoracotomy or RATS is received a cover letter and&#xD;
      information sheet, containing details of the study, will be mailed to patients along with&#xD;
      their clinic appointment letter. Interested patients will be encouraged to contact a member&#xD;
      of the research team, by telephone or email, to discuss the study in more detail. When&#xD;
      patients attend their preoperative clinic a member of the clinical team will request&#xD;
      permission for a member of the research team to approach them about participation in the&#xD;
      study. If individuals would like to participate in the study informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery all patients receive standard physiotherapy consisting of breathing&#xD;
      exercises and advice on activities postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cardiothoracic surgeons, 2 at JCUH and 1 at Barts, will perform lung resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with usual care at JCUH and Barts all individuals will be transferred to sitting&#xD;
      at the bedside as soon as possible post-surgery and will be required to walk 150m before&#xD;
      being discharged home. At JCUH patients are also required to complete a flight of stairs and&#xD;
      cycle for five minutes (with no resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and anthropometric information will be collected at baseline at the preoperative&#xD;
      clinic visit including; age, sex, BMI, lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second&#xD;
      (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)), smoking history, comorbidities, cancer stage and&#xD;
      grade. Details of the operation (i.e. technique, time, surgeon, post-operative pain&#xD;
      management) will be documented. Length of stay, readmissions and PPCs will be recorded at 3&#xD;
      months follow-up. The same criteria will be used to define a PPC as applied by Brocki et al.&#xD;
      PPCs will be classified as minor (a score of 1), medium (a score of two) or severe (a score&#xD;
      of three). A PPC will be defined as clinically relevant if two or more items are graded as a&#xD;
      minor complication (score of 1) or one item is graded as a medium or severe complication&#xD;
      (scores ≥2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed at 4 time-points; at baseline in the preoperative clinic (1 day to&#xD;
      2 weeks prior to surgery), day 3 post-surgery, at the follow up postoperative clinic visit&#xD;
      (within 6 weeks post-surgery) and at an additional hospital visit which will take place at 3&#xD;
      months. The time taken to complete each assessment will be recorded, we estimate no more than&#xD;
      2 hours will be required to complete the outcome variables (ISWT, the European Organization&#xD;
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30) and the&#xD;
      EORTC Lung Cancer module (EORTC QLQ LC13)). Individuals will also be requested to wear an&#xD;
      activity monitor Actigraph G3TX (Actigraph) immediately post-surgery until 1-week&#xD;
      post-discharge. Data will be stored on the cardiothoracic database at JCUH or Barts and on an&#xD;
      IBM SPSS statistics database at Teesside University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interpretive phenomenological approach (IPA) will be applied to the collection and&#xD;
      analysis of the qualitative data. IPA aims to understand the lived experience of participants&#xD;
      in response to a specific event (i.e. undergoing surgery). Analysis examines in detail how an&#xD;
      event is experienced and what meaning is ascribed to that event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informal interview schedule consisting of open-ended questions will be developed in&#xD;
      conjunction with members of the cardiothoracic team. The questions will be developed to&#xD;
      stimulate narratives focusing on the experience of undergoing RATS whilst also permitting&#xD;
      other topics, important to the individuals, to be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be conducted on up to 15 patients who underwent RATS. The interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted at patient's homes one week following hospital discharge (at the same time&#xD;
      the activity monitor is collected). Interviews will be largely patient led, allowing&#xD;
      individuals to tell their own story in their own words and at their own pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is exercise capacity measured by the ISWT (m) completed at patients'&#xD;
      6-week postoperative clinic. Based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID)&#xD;
      (48m) for the ISWT (Singh et al 2008), the between-subjects variability in the measure, and&#xD;
      the variability in the change scores (the 7-week reliability). A conventional estimation with&#xD;
      90% power and 2 p=0.05 returned a required sample size of 80 patients, 40 per group. This is&#xD;
      based on an ANCOVA analysis model, where invetigators look at the differences in the change&#xD;
      in ISWT between groups, adjusted for any imbalance between groups in ISWT performance at&#xD;
      baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will involve conducting a close line-by-line analysis on each original transcript to&#xD;
      explore the claims and understandings of the participants. A second researcher will review&#xD;
      the original transcripts before the 'emerging themes' are agreed. Once agreed, 2 researchers&#xD;
      will transfer the 'emerging themes' across the entire data set, thereafter referring to them&#xD;
      as 'master themes' The final master themes will be presented to a third researcher and&#xD;
      agreed. Thematic mapping will be used to develop the relationship between themes. Finally,&#xD;
      the findings will be translated into a narrative account with verbatim extracts (quotes) to&#xD;
      provide a means of validation.&#xD;
