    <textblock>
      Specific phobias and other anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&#xD;
      represent a major mental health problem, and present a significant challenge to researchers&#xD;
      because effective treatment usually involves repeated exposure to feared stimuli, and the&#xD;
      high levels of associated distress can lead to termination of treatment. Recent advances in&#xD;
      computational functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide a method by which&#xD;
      individuals may be unconsciously exposed to fearful stimuli, leading to effective fear&#xD;
      extinction while eliminating a primary cause of attrition. Because such treatment happens&#xD;
      directly in the brain, the investigators further hypothesize that the behavior outcomes may&#xD;
      generalize particularly well to different contexts beyond the treatment period, and this&#xD;
      approach, if successful, may be extended to treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD) and other mental disorders.The objective of this study is to use the novel approach of&#xD;
      neuro-reinforcement based on decoded fMRI information to reduce fear responses to fearful&#xD;
      stimuli (e.g., spiders, heights) in individuals with phobias, directly and unconsciously in&#xD;
      the brain, without repeatedly exposing participants to their feared stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of the R61 Phase are to: (1) confirm that our method engages the&#xD;
      neurobiological target (amygdala reactivity to images of a feared object) in a population of&#xD;
      individuals with specific phobia; and (2) to determine dosage-response optimization. The R61&#xD;
      Phase will confirm engagement of amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli by our intervention&#xD;
      method in patients suffering from phobia of everyday objects and animals (e.g., spiders).&#xD;
      Varying the number of neuro reinforcement sessions across different subject groups (3 groups&#xD;
      of 10 subjects each) and measuring reductions in the amygdala reactivity will demonstrate the&#xD;
      robustness and mechanisms of target engagement. This will also enable assessment of the&#xD;
      optimal dosage required to balance between maximal target engagement and imaging costs, in&#xD;
      order to inform later studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypotheses are: i) our proposed intervention method will lead to significant&#xD;
      reduction in fear to feared objects, via influence of the neurobiological target (amygdala&#xD;
      reactivity, as measured by fMRI) at a suitable dosage level, this method can be successfully&#xD;
      applied to patients suffering from phobias of everyday objects (e.g., spiders, syringes), to&#xD;
      reduce clinically relevant fear measures.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to use the novel approach of neuro-reinforcement based on&#xD;
      decoded fMRI information to reduce fear responses to fearful stimuli (e.g., spiders, heights)&#xD;
      in individuals with phobias, directly and unconsciously in the brain, without repeatedly&#xD;
      exposing participants to their feared stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) confirm that our method engages the neurobiological target (amygdala reactivity to images&#xD;
      of a feared object) in a population of individuals with specific phobia; and (2) to determine&#xD;
      dosage-response optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to enroll a total of 60 participants (30 patients and 30 controls in&#xD;
      the R61 phase). The investigators seek female and male participants in equal proportions. The&#xD;
      age range of the subjects will be between 18 and 65. The investigators will work to achieve&#xD;
      an ethnic and racial distribution that is consistent with the very diverse community found in&#xD;
      the Los Angeles area and the UCLA campus: Hispanic/Latino 56.4%, African American 7.7%;&#xD;
      Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander 15.8%; White (non-Hispanic) 17.5% (California Health&#xD;
      Interview Survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential research participants' eligibility will be confirmed at the beginning of the first&#xD;
      session, but eligibility criteria will also be listed in recruitment materials. A research&#xD;
      assistant or other personnel possessing current CITI and HIPAA certification will conduct an&#xD;
      eligibility screening interview in a private room. Following onset of the study, subjects who&#xD;
      are unable to attend to or respond to stimuli as required by the experimental protocol will&#xD;
      be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders, the most common group of mental disorders in the United States, represent&#xD;
      a major mental health problem. Phobias, in which fear and anxiety are triggered by a specific&#xD;
      stimulus or situation, are the largest category of anxiety disorders and affect 5 - 12% of&#xD;
      the world's population. The treatment of anxiety disorders represents almost one third of&#xD;
      mental health costs annually. Specific phobias and other anxiety disorders, such as PTSD,&#xD;
      represent a significant driving force in seeking mental health-related treatment. These&#xD;
      disorders present a major challenge, and researchers have previously explored various ways to&#xD;
      address this challenge. One of the most effective psychotherapy methods for the treatment of&#xD;
      phobias involves exposure, or repeated approach towards feared stimuli, often in a hierarchy&#xD;
      of least to most anxiety-provoking distances or situations. Exposure-based therapies are&#xD;
      effective in reducing symptoms, but their effectiveness depends on the individual's capacity&#xD;
      or willingness to consciously confront their feared object. The associated distress can be so&#xD;
      extreme that it prevents patients from seeking treatment, and contributes to attrition from&#xD;
      exposure once treatment begins: estimated dropout rates can top 70%, with three out of five&#xD;
      refusing to even begin treatment, meaning that as low as 12% of patients receive adequate&#xD;
      treatment. Even other therapies that require conscious engagement with the aversive stimulus,&#xD;
      such as cognitive therapies, show high dropout rates. As a result, there is an unmet need for&#xD;
      treatment that minimizes attrition and subjective patient discomfort, especially for clinical&#xD;
      populations for whom conventional exposure-based therapies are prohibitively aversive. This&#xD;
      problem has led some researchers to develop less aversive exposure-based therapies-for&#xD;
      example, by showing the phobic stimulus very briefly, and immediately following it with a&#xD;
      visual mask. However, in general, learning effects are weak and short-lasting when stimuli&#xD;
      are fully masked because masking greatly reduces the signal strength of neural representation&#xD;
      in the visual system. It would seem ideal if the investigators could capitalize on the&#xD;
      potential benefits of fully unconscious presentation without sacrificing neural signal&#xD;
      strength of the relevant visual representation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the R61 phase, the investigators will enroll 30 patients, who will be required to meet the&#xD;
      DSM-5 criteria for specific phobias. Patients will be assessed by trained clinical personnel&#xD;
      using the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS) for DSM-5 - Adult version,&#xD;
      a structured clinical interview based on the DSM-5 criteria (Brown &amp; Barlow 2014) and the&#xD;
      Fear Survey Schedule (Wolpe &amp; Lang 1964). Participants presenting with post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Substance Use Disorder, Current Major&#xD;
      Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Psychosis, neurologic diagnoses or unstable serious medical&#xD;
      conditions will be excluded. Participants will also be excluded if (a) if they can touch the&#xD;
      phobic object category during the pre-training BAT without presenting significant distress,&#xD;
      and/or (b) if they are currently prescribed psychotropic medication. Importantly,&#xD;
      participants who cannot even view images of a feared stimulus without presenting significant&#xD;
      distress will also be excluded, as the pre-treatment and post-treatment tests of biological&#xD;
      target engagement require that participants view images belonging to the feared object&#xD;
      category. The investigators will enroll 30 healthy individuals (controls) who obtain&#xD;
      subclinical scores on the Fear Survey Schedule (Wolpe &amp; Lang 1964).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roles and Responsibilities Our study procedures and results will be monitored by the&#xD;
      Principal (Hakwan Lau) and Co-Principal (Michelle Craske) Investigators, the UCLA&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board, and an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drs. Lau and Craske will monitor adherence to the confidentiality rules, the quality of the&#xD;
      data, their timeliness, and the correctness of their entry into computer files. This is a&#xD;
      routine part of their supervision of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and assistants.&#xD;
      Every two weeks, data safety will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Safety Specific Events That Would Preclude a Participant from Continuing the&#xD;
      Intervention A participant will be precluded from continuing the intervention in the event of&#xD;
      an adverse event rated 3 -5 according to the scale in the Reporting Adverse Events section&#xD;
      below. Such events could include an injury or other event resulting in hospitalization or a&#xD;
      persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a life-threatening or disabling event, or&#xD;
      a fatal event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Managing Any Medication Related issues N/A Potential Risks and Protections&#xD;
      Against Risk (see Human Subjects for more details) There are no known physical, social,&#xD;
      legal, or other adverse effects associated with participation in this study. The risks from&#xD;
      this study to the subject are minimal. At all times, participants will be informed that they&#xD;
      are welcome to stop any part of the procedures at any time without penalty and to discuss&#xD;
      their concerns or ask questions of the research staff at any time. Subjects will be informed&#xD;
      that they should contact the PIs if they experience a research-related injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that some participants may become uncomfortable revealing personal information&#xD;
      when completing questionnaires and/or become fatigued and bored during the experimental&#xD;
      procedures. Participants may become physically uncomfortable with the electrodes attached to&#xD;
      their person and/or with sitting for long periods of time during the psychophysiological&#xD;
      procedures. They also may become anxious when exposed to the psychophysiological equipment&#xD;
      and procedures. It is possible that participants may experience emotional distress when&#xD;
      presented with feared stimuli at the outset of the study. All on-site study personnel will be&#xD;
      clinicians who will be available to address participants' needs in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical interviewing will be conducted by trained advanced clinical psychology PhD students&#xD;
      who are sensitive to the potential discomfort that participants may have while discussing&#xD;
      personal matters. All diagnostic procedures will be conducted by staff members experienced in&#xD;
      performance of similar clinical studies, with appropriate Human Subjects and HIPAA&#xD;
      certifications. Interviews will be conducted in sound protected rooms. All of the procedures,&#xD;
      including fear conditioning, have been used extensively in prior studies without adverse&#xD;
      events. Our instrumentation for psychophysiological recordings meets all standards for non-&#xD;
      invasive recordings, is well maintained, and has approval from the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration. Standard application procedures are observed to minimize risk of infection.&#xD;
      When participants arrive for their first session, they will participate in a familiarization&#xD;
      period in the experimental room in Franz Hall and they will be allowed and encouraged to ask&#xD;
      questions about the equipment and procedures during and after the equipment is set-up.&#xD;
      Subjects will be protected by: a) respecting their right to refuse to attempt or continue any&#xD;
      task, b) providing reassurance or intervention if needed, and c) terminating the experimental&#xD;
      procedures for participants that become acutely distressed during a session. To minimize the&#xD;
      risks of fatigue, all participants appearing fatigued during the procedures will be allowed&#xD;
      to take a break.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both the decoder construction and the neuro-reinforcement sessions, participants will&#xD;
      not be viewing images belonging to the Active or Control fear stimuli categories, so&#xD;
      discomfort should be minimal. However, in the event that some subjects are unable to&#xD;
      comfortably tolerate such long scanning times, sessions may be broken up into shorter&#xD;
      sessions. Decoder construction can be separated into two 1-hour sessions, and&#xD;
      neuro-reinforcement can be broken into twice as many 45-minute sessions. For example, instead&#xD;
      of 3 days 1.5-hour sessions of neuro-reinforcement, a subject could undertake 6 days of&#xD;
      45-minute sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known significant side effects associated with MRI procedures. The magnetic&#xD;
      fields, at the strengths used, are assumed to be without harm, as our MRI scanning procedures&#xD;
      fall within the FDA guidelines for radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure. The&#xD;
      investigators feel these are safe levels and are less hazardous than a comparable X-ray&#xD;
      computed tomography examination. Exceptions include if a person has electrically,&#xD;
      magnetically, or mechanically activated implants (such as cardiac pacemakers), clips on blood&#xD;
      vessels in his or her brain, or other metallic objects in his or her body such as shrapnel,&#xD;
      bullets, buckshot, or metal fragments; subjects with such attributes will not be allowed to&#xD;
      participate. Although there are no known risks of an MRI scan to the unborn fetus, the&#xD;
      investigators will not permit anyone who is or is suspected to be pregnant to participate.&#xD;
      Subjects will thus be given an MRI screening questionnaire prior to participation, and will&#xD;
      be excluded from participating in brain imaging studies if they indicate any risk factors on&#xD;
      this questionnaire. The most serious potential risks are related to the possibility of&#xD;
      ferromagnetic objects in the vicinity of the high- field magnet in the scanner. These objects&#xD;
      could conceivably become projectiles due to the powerful magnetic field. Therefore, subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to place all metallic and magnetic objects in their possession (e.g., keys,&#xD;
      jewelry, credit cards) in a locker outside the magnet room. Most people do not find magnetic&#xD;
      resonance scans uncomfortable, although mild discomfort has been reported on some occasions:&#xD;
      1. Some subjects may experience claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) as they will be&#xD;
      lying on a table in a horizontal cylinder that is only slightly wider in all directions than&#xD;
      their body, and extra movement will be minimized as their head is secured. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to notify the researcher in charge of the scan beforehand if they are prone to&#xD;
      claustrophobia. 2. The MR scanner makes loud knocking or beeping sounds during imaging;&#xD;
      earplugs will be provided to help reduce this noise. 3. Due to the rapid rate of change in&#xD;
      magnetic gradients during imaging, the possibility exists for peripheral nerve stimulation.&#xD;
      If this happens, subjects may feel creeping or tingling sensations, typically along their&#xD;
      arms or lower back. 4. Dizziness and nausea may occur if the subjects move their head quickly&#xD;
      in the bore of the magnet. 5. Finally, there may be some heating from the radio frequency&#xD;
      coils, the cables to the coils, or response and physiological monitoring devices. The machine&#xD;
      will be calibrated so that this heating will be no more than one degree of body temperature.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to immediately notify the investigators if they feel&#xD;
      uncomfortable at any time, for whatever reason. Subjects will be able to contact the research&#xD;
      staff at any point in the study via a microphone mounted on the MRI scanner. They will also&#xD;
      be instructed on how to use the emergency handheld device to inform the operator if they wish&#xD;
      to immediately stop scanning and be removed from the magnet. The MRI can be stopped at any&#xD;
      time at their request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no known radiological risk of MRI scanning. Subjects will be screened in a standard&#xD;
      fashion for magnet sensitive substances (metal prosthesis, etc.), for claustrophobia, and for&#xD;
      other medical and psychiatric conditions prior to the study. In addition, any participant who&#xD;
      has been told he or she has cardiovascular disease, or who is pregnant or nursing will be&#xD;
      excluded. Participants will also be screened for neurological, psychiatric and substance&#xD;
      abuse problems and a history of other medical problems or medical treatment related to&#xD;
      cerebral metabolism and blood flow. Because the magnetism of the fMRI machine attracts&#xD;
      certain metals, people with these metals in them (specifically pacemakers, infusion pumps,&#xD;
      aneurysm clips, metal prostheses, joints, rods, or plates) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      The &quot;metal&quot; in dental fillings is less susceptible to magnetism and is therefore allowed.&#xD;
      Procedures that will minimize discomfort during the scanning include the option of an MRI&#xD;
      simulation laboratory and for an initial familiarization session in the scanner. Also, the&#xD;
      use of headphones and video systems will minimize the potential discomfort of the scanner&#xD;
      environment. Participants will be encouraged to ask questions about the equipment and&#xD;
      procedures. Experimental procedures will be terminated if participants become overly&#xD;
      distressed. A protocol outlining the specific steps on how to act if patients become overly&#xD;
      distressed during these tasks will be available to all staff members. To ensure safety during&#xD;
      MRI sessions, every researcher in the lab will complete a safety training course, every year.&#xD;
      Subjects will be carefully screened to make sure they do not have any metal before being&#xD;
      taken into the room with the MRI scanner. Subjects will wear earplugs to protect their&#xD;
      hearing while in the MRI scanner. Volunteers who exhibit contraindications for MRI exams,&#xD;
      such as pacemakers, surgical aneurysm clips and known metal fragments embedded in the body&#xD;
      including eyes, will be excluded. Women of childbearing age will not be included in this&#xD;
      study if they are or think they might be pregnant. Subjects with suspected cerebrovascular or&#xD;
      pulmonary disease or a history of such will be excluded. Subjects who have experienced&#xD;
      claustrophobia, or who have a history of migraine, arterial hypertension, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, asthma, or anemia will be excluded. Based on our current ethics protocol approved by&#xD;
      UCLA, in all MRI studies the investigators will also exclude subjects with any history of&#xD;
      epilepsy or other neurological disorders. Subjects will be carefully screened for these&#xD;
      conditions prior to scanning, using a standardized form/checklist. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      instructed not to use any recreational drugs (e.g., marijuana, cocaine) within 48 hours&#xD;
      before participating, nor consume more than 3 units of alcoholic beverages within 24 hours&#xD;
      before taking part in the study. Subjects will receive these instructions a week before&#xD;
      participating, and their compliance will be checked again on the day of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Procedures and Subject Privacy Signed consent will be obtained from each participant.&#xD;
      Member(s) of the study staff will meet with the prospective participants in a private room to&#xD;
      review the consent documents and/or provide an oral explanation of the study. Any experiments&#xD;
      involving MRI scanning will be undertaken in compliance with the safety guidelines for MRI&#xD;
      research, and prior to participating in the study, subjects will be informed of the risks and&#xD;
      benefits of the study, and will fill out and sign the screening questionnaire and informed&#xD;
      consent form. Individuals will be given a chance to ask questions before making a considered&#xD;
      decision about whether or not to participate in the study. Subjects will be given as long as&#xD;
      necessary to decide whether they wish to participate in the study. The investigator or study&#xD;
      team member(s) will confirm that subjects understand the information conveyed during the&#xD;
      consent process. Study procedures and consent forms will be reviewed and approved by the UCLA&#xD;
      Institutional Review Boards. Participants will be provided a copy of the consent form and the&#xD;
      original will be maintained in laboratory files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Stopping Rules Please see the procedures described in the Reporting Adverse Events&#xD;
      section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Incidental Findings If the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale reveals scores&#xD;
      at any point of assessment that are in the severe range for depression, participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated by PI Craske for consideration of referral to alternative treatment. In addition,&#xD;
      Dr. Craske will follow a detailed, written action plan if the participant discloses suicidal&#xD;
      intent/plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a small chance that the MRI scan will discover a brain injury, such as a brain&#xD;
      tumor. In that case, the investigators will send the participant's scan to a radiologist, who&#xD;
      will check the scan. If the finding is confirmed to be a clinically relevant abnormality that&#xD;
      can be treated, this information is passed on to the participant's general practitioner. Each&#xD;
      participant will be required to provide the name and address of his or her general&#xD;
      practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process for Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest N/A Data Security Please see the data&#xD;
      security measures described in the Data Management, Analysis, and Quality Assurance section&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting Adverse Events Per UCLA IRB requirements, the investigators will report any Adverse&#xD;
      Events (including Serious Adverse Events) that meet the definition of an Unanticipated&#xD;
      Problem to the IRB within 10 working days of PI/Co-PI awareness, with the exception of&#xD;
      unexpected internal (on-site) death, which would be reported within 3 working days. The&#xD;
      investigators will comply with the NIMH Reportable Events Policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others, the following&#xD;
      adverse events will be monitored: deaths, suicide attempts, study dropout, psychiatric&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and clinical deterioration, defined as emergent suicidal ideation or&#xD;
      suicidal plan, development of serious substance abuse, or emergence of a new psychiatric or&#xD;
      medical diagnosis or behavior posing significant risk to the subjects of others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following grading system will be used to assess the seriousness of any adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 No adverse event or within normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe adverse event resulting in hospitalization or a persistent or significant&#xD;
           disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Life-threatening or disabling adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fatal adverse event The Ph.D. level project coordinator will be trained in what events&#xD;
           to look for and to report any such events to Drs. Lau and Craske. If the event is graded&#xD;
           2-4, Dr. Craske, a licensed clinical psychologist, will interview the participant and&#xD;
           take the appropriate action. The UCLA IRB and NIH will be notified within 24 hours of&#xD;
           any serious adverse events (SAEs), in the 3-5 range. All SAEs will be reported to the&#xD;
           DSMB within 2 days of their occurrence. Within a week of any SAEs, the DSMB together&#xD;
           with Drs. Lau and Craske will determine whether the adverse event affects the&#xD;
           Risk/Benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (at Risks to&#xD;
           Subjects) or consent form (at Risks and Inconveniences) are required. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           DSMB shall have the discretion and responsibility to recommend that the study be&#xD;
           terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drs. Lau and Craske will conduct a review of all non-serious adverse events at least&#xD;
      quarterly. They will evaluate the types, frequency, and severity of the adverse events and&#xD;
      determine if modifications to the protocol or consent form are required. A summary of the&#xD;
      non-serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and DSMB periodically or, at minimum,&#xD;
      when yearly re-approval of the IRB protocol is sought. The summary will include number of&#xD;
      Participants enrolled, treatment retention and reasons for drop-out, and a description of&#xD;
      graded adverse events to date. Drs. Lau or Craske or the IRB has the authority to stop or&#xD;
      modify the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management, Analysis and Quality Assurance All data will be specifically obtained for&#xD;
      research purposes during individual test sessions. Sources of material obtained from&#xD;
      participants will include amygdala reactivity, skin conductance response (SCR), and&#xD;
      subjective fear ratings in both the R61 and R33 phases. In the R33 phase the investigators&#xD;
      will also assess spontaneous recovery with the Behavioral Approach Test (BAT) and Anxiety and&#xD;
      Related Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). The identifying information that will be&#xD;
      collected from study participants includes all information required to create a GUID: sex,&#xD;
      first name, last name, middle name, date of birth, and city/municipality of birth. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect email addresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team with current CITI and HIPAA certification will assign a code&#xD;
      number to each data file. The key pairing each code number with each participant's name and&#xD;
      other identifying information will be stored separately from the data files themselves, in a&#xD;
      locked filing cabinet to which only declared research personnel have access. All of the&#xD;
      interviews and study procedures will be conducted in private, locked room where only the&#xD;
      experimenter and participant are present in order to protect each participant's privacy. The&#xD;
      data collected will be used only for this study. Upon completion of the study, all data files&#xD;
      will be stripped of personal identifiers and/or the key to the code destroyed. The&#xD;
      investigators agree to follow the OHRPP Data Security in Research guidance and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit subjects through community outreach. Patients meeting the&#xD;
      DSM-5 criteria for specific phobias will be recruited through the UCLA Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Research Center and advertising in the local community. In order to maximize the fidelity and&#xD;
      reliability of the between-subjects decoder for fearful objects, it is necessary to establish&#xD;
      a pool of hyper-realigned brain activity patterns from control subjects matching the&#xD;
      demographics of the patient population. Therefore, the investigators will attempt to achieve&#xD;
      a high level of diversity in our sample by placement of advertisements and flyers in local&#xD;
      community recreational centers and religious centers in areas more densely populated by&#xD;
      Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans as well as through Internet-based advertisements.&#xD;
      Every month, the investigators will monitor the ethnic and racial distributions in the&#xD;
      recruited sample. If the investigators observe that the investigators are not reaching the&#xD;
      targeted level of diversity, the investigators will make further outreach efforts.&#xD;
