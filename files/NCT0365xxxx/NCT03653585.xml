    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease, leading to inflammation and degeneration of&#xD;
      neurons in the entire central nervous system (CNS). Not only does MS attack CNS white matter,&#xD;
      the wiring of the brain, but it also affects so called grey matter, involved in communication&#xD;
      between brain cells. Some studies have shown that grey matter damage and lesions to the&#xD;
      outermost layer of the brain, the cortex, might serve as a better diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      tool for MS patients. The issue is that cortical lesions only to a limited extent can be&#xD;
      visualized by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 tesla. The new generation of&#xD;
      ultra-high field MR scanners with a field strength of 7 tesla, has a higher sensitivity&#xD;
      towards detecting these cortical lesions. We therefore wish to use the improved sensitivity&#xD;
      of ultra-high field MRI to improve detection of cortical lesions, and to elucidate the&#xD;
      detrimental effects of single lesions to the cortex, thereby improving both diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By implementing newly developed ultra-high-resolution MR-sequences the amount and extent of&#xD;
      cortical lesions to the area of the brain responsible of the sensory and motor function of&#xD;
      the hand (sensorimotor hand area - SM1-HAND) will be investigated in patients with relapsing&#xD;
      remitting and secondary progressive MS. We will also assess how these lesions affect manual&#xD;
      dexterity and sensory function and how cortical lesions affect communication within brain&#xD;
      areas. It is hypothesized that the amount and size of cortical lesions is highly involved in&#xD;
      brain communication and manual function, a major problem in MS, and that this project will&#xD;
      shed new light on how the disease damages this important brain area.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND. In recent years, several lines of research have shown that multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS) affects cortical grey matter and that the degree of cortical grey matter involvement is&#xD;
      associated with cognitive and physical disability, but the specific impact of a cortical&#xD;
      lesion on regional function remains to be clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 3T has been used to detect cortical lesions in&#xD;
      MS, but histological examinations have shown that only 'the tip of the iceberg' is detected.&#xD;
      Ultra-high field 7T MRI has a higher diagnostic sensitivity than 3T MRI. Although not every&#xD;
      cortical lesion is detected even at 7T, a recent post-mortem verification study concluded&#xD;
      that ultra-high field MRI &quot;more than doubles detection of cortical MS lesions, compared to 3T&#xD;
      MRI&quot;. Implementing 7T MRI in detection of cortical lesions and elucidating the behavioural&#xD;
      and neurophysiological impact of cortical lesions is therefore a good candidate in aiding to&#xD;
      resolve the clinico-radiological paradox reported in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS and HYPOTHESES. This study is designed to clarify the occurence of cortical lesions&#xD;
      within the primary sensory-motor hand area (SM1-HAND) and their impact on manual motor and&#xD;
      sensory function, as well as regional cortical connectivity. The SM1-HAND is well suited to&#xD;
      address this question, because functional integration in SM1-HAND can be studied in detail&#xD;
      with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-resolution fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploiting the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI to detect cortical lesions, the number, size&#xD;
      and regional distribution of cortical lesions in SM1-HAND will be assessed and lesion load in&#xD;
      SM1-HAND will be related to MRI-based, electrophysiological, and behavioral correlates of&#xD;
      hand function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically the following parameters will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The extent that the primary sensorimotor cortex is affected by cortical lesions in&#xD;
           patients with relapsing remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The impact of a single cortical MS lesion in the sensorimotor cortex on upper extremity&#xD;
           sensorimotor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The impact of a single cortical MS lesion in the sensorimotor cortex on regional&#xD;
           intra-cortical connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The extent of cortical damage to the primary sensorimotor cortex is unknown, but based on&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of motor function it is expected that up to 40% of patients show focal&#xD;
      cortical lesions in this area and that this will include all subtypes of cortical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2a) It is hypothesized that unimanual motor function correlates negatively with the total&#xD;
      cortical lesion load within the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, independent of age,&#xD;
      gender, handedness, white matter lesion volume, axonal integrity of the cortico-spinal tract,&#xD;
      central motor conduction time and cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortex. 2b) It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the amount and size of cortical lesions within the primary sensorimotor&#xD;
      cortex correlates positively with motor fatigue. 2c) It is hypothesized that unimanual&#xD;
      sensory acuity correlates negatively with the total cortical lesion load within the&#xD;
      contralateral sensorimotor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a) It is expected cortical lesions to cause a shift in the digit representation, measured as&#xD;
      the task related BOLD signal of the contralateral somatosensory cortex, away from the lesion.&#xD;
      3b) It is hypothesized that cortical lesions within the primary sensorimotor cortex affects&#xD;
      the regional intra-cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) It is further expected that the functional impact of regional cortical lesions are&#xD;
      independent of age, gender, handedness, white matter lesion volume, axonal integrity of the&#xD;
      cortico-spinal tract, central motor conduction time and cortical thickness of the&#xD;
      sensorimotor cortex and scales with lesion type, number and volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. RESEARCH PLAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. Whole-brain 7T MRI study to identify cortical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The project is planned to involve 80 mildly to moderately affected patients&#xD;
      (Expanded Disability Status Scale of &lt;5.5) with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS, n=40) or&#xD;
      secondary progressive MS (SP-MS, n=40) who had no clinical relapse within the last three&#xD;
      months and 20 healthy age-matched controls (age range: 18-70 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultra-high field MRI. All participants will be studied with whole-brain ultra-high field MRI&#xD;
      at 7T, using a research-only 7T Achieva MR system (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) located at&#xD;
      Hvidovre Hospital. Whole-brain MR scanning will be performed with a dual transmit, 32-channel&#xD;
      receive head coil (Nova Medical Products), including 3-dimensional (3-D),&#xD;
      magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echoes (MPRAGE) imaging at 0.65-mm&#xD;
      isotropic resolution and 3-D, magnetization-prepared, fluid attenuated inversion recovery&#xD;
      (MPFLAIR) imaging at 0.7-mm isotropic resolution (5). Whole-brain semi-quantitative&#xD;
      (MP2RAGE), as well as a quantitative T2* sequence will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional examinations. Outside the MR scanner, physical impairment (EDSS), fatigue (Fatigue&#xD;
      Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions, FSMC), cognition (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SMDT&#xD;
      &amp; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, PASAT), depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI II)&#xD;
      as well as sensorimotor hand function (9HPT, Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), Finger&#xD;
      tapping, Grating Orientation Discrimination Test (GODT)) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2. Selected 7T MRI of the SM1-HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A sub-group of individuals who participated in part 1 will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in part 2: It is expected that at least 20 patients will show at least one&#xD;
      cortical lesion in the right or left SM1-HAND on 7T MRI. The lesion-positive patients (n&gt;20),&#xD;
      an age- and EDSS- matched lesion-negative MS group (n&gt;20), and an age-matched healthy control&#xD;
      group (n=20) will be studied. Recruitment will be done continuously to minimize the delay&#xD;
      between part 1 &amp; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be scanned again with the 7T Achieva MR system using a reduced coronal&#xD;
      field-of-view, covering the right and left SM1-HAND and the corticospinal tract. Structural&#xD;
      imaging will include a 0.7 mm isotropic FLAIR sequence, and an ultra-high resolution MP2RAGE&#xD;
      (0.5 mm isotropic) sequence as well as whole brain diffusion weighted imaging (DWI).&#xD;
      Proton-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) will be performed to measure regional&#xD;
      N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), GABA and glutamate concentration in right and left SM1-HAND. Lastly&#xD;
      high-spatial resolution functional Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) (fMRI) will be used to&#xD;
      map the somatotopy of sensory and motor representations in SM1-HAND. Activation maps will be&#xD;
      superimposed to individual lesion maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS. The corticospinal conduction will be quantified with transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS). A novel neuronavigated TMS mapping method developed by this group, which is sensitive&#xD;
      to changes in cortico-motor representations of intrinsic hand muscles will also be&#xD;
      implemented. Finally, aspects of intracortical inhibition in both SM1-HAND with established&#xD;
      single-pulse and double-pulse TMS paradigms will be carried out. Conduction in the afferent&#xD;
      somatosensory pathway will be assessed by recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP).&#xD;

The extent of damage to the SM1 is unknown, but based on clinical symptoms of motor function we expect that up to 40% of patients show focal cortical lesions in this area.&#xD;

We hypothesize that unimanual motor function correlates negatively with the total cortical lesion load within the contralateral SM1-HAND area, independent of age, gender handedness, white matter lesion volume and axonal integrity of the cortico-spinal tract, central motor conduction time (CMCT) and cortical thickness of the primary sensorimotor cortex.</description>

And as regional GABA and glutamate concentrations, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).&#xD;
We hypothesize that cortical lesions in the SM1 will alter the regional intra-cortical inhibitory/excitatory balance evident as changes in TMS derived measures of intra-cortical inhibition and facilitation and that this correlates with regional changes in GABA and Glutamate measured with MRS.</description>
