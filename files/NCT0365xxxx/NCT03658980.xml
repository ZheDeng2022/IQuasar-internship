  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of death and disability. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an&#xD;
      eye disease that affects the eyesight of about 21.3% persons with diabetes in Bangladesh in a&#xD;
      way that is irreversible because of the nature of the disease. According to International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas (5th Edition), in 2011 there were approximately 8.4&#xD;
      million people in the age bracket 20-79 suffering from diabetes in Bangladesh, and this&#xD;
      number is projected to double to 16.8 million by 2030. Based on these statistics, and also&#xD;
      according to a nationally published report, the number of persons with DR is estimated to be&#xD;
      about 1.8 million in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking measures to delay vision loss in persons with diabetes is more cost-effective than its&#xD;
      treatment. Timely and effective referral of DR cases to an Ophthalmologist is very important&#xD;
      in the prevention of this disease. The objective of this study is to identify reasons of DR&#xD;
      referral procedure compliance and non-compliance among registered persons with diabetes in a&#xD;
      diabetic clinic and recommend effective strategies to enhance the referral system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of study is cross-sectional. Second phase of study is a Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (intervention group to receive home-based health education and control group to receive&#xD;
      standard care). It is expected that the number of registered persons with diabetes of&#xD;
      Barishal DAB hospital who were referred to an Eye Consultant at a tertiary hospital from&#xD;
      September 2017 - August 2018 will be N=300. All 300 participants will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in the first phase of the study. This group (est. N=300) will be categorized into&#xD;
      compliant (est. N=120) and non-compliant participants (est. N=180). Both groups will be&#xD;
      interviewed to understand motivation factors for compliance and de-motivation factors for&#xD;
      non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, the non-compliant group will be categorized further into&#xD;
      intervention and control groups following Randomization. The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      relevant health education messages on Diabetic Retinopathy and information about the days and&#xD;
      times when eye care services are provided at the tertiary hospital (i.e. service availability&#xD;
      information). They will be provided with telephonic reminders at Days 7, 30 and 90 after the&#xD;
      health education. Then, after a gap of one month from the last telephonic reminder, both&#xD;
      control and intervention groups will be interviewed again. In this way this study will&#xD;
      conclude whether the health education intervention is an effective way of improving&#xD;
      compliance rate of referred DR persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires will be pre-tested in the study location. All participants will have to&#xD;
      sign a detailed Bengali informed consent form. SPSS software will be used for data entry and&#xD;
      analysis. Multiple Logistic Regression, along with other tests, will be used to identify&#xD;
      variables that significantly influence successful referrals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a non-communicable chronic disease associated with abnormally high levels of the&#xD;
      glucose in the blood. One of the many complications of diabetes is Diabetic Retinopathy (DR),&#xD;
      which results in vision problems in persons suffering from diabetes for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DR is the fifth leading cause of global blindness, affecting an estimated 1.8 billion people&#xD;
      and responsible for 4.8% of all causes of blindness. According to International Diabetes&#xD;
      Federation (IDF) Atlas, Bangladesh is a least developed country (LDC) with a&#xD;
      disproportionately high proportion of people having diabetes. Among all people living with&#xD;
      diabetes in the 48 LDCs, about 40% live in Bangladesh, which makes it one of the top 10&#xD;
      countries suffering from diabetes. In Bangladesh, approximately 6.1% of the population aged&#xD;
      20-79 years has diabetes, with approximately 46% of these undiagnosed. According to&#xD;
      International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas (5th Edition), in 2011 there were&#xD;
      approximately 8.4 million people in the age bracket 20-79 suffering from diabetes in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, and this number is projected to double to 16.8 million by 2030. Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) are common complications of diabetes that&#xD;
      can result in vision loss - the estimated number of people with DR in Bangladesh is about 1.8&#xD;
      million (21.3% of the diabetic persons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a patient perspective there is little or no integration between the eye health sector&#xD;
      and the diabetes sector. In Bangladesh, care for diabetes-related eye disease is available in&#xD;
      very few tertiary level health facilities. There is currently no eye health care available&#xD;
      for people with diabetes or those suffering from DR, at the community clinics, primary health&#xD;
      care centers or secondary health care centers (The Fred Hollows Foundation, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective referral system is a 'critical component of quality clinical care'. When&#xD;
      utilized optimally, it can solve more public health problems in less time by directing cases&#xD;
      through an appropriate channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DR Screening is very important, because early stages of the disease lack symptoms - when&#xD;
      symptoms occur the disease already requires treatment. DR Screening centers may have to refer&#xD;
      persons in a timely and effective manner to a DR treatment center. Early detection and timely&#xD;
      referral are critical for timely interventions to prevent further deterioration of vision. In&#xD;
      the case of DR, an effective referral system is crucial for the success of the disease&#xD;
      management. This is because knowledge, awareness and perceived benefit of receiving DR&#xD;
      Management services among persons with diabetes is very low, the world over, and more so in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. Therefore, in order to make sure that DR Management is effectively integrated&#xD;
      into mainstream public health in Bangladesh, it is vital to address one of the most&#xD;
      challenging components of DR management, which is, strengthening referral system for persons&#xD;
      having DR. If a person with diabetes is not made aware about possible consequences of&#xD;
      negligence of eye problem, is not properly counseled to undertake DR treatment and is not&#xD;
      made aware of the existing DR referral pathway, the person will in all probability forego&#xD;
      treatment, since the perceived benefit of DR treatment is low among persons who lack&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Question is 'How can we increase the number of successful referrals of Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy persons from a diabetes clinic (DAB center) to an Eye Consultant located at a&#xD;
      tertiary hospital?' The general objective is to recommend health education messages regarding&#xD;
      DR and intervention strategies to benefit people who are at risk of developing DR or has&#xD;
      already developed DR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective is to investigate the effect of a health education intervention on&#xD;
      persons with probable Diabetic Retinopathy who did not attend eye screening appointment with&#xD;
      an Eye Consultant following referral from a diabetes clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is 'Increase in Successful Referrals' and the secondary outcome is&#xD;
      'Increase in knowledge of Diabetic Retinopathy'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diabetic clinic should ideally be a 'one-stop-care center' that offers holistic care for&#xD;
      people with diabetes. DR persons may be diagnosed or undiagnosed persons with diabetes.&#xD;
      Before a person is screened or treated for DR, ideally that person must first be diagnosed&#xD;
      with diabetes, and brought under comprehensive diabetes care management. Comprehensive&#xD;
      diabetes care management includes management of diseases of organs including kidneys, heart,&#xD;
      tooth, brain and eyes. Yet many undiagnosed persons with diabetes who suffer from DR may also&#xD;
      walk into eye clinics, requiring urgent attention. In such cases, it is best to manage DR&#xD;
      first and then refer the person to a diabetes clinic, so that person can be brought under&#xD;
      comprehensive diabetes management. Controlling and managing diabetes will ensure that the DR&#xD;
      condition of person does not deteriorate. Management of diabetes ensures that DR is&#xD;
      controlled or prevented. It is a well-established fact that prevention of DR is more&#xD;
      cost-effective than its treatment. In order to delay the onset of DR, it is important that&#xD;
      referred DR persons from Barisal DAB Center promptly uptakes services at the referred&#xD;
      facility, i.e. the tertiary hospital. Referred persons should ideally avail advanced DR&#xD;
      management and treatment options without further loss of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study location (i.e. Barisal district), there are approximately 21000 persons&#xD;
      suffering from varying stages of DR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sher-e-Bangla Medical College and Hospital (SBMC&amp;H) has been providing eye care services for&#xD;
      a long time to the community, and has recently started to provide eye care services to&#xD;
      persons suffering from Diabetic Retinopathy. Their services include eye screening and&#xD;
      treatment for DR persons. The Eye Consultant in this hospital has received reputed&#xD;
      international training. Most of the people who came to seek DR management services at SBMC&amp;H&#xD;
      in 2017 and 2018 are persons with diabetes, registered with the Barishal DAB center, who have&#xD;
      been referred from Barisal DAB center to SBMC&amp;H (The Fred Hollows Foundation Bangladesh,&#xD;
      2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes clinics are one-stop-care-center for most registered persons with diabetes. Barisal&#xD;
      DAB center is visited by thousands of persons with diabetes each year. If a person with&#xD;
      diabetes is referred to an Eye Consultant of a tertiary hospital for advanced DR screening&#xD;
      and management, most of the referred persons to not avail services in the tertiary hospital,&#xD;
      due to lack of awareness, motivation and other barriers. These 'non-compliant' persons maybe&#xD;
      assumed to 'drop out' of the health system (The Fred Hollows Foundation Bangladesh, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barisal DAB center provides diabetes management services to registered persons with diabetes,&#xD;
      and has in recent year started to provide eye care services to persons suffering from DR (The&#xD;
      Fred Hollows Foundation Bangladesh, 2017). Its services include screening for probable DR&#xD;
      cases. The medical personnel in this hospital has received training to screen for probable DR&#xD;
      cases, and then refer these probable cases to an Eye Consultant for advance screening and&#xD;
      management (preferably at SBMC&amp;H since it provides DR treatment and is located nearby). From&#xD;
      the records from the year 2017 and 2018, it has been found that most referred persons of&#xD;
      Barishal DAB center do not avail their appointment at the referred facility (non- compliant&#xD;
      persons). These non-compliant persons are probable priority DR persons who need immediate&#xD;
      medical attention (this risk group also has diabetes for more than 5 years, and/or a family&#xD;
      history of diabetes, and/or a higher range of Body Mass Index along with worsening eye&#xD;
      conditions) (The Fred Hollows Foundation Bangladesh, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chances are these same registered persons with diabetes (who have been referred from Barisal&#xD;
      DAB center to an Eye doctor) will visit Barisal DAB center in future again for continued&#xD;
      management of diabetes and other complication management. These high-risk persons can be&#xD;
      followed-up with, regarding their eye screening appointment at SBMC&amp;H (The Fred Hollows&#xD;
      Foundation Bangladesh, 2018). This is because timely referral is critical for DR persons, in&#xD;
      order to delay further deterioration of their vision, and DR persons need to complete the&#xD;
      referral cycle in a prompt manner. That is, the number of successful referrals (or completed&#xD;
      referrals) is an important indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a patient perspective, the referral pathway should be clear and specific. Patients&#xD;
      require specific information not only about the disease management, but also about the&#xD;
      referred facility, such as days and times of services, how to travel to the referred&#xD;
      facility, and so on. Through the health education component in this research, non-compliant&#xD;
      persons will be provided with this type of information, which will help them decide when and&#xD;
      how to access tertiary level care. In this way, the non-compliance rate may be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will highlight health education messages and possible health education delivery&#xD;
      strategies, targeting DR persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of study is cross-sectional. The second phase of study is a Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (intervention group to receive home-based health education and control group&#xD;
      to receive standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables used in study: Education, Occupation, Income, Age, Sex, District of residence,&#xD;
           DR Stage, time taken to travel to health facility, knowledge of DR, source of&#xD;
           information on DR, accompanying person, decision maker, information received at diabetes&#xD;
           clinic, counseling received at diabetes clinic, follow up/reminder calls about&#xD;
           appointment with Eye Consultant, clarity about referral procedure&#xD;
           (place/time/location/how to get there), satisfaction with health facilities,&#xD;
           understanding of non-compliance on vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population: Registered persons with diabetes, who are/will be detected with&#xD;
           probable DR and referred for specialty DR services at Sher-e-Bangla Medical College and&#xD;
           Hospital (both groups will be studied - those who uptake services and those who do not,&#xD;
           i.e. compliant and non-compliant persons)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: All diabetic persons registered at Barisal DAB who are referred to&#xD;
           SBMC&amp;H for DR management (screening/treatment), from September 2017 - August 2018 (i.e.&#xD;
           during these 12 months) are eligible for inclusion in this study. Also, participants&#xD;
           have to be atleast 18 years of age and will provide informed consent to be included in&#xD;
           the research study. Only those persons will be included who did not undergo a Dilated&#xD;
           Fundus Examination (DFE) in last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: Persons with diabetes who are registered at Barisal DAB but are not&#xD;
           referred to SBMC&amp;H for DR management (screening/treatment), from September 2017 - August&#xD;
           2018 (i.e. during these 12 months) are excluded from this study. Persons below 18 years&#xD;
           of age, and those who do not provide informed consent to be included in the research&#xD;
           study, are excluded from the study. Persons who have undergone a Dilated Fundus&#xD;
           Examination (DFE) in last 12 months will also be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome: Increase in Referral Rate (among non-compliant persons, i.e. those who&#xD;
           do not avail appointment with an Eye Consultant at a tertiary hospital after being&#xD;
           detected with probable DR at a diabetic hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcome: Increase in knowledge of Diabetic Retinopathy and service&#xD;
           availability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical basis of the sample size: All diabetic persons registered at Barisal DAB who&#xD;
           were referred to Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College and Hospital after screening for&#xD;
           probable DR (at the DAB clinic) from September 2017 - August 2018 are eligible for&#xD;
           inclusion in this study. The total expected number of referred persons referred from&#xD;
           September 2017 - August 2018 is expected to be about N=¬300 based on trend analysis (of&#xD;
           monthly data from September 2017 - April 2018). All persons will be interviewed (both&#xD;
           compliant and non-compliant persons). ¬ This number (N=300) was calculated based on the&#xD;
           following parameters: Confidence Interval = 95%; population of probable DR persons in&#xD;
           Barisal district = 20,000; Power = 0.8; Standard Deviation = 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods of Data Collection: After completion of informed consent forms, face-to-face&#xD;
           In-depth Interviews (IDI) with all participants will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-testing: Questionnaires will be pre-tested in the study location&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Interpretation: Responses to questions will be coded and entered into SPSS&#xD;
           software, which will then be used to analyze and interpret data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis: Frequency distributions will be used to analyze the demographic&#xD;
           characteristics of the study population. Multiple Logistic Regression method will be&#xD;
           used to identify variables that significantly influence successful and unsuccessful&#xD;
           referrals among compliant and non-compliant persons. For the RCT study among&#xD;
           non-compliant persons to find impact of health education intervention, the primary&#xD;
           outcome (successful referral rate - defined as attendance at referred facility) and&#xD;
           secondary outcome (increase in knowledge of Diabetic Retinopathy and service&#xD;
           availability) will be compared between both arms. For continuous measures the t-test&#xD;
           will be used and for categorical outcomes, chi-square test will be use, when comparing&#xD;
           the two arms (i.e. intervention and control groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no reasonable foreseeable risks in this study. Participants will be made aware&#xD;
      about the confidentiality issues, study procedures, modalities, and their rights to refuse to&#xD;
      answer/withdraw at any point without any monetary/non-monetary loss. This study is anonymous.&#xD;
      Investigator will not be collecting or retaining any information about participant identity.&#xD;
      The records of this study will be kept strictly confidential. Publications will not contain&#xD;
      any information that may make it possible to identify participants. Participants will not&#xD;
      receive any monetary benefits for participating in this study. They will be informed about&#xD;
      this before the start of the survey. They will be required to sign a detailed consent form&#xD;
      that they can read in Bengali and have a witness sign. One copy of this will be provided to&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;
