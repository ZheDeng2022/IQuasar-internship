      To assess effects of THC (n=150) and THC + alcohol (n =50) in MJ users on prefrontal brain&#xD;
      activity with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during resting state and during&#xD;
      memory task performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, 150 participants will complete fNIRS testing 120 minutes following THC or identical&#xD;
      placebo at a clinically determined dose of 20-50mg dronabinol (synthetic THC) and 50&#xD;
      participants will complete fNIRS testing following THC/ethanol, THC/placebo ethanol, placebo&#xD;
      THC/ethanol, and placebo THC/placebo ethanol, each at at clinically determined doses designed&#xD;
      to produce intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During peak intoxication in participants determined to be intoxicated, (intoxication defined&#xD;
      as self reported intoxication &gt;50 on 100 point VAS, by field sobriety testing by a Drug&#xD;
      Recognition Expert, and by clinical evaluation, the fNIRS HbO signal will be significantly&#xD;
      greater than at baseline and than at a post-peak assessment, and/or resting state&#xD;
      connectivity will increase with THC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana has become the most popular illicit drug in the western world (Substance Abuse and&#xD;
      Mental Health Services Administration, 2004). Both acute and chronic exposure to cannabis is&#xD;
      associated with changes in brain activity in frontal, limbic and also cerebellar regions,&#xD;
      with generally increased brain activity following acute exposure and generally decreased&#xD;
      activity during abstinence (Quickfall, 2006). Regions showing differences in brain activity&#xD;
      involve the extended dopamine reward pathways and the frontocerebellar network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most brain imaging studies of acute marijuana exposure have demonstrated global cortical&#xD;
      activity increases during administration of smoked cannabis or infused THC. Several&#xD;
      techniques have been used to track alterations of the brain associated with marijuana&#xD;
      intoxication (Mathew and Wilson, 1992, Levin, 2001 and Mathew et al., 1997). Using positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET), studies have shown that marijuana intoxication is associated with&#xD;
      global and rCBF increases that are most notable over the frontal regions and, in right-handed&#xD;
      subjects, in the right hemisphere, (Mathew et al., 1997). Ratings of intoxication and&#xD;
      euphoria correlated with the right hemispheric rCBF increase (Mathew et al., 1997). In&#xD;
      another PET study, Volkow et al. (1991a) showed that increased cerebellar metabolism during&#xD;
      intoxication, correlated with degree of intoxication and plasma THC levels (Volkow et&#xD;
      al.,1991b). FMRI studies have also shown increases in brain activity when individuals are&#xD;
      intoxicated. In two pharmacological fMRI studies, Bossong and colleagues investigated the&#xD;
      acute effects of THC, administered with a Volcano vaporizer (6 mg), and found that activity&#xD;
      during a memory task was significantly increased in a network of memory-related brain&#xD;
      regions, particularly when workload increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative technology to PET and fMRI that has not been used to assess the effects of THC&#xD;
      on brain function is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a neuroimaging&#xD;
      technology for mapping the functioning human cortex that exploits the principles of&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). An fNIRS headset can be quickly fixed to the forehead and&#xD;
      enables measurements of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) within minutes. NIRS is based on the fact&#xD;
      that: 1) human tissues are relatively transparent to light in the NIR spectral window&#xD;
      (650-1000 nm); 2) NIR light is either absorbed by pigmented compounds (chromophores) or&#xD;
      scattered in tissues; 3) NIR light is able to penetrate human tissues (Delpy and Cope, 1997);&#xD;
      and 4) the relatively high attenuation of NIR light in tissue is due to hemoglobin, the&#xD;
      oxygen transport red blood cell protein, located in small vessels of the microcirculation,&#xD;
      such as capillary, arteriolar and venular beds. NIRS is weakly sensitive to blood vessels &gt;1&#xD;
      mm because they completely absorb the light. The absorption spectrum of hemoglobin depends on&#xD;
      its level of oxygenation. NIRS is a non-invasive, safe technique that utilizes 1) laser diode&#xD;
      and/or light emitting diode light sources spanning the optical window between 650 and 1000&#xD;
      nm, and 2) flexible fiber optics to carry the NIR light to (source) and from (detector)&#xD;
      tissues. Fiber optics are suitable for any head position and posture. Adequate depth of NIR&#xD;
      light penetration (almost one half of the source-detector distance) can be achieved using a&#xD;
      source-detector distance around 3 cm. fNIRS has been used in several fields in which fMRI is&#xD;
      impractical due to the constraints of the fMRI scanning environment. fNIRS can be utilized,&#xD;
      for example, in infant and children developmental studies, in neurorehabilitation assessment,&#xD;
      and in simultaneous brain activation studies on multiple subjects. In this study, we will use&#xD;
      fNIRS to assess the effects of THC intoxication on hemodynamic response and connectivity in&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronabinol (marinol) is an FDA approved, synthetic, orally active cannabinoid used for&#xD;
      appetite stimulation that has been shown to be safe for multi dose use at doses up to 210 mg&#xD;
      per day, although after dosing of 210 mg per day for 16 days, a withdrawal syndrome was&#xD;
      described with abrupt discontinuation. Doses of 2.5-20 mg per day are used for appetite&#xD;
      stimulation and antiemetic indications. Doses of 0.5 mg/kg body weight reliably produce&#xD;
      intoxication (easy laughing, elation and subjective heightened awareness)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1. Assess the effects of THC intoxication using dronabinol (synthetic&#xD;
      THC) on the HbO signal during resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (PFC) and resting state connectivity, as well as on neurocognitive task performance&#xD;
      and correlations between these measurements and clinical signs of intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Investigate at which doses of dronabinol an effect on neurocognitive task performance&#xD;
      or an effect on PFC activity can be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine potential interaction following co-administration of THC with oral ethanol&#xD;
      exposure in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 150 adults who use marijuana at least monthly (aged 18-55) will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this Phase IIa study of dronabinol vs placebo. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      refrain from using marijuana within 24 hours of the start of study procedures. Since THCCOOH,&#xD;
      the main secondary metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can be detected in urine several&#xD;
      weeks after last use, a negative urine toxicology screen for THC-COOH will not be required,&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the inpatient research unit of Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital the night prior to start of study procedures on each study day after screening, and&#xD;
      participants who arive exhibiting overt signs of intoxication (e.g. congestion of the&#xD;
      conjunctival blood vessels (red eyes), slowed speech response, giddiness) will not be tested&#xD;
      the next morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug and Dosing: Participants will be given up to 50 mg of dronabinol, an FDA-approved&#xD;
      synthetic form of THC that is used to treat loss of appetite that causes weight loss in&#xD;
      people with AIDS. THC is the principle psychoactive drug in marijuana. The study physician,&#xD;
      Dr. A. Eden Evins MD, as well as physicians on study staff at the Center for Addiction&#xD;
      Medicine, will be responsible for administering the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronabinol will be dosed to 50mg per study visit. The rationale for this dose is based on&#xD;
      several factors. The study will be conducted in regular cannabis users who present at their&#xD;
      first study visit with a positive urine screen for THC metabolites. Chronic cannabis use is&#xD;
      associated with significant tachyphylaxis and tolerance to pharmacologic effects of THC and&#xD;
      other cannabinoids. In healthy males who received 210 mg/day dronabinol for 16 days,&#xD;
      tolerance developed to the CNS effects of dronabinol (including the euphoric 'high' effect)&#xD;
      within 12 days. At doses of 5 mg/day for appetite stimulation in 139 patients, only 18%&#xD;
      experienced ay CNS effect (feeling high, dizziness, confusion, somnolence). These CNS effects&#xD;
      are the target symptoms we wish to assess in study participants. Because of tolerance, the&#xD;
      rate of CNS effects is expected to be lower in our study population than in non-cannabis&#xD;
      users who participated in dronabinol studies for anti-emetic and appetite stimulation&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dronabinol was evaluated in 454 patients with cancer at doses up to 40 mg/day. At doses&#xD;
      greater than 0.175 mg/kg approximately 58% reported feeling 'high'. The starting recommended&#xD;
      antiemetic dose is 15-20mg/day, noting that dosage may be escalated during a chemotherapy&#xD;
      cycle or at subsequent cycles based upon initial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For appetite stimulation, the recommended dose range is up to 20 mg/day, and at this dose&#xD;
      approximately half of patients tested have reported CNS symptoms targeted in this study&#xD;
      (feeling high, dizziness, confusion, somnolence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we will dose at up to 50mg and will assess for CNS symptoms frequently during the study&#xD;
      visit. The exact dronabinol dose will be clinically determined by a study physician. The dose&#xD;
      will be designed to minimize adverse psychologic and physiologic effects of dronabinol and&#xD;
      will be primarily based on the degree of tolerance expected (based on dose and frequency of&#xD;
      cannabis use), self report of degree of intoxication experienced with each use, and any&#xD;
      regular or prior negative psychological reactions to cannabis use or binges. This is an&#xD;
      inexact determination as potency of cannabis used is almost never known. Other factors that&#xD;
      will be considered when determining dose are height, weight, BMI, and baseline blood&#xD;
      pressure. For example: Heavy daily cannabis users will generally receive 50 mg. Daily&#xD;
      cannabis users who use 1/2-1 gram per day and who weigh over approximately 140 pounds will&#xD;
      generally receive 50 mg, while those who use less than half a gram per day, use less than&#xD;
      daily or who weigh less than 120 pounds will receive between 30 and 45 mg based on the&#xD;
      physician's best judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Drug Screen: Before study procedures are initiated, we will perform a qualitative urine&#xD;
      drug screen (Multi Drug 6 Panel Urine Test; Medimpex United Inc., Bensalem, PA) that will&#xD;
      test for marijuana, amphetamines, methamphetamines, cocaine, and opiates. These rapid tests&#xD;
      are simple, can be done at home, and are CLIA-waived. The test will be administered by a&#xD;
      trained research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Pregnancy: Before study procedures are initiated, we will perform a qualitative urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test for females. The test will be administered by a trained research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Procedures Phase 2A. Investigate the effect of THC on fNIRS brain signature and&#xD;
      its association with self-reported intoxication, laboratory measures of impairment, and the&#xD;
      gold-standard behavioral field test of driving impairment used by law enforcement, the&#xD;
      primary classifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be scheduled for 2 study sessions. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      random order cross-over study of single dose THC (dronabinol) at physician determined doses&#xD;
      of 20-50mg, participants will receive THC capsules or identical placebo. The MGH research&#xD;
      pharmacy will generate a blinded randomization code for order of dosing and will dispense&#xD;
      blinded drug in the dose ordered and identical placebo for use on separate study days. In&#xD;
      order for a complete washout of effects, and to minimize the effect of repeat testing for the&#xD;
      neuropsychology tasks, study visits for each subject will be conducted at least 1 week apart.&#xD;
      On each study day, participants will be admitted to the MGH inpatient research unit, and will&#xD;
      have a light standardized breakfast after overnight fast and sleep. They will be asked not to&#xD;
      deviate from normal behaviors (e.g. if they drink caffeinated beverages or smoke cigarettes&#xD;
      in the mornings, they will be asked to do so on the study day so that no symptoms of caffeine&#xD;
      or nicotine withdrawal will appear during the scanning period. On each study day,&#xD;
      participants will complete tests of motor function/spatial navigation and fNIRS data&#xD;
      collection before study drug is administered. cognitive tasks will be repeated approximately&#xD;
      90 minutes after study drug administration, fNIRS will be repeated at approximately 120&#xD;
      minutes post dose, and the field sobriety test will be conducted immediately following the&#xD;
      second fNIRS assessment. Blood pressure, heart rate and ratings of subjective drug effects&#xD;
      will be monitored at approximately 15-minute intervals throughout the study. A third fNIRS&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted when intoxication has resolved, at approximately 220 minutes&#xD;
      post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 150 healthy adults, aged 18-55, who use cannabis at least weekly, will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Participants must test positive for cannabis at the screening visit and have no&#xD;
      serious unstable medical illness to participate (See Participant Selection Section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2B. Examine potential interaction following co-administration of THC with oral ethanol&#xD;
      exposure in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Design adapted from recently published alcohol interaction studies (Modi et al., 2007;&#xD;
      Trevisan et al., 2008).]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 by 2 crossover study of effect&#xD;
      of dronabinol, ethanol, and combined dronabinol and ethanol on brain activation and&#xD;
      connectivity as measured by fNIRS. Participants will be assigned randomly for order to&#xD;
      receive single doses of each of the following study medications on 4 separate study visits&#xD;
      conducted at least one week apart:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo THC + Ethanol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  THC + Placebo Ethanol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  THC + Ethanol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo THC + Placebo Ethanol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted in the evening, have an overnight fast, be provided a standard&#xD;
      breakfast of approximately 400 calories (e.g. juice, cereal, bagel), approximately 45 minutes&#xD;
      before administering study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethanol will be dosedby weight to obtain a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of&#xD;
      approximately 0.05, consistent with BrAC following 1-2 standard drinks, using established&#xD;
      methods of dosing based on previously published procedures (e.g. King 2005, Alcohol Clin Exp&#xD;
      Res, Vol 29, No 4, 2005: pp 547-552).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required volume of 95% ethanol will be calculated from the nomogram published by Watson&#xD;
      (1989), and diluted to a final concentration of 20% by volume with diet soda. The nomogram,&#xD;
      based on total body water, estimated for each subject using standard equations based on&#xD;
      gender, age, height, and weight (Watson et al., 1980) will be used to prepare the ethanol for&#xD;
      dosing by study staff who are not otherwise involved in study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to standardize the drinking time to 8 minutes, the total dose will be split&#xD;
      into 4 equal aliquots and placed in cups with lids. The subject will be given a cup every 2&#xD;
      minutes with instructions to sip the drink using a straw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Placebo Ethanol drink will be made as an equal volume of diet soda placed in identical cups&#xD;
      with lids and straws. 0.25 ml of 95% ethanol will be floated on the top of the soda in each&#xD;
      cup in an attempt to blind the participant and study staff who are involved with assessments&#xD;
      / data acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alcohol administration procedure will take place approximately 45 min before the start of&#xD;
      the second fNIRS session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathalyzer measurements will be taken approximately every 5-10 minutes after the alcohol&#xD;
      administration procedure, until BrACs have returned to &lt;0.01. Participants will be required&#xD;
      to stay in the laboratory until BrACs have returned to &lt;0.01. A member of our study staff&#xD;
      will then (1) arrange cab service, and (2) escort the participant to the cab at the end of&#xD;
      the study visit. Alternatively, participants may arrange travel home with a family member or&#xD;
      friend. If they choose to do this, a study staff member will ensure that someone is there to&#xD;
      bring them home prior to departure.&#xD;
