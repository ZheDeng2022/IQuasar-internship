      The purpose of this study is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the population pharmacokinetics of unbound ticagrelor and its metabolite in acute&#xD;
           coronary syndrome patients treated by ticagrelor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ticagrelor and its metabolite levels by LC-MS/MS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is an anti-platelet agent of the cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine class. It is&#xD;
      administered by the oral route, rapidly absorbed (2-3 hours), and has a bio-availability&#xD;
      estimated at around 36%. Contrary to other P2Y12 inhibitors, ticagrelor is not a pro-drug and&#xD;
      does not need to be metabolized to exert is pharmacodynamic effect. It had been previously&#xD;
      showed that stimulation of platelets by ADP or inhibitors of platelets by ticagrelor modified&#xD;
      the organisation of the platelet membrane, with a re-distribution of cholesterol and P2Y12&#xD;
      receptors towards the lipid rafts. This suggests that lipid membranes and cholesterol may&#xD;
      play an important role in the anti-platelet activity of ticagrelor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the aim of the study is to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the population pharmacokinetics of unbound ticagrelor and its metabolite in acute&#xD;
           coronary syndrome patients treated by ticagrelor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ticagrelor and its metabolite levels by LC-MS/MS.&#xD;
