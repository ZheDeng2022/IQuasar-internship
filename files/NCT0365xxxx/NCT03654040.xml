  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial exploring&#xD;
      cellular therapy to facilitate immunosuppression withdrawal in liver transplant recipients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study plan to enroll 9 participants. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of Treg product (arTreg). The target dose is at least 90 x 10^6 total&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who successfully withdraw from all immunosuppression (IS) will undergo a&#xD;
      research biopsy at 52 weeks following IS discontinuation to determine whether they meet the&#xD;
      primary efficacy outcome of operational tolerance. Participants determined to be&#xD;
      operationally tolerant will be followed until 104 weeks following IS discontinuation.&#xD;
      Participants who fail drug withdrawal after 52 weeks but before 104 weeks will be followed&#xD;
      until week 104 or 12 weeks after resuming immunosuppression, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not successfully withdraw from all IS will complete 104 weeks of High&#xD;
      Intensity Safety Follow-up after failing immunosuppression withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the&#xD;
      Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed,&#xD;
      controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can&#xD;
      result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare&#xD;
      circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.&#xD;

Per protocol: Post transplantation, subject will initially receive standard IS with tacrolimus (TAC),plus a mycophenolate product and/or steroids.Subsequently, evaluation for eligibility to be converted to EVR-based IS regimen will occur and, when applicable, proceed. Once the optimal EVR trough level is achieved,TAC dose will be reduced. When target EVR and TAC levels are maintained over two consecutive measurements, ALT liver function test (LFT) is ≤50 U/L, GGT LFT is ≤ the upper limit of normal or ≤ 1.5 times the baseline GGT, subject will be considered successfully converted to EVR-based IS regimen. EVR doses will be administered/monitored/adjusted over time.</description>
