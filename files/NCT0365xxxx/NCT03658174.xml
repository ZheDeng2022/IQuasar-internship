  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is known to be associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      heart rhythm abnormalities and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure - a condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The nitric oxide pathway has&#xD;
      been identified as being involved in mediating the effects of the autonomic nervous system on&#xD;
      the heart. Recent studies have shown that dietary nitrates can increase the availability of&#xD;
      nitric oxide in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hopes to find out if dietary nitrate supplementation can help to improve cardiac&#xD;
      and autonomic function in patients with heart failure and autonomic dysfunction and reduce&#xD;
      the risk of arrhythmias.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 participants enrolled at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust will be invited&#xD;
      to take a beetroot juice supplement, which naturally contains a high concentration of&#xD;
      nitrates, and a nitrate-free (placebo) beetroot supplement. In a double blind way,&#xD;
      participants will be randomised to the order in which they receive the 2 treatments with&#xD;
      crossover of the treatments. There will be a washout period between the two treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess cardiac and autonomic function, and risk of heart rhythm abnormalities,&#xD;
      tests will be carried out before and after each treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitrate supplementation reverses the autonomic dysfunction seen in Chronic Heart Failure&#xD;
           (CHF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of prognostic significance for predicting SCD, including QT variability index&#xD;
           and cardiac restitution properties (R2I2, PERS), are normalised by nitrate&#xD;
           supplementation in patients with CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitrate supplementation results in functional improvement in CHF patients.&#xD;
