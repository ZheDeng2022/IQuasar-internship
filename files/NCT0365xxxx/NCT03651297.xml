    <textblock>
      Fall risk increases with age and the fear of falling can significantly impact activity,&#xD;
      mobility and future fall risk. Exercise designed specifically to help balance is effective at&#xD;
      improving balance and postural control for mobility, gait, and other daily activities. The&#xD;
      individual purposes of this research are to (1) effectively use a prototype of an&#xD;
      instrumented and actuated harness and support system, (2) demonstrate that this system can be&#xD;
      used as designed during induced falls (reactive) and in place gaming (proactive) balance&#xD;
      training protocols with the ability to modulate parameters as designed, measurements of&#xD;
      harness system are accurate, and resultant output of the system matches intended parameters,&#xD;
      and (3) demonstrate that the use of this system can allow provision of and study of varied&#xD;
      balance training protocols, including: the measurements of the system, feedback of the system&#xD;
      to participants, and the impact of the support parameters of the harness system on the task&#xD;
      execution, learning and transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate groups of 20 participants (40 total participants) will be studied. The first&#xD;
      group will include 20 individuals between the ages of 18 to 40 years old with no history of&#xD;
      falls or fear of falling. The first group will complete two sessions of harnessed video&#xD;
      gaming balance training. The second group will include older adults over the age of 55 with&#xD;
      self-reported falls or the fear of falling. The second group of older adults will complete&#xD;
      two sessions of a reactive (slip) training protocol. For both groups, the first session&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to use either a standard fall-arrest harness or the&#xD;
      new BWS harness system. At the second session, they will switch the harness used. The&#xD;
      protocol will involve slips or gaming based balance training, initially of low intensity and&#xD;
      then advanced by algorithm based on their response to the trial just prior. This will allow&#xD;
      comparison of postural control, perturbation responses, motor learning, and confidence with&#xD;
      the system between the two harness types.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fall risk increases with age and the fear of falling can significantly impact activity,&#xD;
      mobility and future fall risk. Exercise designed specifically to help balance is effective at&#xD;
      improving balance and postural control for mobility, gait, and other daily activities.&#xD;
      Balance training for fall prevention can be proactive or reactive. Proactive balance training&#xD;
      is the practice of anticipatory and self-initiated movement. Reactive training, on the other&#xD;
      hand, involves responses to unexpected movements that cause a loss of balance. Safety harness&#xD;
      systems are used for reactive balance protocols to prevent actual falls. They may also be&#xD;
      used in intense proactive protocols for more vulnerable, frail, or fearful participants. In&#xD;
      therapeutic settings, harnesses for gait and mobility training are either body weight&#xD;
      supporting (BWS) or fall-arresting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed and built a harness system that allows better control of more&#xD;
      of the support parameters than much more expensive, commercially available, and BWS systems.&#xD;
      This harness system better controls aspects such as: limiting fall distance, modulation of&#xD;
      how the support responds to descents, assist to return to stand, and recording of all body&#xD;
      movements. This will allow the investigation of questions about the impact of harness systems&#xD;
      on learning and performance of postural control and effective use of harnesses in balance&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have done extensive work with the Xbox system using Kinect, having designed&#xD;
      a protocol and progression of games and surfaces that provides high intensity proactive&#xD;
      balance training using Kinect. The investigators also train reactive balance through the use&#xD;
      of a custom made platform called the Slip Trainer (MASS Rehab, Dayton, OH), along with a fall&#xD;
      arresting harness and load measuring device. This allows the administration of repeated slip&#xD;
      perturbations of a consistent and known intensity safely and efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions that still need to be answered include: Will patients challenge themselves more or&#xD;
      engage in more intense activities with a harness? Does the support provided by a harness&#xD;
      impact or interfere with the motor learning of the balance tasks? Could balance task learning&#xD;
      be more effective with some degree of support vs. just a fall-arresting &quot;backup&quot; as is&#xD;
      theorized with treadmill gait training? If so, what types and parameters are most effective?&#xD;
      Would this type of support allow more intense training to be extended to people who are less&#xD;
      mobile, more vulnerable or frail or more fearful, those who would not be able to participate&#xD;
      in effective balance training otherwise?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer initial questions about the effectiveness and acceptance of the&#xD;
      harness system by older adults in a reactive and by younger adults in a proactive protocol,&#xD;
      and will provide pilot data for larger, external grants to investigate the broader questions&#xD;
      among a much larger group of people. The larger impact will be translating the technology and&#xD;
      understanding its impact clinically, allowing much greater intensity and more effective&#xD;
      balance training for at risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to build a harness system in which the support within a single&#xD;
      plane can be finely controlled and measured. This harness will have the following&#xD;
      capabilities: limit height/fall to a pre-set vertical limit with ability to modulate the fall&#xD;
      arrest kinematics, dynamic partial body weight support - to remain constant with center of&#xD;
      mass (COM) movements, modulate by pre-set thresholds how the support responds to descent,&#xD;
      assist to return to stand - with preset thresholds and levels of assist,&#xD;
      monitor/measure/record: vertical and horizontal components of body COM movements, and provide&#xD;
      feedback to users re: the support of being provided or re: other parameters, potentially in&#xD;
      various modes (haptic, visual, auditory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual purposes of this research are to (1) effectively use a prototype of an&#xD;
      instrumented and actuated harness and support system, (2) demonstrate that this system can be&#xD;
      used as designed during induced falls (reactive) and in place gaming (proactive) balance&#xD;
      training protocols with the ability to modulate parameters as designed, measurements of&#xD;
      harness system are accurate, and resultant output of the system matches intended parameters,&#xD;
      and (3) demonstrate that the use of this system can allow provision of and study of varied&#xD;
      balance training protocols, including: the measurements of the system, feedback of the system&#xD;
      to participants, and the impact of the support parameters of the harness system on the task&#xD;
      execution, learning and transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate groups of 20 participants (40 total participants) will be studied. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from students, faculty and staff, as well as community members known to the&#xD;
      investigator following the procedure outlined below. The first group will include 20&#xD;
      individuals between the ages of 18 to 40 years old with no history of falls or fear of&#xD;
      falling. The first group will complete two sessions of harnessed video gaming balance&#xD;
      training. The second group will include older adults over the age of 55 with self-reported&#xD;
      falls or the fear of falling. The second group of older adults will complete two sessions of&#xD;
      a reactive (slip) training protocol. For both groups, the first session participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to use a standard fall-arrest harness or the new BWS harness system. BWS&#xD;
      harness can be set to support a predetermined portion of the person's body weight and&#xD;
      maintain that support throughout the session. At the second session, they will switch the&#xD;
      harness used. The protocol will involve balance training, advanced by algorithm, based on the&#xD;
      participant's response to the trial just prior. This will allow comparison of postural&#xD;
      control, perturbation responses, motor learning, and confidence with the system between the&#xD;
      two harness types.&#xD;

    <measure>Change (improvement) in response to increasingly difficult perturbations, as measured by the Rate of Perceived Stability Score (RPS).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 sessions of 60 - 90 minutes, more than 3 days but less than three weeks apart.</time_frame>
    <description>The protocols are advanced by algorithm. The reactive algorithm sets initial slip distance and force by the individual's leg length, weight, and MiniBEST (balance evaluation systems test). The result of each slip (harness loading and recovery steps) dictates the next condition as set forth in the algorithm. The proactive algorithm is a hierarchy of game and balance surface difficulty: participants begin at the same level and progress based on their Rate of Perceived Stability (RPS) score for each condition. The RPS self-rates balance task difficulty from 1 to 10 (least to most challenging). Advancing through more steps/more quickly with one harness indicates greater efficacy of that harness in balance skill acquisition. Because balance ability and the learning curve for balance tasks are highly individual, the outcome of interest is individual improvement in response to increasingly difficult perturbations, rather than standardized measure of balance ability across subjects.</description>

    <description>This study will analyze the subjects' responses to balance training protocols with two types of harness support. The protocol will involve balance training, initially of low intensity and then advanced by an algorithm based on subjects' responses to the prior repetition of balance activity. For this intervention, the subjects will be using a standard Fall-Arrest harness for safety throughout, but no other external support. This will allow comparison of postural control, slip responses, motor learning, reliance on the harness and confidence with the system between the two harness types.</description>
