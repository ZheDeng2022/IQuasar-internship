  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff lesions (RCL) are one of the most common shoulder joint disorders. The most&#xD;
      important cause of RCL is the impairment of the balance of synergies and force couples of&#xD;
      muscles responsible for scapulothoracic stabilization.This study aims to compare SME,&#xD;
      shoulder pain, and functionality of patients with rotator cuff lesions (RCL) with those in&#xD;
      the matched healthy controls and to evaluate the relationship between SME with shoulder pain,&#xD;
      and functional impairments in patients with RCL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) (n:20), and partial rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      (PRCT) (n:20), and age-gender matched healthy controls (n:20) were included in the study. SME&#xD;
      were measured by a one-kilogram dynamometer while the shoulder and elbows are flexed 90°.&#xD;
      Self-reported pain intensity (during rest, activity, night, and measurement pain) was&#xD;
      assessed visual analog scale (VAS). Functionality was also assessed using the Functional&#xD;
      Impairment test-hand, neck, shoulder, and arm (FIT-HaNSA).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Scapular muscle endurance test</intervention_name>
    <description>The SME test, developed by Edmondston et al. 17, is based on an exercise used to improve the performance of the serratus anterior and trapezius muscles. The test was carried out while the subjects were facing the wall in standing position and with their shoulders and elbows flexed to 90 degrees. While both scapulae were in neutral position, an appropriate size of stick (18-36 cm) was selected and placed between the elbows, and they were asked to hold the dynamometer (Feta 137 F0202 1 kg/10 N) between their hands.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity assessment was performed by questioning rest, activity, night, and measuremant pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) on a 10 cm line with marks at both ends to define the limits of the pain experience as &quot;no pain&quot; (0) and &quot;maximum pain experienced&quot; (10), with higher scores indicating greater pain 20.</description>
