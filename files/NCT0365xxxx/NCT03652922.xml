  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed work is to gather pilot data from an attempt to enhance the ability&#xD;
      of propranolol reactivation (PR) to improve PTSD symptoms by incorporating into the design a&#xD;
      mismatch (PRM) between what is expected and what occurs while a subject reads a narrative of&#xD;
      the traumatic event that caused their PTSD under the influence of the ß-adrenergic blocking&#xD;
      drug propranolol. It is hypothesized that a series of PRM treatments will produce superior&#xD;
      symptomatic decreases compared to what the investigators have found in prior, published&#xD;
      studies using PR without mismatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under certain circumstances, retrieval (reactivation) of a traumatic memory returns it to a&#xD;
      deconsolidated state from which it must be reconsolidated if it is to persist. Concomitant&#xD;
      administration of the ß-adrenergic blocker weakens a deconsolidated traumatic memory and&#xD;
      reduces PTSD symptoms, presumably through blockade of reconsolidation. It has recently been&#xD;
      discovered that in order for deconsolidation to occur, there must be a mismatch between what&#xD;
      is expected and what actually occurs. Altering the context in which a traumatic memory is&#xD;
      retrieved putatively represents a deconsolidation-promoting mismatch. Experimentally&#xD;
      increasing mismatch by manipulating context may make propranolol more effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized PRM clinical trial by Partners&#xD;
      researchers in 11 convenience pilot subjects between ages 18 and 65 with active PTSD, using a&#xD;
      10:1 propranolol:placebo randomization schedule. This two-month study will have the following&#xD;
      components: Pre-treatment psychometric evaluation; Treatment consisting of six weekly PRM&#xD;
      sessions with propranolol, or placebo; Post-treatment psychometric evaluation; Six-month&#xD;
      follow-up psychometric evaluation. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and PTSD&#xD;
      Checklist (PCL) will be administered at pre- and post-treatment and at follow-up. The&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders-fifth edition (DSM-5) will also be administered at the pre-treatment evaluation.&#xD;
      The PCL will also be administered prior to each weekly treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot data analysis will consist of calculation of percent improvements and effect sizes in&#xD;
      CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores; observational comparisons with results obtained without mismatch in&#xD;
      prior published studies; informal statistical comparisons via t-tests; and calculation of&#xD;
      effect sizes for power analysis for a subsequent definitive study, if indicated.&#xD;

    <description>Ninety minutes prior to each of six weekly traumatic memory reactivation sessions, the subject will be given 0.67 mg/kg of short-acting propranolol (or placebo), rounded up to the nearest 10 mg (minimum 40 mg) and 1 mg/kg of oral long-acting propranolol or placebo (minimum 60 mg). rounded so as to achieve a dose of 60, 80, 120, or 160 mg. The subject will then read a narrative of their personal traumatic event aloud. During each weekly reading, a simple, different &quot;mismatch&quot; condition will be created by having the subject do such things as whisper the narrative, skip over every word that contains the letter &quot;e,&quot; pronounce the narrative in a different accent, or alter the tense and/or person of the narrative.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Convenience sample of pilot subjects between ages 18 and 65 with active PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;18 or &gt;65;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Basal systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mm Hg or heart rate &lt;55 beats per minute;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition that contraindicates the administration of propranolol, e.g.,&#xD;
             history of congestive heart failure, heart block, insulin-requiring diabetes, chronic&#xD;
             bronchitis, emphysema, or asthma. With regard to asthma, because many persons who say&#xD;
             they have had an asthma attack, especially as a child, may only have had hay fever,&#xD;
             another allergy, or another non-asthmatic episode, a blanket exclusion criterion may&#xD;
             be overly restrictive. Therefore, asthma attacks will only be exclusionary if they a.)&#xD;
             occurred within the past ten years, b.) occurred at any time in life if induced by a&#xD;
             β-blocker, or c.) are currently being treated, regardless of the date of last&#xD;
             occurrence;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous adverse reaction to, or non-compliance with, a β-blocker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with&#xD;
             propranolol, including, other β-adrenergic blockers, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel&#xD;
             blockers and benzodiazepines. Subjects taking an α-1-adrenergic antagonist (e.g.,&#xD;
             prazosin) or an α -1-adrenergic agonist (e.g., clonidine) will be asked to refrain&#xD;
             from taking this medication on the day of a study medication visit. Note: Possible&#xD;
             inhibition of CYP2D6 isoenzyme-dependent reactions will not be of concern in this&#xD;
             study, because propranolol will only be administered once a week for six weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of drugs of abuse, including opiates, marijuana, cocaine, or amphetamines, as&#xD;
             determined by saliva or urine testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding. Women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test&#xD;
             prior to being administered study medication at study week 0, and again at study week&#xD;
             7, following study medication discontinuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current PTSD from a traumatic event other than the event being treated, or another&#xD;
             contraindicating psychiatric condition, e.g., current psychotic, bipolar, melancholic,&#xD;
             or active substance dependence or abuse disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiation of, or change in, psychotropic medication within the previous two months.&#xD;
             For subjects receiving stable doses of pharmacotherapy, they and their providers will&#xD;
             be asked not to change the regimen during the proposed two-month study (excluding the&#xD;
             6-month follow-up) except in clinically urgent circumstances; if this becomes&#xD;
             necessary, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis with regard to retaining&#xD;
             the subject or terminating participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in any psychotherapy (other than supportive). Subjects will be&#xD;
             asked not to initiate new psychotherapy during the proposed two-month study (excluding&#xD;
             the 6-month follow-up) except in clinically urgent circumstances; if this becomes&#xD;
             necessary, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis with regard to retaining&#xD;
             the subject or terminating participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to understand the study's procedures, risks, and side effects, or to&#xD;
             otherwise give informed consent for participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject candidate does not understand English. This exclusion criterion is necessary&#xD;
             because the procedures require a subtle dialogue with solely English-speaking&#xD;
             investigators, which translation cannot accomplish. There is a need for rapid&#xD;
             communication with English-speaking investigators in case of an adverse drug effect.&#xD;
