  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of an established internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      intervention in a group of adolescents with type 1 diabetes and mild to moderate depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Half of the participants will receive the internet-based intervention while the&#xD;
      other half will receive usual care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with diabetes have a higher incidence of subclinical and clinical depression&#xD;
      compared to healthy adolescents. Patients with diabetes who are clinically or subclinically&#xD;
      depressed are at high risk for poor glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating prevention and treatment strategies for depression in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes have shown that group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and individual&#xD;
      interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can reduce the risk of depressive illness in adolescents&#xD;
      with diabetes. Computerized interventions show evidence of being efficacious, and have been&#xD;
      recommended as the &quot;first line&quot; intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Humanistic and Interpersonal Teaching&#xD;
      (CATCH-IT) internet program has shown positive results with adolescents at risk for&#xD;
      depression, but has not been used in patients with a chronic illness like diabetes. CATCH-IT&#xD;
      is based on established CBT and IPT treatment models. It includes a) an innovative and&#xD;
      effective brief practitioner-provided motivation enhancement component (in person at&#xD;
      enrollment and through phone calls) and b) self-directed modules for the adolescent that can&#xD;
      be accessed on the internet.&#xD;
