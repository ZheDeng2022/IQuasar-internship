  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      4-monthly application of 10% povidone iodine solution followed by 5% sodium fluoride varnish&#xD;
      with those of annual application of 38% silver diammine fluoride solution on the prevention&#xD;
      of new dental root caries in elders. A secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the two interventions mentioned above on arresting (halting the progression) active root&#xD;
      surface caries in the elders, thus avoiding the need for placing dental restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial with 24-month&#xD;
      follow-up. A total of 353 elders aged 60 years or above living in residential homes or&#xD;
      attending long-term care facilities in different districts in Hong Kong were recruited.&#xD;
      Baseline clinical examination will be conducted by two calibrated examiners in the homes&#xD;
      using an intra-oral LED light, dental mirrors and probes. Subjects were randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of the two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) positive control - received annual application of 38% silver diammine fluoride solution;&#xD;
      and 2) test - received application of 10% povidone iodine solution followed by application of&#xD;
      5% sodium fluoride varnish every 4 months. Follow-up examinations will be carried out after&#xD;
      12 and 24 months by the same blinded examiners to assess the clinical outcomes, i.e. whether&#xD;
      new dental caries has developed and whether the active root surface caries lesions found at&#xD;
      baseline have become arrested (hardened).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study population of this proposed clinical trial is adults aged 60 years and above living&#xD;
      in residential care homes or attending long-term care facilities in Hong Kong. Totally, 10&#xD;
      residential care homes or long-term care institutions served by NGO dental outreach teams in&#xD;
      various districts with different background were selected by the PI in consultation with the&#xD;
      NGOs. All elders living in the selected residential homes were invited to attend a free&#xD;
      dental examination. Elders fulfilling the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in&#xD;
      this study and informed written consent will be obtained before commencement of the study.&#xD;
      Dental treatments other than the study interventions were provided by dentists from the NGOs&#xD;
      which serve the residential homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Totally, 353 elder adults enrolled in the trial. The baseline examination was carried out in&#xD;
      the residential home by two calibrated examiners, and so will be as follow-up examinations&#xD;
      after 12 and 24 months. A portable dental chair, an intra-oral LED light, disposable dental&#xD;
      mirrors and CPI probes were used in the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each tooth that was not indicated for extraction, status of its crown and its root were&#xD;
      assessed and recorded separately. Caries diagnosis was based on visual and tactile&#xD;
      inspection. No radiograph was taken. Plaque and food debris that obscures visual inspection&#xD;
      of the tooth surfaces were removed. Four surfaces (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual) per&#xD;
      tooth were examined and the status were recorded using the following codes which basically&#xD;
      follow the criteria recommended by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System&#xD;
      (ICDAS II) Coordinating Committee (2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral hygiene status of the subject was assessed and recorded by using the Visible Plaque&#xD;
      Index (Ainamo &amp; Bay, 1975). The presence or absence of visible plaque were recorded on four&#xD;
      surfaces (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual) per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gingival status of the subject was assessed and recorded using the Gingival Bleeding&#xD;
      Index (Ainamo &amp; Bay, 1975). The presence or absence of bleeding within 10 seconds after&#xD;
      running a probe across the gingival margin was recorded on four surfaces (mesial, distal,&#xD;
      buccal and lingual) per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other information that was recorded included whether the subject normally wears a removable&#xD;
      partial denture or not, and the subject's general health status and medications that affect&#xD;
      the saliva flow rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same calibrated two examiners were blinded by the assignment of the participants. A&#xD;
      random sample of 10% of the subjects were re-examined during each examination to monitor&#xD;
      intra-examiner reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the examinations, the subjects were asked to report on their oral hygiene practices, use&#xD;
      of fluoridated toothpaste and other topical fluoride agents, and use of dental services&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral health education talk and instructions on how to keep good oral hygiene were provided at&#xD;
      baseline and every year to all the elders in the selected residential homes. Standard&#xD;
      fluoride toothpastes with 1000-1500 ppm fluoride were provided free to all the elders in the&#xD;
      selected residential homes over the 24-month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline examination, subjects satisfying the inclusion criteria of the study were&#xD;
      stratified into two groups according to the number of natural teeth with exposed root&#xD;
      surfaces in their mouth, those with 12 or fewer teeth and those with 13 or more teeth. The&#xD;
      subjects were assigned to one of the two study groups by a research assistant using a block&#xD;
      randomization method with a block size of 6. The stratified randomization procedure will help&#xD;
      to ensure that the numbers of teeth involved in the two study groups are balanced. The&#xD;
      interventions for the two study groups were provided by other dentists and are described&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - plaque on the root surfaces of all teeth in the subject's mouth was removed and a&#xD;
      38% SDF solution (Saforide, Toyo Chemical, Japan ) was applied onto the root surfaces using a&#xD;
      microbrush/applicator. This will be repeated every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - plaque on the root surfaces of all teeth in the subject's mouth was removed and a&#xD;
      10% povidone iodine solution (Betadine, Mundipharma, Switzerland) was applied, then followed&#xD;
      by application of a 5% sodium fluoride varnish (Duraflor, Medicom, Canada) using a&#xD;
      microbrush/applicator. This will be repeated every 4 months.&#xD;
