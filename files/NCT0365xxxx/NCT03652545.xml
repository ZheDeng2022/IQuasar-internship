      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      rapidly generated tumor multi-antigen associated specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TAA-T) in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas DIPGs (Group A) or recurrent,&#xD;
      progressive, or refractory non-brainstem CNS malignancies (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric and adult patients who have high-risk CNS tumors known to typically have positivity&#xD;
      for one or more Tumor Antigen Associated (TAA) (WT1, PRAME and/or Survivin) will be eligible.&#xD;
      TAA-T will all be generated from patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A patients (DIPG): The first TAA-T dose will be infused any time 14 days or more after&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B patients (other recurrent/progressive/refractory CNS tumors): The first TAA-T dose&#xD;
      will be infused any time 14 days or more after completing most recent course of conventional&#xD;
      (non-investigational) therapy for their disease AND after appropriate washout periods as&#xD;
      detailed in eligibility criteria.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. Three different TAA-T dose&#xD;
      levels will be evaluated in each treatment group (A and B) (see below) with 2 to 4 patients&#xD;
      enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level 1: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level 2: 4 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level 3: 8 x 107 cells/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two patients will be initially enrolled to the lowest dose level cohort (separately on each&#xD;
      arm) and followed for 42 days after initial TAA-T for DLT evaluations. The decision on&#xD;
      whether it is safe to escalate to next dose level or not will be made after at least two&#xD;
      patients in each dose level have finished their 42-days toxicity follow up after initial&#xD;
      TAA-T. If the first two patients have not finished their 42 days follow-up, up to 2&#xD;
      additional incoming patients can be enrolled at the current dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 42&#xD;
      days after infusion of TAA-T (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be&#xD;
      added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive at least one TAA-T infusion and may receive a maximum of 8&#xD;
      subsequent infusions. The first and second infusions will be administered at least 42 days&#xD;
      apart then additional infusions will be spaced at least 28 days apart from each other. The&#xD;
      expected volume of each infusion is 1 to 10 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients with disease have a response of stable disease or better by RANO criteria at the&#xD;
      day 28 evaluation after the second infusion OR if they have clinical stability and a clinical&#xD;
      assessment of possible pseudoprogression on MRI, they are eligible to receive up to 6&#xD;
      additional infusions of TAA-T at 28 day intervals if available. Each subsequent infusion will&#xD;
      be the same as the enrollment dose level (i.e. no subsequent dose escalation). The first and&#xD;
      second infusions will be administered at least 42 days apart then additional infusions will&#xD;
      be spaced at least 28 days apart from each other. Following the first infusion, if a&#xD;
      patient's TAA-T supply is insufficient for subsequent infusions at the enrollment dose level,&#xD;
      further treatments may be administered at a lower dose level at the treating physician's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients who are clinically stable are deemed to have likely pseudoprogression at the&#xD;
      disease evaluation after the second infusion or on subsequent imaging, then these patients&#xD;
      may still be eligible for infusion if serial imaging and clinical assessments demonstrate&#xD;
      stability most consistent with pseudoprogression. In these patients, disease assessment after&#xD;
      the imaging that first raises the concern for pseudoprogression (potential progressive&#xD;
      disease versus pseudoprogression) must be at least stable when compared with the first scan&#xD;
      demonstrating pseudoprogression.&#xD;

                  enlargement by radiographic criteria may reflect immune cell infiltration rather&#xD;
                  than true tumor progression. This diagnosis is commonly accepted to be&#xD;
                  retrospectively true if, in the context of clinical stability, radiographic&#xD;
                  progression plateaus when it would have been expected to progress.&#xD;

             have overly bulky tumor by the PI of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal&#xD;

&#xD;
        ** Pregnancy assessment on all patients &gt;7 years will be performed. If patient has child&#xD;
        bearing potential (per PI/Sub-I discretion), then pregnancy testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        *** For subsequent infusions, the most recent disease assessments (as obtained per standard&#xD;
        of care) will be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
