      Study Design and Investigational Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety and tolerability of combination&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitor (APL-501 or nivolumab) administered concomitantly with c-Met inhibitor&#xD;
      (APL-101), to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of the combination, and to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in HCC or RCC subjects with advanced or metastatic disease that have not&#xD;
      been previously treated with a PD 1 inhibitor or a c-Met inhibitor. HCC subjects will receive&#xD;
      the combination APL-501 plus APL-101 while RCC subjects will receive the combination&#xD;
      nivolumab plus APL-101. In Phase 1, mandatory archival or fresh tumor biopsies will be&#xD;
      collected. In Phase 2, a mandatory fresh tumor biopsy will be required for study entry and&#xD;
      another fresh biopsy will be collected between Cycles 2 and 4. The frequency of&#xD;
      administration of PD-1 inhibitors will be every 2 weeks starting in Cycle 1 on Day 8 and Day&#xD;
      22 of a 35-day cycle with all subsequent cycles on Day 1 and Day 15 of 28-day cycles. APL-101&#xD;
      will be administered orally every 12 hours continuously on an empty stomach.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each potential subject, there is a 28-day screening and eligibility assessment period&#xD;
      before enrollment; the first dose of study treatment will be administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1&#xD;
      (C1D1) (Safety population). Subjects will continue to receive their assigned treatment&#xD;
      throughout the study until the occurrence of confirmed disease progression [progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD)] by irRECIST, death, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or until the study&#xD;
      is closed by the Sponsor. During the treatment period, study visits will occur on Day 1, Day&#xD;
      2, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 and Day 15 of every subsequent cycle. Subjects&#xD;
      who experience a response [Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR)] â‰¥ 2 cycles, PD 1&#xD;
      plus APL-101 combination will be continued until disease progression based on irRECIST.&#xD;
      Subjects should receive a minimal of 2 cycles of PD-1 and APL-101 for adequate evaluation of&#xD;
      response (Evaluable population). Discontinuation of PD-1 and APL-101 should occur upon&#xD;
      determination of disease progression as determined by irRECIST, intolerable toxicity or when&#xD;
      the risk/benefit ratio is no longer beneficial for the subjects as determined by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, or upon subject withdrawal of consent. Upon permanent discontinuation&#xD;
      of study treatment, there is a Treatment Termination visit and three monthly follow-up visits&#xD;
      for a 90-day safety follow-up visit period. Subjects who drop out before they complete the&#xD;
      first cycle of combination treatment for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced&#xD;
