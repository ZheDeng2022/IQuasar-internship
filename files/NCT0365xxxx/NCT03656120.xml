  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid addiction is common worldwide. Thienorphine hydrochloride is a newly partial opioid&#xD;
      receptor agonist drugs. It's affinity with opioid receptors was much higher than opioids,&#xD;
      which could effectively prevents opioid dependence by stop opioids competition for opioid&#xD;
      receptors and causing opioid dependence. The aim of this research was to determine whether&#xD;
      thienorphine hydrochloride would reduce opioid use and better preventing relapse among opioid&#xD;
      addicts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids dependence is a chronic brain disease, with a much higher rate of relapse rate.&#xD;
      Relapse prevention is important for opioid dependence treatment. Thienorphine hydrochloride,&#xD;
      derivatives of buprenorphine, is one of the receptor partial agonists. Previous research&#xD;
      indicated that, it may be a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of opioid&#xD;
      dependent patients after detoxification. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, phase Ⅱb clinical trial, we are aimed to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      thienorphine hydrochloride tablets for anti-relapse therapy after opioid dependence&#xD;
      detoxification treatment, determining the optimal dose of thienorphine hydrochloride tablets,&#xD;
      and further evaluate the safety of thienorphine hydrochloride for patients with opioid&#xD;
      dependence. 180 eligible patients are going to be recruited and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      0.2mg/day group, 0.5mg/day group and placebo control group after they provided their consent&#xD;
      forms. Subjects in each group would receive assigned treatment for 12 weeks. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measure was retention time of each participants during these 12 weeks. Urine test for&#xD;
      opioids, changing of withdrawal score and craving, self-reported euphoria after using heroin,&#xD;
      subjects and researchers' overall evaluation of treatment efficacy are secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome measure was retention time of each participants during these 12 weeks, defined as from the beginning of randomized into assigned group to the days participants decided to quit the research for the following reasons: (1) Subjects were not receiving assigned therapy for seven consecutive days or more; (2) the subject cannot continue to participate in the study for other reasons; (3) The researchers decided that the subject should stop the study based on their clinical diagnosis and treatment; (4) subjects withdrew their consent form.</description>

    <measure>opioids negative rate through urine test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject，opioids negative rate was defined as the number of negative urine test during the 12-week treatment divided by the number of urine tests each subject should performed at the end of the study. Missed test is treated positively by urine test.</description>

    <measure>Change of withdrawal score of Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Symptom Scale (COWS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Symptom Scale (COWS) is calculates as the change in the subject's COWS score over the 12-week period compared to baseline. COWS scale contains a total of 32 items, and the contents of the item basically cover all symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal. Each symptom is divided into four levels, ranging from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 3 (severe symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Change of craving from baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess subjective self-report craving for opioids, where the subject was asked to quantify his/her subjective state of craving for opioids by marking a point on a line which is anchored at one end by words describing an absence of the subjective craving state (0 point) and at the other end by words describing a maximal intensity of craving state (10 points).</description>

    <description>At the end of the 12-week study, subjects are going to evaluate the overall treatment efficacy of thienorphine hydrochloride during these 12-week period using a five-point scale. The scale is divided into 5 levels: very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor.</description>
