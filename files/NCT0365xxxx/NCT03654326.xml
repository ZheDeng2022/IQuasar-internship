  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of gefapixant&#xD;
      (MK-7264) in premenopausal female participants with moderate to severe endometriosis-related&#xD;
      pain. The primary hypothesis: gefapixant is superior to placebo in reducing the average daily&#xD;
      pelvic pain score (cyclic and non-cyclic, combined) during Treatment Cycle 2.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Pelvic Pain Score During Treatment Cycle 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Treatment Cycle 2 (Week 4 to Week 8; each cycle is approximately 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic pain (cyclic pain associated with menses, and non-cyclic pain not associated with menses) severity score was measured using a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing extremely severe pain. The averages of the daily pelvic pain scores (cyclic and non-cyclic, combined) entered in participants' electronic diaries (eDiaries) were calculated for Baseline and Treatment Cycle 2 (approximately Week 4 to Week 8). A negative change indicates a decrease in pain severity from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. Per protocol, this analysis included AEs reported up to 14 days after end of study intervention.</description>

    <description>Cyclic pelvic pain (associated with menses) severity score was measured using a 0-10 NRS, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing extremely severe pain.
