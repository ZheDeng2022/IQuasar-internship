  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      75% patients in the chronic phase of a stroke keep walking disabilities. Focal spasticity in&#xD;
      the paretic lower limb frequently causes these walking disabilities, and the gold standard&#xD;
      treatment is intramuscular injection of Botulinum toxin A in the spastic muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To potentiate the effects of toxin, walking rehabilitation is usually prescribed in the weeks&#xD;
      following injection, but the protocols vary and few have been evaluated in the medical&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the effect on walking ability of combined treatment by botulinum toxin A and&#xD;
      robot-assisted gait training has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested hypothesis: Robot-assisted gait training by Lokomat® motorized exoskeleton potentiates&#xD;
      botulinum toxin's effects better than conventional walking therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on walking ability of the association of&#xD;
      focal spasticity treatment by Botulinum toxin and Lokomat-assisted walking rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients suffering from spastic hemiparesia after stroke in the chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary: distance walked (meters) in the six-minute walk test (SMWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, opened, monocentric study with a crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients over 18 years of age, in the chronic phase of stroke, who have&#xD;
      already been treated by Botulinum toxin injection for focal spasticity in our PMR ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment at Day one (D0), Week four (W4) and Week eight (W8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a preliminary study which had the six-minute walk test as a secondary outcome, the&#xD;
      expected results are a significant improvement of the distance walked in the SMWT after&#xD;
      robotic rehabilitation, and a lack of significant improvement following conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study should serve to further harmonize and optimize rehabilitation protocols after toxin&#xD;
      injections, and to justify the use of robotic rehabilitation for patients in the chronic&#xD;
      phase of stroke.&#xD;

      Introduction :&#xD;
&#xD;
      75% patients in the chronic phase of a stroke (&gt;6 months) keep walking disabilities. Focal&#xD;
      spasticity in the paretic lower limb frequently causes these walking disabilities, and the&#xD;
      gold standard treatment is intramuscular injection of Botulinum toxin A in the spastic&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To potentiate the effects of toxin, walking rehabilitation is usually prescribed in the weeks&#xD;
      following injection, but the protocols vary and few have been evaluated in the medical&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the effect on walking ability of combined treatment by botulinum toxin A and&#xD;
      robot-assisted gait training has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robot-assisted gait training by Lokomat® motorized exoskeleton potentiates botulinum toxin's&#xD;
      effects better than conventional walking therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: to evaluate the effects on walking ability of the association of focal&#xD;
           spasticity treatment by Botulinum toxin and Lokomat-assisted walking rehabilitation in&#xD;
           patients suffering from spastic hemiparesia after stroke in the chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: to determine the optimal time between the toxin injection and the start of&#xD;
           robotic rehabilitation; to evaluate the effects of the combined treatment on the balance&#xD;
           and spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: distance walked (meters) in the six-minute walk test (SMWT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: walking speed (meters/seconds), balance (Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance&#xD;
           Scale), spasticity (score on the Modified Ashworth Scale and joint range of motion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, opened, monocentric study with a crossover design.&#xD;
