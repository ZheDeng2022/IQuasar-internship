    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and the more severe manifestation, acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) describe syndromes of acute onset, bilateral, inflammatory pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrates and impaired oxygenation. ARDS/ALI are a continuum of disease which results in a&#xD;
      life threatening, rapidly progressive illness and occurs in critically ill patients. Recent&#xD;
      reports in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) highlight the significant&#xD;
      public health impact ARDS/ALI has on the critically ill population in that despite robust&#xD;
      research efforts, these illnesses continue to be under diagnosed, under treated, and continue&#xD;
      to have a high mortality rate (≥ 40% of all confirmed diagnoses). The estimates for ARDS/ALI&#xD;
      incidence vary due to inconsistencies with proper diagnosis and lack of valid biomarkers of&#xD;
      disease; however, it is expected that anywhere from 20-50% of patients on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation will develop this disease. Previous work by our group has shown that&#xD;
      sphingolipids play a multifaceted role in lung inflammation. Sphingolipid are a class of&#xD;
      bioactive lipids that play a role in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell migration,&#xD;
      and adhesion. Ceramide is one species of sphingolipid the investigators have examined in both&#xD;
      man and mouse. Our laboratory has shown that ceramide is up-regulated in pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammation in mouse models of pneumonitis and is elevated in the exhaled breath condensate&#xD;
      of mechanically ventilated patients at risk for ARDS/ALI. Our work coupled with the work of&#xD;
      others highlighting a role for ceramide in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),&#xD;
      surfactant dysfunction, and infectious disease make ceramide a logical candidate biomarker&#xD;
      that warrants further investigation. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the&#xD;
      role of ceramide as a biomarker in ARDS/ALI. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that&#xD;
      ceramide is elevated in the lungs of patients who develop ARDS/ALI. This lipid dysregulation&#xD;
      accounts for the pathophysiology seen in this disease and may be a potential pharmacologic&#xD;
      target for clinical treatment. Thus the purpose of this exploratory research is to maximize&#xD;
      existing specimens to further evaluate ceramide as a biomarker for acute lung injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since it was first described in 1967 by Ashbaugh et al, ARDS/ALI remains a global clinical&#xD;
      problem resulting in high morbidity and mortality. These lung syndromes are life threatening,&#xD;
      rapidly progressive disease occurring in critically ill patients characterized by hypoxemia,&#xD;
      alterations in lung mechanics, and edema. Recent reports in the Journal of the American&#xD;
      Medical Association (JAMA) highlight the significant public health impact ARDS/ALI has on the&#xD;
      critically ill population in that despite robust research efforts, ARDS continues to be under&#xD;
      diagnosed, under treated, and continues to have a high mortality rate (= 40% of all confirmed&#xD;
      diagnoses). The estimates for ARDS/ALI incidence vary due to inconsistencies with proper&#xD;
      diagnosis and lack of valid biomarkers of disease; however, it is expected that anywhere from&#xD;
      20-50% of patients on long term mechanical ventilation will develop this disease. Despite&#xD;
      this robust effort to better improve patient care, clinicians are still lacking biomarkers of&#xD;
      disease and a strong understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS/ALI. Thus,&#xD;
      research is warranted in this area. Many research efforts have been aimed at unifying&#xD;
      diagnoses of the disease with clinical criteria, thus the ARDS Task force implemented the&#xD;
      Berlin definition of disease in 2012 but despite this, recent data from the Lung SAFE trial&#xD;
      showed that clinical recognition of disease was only 34.1% on initial presentation, again&#xD;
      emphasizing the need for objective measures of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxygenation threshold set forth by the Berlin definition are critical for understanding&#xD;
      of ARDS/ALI disease severity and progression. Oxygenation is calculated by the PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      ratio (P/F) which is the the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) as determined&#xD;
      by arterial blood gas to fractional inspired oxygen setting on the mechanical ventilator&#xD;
      (FiO2). This P/F ratio is also important to distinguish both diagnosis of ARDS but disease&#xD;
      severity. A normal healthy P/F ratio is between 400-500 whereas ALI is below 300 (aka Mild&#xD;
      ARDS by Berlin definition), ARDS is below 200, and severe ARDS is below 100. These are the&#xD;
      same clinical parameters used by our medical intensive care unit (MICU). The current&#xD;
      treatment modalities for ARDS/ALI are primarily supportive care in the form of lung&#xD;
      protective ventilator management, fluid management, prone positioning, and neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockage in severe ARDS. Clinical studies have examined potential pharmacologic therapies&#xD;
      including the use of albuterol, anti-platelet therapies, statins, aspirin, and steroids -&#xD;
      none of which had any significant benefit on clinical outcomes. Our data in mouse models and&#xD;
      preliminary data in a small cohort of patients at risk for ARDS/ALI highlight a novel role&#xD;
      for ceramide in the pathophysiology of this disease. Our preliminary data indicate that&#xD;
      ceramide may not only be a key player in the underlying pathology of ARDS/ALI, but may also&#xD;
      serve as a useful biomarker. Additionally, as there is a currently FDA approved drug that&#xD;
      targets ceramide formation and actions as the investigators have demonstrated, the work&#xD;
      outlined herein has significant translational potential. Thus, this proposal will examine the&#xD;
      premise that ceramide is a new critical player in ARDS/ALI and identify ceramide as a&#xD;
      biomarker for individualized medicine to optimize diagnosis and improve treatments. Given the&#xD;
      large numbers of individuals affected by ARDS/ALI, the outcomes of this research have the&#xD;
      potential to change the paradigm of how clinicians and researchers perceive inflammatory&#xD;
      airway disease and may then translate into better, targeted approaches for the management for&#xD;
      millions worldwide. This pilot study will be conducted as a prospective descriptive,&#xD;
      cross-sectional study with a single data collection. This design allows for greater control&#xD;
      over the measurements and maximization of data completeness. While a cross-sectional study&#xD;
      design does not allow us to examine causality, it does allow us to examine associations among&#xD;
      the variables/domains of interest, which align with the aim of the study. This design is&#xD;
      appropriate and scientifically rigorous while meeting the budgetary and time constraints of&#xD;
      the grant mechanism. The investigators have developed a state of the science, non-invasive&#xD;
      technique which can be utilized to assess sphingolipid levels in the breath of mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated subjects. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is collected using a commercially&#xD;
      available device, RTubeVent™ (Respiratory Research Inc., Austin, TX). The RTubeVent™, covered&#xD;
      by a frozen aluminum sleeve and fabric cloth sleeve, allows for the cooling of exhaled breath&#xD;
      into a condensed liquid form and is a safe, easy, relatively inexpensive, repeatable,&#xD;
      non-invasive approach to collect a biological fluid that is hypothesized to be more specific&#xD;
      to pulmonary biology changes compared to systemically collected biological fluids such as&#xD;
      serum or plasma. The RTubeVENT™ breath condensate collection device is designed for ease of&#xD;
      use in the ICU. It can be placed in-line in the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit or&#xD;
      at the ventilator exhaust port. This non-invasive device is fully self-contained and&#xD;
      disposable. As the subject is ventilated, the RTubeVENT™ gathers breath condensate in a&#xD;
      special cartridge designed exclusively for ventilator use. EBC has been identified by the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health as an emerging source for biomarker research thus highlighting&#xD;
      another innovative aspect of this proposal. Once patients are enrolled in the study, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect EBC from the ventilator for approximately 20 minutes under the&#xD;
      guidance of respiratory therapy and take a 5cc blood draw for plasma isolation. Samples will&#xD;
      be immediately taken to the laboratory for processing where both EBC and plasma will be&#xD;
      aliquoted, and stored at -80°C until analysis. Liquid chromatography electrospray&#xD;
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) will be used to detect sphingolipid levels&#xD;
      and samples will be batch processed to minimize variability. The investigators predict that&#xD;
      patients in the ARDS/ALI group will have significantly elevated ceramide levels as compared&#xD;
      to those in the control group.&#xD;
