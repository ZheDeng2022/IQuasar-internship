    <textblock>
      The adjusted Cancer Thriving and Surviving Program (CTS) for women with breast cancer living&#xD;
      in Switzerland (CTS-BC-CH) is a course of 7 weekly sessions of 2.5 - 3 hours led by trained&#xD;
      peer-leaders (women with breast cancer experience). This pilot study aims to explore the&#xD;
      reach of the CTS-BC-CH program (integrated into the clinical pathway) and to investigate its&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness with regard to Swiss breast cancer patients' self-efficacy and&#xD;
      self-management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016/17, the self-management program for cancer survivors, the Cancer Thriving and&#xD;
      Surviving Program (CTS) was translated into German. The content of the CTS was adapted to&#xD;
      breast cancer specific needs in three interdisciplinary workshops based on a participatory&#xD;
      approach including active patient engagement. Additional disease-specific topics were&#xD;
      developed and confirmed applying a multi-stakeholder e-rating approach. After a consensus&#xD;
      meeting with the participation of breast cancer survivors, health care professional and&#xD;
      international experts in the field of self-management, consensus on the program was reached&#xD;
      in June 2017, resulting in the CTS-BC-CH program, i.e. a standardized manual for course&#xD;
      leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to explore the reach of the CTS-BC-CH program (integrated into the&#xD;
      clinical pathway) and to investigate its preliminary effectiveness for female Swiss breast&#xD;
      cancer patients. The CTS-BC-CH is delivered in two breast cancer centers in in the&#xD;
      German-speaking part of Switzerland as a group-based program with seven weekly sessions of&#xD;
      2.5 - 3 hours led by trained peer-leaders. Course leaders have to complete a 4-days training&#xD;
      provided by certified master trainers. First, participants are enrolled for usual care,&#xD;
      followed by participants who will attend the CTS-BC-CH course. Participants will complete&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires at three time points over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
