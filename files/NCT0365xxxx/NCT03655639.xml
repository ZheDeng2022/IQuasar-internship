  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants who are born prematurely have immature nervous and cardiorespiratory systems. These&#xD;
      are systems infants use to breathe, to move oxygen throughout their bodies, and to maintain&#xD;
      safe and stable levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The goal of this study is to better&#xD;
      understand how these immature systems affect long term development, such as brain, heart, and&#xD;
      motor function (movement) with several innovative, integrated physiological measures. We hope&#xD;
      this will allow us to begin to find better ways to help premature infants breathe and to&#xD;
      optimize their development.&#xD;

      The broad long-term objective is to use comprehensive state-of-the-art, high-fidelity&#xD;
      monitoring to investigate physiological biomarkers of autonomic neurorespiratory maturation&#xD;
      with integrated analysis of autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses in preterm infants, and&#xD;
      to evaluate their role in ventilatory instability, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and&#xD;
      co-morbidities including neurodevelopment in the 1st year of life. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will&#xD;
      establish the spectrum and developmental trajectory of ANS maturation/function using&#xD;
      high-resolution physiologic recordings of ventilatory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      measures during typical daily activity (28, 32 and 36 weeks (wks) post-menstrual age (PMA)(up&#xD;
      to 24-hour recordings) and at 3 and 12 months (mos) corrected age (CA)(4-hour recordings).&#xD;
      Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that individual and integrated metrics of ANS function will&#xD;
      demonstrate maturational patterns that impart resilience or vulnerability to environmental&#xD;
      challenges. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will determine respiratory and neurodevelopmental morbidity&#xD;
      throughout the 1st year of life using clinically applicable outcome measures and associate&#xD;
      morbidity with ANS development and function using a Respiratory Morbidity Severity Score&#xD;
      (RMSS), need for respiratory support, medications, or hospitalization, Bayley Scales of&#xD;
      Infant Development III (6, 12 mos), Neurological, Sensory, Motor, Developmental Assessment&#xD;
      (NSMDA)(3, 6, 12 mos), and early measures of evoked-auditory potentials (EAP)(28, 32, 36 wks&#xD;
      PMA; 3, 12 mos CA) and General Movement Assessments (GMA)(28, 32, 36 wks; 3 mos). Aim 2 tests&#xD;
      the hypothesis that infants demonstrating delayed ANS maturation or vulnerability to&#xD;
      endogenous challenges will require more respiratory interventions and will demonstrate&#xD;
      developmental delays in the 1st year of life. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will determine endotypes of&#xD;
      autonomic neurorespiratory stability and maturation through trajectory analysis and&#xD;
      integrated physiological modeling. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that trajectory analysis will&#xD;
      reveal 3 autonomic maturation patterns [1) &quot;normal&quot; maturation with ability to withstand&#xD;
      environmental perturbations; 2) &quot;normal&quot; maturation without ability to withstand&#xD;
      environmental perturbations; and 3) delayed or disordered maturation with inability to&#xD;
      maintain physiologic stability in absence of environmental perturbations] that will be&#xD;
      associated with severity of respiratory morbidity and neuromotor impairment at 1 year. This&#xD;
      novel approach will establish the role of autonomic neurorespiratory maturation in stability&#xD;
      of oxygenation throughout the 1st year of life, provide insight into BPD pathogenesis, allow&#xD;
      prospective identification of at-risk infants, and permit development of mechanism-specific&#xD;
      interventions with potential to impact thousands of families and billions in healthcare&#xD;
      cost/year in the U.S., alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to lung-independent mechanisms of respiratory dysfunction, this study aims to&#xD;
      investigate lung-independent mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Typically thought to&#xD;
      be a secondary effect of primary lung structural development and/or hypoxia, up to 40% of&#xD;
      infants with chronic respiratory dysfunction develop pulmonary hypertension (PH) and&#xD;
      increased risk for mortality. However, we and others found that 10-30% of premature infants&#xD;
      who develop PH did not have clinical evidence of respiratory dysfunction, suggesting&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular mechanisms that are independent of clinically apparent respiratory&#xD;
      disease. Multiple molecular mechanisms are postulated by which hypoxia results in PH, but&#xD;
      preliminary data from our group and others suggest a role for Fibroblast Growth Factor 2&#xD;
      (FGF2) and FGF receptors 1 and 2 (FGFR1, FGFR2) signaling in the development of pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular remodeling in PH. Thus, by serially using sensitive echocardiographic measures of&#xD;
      Right Ventricular-Pulmonary Arterial (RV-PA) coupling, we can quantify hypoxic exposure and&#xD;
      RV-PA axis dysfunction and we will couple these clinical measurements of FGF2 signaling. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that recurrent hypoxic exposure of dysmature pulmonary vasculature in premature&#xD;
      newborns results in RV-PA axis dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension that is mediated by&#xD;
      FGF2 signaling and is independent of clinically apparent lung disease.&#xD;
