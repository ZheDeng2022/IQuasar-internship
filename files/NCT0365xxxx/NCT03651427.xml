  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (male-to-female) were invited to participate in this study to test the&#xD;
      impact of Cross-Sex Hormone Therapy (CSHT) in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging and cognitive assessment were performed in different time-points to compare the&#xD;
      impact of CSHT in the brain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sex hormones are known to exert several effect on the brain white matter, cerebral cortex,&#xD;
      functional connectivity and neurotransmission. Furthermore, in transgender people, CSHT is&#xD;
      know to induce anatomical and functional changes in the brain. However, only a few studies&#xD;
      have already been conducted to investigate the effects of sex hormones on the brain&#xD;
      accounting for the interference of endogenous gonadal hormones. Also, there is a lack of&#xD;
      knowledge about the importance of CSHT after Gender Affirming Surgery (GAS) regarding induced&#xD;
      hypogonadism that follows this surgical procedure. Therefore, neuroimaging studies designed&#xD;
      to isolate the effect of endogenous gonadal hormones in people with GD urge to be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fulfil this purpose, transgender women that have already performed GAS and/or were under&#xD;
      Gonadotrophin Release Hormone analogues treatment (in order to induce hypogonadism similar to&#xD;
      GAS) were invited to interrupt CSHT for at least 30 days to promote sex hormones washout. At&#xD;
      the end of the washout, participants performed magnetic resonance imaging, laboratorial&#xD;
      analyses for sex hormones and neuro-cognitive assessment. After this first time-point,&#xD;
      participants received a new prescription for CSHT containing estradiol (without progesterone)&#xD;
      to be used continuously for 60 days, when the same assessments from the end of washout were&#xD;
      repeated 60 days after CSHT to compare brain and cognitive longitudinal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all the time-points, variations in depression scores and anxiety levels were assessed with&#xD;
      specific scales.&#xD;

    <description>Transgender women who already completed GAS or that agreed to start gonadotropin release hormone analogue to suppress endogenous sex hormones.&#xD;
If the participants were using CSHT in the moment of the study assignment, they were asked to stop hormones for 30 days to evaluate the impact of hypogonadism in the brain.&#xD;
After this first assessment, they received prescriptions for Estradiol (equine conjugated oestrogen, or estradiol valerate, or topic 17-beta estradiol formulations) for 60 days, and the impact of CSHT was evaluated again to compare to washout condition.</description>
