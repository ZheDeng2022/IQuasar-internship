      The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy has been reported in the range of&#xD;
      2-15%[3]. Due to the severity of the complications related to asymptomatic bacteriuria in&#xD;
      this patient population, the American College of OBGYN recommends routine screening of all&#xD;
      pregnant women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in a pregnant woman should be screened only using a&#xD;
      clean-catch non contaminated urine sample. Screening for ABU using urine chemistries is not&#xD;
      recommended due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of these tests . If ABU is&#xD;
      present, appropriate antibiotic is given and post treatment urine culture is performed.&#xD;
      However, a controversy does exist as to the value of treatment of ABU in the prevention of&#xD;
      above noted complications [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, we have noted a contaminated urine cultures in up to 15 to 20% of our prenatal&#xD;
      patients. This can be frustrating to both the patient and her physician. Repeat testing,&#xD;
      delay in the diagnosis, and additional cost are just some of the problems associated with&#xD;
      these contaminated urine cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis by improving the instructions given to patients on how to perform a clean catch&#xD;
      urine, that we will decease our contaminated urine cultures.&#xD;

      Introduction Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is defined as the presence of bacteria ( â‰¥105 per&#xD;
      ml) in a non- contaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms&#xD;
      related to UTI[1]. Although this is a benign condition that does not require treatment in&#xD;
      most adults, ABU in pregnant women has been linked to several complications. The pregnancy&#xD;
      state, with its increase in urine stasis and altered immune, can result in increased rates of&#xD;
      pyelonephritis and preterm labor[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy has been reported in the range of&#xD;
      2-15%[3]. Due to the severity of the complications related to asymptomatic bacteriuria in&#xD;
      this patient population, the American College of OBGYN recommends routine screening of all&#xD;
      pregnant women[4]. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in a pregnant woman should be screened only using&#xD;
      a clean-catch non contaminated urine sample. Screening for ABU using urine chemistries is not&#xD;
      recommended due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of these tests[5, 6]. If ABU is&#xD;
      present, appropriate antibiotic is given and post treatment urine culture is performed.&#xD;
      However, a controversy does exist as to the value of treatment of ABU in the prevention of&#xD;
      above noted complications [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, we have noted a contaminated urine cultures in up to 15 to 20% of our prenatal&#xD;
      patients. This can be frustrating to both the patient and her physician. Repeat testing,&#xD;
      delay in the diagnosis, and additional cost are just some of the problems associated with&#xD;
      these contaminated urine cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Clinical Question We hypothesis by improving the instructions given to patients on&#xD;
      how to perform a clean catch urine, that we will decease our contaminated urine cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients (16 years and older) presenting for initial routine prenatal care at one of the&#xD;
      St Luke University Hospital perinatal clinics will be eligible. Patients with known urinary&#xD;
      infection, symptoms of UTI, and other renal disease will be excluded. Consented patients will&#xD;
      be randomized (1:1) using previously prepared sealed envelopes to either the current standard&#xD;
      of verbal explanation of the clean-catch urine technique or to view the instructional video&#xD;
      on the collection technique. A Spanish version video tape will also be available. These&#xD;
      sample results as well as basic patient demographics will be collected (Age, Gestational age,&#xD;
      BMI, gravidity, parity) will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 200 patients based on an improvement from 15% contaminated rate to a 5%&#xD;
      contaminated rate (power 0.80; p=0.05). We will compare proportion of contaminated urine&#xD;
      specimens using chi square test to those patients that watch the video to those that did not.&#xD;
      In addition, we will compare demographics to determine if any difference exists between the&#xD;
      groups. We will employ t-test, chi-squared and Mann-Whitney-U test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and cost to patients This study does not incur any additional risk to the patient. No&#xD;
      additional cost will be charged to the patients since all pregnant patients receive a urine&#xD;
      culture screen as part of their standard of care.&#xD;
