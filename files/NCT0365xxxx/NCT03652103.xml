  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators' goal is to determine whether Erector Spinae Plane Block would provide a better&#xD;
      analgesia, help mobilization and early discharge or increase satisfaction for patients&#xD;
      undergoing Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy(PNL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the two groups will receive ESP catheterization after general anesthesia conducted.&#xD;
      The other group will receive routine analgesia protocol used for PNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total amount of drugs administered, pain scores(NRS) at certain time intervals and at&#xD;
      certain events(removal of nephrostomy and pain at mobilization) will be recorded and&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erector Spinae Plane Block(ESP) is a rather new method which can block ventral and dorsal&#xD;
      rami of spinal nerves in the paravertebral area after they leave the spinal column.&#xD;
      Originally used for thoracic somites, by spreading in a craniocaudal fashion in the erector&#xD;
      spinae muscle group, it has the potential of blocking cervical or lumbar nerves as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide better analgesia for surgical procedures, anesthesiologists use truncal blocks for&#xD;
      peripheral intervention. Although these blocks are generally very effective and easy to&#xD;
      apply, they are limited by a relatively small area of effectivity. In order to achieve denser&#xD;
      effects for larger surfaces, epidural anesthesia must be used with the risk of more severe&#xD;
      complications than any peripheral or truncal nerve blocks. Epidural anesthesia also has the&#xD;
      disadvantages of requiring more experience and more cautiousness than ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      truncal blocks and risks of an undesirable temporary motor blockade. ESP block could be the&#xD;
      answer for better regional analgesia while avoiding motor blockade and complications of&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two groups as Block Group(GB) and Control Group(GC) and two periods as&#xD;
      during operation and 48 hours after the operation. Every participant will receive Total&#xD;
      Intravenous Anesthesia(TIVA) and will be monitored with ECG, non-invasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, pulse oximeter, and Bispectral Index. Participants in GB will receive&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided ESP block catheter after proper maintenance of anesthesia provided. The&#xD;
      first period will be during operation. We will evaluate the administered drug amounts per&#xD;
      kilogram for each patient. Investigators believe ESP block will help them deliver proper&#xD;
      anesthesia with lower dosages. The second period will include postoperative 48 hours. Pain&#xD;
      scores(NRS) will be evaluated at certain time intervals and at two critical moments between&#xD;
      the two groups. One of the critical moment which patients fear and feel the pain most is the&#xD;
      removal time of nephrostomy. The second moment is the first time patients start walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue analgesia will be ordered on demand for both groups as IV 1 mg/kg tramadol. Hours and&#xD;
      amounts of rescue analgesia administered will be recorded.&#xD;
