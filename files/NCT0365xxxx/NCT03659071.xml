  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The childhood cancer experience necessarily impacts the entire family. In this context,&#xD;
      particular attention should be paid to the donor siblings of hematopoietic stem cells in the&#xD;
      context of treatment of leukemia by grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the little existing work on the long-term fate of stem cell donor siblings of&#xD;
      cancer survivors report psychosocial consequences, particularly for real post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress in distant siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have explored the medium and long-term impact of the disease, as well as&#xD;
      donation, on a broader set of domains structuring the quality of life, through validated&#xD;
      quantitative tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, since 2004, the LEA program (Leukemia of the Child and Adolescent) aims to assess&#xD;
      the determinants of the state of health and quality of life in the medium and long term,&#xD;
      patients treated for acute childhood leukemia after 1980.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate, at a distance from the transplant, the&#xD;
      quality of life of donors from the siblings of survivors of acute childhood leukemia who&#xD;
      received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant compared with non-donor siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SIDONY ancillary study will be proposed to families of LEA patients who have received a&#xD;
      geno-identical sibling haematopoietic stem cell transplant (population of interest) and to&#xD;
      families whose LEA patient has not been treated by sibling transplantation. geno-identical&#xD;
      but still declaring to have siblings (main comparator group). Each family will be contacted&#xD;
      by mail and the management of inclusions will be managed by the Epidemiology and Health&#xD;
      Economics Department of AP-HM (Marseille).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information not routinely available in the LEA database will be collected from the siblings&#xD;
      (self-questionnaire, in addition, for each surviving child included in the cohort, data are&#xD;
      available: sociodemographic; characteristics of the initial disease and therapeutic received;&#xD;
      physical sequelae; quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population meeting the inclusion criteria represents 2639 subjects: 337 donors and 2302&#xD;
      non-donors, making it possible to obtain high powers for analyzes (linear regression,&#xD;
      multilevel analyzes, etc.). This study could identify profiles of siblings for whom the&#xD;
      quality of life seems particularly impaired, potential object of individual interventions&#xD;
      (remediation ...).&#xD;

&#xD;
      The results of the little existing work on the long-term fate of stem cell donor siblings of&#xD;
      cancer survivors report psychosocial consequences, particularly for real post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress in distant siblings. disease. Few studies have explored the medium and long-term&#xD;
      impact of the disease, as well as donation, on a broader set of domains structuring the&#xD;
      quality of life, through validated quantitative tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, since 2004, the LEA program (Leukemia of the Child and Adolescent) aims to assess&#xD;
      the determinants (medical, socio-economic, behavioral and environmental) of the state of&#xD;
      health and quality of life in the medium and long term, patients treated for acute childhood&#xD;
      leukemia after 1980. To document the quality of life of their self-reported hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell donor siblings and their perception of the impact that experience of cancer in the&#xD;
      family has had on their medium and long-term future, the organization of the LEA program can&#xD;
      easily be extended to the establishment of an ancillary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      objectives The main objective of this study is to evaluate, at a distance from the&#xD;
      transplant, the quality of life of donors from the siblings of survivors of acute childhood&#xD;
      leukemia who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant compared with non-donor siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: (a) to compare the quality of life of siblings with that of the&#xD;
      general population; (b) to compare the quality of life of the siblings with that of the&#xD;
      surviving patients; (c) to identify the determinants (demographic, socioeconomic, family and&#xD;
      history of cancer) of the medium-long-term quality of life of this family; (d) remotely&#xD;
      evaluate the donation's use of the donor sire care system as a tracer of the impact of the&#xD;
      donation; (e) remotely evaluate the gift of the social integration of the donor sibship,&#xD;
      particularly in terms of schooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SIDONY ancillary study will be proposed to families of LEA patients who have received a&#xD;
      geno-identical sibling haematopoietic stem cell transplant (population of interest) and to&#xD;
      families whose LEA patient has not been treated by sibling transplantation. geno-identical&#xD;
      but still declaring to have siblings (main comparator group). Each family will be contacted&#xD;
      by mail and the management of inclusions will be managed by the Epidemiology and Health&#xD;
      Economics Department of AP-HM (Marseille).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information not routinely available in the LEA database will be collected from the siblings&#xD;
      (self-questionnaire, to be returned by post): sociodemographic and socio-economic data&#xD;
      relating to the siblings and the family; data concerning the quality of life of the siblings;&#xD;
      psycho-behavioral and cognitive data; data on the state of health of the siblings; social&#xD;
      inclusion data; recourse to the health care system. In addition, for each surviving child&#xD;
      included in the cohort, data are available: sociodemographic; characteristics of the initial&#xD;
      disease and therapeutic received; physical sequelae; quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and practical impact The population meeting the inclusion criteria represents&#xD;
      2639 subjects: 337 donors and 2302 non-donors, making it possible to obtain high powers for&#xD;
      analyzes (linear regression, multilevel analyzes, etc.). This study could identify profiles&#xD;
      of siblings for whom the quality of life seems particularly impaired, potential object of&#xD;
