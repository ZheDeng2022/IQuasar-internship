      The present clinical phase I study designed to examine the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the medicinal product - Vaccine vector against influenza A - in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers after a single dose in the three groups with dose escalation.&#xD;

      According to the results of the screening of volunteers who signed the informed consent Form,&#xD;
      a sequential set of three groups of volunteers with different doses of the drug, the total&#xD;
      number of volunteers who received the drug will be at least 36 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the fact that the drug is investigated for the first time with the participation of the&#xD;
      people, will initially be admitted to hospital on 5 volunteers who will receive the&#xD;
      investigational drug in the 1 dose The total number of recombinant pseudo-adenoviral&#xD;
      particles (2.5 ± 1.25) x 10*10 VP/dose). If the safety of the drug is confirmed by the&#xD;
      results of observation on the 7th day of the study, the study will continue with the&#xD;
      participation of 7 more volunteers in this dosing group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, according to a similar scheme (each time after an interim safety assessment on day&#xD;
      7), the study will include volunteers receiving the drug at a dose of 0.5 ml (Total amount of&#xD;
      recombinant pseudo-adenoviral particles (1.0 ± 0.5) x 1011 VP/dose), particles/dose and 0.5&#xD;
