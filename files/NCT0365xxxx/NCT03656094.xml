      After progression to previous PD-1/L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab),&#xD;
      physicians' choice chemotherapy plus pembolizumab (or placebo) will be administered (3 weeks&#xD;
      per cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors should be 2nd or 3rd line therapy for advanced NSCLC. There&#xD;
      should be no systemic therapy after previous PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, before the enrollment to&#xD;

             Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to the date of&#xD;
             allocation/randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Received one or two cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC including at least one&#xD;
             platinum-doublet&#xD;

             progression to last PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The last PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor should be&#xD;
             administered 6 weeks before the study enrollment, and no other systemic therapy should&#xD;
             be done between the interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least one measurable lesion Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions&#xD;
             situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has&#xD;
             been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Available data for PD-L1 IHC results (any of one tested by 22C3, SP263, or SP142)&#xD;
             irrespective of expression level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. EGFR and ALK wild type&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to&#xD;
             [randomization/allocation] (see Appendix 3). If the urine test is positive or cannot&#xD;
             be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents&#xD;
             within 3 weeks [could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short&#xD;
             half-life drugs] prior to [randomization /allocation].&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to&#xD;
             ≤Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
             the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.&#xD;
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study&#xD;
             may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous&#xD;
             investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 2 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, well differentiated thyroid carcinoma, or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment. Patients with oligo (≤5) brain metastasis with size&#xD;
             less than 1cm can be enrolled without prior radiotherapy, if the tumors are regarded&#xD;
             as asymptomatic and stable, based on follow-up brain MRIs checked intervals of at&#xD;
             least 3 months. However, all patients with previously non-irradiated brain metastases&#xD;
             should have brain MRI checked within 4 weeks before starting administration of study&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
