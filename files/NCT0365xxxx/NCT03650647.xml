      The sample will be, at least, 90 primary molars, randomly distributed into three groups:&#xD;
      Group 1: IPC; Group 2: SE; Group 3: SCR. Teeth must present deep caries lesions (at least 2/3&#xD;
      of dentin depth), pulp vitality (no clinical or radiographical signs of pulp disease, such as&#xD;
      abcesses, fistulae, root resorption, abnormal tooth mobility). This study received approval&#xD;
      by the Ethics Committee of Fluminense Federal University (UFF; Brazil) - # CAAE:&#xD;

      The aims of this Randomized Clinical Trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the risk of pulpal exposure and tooth vitality maintenance of primary molars&#xD;
           with deep caries lesions, treated with conservative techniques, such as Stepwise&#xD;
           Excavation (SE) or Selective Caries Removal (SCR), and to compare with those teeth&#xD;
           treated with Indirect Pulp Capping (IPC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to verify changes in the cultivable microbiota isolated in the deep carious dentin&#xD;
           lesions of deciduous molars, before and after performing the procedures of SE;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to clinically evaluate dentin reactions to the SE;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to provide longitudinal monitoring of changes in the non-cultivable microbiota&#xD;
           (microbiome), found in dentin carious lesions of deciduous and permanent molars,&#xD;
           compared to the treatments performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to determine, in vitro, the microbial metabolome of different strains isolated from&#xD;
           dentin samples under conditions of high and low cariogenic challenge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to correlate, in vitro, the microbial metabolites with the clinical classification of&#xD;
           the cavitated lesions from which these samples originated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be, at least, 90 primary molars, randomly distributed into three groups:&#xD;
      Group 1: IPC; Group 2: SE; Group 3: SCR. Teeth must present deep caries lesions (at least 2/3&#xD;
      of dentin depth), pulp vitality (no clinical or radiographical signs of pulp disease, such as&#xD;
      abcesses, fistulae, root resorption, abnormal tooth mobility). This study received approval&#xD;

      January, 2017; and will finish in December, 2020. Patients will be selected from the public&#xD;

    <description>Nonselective removal to hard dentine (formerly complete excavation or complete caries removal) : removal of soft dentin, only hard dentine is left on the cavity, so that demineralized dentine &quot;free&quot; of bacteria is completely removed.&#xD;

    <description>Stepwise removal is carious tissue removal in 2 stages, i.e., visits. Soft carious tissue is left over the pulp in the first step, while peripheral dentine is prepared to hard dentine to allow a complete and durable seal of the lesion. A provisional restoration is placed, which should be sufficiently durable to last up to 6 months to allow changes in the dentine and pulp to take place. After this period, a second excavation is done and, if there is hard dentin formed, the tooth is restored.&#xD;
Intervention: Part of the soft caries is removed. Final restoration is placed on the second visit. Carious dentin removal</description>

    <description>Selective caries removal: only part the soft dentine is removed, so soft carious tissue is left over the pulp, while peripheral enamel and dentine are prepared to hard dentine, to allow a tight seal and placement of a durable restoration.&#xD;
Intervention: Part of the soft caries is removed. Final restoration is place over the soft dentin. Carious dentin removal</description>
