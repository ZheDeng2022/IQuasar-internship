  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this randomized controlled trial is to develop a clinical standard&#xD;
      procedure for measuring lactate in amniotic fluid (amniotic fluid lactate = = AFL) during&#xD;
      childbirth before oxytocin stimulation is started. The aim is to reduce the need for&#xD;
      emergency caesarean section during dysfunctional labour. The aim is also to study how&#xD;
      different substances (oxytocin and Samarin®) affect uterine metabolic status during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labour dystocia, i.e. prolonged labour, occurs in up to 30% in primipara deliveries and in&#xD;
      about 20% of all the deliveries. In 2016, in Finland oxytocin stimulation was used in 42% of&#xD;
      all the deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uterus, myometrium, is one of the largest muscles in the human body and consists mainly&#xD;
      of smooth muscle cells. During the contractions the myometrial vessels also contract, causing&#xD;
      momentary hypoxia and activation of anaerobic metabolism: O2 and pH levels of the muscle cell&#xD;
      decreases and the lactate concentration increases. After the contraction, the blood&#xD;
      circulation is restored and the anaerobic metabolites gradually dissolve. Myometrium requires&#xD;
      a sufficiently long break between the contractions to recover. In dysfunctional labour the&#xD;
      anaerobic metabolites accumulate in the myometrium. Accumulation of lactate has proved&#xD;
      significantly to reduce the spontaneous contractions of myometrium and hinder myometrium&#xD;
      calcium metabolism, which in turn reduces the strength of the contractions. Amniotic fluid&#xD;
      lactate is known to reflect the metabolic state of the uterus during the labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged labour can in many aspects be compared to the athlete's tired muscles. Many of&#xD;
      today's athletes try to control the accumulation of lactic acid in their muscles during&#xD;
      training by drinking baking soda (bicarbonate) dissolved in water one hour before their&#xD;
      physical activity. Bicarbonate is known to function as a lactic acid buffer. Bicarbonate is&#xD;
      considered as food and is sold in grocery stores as baking soda and for example as Samarin®.&#xD;
      Samarin® is safe to use during pregnancy because as a bicarbonate it does not pass through&#xD;
      placenta and does not affect the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aims to research if high AFL values (AFL &gt; 12 mmol/L) in women with labour arrest&#xD;
      are best treated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) treating the labour according to the hospital's current guidelines during labour arrest,&#xD;
      i.e. starting the stimulation with oxytocin and measuring the AFL again after one hour B)&#xD;
      administering bicarbonate (Samarin®) dissolved in water one hour before starting the&#xD;
      stimulation with oxytocin&#xD;
