  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition characterized by abdominal pain, bloating,&#xD;
      constipation, diarrhea and gas and affects up to 15% of the Western population. In many&#xD;
      individuals with IBS, symptoms can be triggered by foods, such as FODMAPs (easily fermentable&#xD;
      dietary fiber containing Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and&#xD;
      Polyols). Some individuals with IBS may also benefit from a gluten-free diet. Current&#xD;
      subtypes of IBS are based on symptoms (constipation, diarrhea, and mixed), rather than&#xD;
      mechanistic differences. Another promising approach for identifying IBS subtypes is based on&#xD;
      grouping individuals into similar metabolic phenotypes, i.e. metabotypes, that share&#xD;
      similarities in metabolism and metabolic regulation in response to specific foods. Health and&#xD;
      wellbeing could potentially be improved by personalized treatment through tailoring diet to&#xD;
      subjects with different IBS subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct an intervention study on&#xD;
      subjects with IBS and identify specific food susceptibilities based on metabolic phenotype&#xD;
      (metabotype). In total, 120 women and men with moderate to severe IBS will be recruited.&#xD;
      Gluten intolerance, other gastrointestinal disease and abdominal surgery will constitute&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The study will be performed in a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled cross-over study design. Study participants will receive three 1-week&#xD;
      diets with additions of either FODMAPs, gluten or an inert control with 1-week washout&#xD;
      in-between. IBS metabotypes will be identified by integrative multivariate analysis of&#xD;
      molecular phenotype data from metabolomics and microbiota measurements combined with data on&#xD;
      bowel habits and stomach discomfort. Study participants will also be subjected to a cocktail&#xD;
      provocation containing FODMAPs and gluten to develop a rapid diagnostic test based on&#xD;
      identified plasma metabolomic biomarkers of IBS metabotypes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is explorative with the primary aim to find and relate distinct subject&#xD;
      metabotypes reflecting tolerance/intolerance to specific food components among IBS-patients&#xD;
      by deducing and relating OMICs data patterns (metabolomics and gut microbiota data) to&#xD;
      reported severity of IBS-symptoms indicated by the primary endpoint variable, i.e. IBS-SSS.&#xD;
      Since the investigators don't have an estimation of the variation in the multivariate&#xD;
      OMICs-data (both metabolomics and 16S rRNA analysis of bacterial RNA), it is not possible to&#xD;
      perform an adequate power-calculation. There is a lack of consensus on how to best perform&#xD;
      power analysis for these OMICs-designs (and therefore also a lack of tools), although some&#xD;
      initiatives have been published. Power analysis is especially difficult in untargeted&#xD;
      metabolomics, where the number of variables are not a priori determined, where there is&#xD;
      strong multi-colinearity and where variables cannot be assumed to contribute with equal power&#xD;
      to effect size. Moreover, there is a shortage of relevant untargeted metabolomics and&#xD;
      microbiota study material on IBS x diet interactions from which to estimate relevant&#xD;
      parameters such as multivariate effect sizes and variance estimates, due to the surprisingly&#xD;
      few metabolomics studies on IBS and the total lack of publicly available raw data. However,&#xD;
      significant differences in the metabolome was previously observed in children with or without&#xD;
      diarrhea-dominant IBS (n=22 per group). Systematic differences were also shown in individual&#xD;
      metabolites in persons with IBS consuming either a high or low FODMAP diet (n≈20 per&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a cross-over design will be performed, which will increase the power compared&#xD;
      to parallel designs. Moreover, participants will be stratified with respect to subtype of IBS&#xD;
      (i.e. diarrhea, constipation and mixed). However, the investigators will not know in advance&#xD;
      how many IBS-metabotypes will be present in the material or the quantitative distribution&#xD;
      between the metabotypes. Therefore, 120 participants will be recruited to be able to observe&#xD;
      significant differences between dietary treatments, based on the assumptions that it will be&#xD;
      possible to identify around 4±1 metabotypes, and an approximate equal distribution between&#xD;
      metabotypes (≥20 persons per metabotype). In addition, a selection of 120 participants will,&#xD;
      under these conditions allow for 20% drop-out from the study, which is a high estimate based&#xD;
      on our previous experience from nutritional interventions. An important secondary outcome&#xD;
      from this study material is that it will give the opportunity to be used for power&#xD;
      calculations in future OMICs-studies where the effect sizes on both clinical parameters and&#xD;
      OMICs-measures are uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovery of IBS metabotypes Identification of metabotypes will be performed using&#xD;
      predominantly multivariate data analytical techniques. During initial analyses, molecular&#xD;
      phenotype data (metabolomics and microbiota) will be analyzed using unsupervised principal&#xD;
      component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to investigate whether data&#xD;
      self-aggregates into meaningful clusters. To adjust for between-individual variability and&#xD;
      focus on the effects of interventions, variance partitioning (sometimes referred to as ANOVA&#xD;
      decomposition) by individual will be performed. Clusters will be correlated with recorded&#xD;
      IBS/clinical data (IBS-SSS, bowel emptying diary) to examine whether emerging clusters&#xD;
      contain functional information in relation to IBS symptoms. Moreover, it is likely that&#xD;
      different clusters are not similarly reflected in plasma and fecal metabolomics and fecal&#xD;
      microbiota. To investigate to which extent the different clusters are associated with the&#xD;
      different omics blocks, a series of techniques for subdivision of variability into common and&#xD;
      distinct components will be applied to the unsupervised analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second line of unsupervised analysis, PCA and clustering analyses will be performed on&#xD;
      molecular phenotype aggregated with IBS/clinical data, which will have the potential to&#xD;
      influence clustering directly instead of investigating correlations afterwards. Again,&#xD;
      subdivision of variability into common and distinct components will be applied to examine how&#xD;
      clusters are reflected in the different data blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, supervised analyses will be used to directly associate molecular phenotype data&#xD;
      (independent variables) with IBS/clinical data (dependent variables) using in-house developed&#xD;
      partial least squares (PLS) and random forest (RF) techniques. These in-house techniques are&#xD;
      specifically adapted to identifying the most relevant set of independent variables to&#xD;
      describe the covariability with the dependent data (submitted manuscript). IBS/clinical data&#xD;
      can be used both as continuous multiple variables or directly by converting observations to&#xD;
      clusters. To examine how clusters and IBS/clinical data are reflected in the different omics&#xD;
      blocks, newly developed procedures to find common and distinct components in supervised&#xD;
      analysis will be applied (submitted manuscript).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression in these three approaches represent an increasing degree of supervision in&#xD;
      multivariate analysis. After all analyses, emerging clusters from the PCA and clustering&#xD;
      analyses and multivariate predictions from the PLS and RF analyses will further analyzed&#xD;
      using bioinformatics tools adapted to provide meaningful biological interpretation with the&#xD;
      aim to confirm correspondence between clusters and metabotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid diagnostic test of metabotypes After metabotypes have been identified, multivariate&#xD;
      predictive analysis of the mixed gluten/FODMAP exposure will be performed to identify&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers of metabotypes. These models will similarly as above be based on&#xD;
      in-house PLS and RF procedures using metabolomics data as independent variables and&#xD;
      metabotype classification per individual as dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma metabolic profiles will be analyzed regularly up to 4 hours post exposure and two&#xD;
      different approaches will be undertaken to address the time-trends in metabolic profiling: In&#xD;
      a first approach, time profiles will be converted to areas-under-the-curve per measured&#xD;
      metabolite feature through numerical integration. These values will then be used directly as&#xD;
      independent variables to give an indication of overall reflection of metabotype on metabolite&#xD;
      levels after exposure. However, this direct approach will not be able to take into&#xD;
      consideration potential differences in time-trends between metabotypes. Therefore, variance&#xD;
      partitioning hyphenated with supervised learning will be used to investigate metabotype x&#xD;
      time interactions. This approach will require method development in multivariate analysis,&#xD;
      which is currently underway in the R Landbergs research group and expected to be ready and&#xD;
      beta-tested during 2018, i.e. before data is available for analysis. This methodology is&#xD;
      projected to allow for simultaneous analysis of overall differences in metabolite levels&#xD;
      between treatments as well as differences in time profiles, thereby giving information also&#xD;
      on the most opportune time points to draw samples for effective prediction of metabotype x.&#xD;
