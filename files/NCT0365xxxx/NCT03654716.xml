    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a novel drug called ALRN-6924 as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      resistant (refractory) solid tumor, brain tumor, lymphoma or leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ALRN-6924&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine (for patients with leukemia only)&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, ALRN-6924, as a&#xD;
      potential new treatment for children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ALRN-6924 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that ALRN-6924 will be studied in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALRN-6924 is a drug that blocks certain proteins in tumor cells called MDM2 and MDMX. These&#xD;
      proteins may be important in the growth of some cancers. Laboratory experiments and results&#xD;
      from studies with adults show that ALRN-6924 may stop tumor growth and, in some cases, may&#xD;
      cause tumor cells to die. ALRN-6924 has been tested in adults with cancer to find out about&#xD;
      side effects and dosing in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate side effects of ALRN-6924 and to find the best dose of ALRN-6924 when used&#xD;
           in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine whether this drug may have benefits against the types of cancer seen in&#xD;
           children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to see how the body breaks down ALRN-6924 by measuring the amount of ALRN-6924 in the&#xD;
           blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One part of the study is for children with solid tumors, lymphoma, and brain tumors (Cohorts&#xD;
      A or B). Another part of this study is for children with leukemia (Cohort C).&#xD;
