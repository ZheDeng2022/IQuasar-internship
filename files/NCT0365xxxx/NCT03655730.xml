  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults in the United&#xD;
      States and the second leading cause in European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive disorders are consistently the most prevalent psychiatric disorder among&#xD;
      adolescents who attempt suicide with a prevalence ranging from 49% to 64%. Depression in&#xD;
      adolescent and young adults is a multifactorial phenomenon, as is the risk of suicidal&#xD;
      attempt. To address such problems, effective and accessible treatment is needed, as&#xD;
      recommended by the French Health Authority (HAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to demonstrate that a weekly psychotherapeutic intervention reduces&#xD;
      the depression level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary assessment criterion is the variation of the clinician Adolescent Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (ADRSc) from randomisation to month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims comparing in the 2 randomised groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADRS depression global score (clinician and subject) at 0, 3, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of suicidal attempts and self-harm attempts at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of drop-out at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck's Hopelessness Scale at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global score on the GHQ-28 and scores on the 4 subscales (Somatization, Anxiety and&#xD;
           Insomnia, Social dysfunction, Depressive mood) at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Working AIliance Inventory (WAI) score at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults in the United&#xD;
      States and the second leading cause in European countries. In France, recent epidemiological&#xD;
      data showed that the suicide rate in adolescents aged 15 to 19 is 4.1/100 000 inhabitants.&#xD;
      Prevalence of suicidal ideations ranges from 15 to 25% in the general population and lifetime&#xD;
      estimates of suicide attempts among adolescents range from 1.3 to 3.8% in males and from 1.5&#xD;
      to 10.1% in females. Reducing suicide and suicide attempts is therefore a key public health&#xD;
      target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive disorders are consistently the most prevalent psychiatric disorder among&#xD;
      adolescents who attempt suicide with a prevalence ranging from 49% to 64%. Depression in&#xD;
      adolescent and young adults is a multifactorial phenomenon, as is the risk of suicidal&#xD;
      attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being in a situation of failure at school or not having a clear training or work project&#xD;
      clearly increases the risk for depression. Some studies have targeted potential high school&#xD;
      drop outs as a target for prevention of suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address such problems, effective and accessible treatment is needed, as recommended by the&#xD;
      French Health Authority (HAS). However, only few studies assess, through a randomized&#xD;
      protocol, efficacity and feasibility of psychotherapeutic treatment in psychiatry in general&#xD;
      and particularly in this population, although individual psychotherapy is highly recommended&#xD;
      in clinical practice for depressed adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to demonstrate that a weekly psychotherapeutic intervention reduces&#xD;
      the depression level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary assessment criterion is the variation of the clinician Adolescent Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (ADRSc) from randomisation to month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others objectives are the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare in the 2 randomised groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADRS depression global score (clinician and subject) at 0, 3, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of suicidal attempts and self-harm attempts at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of drop-out at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck's Hopelessness Scale at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global score on the GHQ-28 and scores on the 4 subscales (Somatization, Anxiety and&#xD;
           Insomnia, Social dysfunction, Depressive mood) at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Working AIliance Inventory (WAI) score at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe, in the whole sample (randomised and not randomised),&#xD;
&#xD;
      - the baseline level of abuse during childhood with the CTQ. The effectiveness of reinsertion&#xD;
      activities (jobs, diploma, attendance to the Mission Locale) at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the sensitivity to change of the French version of the ADRSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      330 subjects wil be included to have 132 randomized subjects into two arms: sustained&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic intervention or usual care.&#xD;
