      Patients with hematologi¬cal malignancies are at increased risk of infections, not only&#xD;
      because of the malignancy itself, but also because of neutropenia induced by intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy and its cyto¬toxic effect on the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive fungal infection (IFI) causes morbidity and mortality among patients with&#xD;
      hematological malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of IFI has increased worldwide over the last two decades[2]. Major risk factors&#xD;
      for IFI include neutropenia &lt;500 neutrophils/ml for more than 10 days, bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation, prolonged (&gt;4 wk) treatment with corticosteroids; prolonged (&gt;7 days) stays&#xD;
      in intensive care, chemotherapy, HIV infection, invasive medical procedures, and the newer&#xD;
      immune suppressive agents. Other risk factors are malnutrition, solid organ transplantation,&#xD;
      severe burns and major surgery [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive candidiasis are the main invasive fungal diseases&#xD;
      associated with bloodstream Infections. Although invasive yeasts, such as Candida spp., and&#xD;
      molds, such as Aspergillus spp., are the predominant pathogens of IFIs, other uncommon and&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat molds, such as Mucorales, Fusarium spp., and phaeohyphomycetes, have&#xD;
      emerged in patients with hematological malignancies [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early initiation of the correct antifungal therapy has been demonstrated to have a direct&#xD;
      impact on the patient's outcome[5]. The increased use of antifungals has induced a higher&#xD;
      selective pressure on fungal strains and resistance has emerged in two main ways: several&#xD;
      species have developed secondary resistance and susceptible species have been replaced by&#xD;
      resistant ones,changing the epidemiology of fungal infections[6]. Among the most common&#xD;
      mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance are changes in the biosynthetic pathways targeted by&#xD;
      drugs [7]. Genomics technology and the use of DNA microarrays have facilitated the&#xD;
      identification of targets of novel antifungal drugs[8]. the molecular understanding of&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms may identify fungal genes with mutations associated with resistance.&#xD;
      Resistance mediated by alterations in Erg11/Cyp51 (targets of azoles) has been widely&#xD;
      documented, involving either mutations or upregulation of their genes in Candida or&#xD;
      Aspergillus species [9]. Up regulation of CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1 has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      azole-resistant C. albicans [10]. Genome sequencing can type known drug resistance mutations&#xD;
      , in some cases suggesting whether particular drugs will fail to control an infection .Whole&#xD;
      genome variants could be screened for point mutations in specific drug targets that are&#xD;
      highly correlated with resistance . for example , specific mutations in the target of azole&#xD;
      drugs [11] .or in the transcription factors that control the expression of drug efflux&#xD;
      transporters [12] can be identified from whole genome sequence data only in isolates that&#xD;
      display drug resistance [13]. There are two general approaches for genomic analysis of fungal&#xD;
      pathogens. One involves generation of a genome assembly de novo, such as for a species that&#xD;
      has not been previously sequenced and assembled. In the other approach, commonly termed&#xD;
      re-sequencing, variants are identified between an existing reference assembly and a sequenced&#xD;
      isolate via alignment of sequence reads to the reference. However, the choice of technology&#xD;
      selected to generate the sequence is influenced both by the approach selected and by the&#xD;
      goals of the study .[14]&#xD;
