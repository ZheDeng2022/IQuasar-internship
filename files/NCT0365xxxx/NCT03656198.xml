  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines work by stimulating the body to produce a high-quality, rapid and specific immune&#xD;
      response upon exposure to infection by a particular disease-causing microorganism - the&#xD;
      microorganism targeted by the vaccine. Evidence is emerging that some vaccines may have&#xD;
      additional 'non-specific effects' (NSEs); that is, effects on the immune system beyond the&#xD;
      direct protection against the diseases for which the vaccines were developed. It has been&#xD;
      proposed that rabies vaccine has protective NSEs in people and animals, with receipt of&#xD;
      rabies vaccine in children associated with a reduced risk of meningitis and cerebral malaria&#xD;
      in one study, and a history of rabies vaccination in free-roaming dogs associated with&#xD;
      increased survival rates in another study. Studies in mice have shown that prior rabies&#xD;
      vaccination protects against bacterial sepsis. The biological mechanism of action of any such&#xD;
      NSE of rabies vaccine is unknown. Other vaccines with reported protective NSEs (e.g. bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette-Guerin vaccine against tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis)&#xD;
      have been show to reprogram the immune system, leading to enhanced protection against&#xD;
      infection with disease-causing microorganisms unrelated to M. tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will test the hypothesis that rabies vaccine has non-specific protective&#xD;
      effects against common infectious disease (CID) syndromes (upper respiratory illness,&#xD;
      diarrhea and fever) in a population of veterinary students. We will randomly assign&#xD;
      previously-unvaccinated students who volunteer for the study to receive a primary course of&#xD;
      three injections of rabies vaccine (experimental group) or an identical course of three&#xD;
      injections of sterile water (control group). Participants will not know to which group they&#xD;
      have been assigned. We will ask all participants to report episodes of illness through an&#xD;
      online survey each week for 26 weeks, and will also record all clinically- and&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed cases of illness with CID syndromes. We hypothesize that rates of&#xD;
      self-reported new episodes of CID illness over 26 weeks will be at least 25% lower in the&#xD;
      experimental group, relative to the control group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The trial design is a single-site, two-arm, parallel-group, participant-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-sided comparative study, with an internal pilot study for blinded sample size re-estimation. Allocation to study arm will be by block randomization stratified by sex within cohort (semester) with a 1:1 allocation ratio.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will be blinded to their study arm allocation. The intervention procedure will be identical for both arms (intramuscular injections at Student Health Services on days 0, 7 and 21). Participants allocated to the control group will receive an intramuscular injection of sterile water for injection using identical syringes and needles as for the vaccine group. The injection will be prepared in a separate room to maintain participant blinding.</masking_description>

DIA is defined as three or more loose stools within a 24-hour period.&#xD;
UFI is defined as [fever (feeling feverish, or an axillary, oral or otic temperature of 100°F or higher)] and (not meeting the case definition of URI, ILI or DIA).&#xD;
To be defined as a new episode, illness must be preceded by at least one week without any CID.</description>
