  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trial is designed to allow revascularization and tissue engineering in necrotic teeth with&#xD;
      peripical lesion in a single visit approach. different disinfection protocols is used to&#xD;
      ensure that adequate disinfection of root canals is achieved to allow stem cells to&#xD;
      differentiate and proliferate generating pulp like tissue and turning back tooth to live with&#xD;
      periapical healing of resorbed bone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preservation of the natural dentition had always been a primary objective in endodontic&#xD;
      practice. When the pulp is diseased or requires removal for restorative reasons, it is&#xD;
      replaced with an artificial filling material during conventional root canal treatment. Root&#xD;
      canal treatment has lots of controversies, starting with weakening of remaining tooth&#xD;
      structure, affecting the tooth survival. Also Root canal treated teeth are considered to be&#xD;
      weaker than vital tooth, requiring the placement of a post and core, which itself is doubtful&#xD;
      whether it increases fracture resistance of the tooth or it weakens it.1 The most important&#xD;
      controversy is that the survival of affected pulp is hindered by the conventional root canal&#xD;
      treatment2. Thus a new treatment approach was introduced utilizing the body ability to&#xD;
      regenerate, called Pulp Regeneration. Regeneration was first introduced in the dental field&#xD;
      as a solution for immature apex treatment, as it is very difficult to treat them using the&#xD;
      conventional root canal treatment3 American Dental Association adopted the tissue engineering&#xD;
      concept and pulp regeneration in 20114. Regeneration was focused on the treatment of immature&#xD;
      necrotic teeth so as to allow root completion, improving both the functionality and&#xD;
      durability of the affected tooth. Depending on the success of pulp regeneration in treating&#xD;
      immature teeth, ambitious dentists started to look forward on treating mature teeth as a&#xD;
      substitution to the conventional root canal treatment. 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      A shift to tissue engineering took place. Utilizing a blood clot in the affected tooth with&#xD;
      immature roots was very beneficial, as it acts as a scaffold for the migration of stem cells&#xD;
      and morphogens to allow regeneration .6 On the other hand, lots of clinicians were very&#xD;
      doubtful about treating mature teeth with the same protocol, as the small apical foramen&#xD;
      might not provide a good portal for the entry of stem cells and growth factors, which in turn&#xD;
      is very important for the success of pulp regeneration.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      These doubts encouraged researchers to look for an alternative to the stem cells other than&#xD;
      the apical papilla, from this concept the idea for using an alternative source of stem cells&#xD;
      and growth factors as platelet rich plasma (PRP) emerged. The use of Platelet Rich Plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) as a potentially ideal scaffold for regenerative endodontic therapy has been&#xD;
      documented8. However, the use of bovine thrombin for the activation of PRP has been an issue&#xD;
      of controversy, as it requires non autologous anticoagulant known to hinder the process of&#xD;
      pulp regeneration 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to the development of the second generation, Platelet concentrate known as&#xD;
      Choukroun's Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) which is totally autologous in nature. Platelet rich&#xD;
      fibrin (PRF) was very promising, but it is debatable whether to use PRP or PRF10. One&#xD;
      protocol of the regenerative approach is the use of Antibiotic paste as intra canal&#xD;
      medicament in a 2 step procedures, due to the world wide trend of limitation of the use of&#xD;
      antibiotics systemically and locally the assessment of the outcome of single visit&#xD;
      regenerative approach is mandatory, and because the main limitation for such intervention is&#xD;
      adequate disinfection of root canal assessment of different asepsis maneuvers is also of&#xD;
      great importance since literature and evidence based information lack any studies assessing&#xD;
      such techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician at the end of this study must determine which disinfection protocol allows for&#xD;
      more survival of tooth, revitalization of the affected mature tooth and faster healing of&#xD;
      periapical lesion following one step regenerative approach. Healing will be measured using&#xD;
      digital radiography and cone beam computed topography11. Repair of the tooth neural&#xD;
      innervation will be tested by electric pulp tester12.&#xD;
