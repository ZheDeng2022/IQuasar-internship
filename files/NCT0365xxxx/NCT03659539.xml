  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic approach to laparoscopic surgery has greatly facilitated undertaking complex surgery&#xD;
      inside the abdominal cavity with ease. Robotic surgery is performed under general anaesthesia&#xD;
      (GA), which is commonly administered either via the inhalational route or intravenous route.&#xD;
      Currently, there is paucity of evidence regarding comprehensive patient outcome following&#xD;
      robotic transabdominal surgery. The limited data that is available is restricted to specific&#xD;
      outcome parameters such as hemodynamic profile, recovery times, and concomitant effects&#xD;
      (post-operative nausea vomiting, pain). QoR (quality of recovery)-15 is a patient self-&#xD;
      reported measurement of outcome to assess postoperative QoR. QoR-15 is a15-item questionnaire&#xD;
      that assess physical and mental well-being of the patient after anesthesia and surgery. It is&#xD;
      the first validated outcome assessment scale that has been evaluated using the&#xD;
      Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of health Measurements Instruments (COSMIN) and&#xD;
      fulfils the requirements for assessing QoR postoperatively. We plan to conduct this&#xD;
      randomized controlled-trial to evaluate postoperative QoR using the QoR-15 questionnaire in&#xD;
      patients undergoing robotic abdominal surgery under GA administered by routine techniques,&#xD;
      namely, closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) controlled total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol or inhalation anesthesia with desflurane.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advent of robotic approach to laparoscopic surgery has transformed the practice of&#xD;
      transabdominal procedures, especially those involving the pelvic region, such as,&#xD;
      prostatectomy, hysterectomy, among others. In-line with the advantages of robotic&#xD;
      intervention (greater access and precision), the type of patients who can undergo this&#xD;
      surgery has also evolved. Whereas, morbidly obese patients, who were not amenable to 'open'&#xD;
      or even 'laparoscopic' approach because of technical difficulties of gaining access to the&#xD;
      operative organ/area; can now safely undergo surgery because of high-fidelity and intuitive&#xD;
      robotic instrumentation. However, the robotic technique has its own share of concerns: first,&#xD;
      it is difficult for the anesthesiologists to access the patient once the robotic arms are&#xD;
      docked in position; and second, the extreme positioning (steep Trendelenberg,&#xD;
      anti-Trendelenberg position) required to successfully apply the technique may lead to undue&#xD;
      burden/adversity on patient's cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension),&#xD;
      respiratory (decreased lung compliance), and central nervous (elevated intracranial&#xD;
      pressures) systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, general anesthesia (GA) techniques employed for robotic surgery should be robust&#xD;
      and consistent. The common GA techniques, i.e. inhalational or a total intravenous anesthesia&#xD;
      (TIVA) can be used. Advantage of inhalation anesthesia is easy titration of the agent by&#xD;
      finely calibrated dial concentration control. In addition, the commonly used inhalation&#xD;
      anesthetics such as sevoflurane or desflurane rapidly achieve anesthetic brain concentration&#xD;
      and the effect can be efficiently reversed quickly upon discontinuation at the end of&#xD;
      surgery. TIVA with intravenous anesthetic like propofol is delivered by via simple or&#xD;
      target-controlled infusion pumps. Emerging evidence supports the use of propofol TIVA for it&#xD;
      may also proffer decreased incidence of postoperative nausea-and-vomiting, anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect, and anti-neoplastic action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence on beneficial effect of prolonged robotic surgery on postoperative patient&#xD;
      recovery are scanty, unstructured, and limited only to male patients undergoing radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy. For the want of a comprehensive patient assessment protocol, the available&#xD;
      outcome study has been able to focus on a limited number of parameters, including, changes in&#xD;
      intraocular pressure and the incidence of PONV/postoperative pain. Therefore, for knowing the&#xD;
      actual outcome effect of GA for robotic surgery, it is essential to analyze elaborate&#xD;
      quality-of-recovery from anesthesia based on compendious patients experiences rather than&#xD;
      concentrating on specific end-points (hemodynamic profile, recovery time, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15), a comprehensive patient-reported measure of quality of&#xD;
      post-anesthesia, is an abridged form of the expansive 40-item questionnaire (QoR-40) score.&#xD;
      QoR-15 assesses both physical and mental well-being of the patient after surgery under GA and&#xD;
      is easier to administer. QoR-15 is the first outcome assessment scale which has been&#xD;
      evaluated and validated using the consensus-based standards for the selection of health&#xD;
      measurements instruments (COSMIN) and fulfils the requirement for being an effective tool for&#xD;
      assessment of postoperative recovery/outcome in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is a paucity of evidence on comprehensive post-anesthesia outcome following major&#xD;
      robotic procedures and the choice of GA techniques employed for such procedures are subject&#xD;
      to random selection; we aim to undertake this randomized-controlled trial to assess&#xD;
      postoperative QoR with QoR-15 questionnaire in patients receiving anesthesia either by&#xD;
      propofol administration facilitated by automated closed-loop anesthesia delivery system&#xD;
      (CLADS) or desflurane inhalation.&#xD;
