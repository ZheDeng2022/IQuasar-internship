  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on&#xD;
      lactose maldigestion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary endpoint is defined as the difference in breath hydrogen concentration (BHC, ppm) in&#xD;
      lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo and non-inferiority in breath hydrogen&#xD;
      concentration (BHC, ppm) in probiotic group compared to lactase group, measured by the&#xD;
      incremental area under curve (iAUC) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the benefit of the investigational product (IP) the following secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath hydrogen peak value (ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative breath hydrogen (ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute gastrointestinal symptoms (severity or presence/absence to be defined on a Likert&#xD;
      scale) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flatulence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloating&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bowel movements and diarrhea (if present, stool consistency to be defined on Bristol&#xD;
           stool scale and number of bowel movements to be recorded)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline fasting BHC (ppm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath methane (CH4; ppm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath carbon dioxide (CO2; ppm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probiotic identification in feces before each lactose challenge by molecular methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gene test to determine lactase deficiency status at V1 (following single nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphism (SNP) variants to be screened: -13910*C (Europe, Central Asia, commonly&#xD;
           used) -13915*T (Saudi-Arabia, Africa), -14010*C (Africa), -13907*C (Africa))&#xD;
