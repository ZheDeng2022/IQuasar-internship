  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who&#xD;
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance&#xD;
      were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and&#xD;
      9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we&#xD;
      envisage using anlotinib plus docetaxel treat the EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation-negative advanced&#xD;
      nonsquamous Non-small cell lung cancer patients who were failure in the treatment of&#xD;
      chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to further improve the patient's PFS or OS.&#xD;

      This is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in China to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of Anlotinib Plus Docetaxel in patients of EGFR/ALK/ROS1&#xD;
      mutation-negative Advanced nonsquamous Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients on the anlotinib and docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous&#xD;
      infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to 14 of a 21-day&#xD;
      cycle. Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous&#xD;
      infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
