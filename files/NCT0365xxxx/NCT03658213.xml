    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 168 patients in approximately 20 study centres in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to examine whether ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot is&#xD;
      non-inferior to ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot in terms of the suppression rate of serum estradiol (E2)&#xD;
      to the menopausal level (≤30 pg/mL) from Week 4 through Week 24.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 168 patients in approximately 20 study centres in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open label, randomised, parallel group, multicentre study in Chinese pre menopausal&#xD;
      patients with ER+/HER2- early breast cancer will be conducted to determine whether 3 monthly&#xD;
      ZOLADEX 10.8 mg injection is non-inferior to monthly ZOLADEX 3.6 mg injection in terms of&#xD;
      estradiol (E2) suppression. The study will also assess the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of two difference strengths of ZOLADEX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients, as judged by the Investigator after completion of the screening tests,&#xD;
      will be registered for this study and at the same time randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      one of the following treatments. The study treatment must start within 7 days after&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot group: subcutaneous depot injection once every 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot group: subcutaneous depot injection once every 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine whether ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot is non-inferior to ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot in terms&#xD;
      of the suppression rate of serum estradiol (E2) to the menopausal level (≤30 pg/mL) from Week&#xD;
      4 through Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles of ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot and ZOLADEX&#xD;
           3.6 mg depot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the estradiol (E2) suppression by assessment of area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
           of E2 serum concentration during the 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the goserelin pharmacokinetics (PK) in Chinese patients after injection of&#xD;
           ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot and ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the influence on menstruous condition after injection of ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot&#xD;
           or ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the hormonal conditions after injection of ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot compared with&#xD;
           ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot.&#xD;
