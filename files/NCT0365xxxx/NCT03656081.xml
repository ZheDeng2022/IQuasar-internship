  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the therapeutic (clinical and radiological) efficacy of a six-month&#xD;
      treatment by itraconazole and nebulised Ambisome® (liposomal amphotericin B = LAmB) versus&#xD;
      treatment by itraconazole alone, in non - or mildly - immunocompromised patients affected by&#xD;
      Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (single aspergilloma excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Control arm: Itraconazole 200 mg x 2/day associated with inactive nebulised treatment twice&#xD;
      a week during 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Experimental arm: Itraconazole 200 mg x 2/day associated with nebulised LAmB, at 25 mg&#xD;
      twice a week during 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up duration for the patients will be 24 months (12 months minimum) after&#xD;
      discontinuation of the treatment being studied.&#xD;

    <measure>Composite efficacy criterion defined by the association of clinical improvement/stability and radiological improvement evaluated at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>• Clinical improvement or stability is evaluated using the Respiratory Symptom Score based on 6 items (cough, expectoration, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pain, and nocturnal awakening ) quoted with a 10 cm visual analogical scale).&#xD;
Stability is defined by a score variation between -25 and +25%, while improvement is defined by a decrease in score greater than 25%.&#xD;
• Radiological improvement is based on the analysis of CT-scan parameters (a committee consisting on two chest radiologists wil perform centrally and parallel analyses of each CT-scan blinded to the study treatment allocation to reach a final decision by consensus)&#xD;
The radiological improvement (binary variable) is defined by a consensual score based on the evolution of the various radiological parameters (cavity, fungus ball, alveolar condensation, nodules) according to validated thresholds.</description>
