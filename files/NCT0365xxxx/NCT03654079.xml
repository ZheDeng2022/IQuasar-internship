  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction is an important outcome in the evaluation and development of healthcare&#xD;
      services. Studies have identified tools that successfully measure women's childbirth&#xD;
      experiences, and have shown that multidimensional measures of women's satisfaction in labor&#xD;
      and delivery provides a richer and diverse perspective on women's experiences of intrapartum&#xD;
      care. Childbirth experience can have significant effects, both positive and negative, on&#xD;
      women's immediate and long term health outcomes. Patients with negative experiences&#xD;
      surrounding childbirth have been shown to have significant fear surrounding the labor and&#xD;
      delivery experience that negatively impact subsequent deliveries. Often fear is worsened by a&#xD;
      lack of knowledge of what to expect during labor. Women enrolled in this study will simulate&#xD;
      some of the potentially stressful experiences that commonly occur during labor to determine&#xD;
      if doing so decreases a woman's fear and anxiety about labor and delivery.&#xD;

      some of the potentially stressful experiences that commonly occur during labor to determine&#xD;
      if doing so decreases a woman's fear and anxiety about labor and delivery. Women in Centering&#xD;
      Pregnancy groups will be approached and assigned to either the intervention or control arm by&#xD;
      Centering Pregnancy group. Those in the intervention arm will participate in simulations in&#xD;
      the following areas: 1) In-Utero Resuscitation Simulation: the process that may occur if a&#xD;
      baby has a significant drop in heart rate during labor, 2) Cesarean Section Simulation: the&#xD;
      process of moving from the labor bed to the transport stretcher and on to the operating room&#xD;
      in the event that a laboring woman needs a cesarean delivery, 3) Pushing Simulation: the&#xD;
      pushing process after a laboring woman becomes completely dilated. Those in the control arm&#xD;
      will not receive this education. All patient will complete a modified Childbirth Experience&#xD;
      Questionnaire the day after delivery. Responses will be compared between the woman that&#xD;
      participated in the simulations to women who did not participate in simulations.&#xD;

    <measure>Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>After delivery, up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Childbirth Experience Satisfaction will be measured by the CEQ a 24 item questionnaire. For 19 of the items the response format is a 4-point Likert Scale and three of the items are assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS-scales scores were transformed to categorical values, 0-40 = 1, 41-60 = 2, 61-80 = 3 and 81-100 = 4. Total score 24-92. Higher scores indicate better childbirth experience</description>
