    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most prevalent disease affecting the Human beings, it is a complex&#xD;
      disease affecting teeth, which is caused by imbalance between demineralization and&#xD;
      remineralization process in the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive measures will stop the development of early caries lesions or even will direct the&#xD;
      progression of this early carious lesions towards remineralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, researchers have focused on non-invasive techniques to prevent early caries lesions&#xD;
      appearance. In recent years, a calcium and phosphate remineralization technology has been&#xD;
      introduced to decrease their incidence that relies on Casein Phospho-Peptide-Amorphous&#xD;
      Calcium Phosphate (CPP-ACP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex CPP-ACP derived from a milk protein called casein. CPP-ACP represents an&#xD;
      alternative remineralizing agent that prevents the early demineralization, it is capable of&#xD;
      stabilizing calcium phosphate, maintaining the supersaturation of these ions in the oral&#xD;
      environment by binding with them and transport them in the form of amorphous calcium&#xD;
      phosphate. They can enhance remineralization, decrease demineralization or even both in an&#xD;
      acid challenge to teeth surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPP-ACP with sodium fluoride 0.2% (900 ppm) that is very similar to the amount of fluoride in&#xD;
      the toothpaste binds to the tooth surfaces and plaque and provides biocompatible calcium,&#xD;
      phosphate and fluoride in a localized way. So, it provides all the ions needed to build&#xD;
      fluorapatite crystals that are more resistant to the acid attack compared to hydroxyapatite .&#xD;
      It also has a preventive role in the pH control as it might be able to improve pH levels in&#xD;
      different areas in the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early enamel demineralization is frequently observed as white spot lesions (WSLs) which are&#xD;
      opaque enamel areas created by mineral loss from the subsurface layer of enamel. These areas&#xD;
      are also defined as incipient or enamel caries. WSLs are the precursors for caries cavities&#xD;
      and their milky color may cause esthetic problems .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration that caries detection by eyesight is better for cavitated lesions&#xD;
      than for non-cavitated early lesions. Moreover, the visual examination is a subjective method&#xD;
      and so it has a lower reproducibility in detecting occlusal caries. Also, radiographic&#xD;
      examination has shown high specificity and poor sensitivity for non-cavitated lesions,&#xD;
      underestimating the lesion depth . Therefore, the detection of these early carious lesions&#xD;
      (WSL) in the initial stage with optimum efficiency achieved by a variety of technologies one&#xD;
      of them is the use of autofluorescence technique (VistaCam) for the early detection and&#xD;
      diagnosis of these 8 incipient lesions . Studies have shown that white spot lesions can take&#xD;
      only one month to develop .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VistaCam is an intraoral fluorescence camera that illuminates teeth with a violet light&#xD;
      (405 nm) and captures the reflected light as a digital image. Which is then is filtered&#xD;
      contains the green yellow fluorescence of normal teeth with a peak at 510 nm, as well as the&#xD;
      red fluorescence of bacterial metabolites with a peak at 680 nm. The software quantifies the&#xD;
      green and red fluorescent light on a scale from 0 to 3 as a ratio of red to green, showing&#xD;
      the areas with a higher than healthy tooth ratio .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although promising, investigations dealing with the effect of CPP-ACP products on plaque and&#xD;
      salivary pH levels and in the high caries risk patient appear to be limited and have not been&#xD;
      conducted in the form of randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of recommending a CPP-ACPF&#xD;
      product on salivary pH levels and measuring the amount of fluoride remains in the saliva&#xD;
      after using it in high caries risk patients, and also monitoring the prevention of new white&#xD;
      spot lesions during the use of CPP_ACP with and without fluoride by using the vistaCam as a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
