      This study are (1) to assess the relative bioavailability (BA) of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      either 5 mg of Levamlodipine Maleate Tablets from CSPC or 10 mg of Amlodipine Besylate Tablet&#xD;
      (NORVASC®) from Pfizer Inc. under fasting condition in male and female healthy subjects; and&#xD;
      (2) to evaluate food effect on the PK profile of Levamlodipine Maleate Tablets from CSPC.&#xD;

      This study consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will be a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover study to assess the&#xD;
      relative BA of levamlodipine maleate tablets from CSPC (Test) versus Amlodipine Besylate&#xD;
      Tablet NORVASC® from Pfizer Inc. (Reference) after a single oral administration under fasted&#xD;
      conditions in male and female healthy subjects. Approximately 32 healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the US to obtain 27 completed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be a single-arm, open-label, single-dose phase to assess food effect on the PK&#xD;
      profile of levamlodipine maleate tablets from CSPC. Subjects who have completed Part 1 will&#xD;
      be rolled over to Part 2 after a wash-out period for at least 14-days since the last dosing.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single oral administration of study drug under a high-fat /&#xD;
      high-calorie meal that should derive approximately 150, 250 and 500-600 calories from&#xD;
      protein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively.&#xD;
