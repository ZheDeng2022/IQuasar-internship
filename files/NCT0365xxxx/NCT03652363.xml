      A Placebo Controlled Randomised Trial of GDNF vs placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require patients to undergo surgery to implant microcatheters precisely into&#xD;
      the brain. Patients will then attend clinic on a 2 weekly basis for infusions of a nerve&#xD;
      growth factor called GDNF or placebo. Specific tests will also be carried out at regular&#xD;
      intervals to assess your symptoms. All participants will undergo radio-isotope brain imaging&#xD;
      at the beginning and end of the study. Periodically patients will also be required to undergo&#xD;
      an MRI scan to assess the delivery of the study drug or placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are considered likely to meet certain suitability criteria for this trial and&#xD;
      who provide fully informed consent to participate will have screening blood tests and&#xD;
      clinical assessments. As part of these assessments patients will be asked to stop their PD&#xD;
      medication overnight to allow us to assess the severity of their PD symptoms without the&#xD;
      benefit of medication on board. These assessments will answer if patients are eligible to&#xD;
      enter the trial. Some patients will not continue on with the trial following these&#xD;
      assessments. However, we will discuss with those patients alternative clinical care /&#xD;
      research options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are felt to be eligible for the trial following these assessments will undergo&#xD;
      brain surgery performed under general anaesthetic. During the surgery 4 tiny plastic infusion&#xD;
      tubes will be inserted into the putamen area of the brain, 2 on either side of the brain (two&#xD;
      in each putamen). These tubes connect to a single metal port that will come out (exit) from&#xD;
      under the skin behind the ear. This port can be accessed as needed from the outside and will&#xD;
      allow GDNF or placebo infusions to be given every 4 weeks directly into the putamen part of&#xD;
      the brain without requiring additional surgery or piercing of the skin (see Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 4 weeks after surgery patients will have an infusion of placebo / dummy drug&#xD;
      and an MRI to check the tubes and port system are working well enough to allow infusions of&#xD;
      either GDNF or placebo (further details below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be required to attend NBT in order to have either GDNF or placebo infusions&#xD;
      given through the port and down the tiny plastic tubes into the putamen every 4 weeks for a&#xD;
      total of 9 months (10&#xD;
&#xD;
      infusions in total). Neither the patient nor the research team will know whether patients are&#xD;
      receiving GDNF or placebo / dummy infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some of these visits, patients will again be asked to stop their PD medication the night&#xD;
      before. By doing this, it will be possible to assess potential reversal of symptoms compared&#xD;
      with before the start of brain infusion treatments.During the course of this trial patients&#xD;
      will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans at another hospital on two or&#xD;
      three occasions to look for evidence of damaged brain cell recovery. This trial is therefore&#xD;
      time-consuming and this will be made clear to you before seeking your consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that this trial will help clarify whether GDNF does indeed have the potential to&#xD;
      reverse Parkinson's disease and restore parts of the brain. It must be understood, however,&#xD;
      that even if the trial yields positive results, further testing will be required in a larger&#xD;
      number of patients to meet the requirements of the health authorities prior to GDNF being&#xD;
      available over the long term or routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this trial will involve some risks to patients. These risks are described in&#xD;
      detail later in this document and will be discussed with you before you give informed&#xD;
      consent. When the trial ends the information collected from participants will be used to&#xD;
      produce reports for scientific journals, and will be presented at scientific meetings so that&#xD;
      doctors and scientists around the world will better understand the potential brain restoring&#xD;
      and disease reversing effects of GDNF in PD.&#xD;
