    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate how dairy products with different structures&#xD;
      and textures affect lipid absorption kinetics in the acute postprandial period via blood&#xD;
      lipid biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized acute cross-over meal study. Apparently healthy&#xD;
      men will be recruited in the study. They will on 4 test days consume the 4 dairy products and&#xD;
      blood will be drawn the following 8 hours.&#xD;

      The overall aim of this study is to investigate how dairy products with similar nutrient&#xD;
      content but different structures and textures affect lipid absorption kinetics in the acute&#xD;
      postprandial period via blood lipid biochemistry, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#xD;
      and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized acute cross-over meal study. On four different&#xD;
      test days (with a minimum of 2 weeks washout period) four dairy products with similar&#xD;
      nutrient composition but different structures or textures will be tested. During each meal&#xD;
      test a single dairy product (+ bread and water) is served and postprandial blood samples are&#xD;
      collected the following 8 hours. Subjective appetite measurements (VAS) are filled in during&#xD;
      the 8-hour period and an ad libitum meal is served in the end of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 apparently healthy men (weight stable, 18-40 years, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) will be recruited.&#xD;
