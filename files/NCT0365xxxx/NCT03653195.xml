  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of sport related concussions (SRC) occur yearly in the United States, and current&#xD;
      diagnosis of concussion is based upon largely subjective clinical evaluations. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether urinary metabolites are significantly altered post SRC.&#xD;
      Urine of 26 athletes will be analyzed pre-injury and after SRC by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed using multivariate statistics, pairwise t-test, and metabolic pathway&#xD;
      analysis. Variable Importance Analysis based on random Variable Combination (VIAVC) was used&#xD;
      to select what features are present out of 224 features. Partial least squares discriminant&#xD;
      analysis was performed leading to separation between pre-season and post-SRC groups. A&#xD;
      Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) curve will be constructed to classify the features. Pathway&#xD;
      topology analysis will also be completed to determine biological pathways are potentially&#xD;
      affected following SRC.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sport concussion or sport-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects patients across&#xD;
      the spectrum of age, race and gender. It is a medical problem that if not treated&#xD;
      appropriately can have devastating outcomes to patients and families. MTBI or concussion&#xD;
      (terminology used interchangeably in this proposal) more recently has been a hot topic in the&#xD;
      media with high profile politicians and athletes having career altering outcomes following a&#xD;
      concussion. According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, sports and&#xD;
      recreational activities were the third leading cause of TBI admissions in Canadian hospitals&#xD;
      in 2003-2004. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates&#xD;
      that 1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur in sports and recreational activities annually. In&#xD;
      Calgary, approximately 10,000 patients were seen in the emergency departments with a head&#xD;
      injury in 2013, 80% of which were diagnosed as mTBI and a vast majority of these were sport&#xD;
      related (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no single &quot;gold standard&quot; assessment or diagnostic marker to objectively&#xD;
      determine if a patient has suffered a sport concussion and if so, how long it will take to&#xD;
      recover. As such, concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on post-traumatic symptoms,&#xD;
      physical signs, and impairment in cognitive function, which at best is done by a trained and&#xD;
      experienced medical professional. But, this is primarily a qualitative, individualized&#xD;
      approach to diagnosing and is typically clouded by a lack of objective clinical findings.&#xD;
      Other assessment tools can aid a clinician in diagnosing a concussion such as the Sport&#xD;
      Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) (Appendix 1), but unfortunately this has not been&#xD;
      validated and was developed based on expert consensus. As well, computerized&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing may help with the assessment of concussion recovery; however it is&#xD;
      expensive, time consuming and has recently been criticized as lacking specificity and&#xD;
      sensitivity for head injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 20 years researchers have studied biomarkers such as S100B and neuron-specific&#xD;
      enolase in hopes of finding a quantitative approach to diagnosing and prognosticating&#xD;
      concussion. This unfortunately, has met with much disappointment as none of these markers, in&#xD;
      and of themselves, has adequate specificity or sensitivity to be used as a single biomarker&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics is defined as &quot;the quantitative measurement of the metabolic response of living&#xD;
      systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification&quot; and is based on analytical&#xD;
      platforms such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) and/or mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. Metabolomic studies of clinically accessible bio-fluids, such as blood and&#xD;
      urine, provides an intricate and relatively non-invasive snapshot into this response. To&#xD;
      date, metabolomics has been shown to be a useful biomarker tool in amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neonatal hypoxic ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy, brain cancer, multiple sclerosis, aging and neurodegenerative disease,&#xD;
      epilepsy, stroke, severe traumatic brain injury and pediatric septic shock. To the best of&#xD;
      our knowledge, no study has assessed quantitative metabolomic profiling as a diagnostic and&#xD;
      prognosticating tool in sport concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study would aid in the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of testing metabolomics in the sport concussion population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The first study of its kind to use quantitative metabolic profiling to assist with the&#xD;
           diagnosis of acute sport concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The first study of its kind to develop a metabolic &quot;fingerprint&quot; that may help&#xD;
           prognosticate recovery in acute sport concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to provide an mid-stream urine sample between 7-9 am at pre-injury and&#xD;
      post-concussion. Urine aliquots will be obtained immediately by centrifuge and then stored at&#xD;
      -80C until required for analysis. Once all samples are collected they will be batched and&#xD;
      transported to the University of Lethbridge for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No samples for metabolomic analysis will undergo a previous freeze/thaw cycle. An aliquot of&#xD;
      450 μl will be removed from each of the urine samples and added to 250 μl of buffer solution.&#xD;
      The buffer solution will be prepared using a potassium phosphate solution at 0.5M and pH 7.4&#xD;
      ± 0.04. This buffer solution also contains 10 mL of sodium azide which acts as an&#xD;
      antimicrobial agent. The solvent for the buffer will 1 part D2O to 4 parts normal water and&#xD;
      the D2O contains 0.05 weight percent of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP).&#xD;
      The final concentration of TSP will be used as an internal chemical shift and quantification&#xD;
      standard. The buffer/urine solution is then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for five minutes to&#xD;
      remove any particulate matter, large fats, or large proteins and 500 μl is pipetted into 5mm&#xD;
      NMR tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All NMR spectra will be obtained on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 700 MHz spectrometer (Bruker&#xD;
      BioSpin Ltd., Milton, ON, Canada) equipped with a high-throughput sample changer platform, a&#xD;
      triple resonance (TBO) 5mm probe and TopSpin 3.2 software. Each sample will be acquired using&#xD;
      the standard Bruker 1D pre-saturation pulse sequence (noesygppr1d) with a mixing time of 10&#xD;
      ms, an acquisition time of 5 seconds, a recycle delay of 4 seconds and a total of 512 scans.&#xD;
      Each sample will then be processed with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial processing in TopSpin 3.2, all spectra will be loaded into matNMR (24),&#xD;
      correctly referenced by setting the TSP shift to 0 ppm, and exported into the Matlab ®&#xD;
      workspace for further processing. The spectra will then be binned using a dynamic adaptive&#xD;
      binning (DAB) method that has been coded for the Matlab environment. This DAB method deals&#xD;
      with any movement in spectral lines from spectra to spectra, which can be caused by slight&#xD;
      variation in pH from sample to sample (pH = 7.4 ± 0.04), and ensures that peaks from the same&#xD;
      metabolite are not broken apart into different bins. After spectral binning, the spectra will&#xD;
      be normalized, with water and urea excluded from the normalization, and Pareto scaled (26).&#xD;
      The normalized and scaled spectra will then be analyzed using principal component analysis&#xD;
      (PCA) and Partial Least Squared Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The loadings plot of these&#xD;
      two methods will be used for identifying the outlying bins. The chemical shift range&#xD;
      associated with these outlying bins will then be compared to an established metabolite&#xD;
      library in order to determine which metabolites have variation across comparison groups&#xD;
      (concussion and pre-injury). Eretic tool in the TopSpin 3.2 software will be used to&#xD;
      determine the quantitative changes in the concentration of these metabolites. This&#xD;
      quantification of the concentration is based on the known internal concentration of TSP in&#xD;
      our NMR samples. A Mann Whitney U test for metabolic analysis and a Fisher exact test for the&#xD;
      categorical data will be performed.&#xD;
