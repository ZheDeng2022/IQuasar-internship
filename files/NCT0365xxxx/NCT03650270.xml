    <textblock>
      Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is a potentially devastating condition which can result&#xD;
      in significant morbidity and mortality. Studies addressing status epilepticus in children are&#xD;
      rare and there is a paucity of large randomised controlled trials in children looking at&#xD;
      forms of drug treatment for SE. There is consistency worldwide in guidelines for first line&#xD;
      treatment of CSE with benzodiazepines, with slight variations in type and route of&#xD;
      administration of agents. Second line therapy usually entails phenobarbital or phenytoin&#xD;
      parenterally. Both repeated phenobarbital loading doses and midazolam infusions have been&#xD;
      shown to be effective and safe in the management of established convulsive SE, but there are&#xD;
      no prospective randomized controlled trials comparing the two in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study has been undertaken to review 2 existing, and routinely used, interventions for&#xD;
      children presenting to our center with acute convulsive seizures. In order to permit&#xD;
      comparable data to be collected we are randomly allocating these standard interventions&#xD;
      prospectively. This is in order to compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment protocols&#xD;
      (phenobarbital vs phenytoin and midazolam) both of which as stated are already part of&#xD;
      existing standard protocols internationally and in South Africa. Parenteral phenobarbital is&#xD;
      a safe, affordable and easy to use drug in the management of status epilepticus especially&#xD;
      for poorly resourced communities where undertaking infusions may be unsafe, time consuming or&#xD;
      unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that repeated phenobarbital loading is as effective and safe, or more so, than&#xD;
      phenytoin followed by midazolam infusion in the management of established and refractory&#xD;
      childhood convulsive SE. If proven, then the former would be a viable option for all health&#xD;
      care workers with access to intravenous routes (including Day hospitals) where infusions are&#xD;
      unsafe, time consuming or unavailable.&#xD;

      This prospective study was conducted at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital&#xD;
      (RCWMCH) and recruitment ran from between March 2015 to March 2018. All patients presenting&#xD;
      with convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) who presented to the medical emergency unit at&#xD;
      RCWMCH and needed therapeutic intervention were entered into the study by the attending&#xD;
      medical staff. Study data was collected using REDCap hosted by the University of Cape Town's&#xD;
      eResearch Centre and the study was approved by the UCT Human Research Ethics Council (UCT&#xD;
      HREC 297/2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions The definition of CSE was defined as any convulsive seizure that lasted longer&#xD;
      than five minutes or multiple discrete seizures between which there is no extended period of&#xD;
      recovery between events (Trinka et al., 2015). The onset of CSE was defined as the time&#xD;
      provided by the caregiver who accompanied the child. The time to admission and to treatment&#xD;
      were recorded by the staff in the unit. If children were admitted multiple times, each&#xD;
      admission was captured independently, but only data from the first admission was included in&#xD;
      this report . The full diagnosis of CSE was described using the multiaxial classification&#xD;
      system. However, as it was not possible to perform EEG on all patients, this axes was&#xD;
      excluded. Febrile status epilepticus was defined .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocols Upon entry into the study, children were randomly allocated to one of two&#xD;
      protocols . Both these protocols are well-established treatment protocols used in the&#xD;
      sub-Saharan African setting for the management of SE . Randomization of protocols was&#xD;
      performed using a free online platform (Research Randomizer Â©). Both protocols began with&#xD;
      children receiving first-line benzodiazepines (either midazolam, lorazepam or diazepam) which&#xD;
      were either administered intravenously (IV), per rectally, intranasally or sublingually. If&#xD;
      the children did not respond to single dose of benzodiazepines, they were given a second dose&#xD;
      5-10 minutes after the first dose. Pre-hospital administration of benzodiazepines by&#xD;
      emergency services were counted if administered intravenously. However, all other routes of&#xD;
      administration were not counted due to the lack of consistency in their administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CSE continued after two doses of benzodiazepines, children were then randomized to&#xD;
      second-line agents according to the protocol allocated to them. The one protocol, termed&#xD;
      'Phenobarbital' (PHB), instructed the clinician to give giving an IV bolus of phenobarbital&#xD;
      (20mg/kg ). If CSE did not terminate after 5 - 10 minutes, a second dose was given at half&#xD;
      the dosage (10mg/kg) and a third dose (10mg/kg) was given if CSE persisted 5-10 minutes after&#xD;
      that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second protocol, termed 'Phenytoin / Midazolam infusion' (PHY/MDZ), children were&#xD;
      given a dose (20mg/kg) of IV phenytoin mixed with 50mL of normal saline solution and&#xD;
      administered over 30 minutes . If the patient was still in CSE 5-10 minutes after the&#xD;
      phenytoin was given, they were then started on a midazolam infusion. This included a loading&#xD;
      dose of IV midazolam (0.2mg/kg) followed by an infusion set at 3mg/kg into 50mL 5% dextrose&#xD;
      water given at a rate of 1-4 mL/hour (equivalent to 1-4 mcg/kg/min ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient child did not respond to the PHB or the PHY/MDZ protocols, they were referred to&#xD;
      the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Other reasons for admission to the PICU included&#xD;
      respiratory depression following administration of the second-line agent, need for inotropic&#xD;
      support, etiology-related concerns requiring intensive monitoring (e.g. severe electrolyte&#xD;
      imbalances) and or prolonged state of a depressed level of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data inclusive of age, sex, etiologies, pre-existing medications, previous&#xD;
      medical conditions and co-morbidities were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures In comparing the two treatment protocols, we will only focused on the&#xD;
      short-term outcomes of the children in each treatment protocol. These include how the agents&#xD;
      affected the children's physiology, admission to PICU, whether subsequent breakthrough&#xD;
      seizures occurred and days admitted to hospital. In measuring the effects on the children's&#xD;
      physiology, their we will calculate heart rate, respiratory rate and mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      from during CSE to immediately post-ictal period. This will be done by subtracting the first&#xD;
      measurement as the child presented to the unit from the first measurement taken immediately&#xD;
      after the child had stopped convulsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis During the analysis, the investigator performing the analysis was blinded to&#xD;
      which protocol the patients children were allocated to. Group allocations will only be&#xD;
      unblinded after statistical analysis is completed and verified by an external party. Data&#xD;
      will analysed using SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp. Released 2016, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM&#xD;
      Corp). Statistical measurements will be performed using both SPSS Statistics and GraphPad&#xD;
      Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). For continuous data normality will be established&#xD;
      using the Shapiro-Wilk test and thereafter parametric (i.e. paired or unpaired student's&#xD;
      t-tests) or nonparametric tests (i.e. Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) will&#xD;
      be performed. Normally distributed data will be reported as mean standard deviation. Data&#xD;
      that is not normally distributed will be reported as median with the interquartile range&#xD;
      (IQR). Categorical data will be summarized in contingency tables with differences between&#xD;
      groups being identified using the Fisher-exact or chi-squared (X2) tests and associations&#xD;
      calculated using odds ratios (OR). Significance will be defined as a p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
