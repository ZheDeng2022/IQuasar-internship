    <textblock>
      Background: Childhood epilepsy disorders are particular frequent in the area around Mahenge,&#xD;
      southern Tanzania and recent studies have described a novel type of epilepsy with repetitive&#xD;
      head nodding episodes and often progressive cognitive dysfunction. Despite the disease&#xD;
      affecting thousands in Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan, etiology and pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      disorder termed Nodding Syndrome (NS) is still obscure as the phenotype remains imprecisely&#xD;
      described. Epidemiological associations with Onchocerca volvulus and Mansonella spp. were&#xD;
      noted at different African sites and remain robust even though no evidence for the presence&#xD;
      of O. volvulus in CSF or any previous contact with the CSF was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: With regard to the complex host immune reaction to O. volvulus, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the immune response against filariae might contribute to NS and epilepsy.&#xD;
      The investigators further assume that specific genetic traits might play a role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims In the present study the investigators aim to examine if and how O. volvulus and/or&#xD;
      Mansonella spp. contribute to the pathology of NS/epilepsy and therefore intend to analyze&#xD;
      the filarial infection and the host immune response in affected children. To identify&#xD;
      inherited traits predisposing for epilepsy, NS or specific immune responses, a genetic workup&#xD;
      that includes whole-exome sequencing (WES) is performed. The clinical and EEG characteristics&#xD;
      are further defined. Cognitive impairment of people with epilepsy and NS is assessed using&#xD;
      the Wechsler Nonverbal Scale of Ability (WNV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cross-sectional observational (groups I-III) and a case-control (groups I-V)&#xD;
      study recruiting in total 250 patients and controls (I: people with NS, n=50; II: people with&#xD;
      epilepsy (PWE) and onchocerciasis, n=50; III: PWE without onchocerciasis, n=50; IV: controls&#xD;
      with onchocerciasis but otherwise healthy, n= 50; healthy controls without evidence for&#xD;
      onchocerciasis, n= 50) is performed to describe the clinical characteristics in children with&#xD;
      NS/epilepsy and to evaluate differences in infection and immune response between groups,&#xD;
      respectively. The WNV should be validated in 500 healthy controls to obtain reference data in&#xD;
      rural Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: In summary, the study aims to elucidate clinical characteristics and the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of NS/epilepsy in children of southern Tanzania and role of parasitic infection&#xD;
      as a cause for NS/epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood epilepsy disorders are particular frequent in low income countries and especially&#xD;
      common in the area around Mahenge, Ulanga region, southern Tanzania, with an epilepsy&#xD;
      prevalence of up to 39 per 1000 inhabitants. Therefore, in 1959 Prof. Louise Jilek-Aall&#xD;
      founded the Mahenge Epilepsy Clinic to provide basic care to people suffering from convulsive&#xD;
      disorders and to enable further in-depth investigations regarding epilepsy. In the summer of&#xD;
      2005, a multinational a team of researchers including the founder of the clinic, Prof. Louise&#xD;
      Jilek-Aall, Prof. Erich Schmutzhard, Dr. Andrea Winkler and Prof. William Matuja performed&#xD;
      several in-depth etiological investigations. In intensive field research they were able to&#xD;
      examine a large number of clinic patients and healthy controls, perform&#xD;
      electro-encephalographic and magnetic resonance studies and collect biological materials,&#xD;
      such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and skin samples for further sophisticated&#xD;
      laboratory tests in Europe. Among others, the studies confirmed the presence of a new type of&#xD;
      childhood epilepsy with repetitive head nodding episodes and often progressive cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Even though the disease termed Nodding Syndrome (NS) affects thousands in&#xD;
      Tanzania, Uganda and South-Sudan, clinical, metabolic and EEG phenotypes are still&#xD;
      imprecisely described, and etiology and pathogenesis remain obscure. The high familial&#xD;
      occurrence and clustering within circumscribed villages and tribes suggests that genetic&#xD;
      traits might play a role. Epidemiological associations with Onchocerca volvulus and&#xD;
      Mansonella spp. were noted at different African sites. Despite lacking evidence for the&#xD;
      presence of O. volvulus in the CSF the association to NS remains robust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is basis for the present study where the investigators aim to examine if and how O.&#xD;
      volvulus and/or Mansonella spp. contribute to the pathology of NS, elucidate associated&#xD;
      genetic traits, further specify the clinical, metabolic and EEG phenotypes. The investigators&#xD;
      will use a cross-sectional observational design including children with NS and epilepsy in&#xD;
      order to describe the clinical characteristics and a case-control design to evaluate&#xD;
      associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to enroll 250 patients and controls between 3 and 18 years of age (I: people&#xD;
      with NS, n=50 (inclusion according to the WHO case definition from the first &quot;International&#xD;
      Conference on Nodding Syndrome&quot;, Kampala, Uganda, July 2012); II: people with epilepsy (PWE)&#xD;
      and onchocerciasis, n=50; III: PWE without onchocerciasis, n=50; IV: controls with&#xD;
      onchocerciasis but otherwise healthy, n= 50; healthy controls without evidence for&#xD;
      onchocerciasis, n= 50). Patients with cardiovascular or renal comorbidities, a history of&#xD;
      birth or traumatic brain injuries, lacking or withdrawing consent will be excluded. Groups II&#xD;
      to V will be matched to Group I for age, gender and social status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to analyze the filarial infection and host immune response in&#xD;
      affected children compared to unaffected controls. PCR assays will be performed to&#xD;
      characterize Onchocerca and Mansonella spp. strains found in patients with NS/PWE and&#xD;
      determine Wolbachia loads and features. A novel unique biomarker,&#xD;
      N-acetyltyramine-O,ÃŸ-glucuronide (NATOG) will be determined to quantify infection with O.&#xD;
      volvulus and correlated with other markers that define the host immune response and immune&#xD;
      regulation (e.g. regulatory T cells (Treg), cytokines). As polymorphisms in the&#xD;
      multidrug-resistance gene 1 (MDR-1) that alter p-glycoprotein expression or function may&#xD;
      enhance neurotoxicity of widely used antihelmintic drugs, single nucleotide polymorphism&#xD;
      (SNP)-arrays will be determined to investigate if specific polymorphisms might be associated&#xD;
      with NS. In addition, the investigators aim to define the clinical picture and course of NS&#xD;
      and conduct further EEG investigations and validated neuropsychological tests, follow up&#xD;
      patients of previous studies and perform metabolic analyses to specify the metabolic&#xD;
      characteristics of NS. A genetic workup that includes whole-exome sequencing (WES) to&#xD;
      identify traits predisposing to epilepsy, NS or specific immune responses is scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the study aims to elucidate factors that contribute to the high prevalence of NS&#xD;
      and epilepsy in the Mahenge area in Southern Tanzania. Also, the research project will have&#xD;
      immediate benefits for the population under investigation as people newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      epilepsy will be offered treatment at the Mahenge Epilepsy Clinic and staff, patients and&#xD;
      relatives will receive further education regarding epilepsy, thereby contributing to&#xD;
      sustainability of a standardized approach to care for children with NS and PWE. Conclusions&#xD;
      drawn from our study will not only relate to the Mahenge area, but may be applicable to vast&#xD;
      numbers of children with NS (northern Uganda and South Sudan) and PWE in other areas.&#xD;
      Dissemination of the data through scientific meetings and publications may stimulate further&#xD;
      research regarding risk factors for epilepsy in the low income countries.&#xD;

      To further describe the clinical features of NS, a complete physical and neurological&#xD;
      examination in patients with NS and controls is performed at the Mahenge Epilepsy Clinic. All&#xD;
      individuals will have to undergo sampling of blood and skin snips from at least two different&#xD;
      areas of the body, one of which must be close to the head. Time expenditure for the&#xD;
      individual participant is estimated with 60 min (Introduction of the study, consent, skin&#xD;
      snip, lumbar puncture and venipuncture) extended for about 60 minutes if EEG recordings are&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
