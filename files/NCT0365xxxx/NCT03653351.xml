      The aim of the current research is to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      to improve cognitive function in individuals with anxiety, depression and/or cognitive&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive difficulties are a common problem in the older adult population. Previous&#xD;
      research has shown memory complaints are higher in older adults with depression or anxiety&#xD;
      versus those without these diagnoses. This suggests that mood symptoms, or a diagnosis of a&#xD;
      mood disorder, may represent significant predictors of cognitive impairment. If left&#xD;
      untreated, symptoms of depression and memory complaints may lead to greater cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, i.e. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and diagnosis of dementia. Therefore, early&#xD;
      interventions are urgently needed to prevent decline in memory and cognitive function in&#xD;
      individuals with MCI, depression and/or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideal interventions for the older aged population would be those that are easily accessible&#xD;
      and associated with minimal burden on family members, the healthcare system and the&#xD;
      individuals themselves. Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) therapy and Transcranial&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) are two interventions that may be effective in targeting&#xD;
      cognitive deficits in individuals with anxiety, depression and/ or cognitive complaints. MBSR&#xD;
      has been shown to decrease symptoms of depression and improve cognition and tDCS has been&#xD;
      shown to improve cognition in the older aged population. The effectiveness of these two&#xD;
      interventions combined to elicit changes in cognition has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore,&#xD;
      the overall aim of the current research is to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of MBSR&#xD;
      and tDCS to improve cognitive function in individuals with anxiety, depression and/or&#xD;
      cognitive complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized pilot study. Sixteen individuals (separated into 2 groups of 8)&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a combination of MBSR + active tDCS or MBSR + sham tDCS over 8&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will visit the Healthy Mind Lab once per week for in-class group sessions&#xD;
      and will complete the intervention daily at home for the duration of the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be aged 60 and older with cognitive complaints, with or without symptoms of anxiety&#xD;
      and/or depression. Participants will be trained to self-administer tDCS and given guidelines&#xD;
      for the completion of daily MBSR activities at home. It is hypothesized that the combination&#xD;
      of active tDCS+MBSR will enhance cognition compared to the combination of sham tDCS + MBSR.&#xD;

    <description>NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Composite Score: provides a global assessment of general fluid cognition functioning. Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive functioning. A score at or near 100 indicates ability that is average compared with others nationally. Scores around 115 suggest above-average cognitive ability, while scores around 130 suggest superior ability ( in the top 2 percent nationally). Conversely, a score around 85 suggests below-average cognitive ability and a score in the range of 70 or below suggests significant impairment, which may also be indicative of difficulties in general functioning.&#xD;
Fluid abilities are used to solve problems, think and act quickly, and encode new episodic memories. They are presumed to be especially influenced by biological processes and are less dependent on past exposure (learning experiences).&#xD;
There is only one primary outcome. No secondary outcomes were reported.</description>

        <title>Cognitive and Memory Function</title>
        <description>NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Composite Score: provides a global assessment of general fluid cognition functioning. Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive functioning. A score at or near 100 indicates ability that is average compared with others nationally. Scores around 115 suggest above-average cognitive ability, while scores around 130 suggest superior ability ( in the top 2 percent nationally). Conversely, a score around 85 suggests below-average cognitive ability and a score in the range of 70 or below suggests significant impairment, which may also be indicative of difficulties in general functioning.&#xD;
Fluid abilities are used to solve problems, think and act quickly, and encode new episodic memories. They are presumed to be especially influenced by biological processes and are less dependent on past exposure (learning experiences).&#xD;
There is only one primary outcome. No secondary outcomes were reported.</description>

Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of neurostimulation (also known as neuromodulation) where very low levels of direct electrical current are delivered to specifically targeted areas of the brain, in order to increase neuroplasticity. The direct current in active tDCS will be of 2 milliampere (mA) (current density = 0.57 A/m2), however, the device is pre-programmed to turn off after 1 minute of active stimulation (and then turn back on briefly at the end of the 30 minutes).</description>

Most of the adverse events in this study were mild and transient. They included tingling, itching, pain and redness on the scalp, and headaches. Three participants reported worsening of their depressive symptoms; however, this did not lead them to discontinue the study. There were no safety issues associated with tDCS. Adherence with tDCS administration and in-class attendance were comparable in the sham and active groups, suggesting that active tDCS did not cause adverse effects or discomfort associated with non-adherence.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Some of the strengths of this feasibility study were a broad range of outcome measures assessing mindfulness, but also cognition, anxiety, depression, and social function; and the length and duration of the tDCS stimulation (10 weeks) that was longer than in most previous studies. The main limitation was the small sample size, which increases the likelihood of both false negative and false positive findings.</limitations_and_caveats>
