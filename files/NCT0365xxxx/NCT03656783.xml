  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single pill regimen that was&#xD;
      approved by the FDA in February 2018 for treatment of HIV. The marketed name of the drug is&#xD;
      Biktarvy. In two phase 3 comparative clinical trials, including one with ABC/3TC/DTG, it was&#xD;
      found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens in terms of virologic outcomes.&#xD;
      B/F/TAF was also well tolerated, with few discontinuations for adverse events. As a result,&#xD;
      B/F/TAF is an ideal non-abacavir containing regimen to assess the effect of removing ABC on&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows precise and reproducible quantification of&#xD;
      myocardial blood flow, thereby providing a direct assessment of coronary vascular health.&#xD;
      Coronary flow reserve (CFR, calculated as the ratio of peak hyperemic myocardial blood flow&#xD;
      over that at rest) is emerging as a powerful quantitative prognostic imaging marker of&#xD;
      clinical cardiovascular risk. CFR provides a robust and reproducible clinical measure of the&#xD;
      integrated hemodynamic effects of epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD), diffuse&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, vessel remodeling, and microvascular dysfunction resulting from endothelial&#xD;
      cell dysfunction on myocardial tissue perfusion across the entire coronary circulation. These&#xD;
      processes have direct relevance to the underlying vascular pathobiology in patients with HIV&#xD;
      infection. Consequently, quantitative CFR provides a unique opportunity to examine the&#xD;
      potential impact of novel therapies on the biology of the disease and its association with&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes. By testing the fundamental concept of whether novel ART therapies in&#xD;
      HIV can lead to improved coronary blood flow and myocardial tissue perfusion, TAF-CFR would&#xD;
      provide important mechanistic insights of the capabilities of TAF therapy to improve key&#xD;
      determinants of clinical risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, multicenter, uncontrolled, single arm pilot study. Patients with&#xD;
      stable HIV currently treated with abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir STR regimens will be&#xD;
      eligible for the B/F/TAF-CFR study. PET scans will be performed after enrollment while on the&#xD;
      abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir STR regimen and at 24 weeks after the switch to B/F/TAF&#xD;
      regimen. Patients will be encouraged to remain on stable medical therapy throughout the&#xD;
      enrollment period.&#xD;
