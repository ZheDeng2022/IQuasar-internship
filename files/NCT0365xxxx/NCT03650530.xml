      Even though most children with cancer now survive the ill child has to go through painful&#xD;
      treatments which include suffering and uncertainty for all family members. The overall aim is&#xD;
      to evaluate a modified version of the Family Talk Intervention (FTI) among families affected&#xD;
      by childhood cancer. The goals of FTI are to increase family communication, the family&#xD;
      members' resilience, knowledge about the illness, and thereby reduce the family members'&#xD;
      long-term psychosocial well-being. Specific aims are to assess the feasibility (Aim 1) and&#xD;
      the possible effects of the FTI (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to three months after diagnosis families at one of six pediatric oncology units in Sweden&#xD;
      will be recruited to FTI. All families at this unit who have a child (with cancer and/or&#xD;
      sibling) in the age of 6 to 19 will be asked to participate. The recruitment will continuing&#xD;
      for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core elements in the intervention are to support: 1) the families in talking about the&#xD;
      illness and related subjects, 2) the parents in understanding the needs of their children and&#xD;
      how to support them, and 3) the families in identifying their strengths and how to use them.&#xD;
      FTI entails six meetings with two interventionists (with the whole family and with the&#xD;
      individual members of the family) at 1-2 weekly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires, interviews and field notes will be used to evaluate the intervention. Time&#xD;
      points for data collection: before the intervention starts (baseline), directly after the&#xD;
      intervention (follow-up 1) and 6 months after baseline (follow-up 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since few intervention studies (if any) of this kind have been carried out in pediatric&#xD;
      oncology in Sweden to date, this study fills a knowledge gap. Research has described how&#xD;
      cancer affects the whole family, and the importance of an open and honest communication about&#xD;
      the illness in order to reduce the psychological suffering. The interventions presented here&#xD;
      are likely to improve communication within the family, which may reduce the risk of long-term&#xD;
      psychological distress for all family members.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous research in pediatric oncology and evaluations from the Swedish Childhood&#xD;
      Foundation, which focusing on parents', the ill child's, and the siblings' experiences,&#xD;
      conclude that much remains to be done regarding support to families affected by childhood&#xD;
      cancer. As there is no scientifically evaluated family-centered psychosocial intervention in&#xD;
      pediatric oncology in Sweden intervention studies are needed. This present study, described&#xD;
      below, fills a part of this knowledge gap. The overall aim is to evaluate a modified version&#xD;
      of the Family Talk Intervention (FTI) among families affected by childhood cancer. The goals&#xD;
      of FTI are to increase family communication, the family members' resilience, knowledge about&#xD;
      the illness, and thereby reduce the family members' long-term psychosocial well-being.&#xD;
      Specific aims are to assess the feasibility (Aim 1) and the possible effects of the FTI (Aim&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an intervention study that primarily focuses on feasibility. It will consist of an&#xD;
      intervention group based on families affected by childhood cancer. One of the children in the&#xD;
      family, the ill child or the sibling(s), have to be between 6-19 years old and the inclusion&#xD;
      of families will be conducted approximately 2-3 months after the cancer diagnosis or relaps.&#xD;
      The whole family or a part of the family can participate in the intervention. A minimum is&#xD;
      that at least one adult and one child in the age 6-19 can participate. To participate, the&#xD;
      family members have to understand and talk Swedish. All families that meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria at the pediatric oncology unit at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital will be asked&#xD;
      for participation from September 2018 to May 2019. Nurses at the clinic will identify the&#xD;
      families that meet the inclusion criteria's. Information about the study will be sent home to&#xD;
      the families by the researchers. One to two weeks later the interventionists will contact the&#xD;
      families by phone, inform them about the study, and asked them about participation. Those who&#xD;
      are willing to participate will be asked for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FTI is a preventive method originally developed for families with a parent with an affective&#xD;
      disorder who had children aged 6-18 years. The over-arching aims of the method are not&#xD;
      traditional psychotherapeutic intervention. They are instead to support an open, honest and&#xD;
      child-centered family communication, and increase understanding of the disease. The&#xD;
      intervention also aims to promote parental awareness concerning protective factors (as well&#xD;
      as identification of such), such as well-functioning school life, relationships and hobbies&#xD;
      among their children. Even if the intervention was developed for families with a parent with&#xD;
      depression it has also been tested among families with a severely ill parent who has young&#xD;
      children, with positive results. The core elements in the intervention are to: 1) support the&#xD;
      families in talking about the illness and related subjects 2) support the parents in&#xD;
      understanding the needs of their children and how to support them, and, 3) support the&#xD;
      families in identifying their strengths and how to use them. One of the most important&#xD;
      principles is respect for the parents. It is important to emphasize the parents' expertise&#xD;
      regarding their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since pediatric oncology is yet another context, the intervention has been slightly modified&#xD;
      by the research group together with individuals who educate persons in FTI in Sweden. The&#xD;
      modified FTI entails six meetings at 1-2 weekly intervals with five extra meetings. The&#xD;
      interventionists, who work in pairs, are educated in FTI and have clinical experiences of&#xD;
      working with families affected by seriously illness (e.g. as a nurse, counselor, etc.). To&#xD;
      support the interventionists a supervisor/educator in FTI will be available. The FTI is&#xD;
      manual-based and the interventionists are following a special protocol (here called the&#xD;
      logbook). The meetings with the families are held at a place chosen by the families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meetings 1-2: include only the parent(s) and focus on the parents' experiences of their&#xD;
      situation as well as the consequences of the cancer diagnosis for each family member. During&#xD;
      the meeting, each child's situation will be discussed including strengths, problems, worries,&#xD;
      the situation in school and with friends, and their social network. The knowledge of the&#xD;
      disease will also be a focus. The parent(s) will formulate the goal of the intervention. They&#xD;
      can also formulate questions that the interventionist(s) will ask the children in meetings 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 3: interviews will be held with each child (without the parents) concerning the&#xD;
      child's life situation, feelings, understanding of the disease, questions and hobbies. The&#xD;
      relationship with their parents is discussed as well as the child's social network. The&#xD;
      interventionist(s) identifies protective factors from the child's narrative (e.g.&#xD;
      well-functioning school life and relationships with friends) as well as risk factors (e.g.&#xD;
      poor social network). The child can also formulate questions for the parents and what he/she&#xD;
      wants to discuss during the family meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 4: includes the parent(s) and focuses on the planning of the family meetings. The&#xD;
      child's thoughts and questions serve as a guide for the upcoming family meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 5: is preferably led by the parent(s) to facilitate ongoing and continuous&#xD;
      communication within the family, and consists of questions and issues raised earlier by each&#xD;
      family member. This family meeting can be seen as a starting point for communication within&#xD;
      the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 6: is a follow-up with all family members, held preferably within a month of meeting&#xD;
      5. The meeting is guided by the family members' needs, e.g. communication and parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various strategies will be implemented during the different meetings including conversation&#xD;
      technique, books and different techniques of expression such as drawing and writing. For&#xD;
      example the interventionist(s) will use mapping of the children's social network as one&#xD;
      technique to assess the support that children receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of that the intervention not can be finished due to special circumstances extra&#xD;
      meetings will be available (meeting 7-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed methods, i.e. questionnaires, interviews and notes, will be used to evaluate the FTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus for this study is on the feasibility (Aim 1). Interviews and notes from the&#xD;
      logbooks will be analyzed with content analysis and the study process will be observed. As&#xD;
      this is a first study in this context, the results of the potential effects (Aim 2) will&#xD;
      indicate the direction for further studies. The potential effects will be explored with&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (data from the questionnaires) focusing on within effects where&#xD;
      descriptive trends of e.g. family communication will be explored. However, the main part of&#xD;
      Aim 1 will be answered by interview data from the families, the interventionist and by&#xD;
      observations. This study will also contribute to a power calculation for a larger study in&#xD;
      this context.&#xD;
