        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ≤ 37 points per the scoring system listed in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer not of CNS or spinal&#xD;
             column origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI or CT evidence of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have started 30 Gy in 10 fractions are not excluded as long as 4 doses of&#xD;
             chemotherapy could potentially be given. This means the latest nab-paclitaxel can&#xD;
             start is the morning of the third fraction of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy should&#xD;
             ideally be delivered at least 6 hours after the nab-paclitaxel infusion started.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving&#xD;
                  platelet transfusions within 7 days prior to blood draw)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x IULN (unless bone metastasis is present (&lt; 5 x IULN)&#xD;
                  in the absence of liver metastasis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (defined as a sexually mature woman who (1) has not&#xD;
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or (2) has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with,&#xD;
                  effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting treatment&#xD;
                  with nab-paclitaxel and while on study; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and agree to ongoing&#xD;
                  pregnancy testing during the course of the study and after the end of study&#xD;
                  therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from&#xD;
                  heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual&#xD;
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while&#xD;
             participating in the study, during dose interruptions, and for 6 months following&#xD;
             nab-paclitaxel discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential&#xD;
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with nab-paclitaxel. In addition, these patients are&#xD;
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous spinal cord radiotherapy that would overlap with the proposed treatment&#xD;
             field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal instability or bony retropulsion causing the cord compression. That is,&#xD;
             mechanical, not tumor, cord compression. In these cases surgery may be indicated.&#xD;

          -  Patients eligible for surgical decompression like laminectomy.&#xD;
