      Randomized Control Trial (RCT) longitudinal Intervention study. The RCT will be in accordance&#xD;
      with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement . In this study there&#xD;
      will be 2 groups of intervention and one control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Socially Assistive Robotic (SAR) intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Computer intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control group: standard therapy. Participants A total of 30 subacute, one year post&#xD;
           first stroke survivors, age 45-85, females and males, will be randomly allocated into 3&#xD;
           intervention groups. The participants will be recruited from Aleh Negev rehabilitation&#xD;
           center, from the ambulatory day care by Dr. Oren Barzel-MD, a Rehabilitation Medicine&#xD;
           specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure All patients that will be recruited to the study will be randomly allocated to each&#xD;
      of the three intervention groups. The measurements and therapy sessions will take place in&#xD;
      Aleh Negev rehabilitation center, in the Day-Care unit, by a physiotherapist and a PhD&#xD;
      student from Ben Gurion University (GCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations for all patients will be conducted in three points of time: T1: entrance to the&#xD;
      study, before randomization. T2: following 15 intervention sessions (after 5 weeks). T3: one&#xD;
      month after end of the intervention. MMSE and FM-UE scores will be recorded as screening&#xD;
      tools. FM-UE is a screening tool and a primary outcome measures. At each time point (T1, T2&#xD;
      and T3), the measurements described below will be performed on two separate days to avoid&#xD;
      effect of fatigue. Participants will come for a total of 21 sessions: 2 sessions of&#xD;
      evaluations, 15 sessions of treatment, 2 sessions of evaluation at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention, 2 sessions of evaluations one month post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Program The intervention program consists of 15 therapy sessions, 3 times a&#xD;
      week, an hour session each time for 5 weeks (over all 15 hours of intervention). Our proposed&#xD;
      intervention is a graduated functional RTG games using real objects (like a cup or a jar), in&#xD;
      different sizes, shapes, weights, textures and different environments (i.e. different heights&#xD;
      or location on the table). The RTG game selected for a participant will be based on the upper&#xD;
      limb movement and functional ability of the participant, as was measured by the therapist in&#xD;
      the inclusion to the study. The progression will be starting from low table and progressing&#xD;
      to higher table, starting from low weights objects (i.e. an empty jar) and progressing to&#xD;
      higher weights (i. e. a jar full with flour). Our program is based on two critical parameters&#xD;
      of upper limb rehabilitation: 1. the amount of practice-it has been recommended that&#xD;
      individuals post-stroke perform as many repetitions per session as they can tolerate . 2.&#xD;
      Practicing challenging tasks and not simple repetitive tasks, is likely to elicit motor&#xD;
      learning and associated neural reorganization. Since a correlation between cognition and arm&#xD;
      motor improvement has been lately described, the games we developed contain upper limb&#xD;
      movement as well as cognitive aspects (like working memory). In each meeting the participant&#xD;
      will have a one-hour session of RTG games, based on his\ her ability, as was measured upon&#xD;
      enrollment in the study and based on his\her fatigue etc. The patient will be able to rest up&#xD;
      to 5 minutes between a trial to trial in order to avoid fatigue. In addition, a patient will&#xD;
      be able to stop a session at any time if desired. Even though our aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      motivation and performance of the patient outside the individual physiotherapy session with&#xD;
      the therapist, we assume that during self-practice at the clinic and at home there is someone&#xD;
      with the patient. Therefore during the therapy session of the intervention study a&#xD;
      physiotherapist or a student will be present in the room (to help with problems that can&#xD;
      arise). All sessions will be filmed and recorded upon agreement of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Upper-limb functional RTG games with a humanoid robot (the &quot;ROBOT group&quot;). The robot&#xD;
      that will be used in this study is the Pepper robot (Aldebaran Soft Bank robotics) -a&#xD;
      humanoid off the shelf robot- with human-like face, 120 cm in height (see Figure 1). Pepper&#xD;
      has a touch screen tablet on its chest. The participant will sit in front of the robot, and&#xD;
      will play RTG games with the robot using real objects like a cup or a jar, open a drawer,&#xD;
      order jars on a shelf etc. The robot will give the participant feedback on his\ her&#xD;
      performance: the speed and the accuracy of the movement. There is no physical touch between&#xD;
      the robot and he participant. There are no modulation of the off-the-shelf features of the&#xD;
      robot for the study, besides recording the sentences of the robot speech for Hebrew in order&#xD;
      for the patients to understand his speech. Pepper is off-the shelf humanoid robot, with&#xD;
      human-like face. It can interact with the patient by gestures of voice (talk to the patient,&#xD;
      encourage him\her to keep on training), by gestures of movement (like hand clapping, hand&#xD;
      raising etc.) and by changing its color of eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Upper-limb functional RTG games with a computer (the &quot;COMPUTER group&quot;). The games&#xD;
      are the same as described for the &quot;ROBOT&quot; group. In this group the pictures of the cups and&#xD;
      the feedback on performance will be displayed on a standard computer screen (17''). There is&#xD;
      no physical touch between computer and the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: follow up with no intervention besides the usual rehabilitation program at the&#xD;
      facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of a game: the cup game. In each trial, a row of colored cups will be displayed on&#xD;
      the robot's chest tablet. The participant have to organize a corresponding set of actual&#xD;
      physical cups on the table according to the picture shown on the screen. There are three&#xD;
      levels of game difficulty: in Level 1 participants are asked to arrange four cups in the&#xD;
      correct order, in Level 2 there are five cups, and in Level 3 there are six cups. The&#xD;
      instructions and feedback will be provided by either the robot, or displayed on the computer&#xD;
      screen or written on a paper. The picture with the target order of the cups will disappear&#xD;
      from the screen after 1-2 min. In the computer and robot groups, when they complete the task,&#xD;
      participants will have to press a push button. In the robot and computer groups, after each&#xD;
      trial, the robot\ computer will either give feedback on the performance (e.g., &quot;try to do it&#xD;
      faster next time&quot;) or a feedback on results (e.g., &quot;you succeeded!&quot;, &quot;you were not right but&#xD;
      try again!&quot;). The feedback given by the robot is both verbal and with head and arm gestures&#xD;
      (e.g. hand clapping). The feedback by the computer will be displayed on the screen. In the&#xD;
      self-training group no feedback is given. After two trials on the basic level (four cups) and&#xD;
      four trials on the second level (five cups), the participant could choose to either continue&#xD;
      at the same level or change to a harder level of game (more cups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Games description and progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cup game: Ordering a row of cups according to the picture. Progression 1: number of&#xD;
           cups: start from 3 cups, continue to 6 cups. Progression 2: Height of table: start low,&#xD;
           continue to high, continue to different heights, different weights of cups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A dartboard: ordering cups on a dartboard according to a picture. Progression 1: number&#xD;
           of cups: start from 3 cups continue up to 7 cups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Progression 2: start close to body (at arm's length) continue longer than arm length.&#xD;
           Progression 3: height of table. Progression 4: weight of cups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ordering Jars on different heights shelves: according to a picture. Progression 1: start&#xD;
           3 jars, add jars. Progression 2: start low height, continue high and different heights.&#xD;
           Progression 3: different weights of jars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Open drawer and order objects according to a picture (memory game). Progression 1:&#xD;
           number of drawers-start with 2 and add drawers. Progression 2: different heights&#xD;
           drawers. Progression 3: start with a handle of different kinds (straight handle, round&#xD;
           handle) continue to a key opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Taking objects (i.e. keys) out of a jar and putting it in a jar according to its color&#xD;
           (stroop game).&#xD;
