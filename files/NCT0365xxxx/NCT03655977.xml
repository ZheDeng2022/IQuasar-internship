  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to evaluate the potential and feasibility of hybrid PET/MRI&#xD;
      functional imaging to non-invasively measure tumor characteristics for radiation therapy&#xD;
      planning (RT) for cervical cancer. It will be assessed how the complementary information of&#xD;
      tumor characteristics can contributed to better understanding of tumor delineation. Another&#xD;
      endpoint of this study is to evaluate a new PET-tracer (68Ga-NODAGA- E[c(RGDyK)]2) enabling&#xD;
      imaging of tumor-angiogenesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer includes a&#xD;
      combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) with concurrent&#xD;
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy. During the last decade, the utilization of MRI for planning of&#xD;
      EBRT and BT has grown based on the GEC ESTRO recommendations and the cervix is among the&#xD;
      first cancer sites where response-adaptive radiotherapy has been successfully implemented in&#xD;
      clinical practice. This approach has changed patterns of clinical practice with regard to&#xD;
      dose administration, and significant improvements in clinical outcome have been reported.&#xD;
      However further development of both BT and EBRT is still demanded to improve tumor&#xD;
      delineation and consequently local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent developments in advanced image guidance for both EBRT and BT have potential to improve&#xD;
      local as well as nodal and also systemic control. Multi-parametric PET/MR imaging potentially&#xD;
      offers new possibilities for RT planning, whereas a complete replacement of the planning MRI&#xD;
      with combined PET/MRI for EBRT and BT, alters target volume delineation due to superior soft&#xD;
      tissue contrast provided by MRI and combined with the information of tumor heterogeneity,&#xD;
      perfusion characteristics, and hypoxia provided by PET, DW-MRI, and DCE-MRI. However combined&#xD;
      use of PET/MRI for treatment planning still remains challenging due to several aspects.&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators intend to encounter the technical challenges regarding dose planning&#xD;
      and attenuation correction of MRI hardware and immobilization devices by generating&#xD;
      Pseudo-CT, using methods based on ultra-short echo time (UTE) MR sequence. Additionally,&#xD;
      investigators desire to assess how the complementary information provided by multi-parametric&#xD;
      PET/MRI can affect the planning of EBRT and BT and contribute to better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathology of cervical cancer during chemo-radiotherapy and improve radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET/MR will be performed with a new PET-tracer &quot;RGD&quot; (68Ga-NODAGA- E[c(RGDyK)]2) enabling&#xD;
      imaging of tumor-angiogenesis. This is to show the angiogenesis within the tumor and changes&#xD;
      during external radiotherapy. The study of angiogenesis will be supported by examination of&#xD;
      tissues from the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect the angiogenesis to correlate to the aggression and thereby the&#xD;
      prognosis of the individual tumor.&#xD;
