  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator driven study will examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of 177Lutetium-PSMA (177Lu-PSMA) and pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). 177Lu-PSMA is a compound that binds to the&#xD;
      extra-cellular domain of the prostate-specific membrane antigen. Pembrolizumab is an antibody&#xD;
      targeted against anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1).This is a single arm study where all&#xD;
      patients will be treated with 177Lu-PSMA for upto 6 doses and pembrolizumab for upto 35&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Through treatment completion, maximum of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) is 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact/interference of pain on daily functions through the use of a numerical rating scale (NRS). Participants rate the severity of their pain as its &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;least' and &quot;average&quot; in the last 24 hours using an 11-point NRS with anchors &quot;no pain'' and ''pain as bad as you can imagine.'' This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference. The BPI-SF also asks the participants to mark the location of the pain on a body drawing and includes additional questions regarding pain treatment and the extent of pain relief. The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide. Higher pain scores is worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through treatment completion, maximum of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate cancer (FACT-P) provides information about general and disease-specific symptoms. The FACT-P module is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire that has been validated for the purpose of assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in prostate cancer patients. The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (7 items), Functional Well-Being (7 items), Emotional Well-Being (6 items), Social Well- Being (7 items), and additional concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items). FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).Scoring of the FACT-P will be based on the user manual. Higher scores means higher quality of life.</description>
