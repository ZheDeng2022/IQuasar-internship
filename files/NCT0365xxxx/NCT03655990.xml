      This study follows subjects who have agreed with their dentist that their failing teeth or&#xD;
      missing teeth all need replacing. This study follows their standard routine care with some&#xD;
      additional assessments. The dental treatment option that replaces a whole arch or both arches&#xD;
      (upper and lower jaws) of the mouth is call &quot;Teeth in a Day&quot; and information on the use of&#xD;
      the JUVORA™ Dental Disc during this treatment is what is being collected as part of this&#xD;
      study along with subjects follow-up care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade full-arch metal implant-supported prosthetics have been used as a&#xD;
      replacement for missing teeth in edentulous (toothless) patients. The standard has been a&#xD;
      titanium metal base. Due to its potential shock-absorbing properties and patients' demands&#xD;
      for metal-free restorations, there is rising enthusiasm surrounding the use of High&#xD;
      Performance Polymers (HPPs) such as the polyaryletherketone (PAEKs) as metal alternatives for&#xD;
      such cases. The JUVORA™ Dental Disc is made from PEEK-OPTIMA™ polymer (Invibio Biomaterial&#xD;
      Solutions) which allows efficient fabrication of reliable non-metal dentures by using CAD/CAM&#xD;
      technology to manufacture precise, custom-fit prostheses. The JUVORA™ Dental Disc is&#xD;
      indicated for the manufacture of: full-arch implant-supported dentures and implant bars; full&#xD;
      and partial removable dentures and overdentures; crowns and 3-unit bridges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical performance and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction of the JUVORA™ full-arch implant-supported prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two subjects will be included in a run-in phase and 10 subjects will be included in the main&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be followed-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and for as long as willing&#xD;
      yearly after the implant of the definitive prosthesis (artificial teeth).&#xD;
