      Hepatic imaging plays an important role in identifying and differentiating both benign and&#xD;
      malignant neoplasms of the liver. One of the clinical and radiologic dilemmas facing hepatic&#xD;
      medicine is the accurate differentiation of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatic&#xD;
      adenoma (HA). This is a question of some import, as there are significant prognosis and&#xD;
      treatment differences between these entities, as well as overlap in the patient populations&#xD;
      in whom they occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FNH is the second most common benign neoplasm of the liver, with a strong female&#xD;
      predilection. These lesions are usually asymptomatic and incidentally discovered, and carry&#xD;
      only a small risk of complication such as bleeding. There is no malignant potential. Hepatic&#xD;
      adenomas (HAs) are more rare benign neoplasms that also have a female predilection. However,&#xD;
      these lesions are more likely to be symptomatic, and carry a higher bleeding risk especially&#xD;
      as they grow over 4 cm. In addition, they harbor a small risk of malignant transformation to&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Of note, patients may present with both types of lesion&#xD;
      concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, MRI with hepatobiliary contrast agents is the standard for differentiation of&#xD;
      these lesions. These agents (such as gadoxetate disodium, or Eovist) are actively transported&#xD;
      into hepatocytes, which are present in FNH and only in very rare cases with HA. Previous&#xD;
      research (such as from Grazioli et al.) has shown that hepatobiliary agents can differentiate&#xD;
      these lesions with excellent accuracy. However, there is still overlap between these lesions&#xD;
      on imaging, and for certain patients MRI may be difficult or impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA approval of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) agents in 2016 has opened a new avenue&#xD;
      for abdominal imaging. CEUS utilizes gas containing lipid microbubbles to provide pure&#xD;
      intravascular contrast, allowing for evaluation of vascular and solid organ perfusion. It has&#xD;
      an excellent safety profile and is not excreted by the kidneys, allowing for use in patients&#xD;
      with acute and chronic renal disease. It has been used for some time outside of the US for&#xD;
      liver lesion evaluation, and the enhancement patterns of both FNH and HA have been described&#xD;
      in the literature by Kim et al. as having different appearances. CEUS can be especially&#xD;
      useful for focal liver lesion imaging for patients who cannot or will not undergo MRI, and it&#xD;
      has the advantages of flexibility, increased temporal resolution, and decreased cost. This&#xD;
      study aims to compare the utility of CEUS for differentiating FNH and HA with the current&#xD;
      standard of hepatobiliary contrast MRI.&#xD;
