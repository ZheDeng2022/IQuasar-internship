    <measure>Responder Rate for Nasolabial Folds Based on the Blinded Rater's Evaluation on the Merz Nasolabial Folds Scale (MNLFS) at Week 12/16 (Depending on Touch-up)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12 (for participants with no touch-up) or Week 16 (for participants with touch-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The MNLFS was used to assess the severity of nasolabial folds. The assessment was performed separately for the left and the right nasolabial fold by the blinded rater and the treating investigator (at baseline only prior to SMD injection) by live rating. MNLFS was a 5 point scale ranging as: 0 (no folds), 1 (mild folds), 2 (moderate folds), 3 (severe folds), 4 (very severe folds). Responders rate was defined as percentage of participants who achieved improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 point in both folds (left and right) from Day 1 pre-injection to Week 12/16 (depending on touch-up). As planned, the cumulative data was collected for Week 12 or Week 16 based on the touch-up.</description>

        <title>Responder Rate for Nasolabial Folds Based on the Blinded Rater's Evaluation on the Merz Nasolabial Folds Scale (MNLFS) at Week 12/16 (Depending on Touch-up)</title>
        <description>The MNLFS was used to assess the severity of nasolabial folds. The assessment was performed separately for the left and the right nasolabial fold by the blinded rater and the treating investigator (at baseline only prior to SMD injection) by live rating. MNLFS was a 5 point scale ranging as: 0 (no folds), 1 (mild folds), 2 (moderate folds), 3 (severe folds), 4 (very severe folds). Responders rate was defined as percentage of participants who achieved improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 point in both folds (left and right) from Day 1 pre-injection to Week 12/16 (depending on touch-up). As planned, the cumulative data was collected for Week 12 or Week 16 based on the touch-up.</description>

        <title>Responder Rate for Nasolabial Folds Based on the Blinded Rater's Evaluation on the MNLFS at Week 4 (Prior to Optional Touch-up), at Week 24/28, at Week 48/52, and at Week 72/76 (Depending on Touch-up)</title>
        <description>The MNLFS was used to assess the severity of nasolabial folds. The assessment was performed separately for the left and the right nasolabial fold by the blinded rater and the treating investigator (at baseline only prior to SMD injection) by live rating. MNLFS was a 5 point scale ranging as: 0 (no folds), 1 (mild folds), 2 (moderate folds), 3 (severe folds), 4 (very severe folds). Responders rate was defined as percentage of participants who achieved improvement of &gt;=1 point in both folds (left and right) from Day 1 pre-injection to Week 4, Week 24/28, Week 48/52, and Week 72/76 (depending on touch-up). As planned, the cumulative data was collected for Week 24 or 28, Week 48 or 52, and Week 72 or 76 based on the touch-up.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Based on Treating Investigator's Evaluation of the Global Aesthetic Improvement on the iGAIS at Week 4 (Prior to Optional Touch-up), Week 12/16, Week 24/28, Week 48/52, and Week 72/76 (Depending on Touch-up Performed)</title>
        <description>The Investigator's Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (iGAIS) was used to assess aesthetic improvement in the participants by the treating investigator by live rating using baseline photographs for comparison. The treating investigator was asked: 'Based on your clinical experience, what is your overall impression of change of the participant's aesthetic result due to treatment, compared to the condition before the first treatment (baseline)? Please check the one option that best fits your overall impression of change based on your comparison of the baseline visit photographs.' Rating was based on 7 point rating scale ranging from: +3 (very much improved), +2 (much improved), +1 (improved), 0 (no change), -1 (worse), -2 (much worse), -3 (very much worse). As planned, the cumulative data was collected at Week 4 (prior to optional touch-up), Week 12 or 16, Week 24 or 28, Week 48 or 52, and Week 72 or 76 based on the touch-up.</description>
        <time_frame>At Week 4 (prior to optional touch-up); at Weeks 12, 24, 48 and 72 (for participants with no touch-up) or at Weeks 16, 28, 52 and 76 (for participants with touch-up)</time_frame>
        <population>The FAS was the subset of all participants who were exposed to the SMD at least once and for whom a baseline and a post-baseline MAS value of at least one treated indication was available. This OM was analyzed in all participants and by the subpopulations of each indication. Here &quot;overall number of participants analyzed&quot; were participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and &quot;number analyzed&quot; were participants who were evaluable for the outcome measure at given time points.</population>

            <description>Participants received SMD (RADIESSE® [+] Lidocaine) on Day 1 with volume and using injection techniques based on investigator's judgement, skin conditions, safety and participant's expectations, and the extent of the volume loss/deficit for treatment of nasolabial folds. An optional touch-up was performed at Week 4 (Visit 2) in the indications that were treated on Day 1, to obtain an optimal aesthetic outcome, as appropriate.</description>

        <description>The Subject's Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (sGAIS) was used to assess aesthetic improvement in the participants by the participant by live rating using baseline photographs for comparison. The participant was asked: 'What is your overall impression of change of your aesthetic result due to treatment, compared to the condition before the injection? Please tick the one option that best fits your overall impression of change based on your comparison of the baseline visit photographs.' Rating based on 7 point rating scale ranging from: +3 (very much improved), +2 (much improved), +1 (improved), 0 (no change), -1 (worse), -2 (much worse), -3 (very much worse). As planned, the cumulative data was collected at Week 4 (prior to optional touch-up), Week 12 or 16, Week 24 or 28, Week 48 or 52, and Week 72 or 76 based on the touch-up.</description>

        <population>The FAS was the subset of all participants who were exposed to the SMD at least once and for whom a baseline and a post-baseline MAS value of at least one treated indication was available. This OM was analyzed in all participants and by the subpopulations of each indication. Here &quot;overall number of participants analyzed&quot; were participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure and &quot;number analyzed&quot; were participants who were evaluable for the outcome measure at given time points.</population>
