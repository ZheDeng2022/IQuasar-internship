    <textblock>
      In order to conduct a multicenter comparative effectiveness clinical research of phase II to&#xD;
      investigate safety and efficacy of applying microwave ablation in patients with Great-glass&#xD;
      lung nodules ≤ 3cm, a single center, non-randomized, open label pilot study is conducted to&#xD;
      examine the flexibility, safety and efficacy of using Microwave Ablation in Patients with&#xD;
      Ground Glass Nodules that are poor candidate of surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide contributing 13% of the total number of new&#xD;
      cases diagnosed. The main treatments of lung cancer are based on surgical resection and&#xD;
      adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy. However, the patients who are intolerant of surgery&#xD;
      wouldn't be benefit from surgical resection. Microwave ablation provide new choice for lung&#xD;
      cancer, which can effectively treat early lung cancer. The diagnosis of early lung cancer can&#xD;
      be based on the results of biopsy of ground-glass nodules (GGNs), which is one of the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for preoperative diagnosis of early lung cancer. The microwave ablation&#xD;
      is the good choice for patients who cannot tolerate surgical resection. However, the&#xD;
      flexibility, safety and efficacy of using Microwave Ablation in Patients with Ground Glass&#xD;
      Nodules are still unclear.&#xD;
