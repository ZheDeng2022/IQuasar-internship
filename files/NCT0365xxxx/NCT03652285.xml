    <textblock>
      A novel stent, called Universal Partially Covered Removable Self-expanding Stent and&#xD;
      Anchoring System for the Treatment of Refractory Benign Esophageal Strictures (UAS-RBS) was&#xD;
      designed to improve the treatment of benign esophageal refractory strictures with a novel&#xD;
      stent. This study aims at evaluating the safety of this new device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory strictures are defined as benign esophageal strictures who do not achieve&#xD;
      acceptable symptom relief despite an intensive dilation schedule. Considering the failure of&#xD;
      balloon or mechanical dilation other techniques such as intralesional injection of&#xD;
      corticosteroids or stents placement were developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-expandable metal stents, plastic stents and biodegradable stents are also used in that&#xD;
      indication. In a meta-analysis of 18 studies with 444 patients, clinical success was achieved&#xD;
      in 41 percent of patients. Stent migration occurred in 29 percent of patients, and adverse&#xD;
      events occurred in 21 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-expending nitinol stent has been design to reduce the migration risk. The stent is&#xD;
      partially covered on both extremities, allowing the formation of small hyperplasia in the&#xD;
      middle part of the stent. This design with the inner sheet (usually, when using fully covered&#xD;
      stents, the sheet is outside) allows formation of hyperplasia (therefore reducing the risk of&#xD;
      migration) but partly controlled by the inner sheet to reduce the risk of lumen occlusion. By&#xD;
      this design, the balance between hyperplasia formation to avoid the risk of migration and&#xD;
      reducing the risk of lumen occlusion could be entailed stable esophageal calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UAS-RBS system is a reversible procedure to treat Refractory Benign Esophageal Strictures&#xD;
      through stent implantation. Above standard of care monitoring, safety assessment of the&#xD;
      procedure and device performance decreases the risk and unforeseen events.&#xD;

    <description>An upper endoscopy will be performed with the use of fluoroscopy. Depending on the size of the stricture a dilation can be performed prior to the stent deployment. Otherwise, the stent will be deployed over a guidewire, under fluoroscopy.&#xD;
After, the gastroscopy will go through the esophagus to check for the stent deployment, or any complications.&#xD;
An injection of contrast agent will be done to be sure of the correct positioning and that no complications was happened.&#xD;
The patient will be kept overnight, with liquid food for 3 days and under PPI until one month after the stent placement.</description>
