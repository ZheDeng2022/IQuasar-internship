  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community mental health programs in publically-funded jurisdictions such as Canada often have&#xD;
      limited budgets in order to provide services, which can result in inadequate access to&#xD;
      effective treatment for patients. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a gold-standard&#xD;
      psychotherapy for depression and anxiety. In order to improve access to treatment, community&#xD;
      mental healthcare settings often provide CBT in a group format for patients experiencing&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate symptoms. However, typical protocols for delivering group CBT in a community&#xD;
      setting nonetheless require a considerable investment of limited clinician time. The&#xD;
      Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) developed the Triple Aim, which is a framework&#xD;
      describing an approach to optimizing health system performance by simultaneously pursuing&#xD;
      three dimensions, namely improving the patient experience of care; improving the health of&#xD;
      populations; and reducing the associated per capita costs of care. Adaptive Psychological&#xD;
      Training (APT) is a group-based psychotherapy designed with all of the dimensions of the&#xD;
      Triple Aim in mind simultaneously. In its development, APT drew heavily upon&#xD;
      mindfulness-based approaches. To-date, APT has already demonstrated positive outcomes in&#xD;
      pilot research and in community clinical settings. The purpose of the current study is to&#xD;
      determine whether for a given population of patients experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms&#xD;
      of depression and/or anxiety, APT can facilitate meaningful change for more patients per time&#xD;
      spent by clinicians than can CBT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in the general population. Community mental&#xD;
      health programs in publically-funded jurisdictions such as Canada often have relatively&#xD;
      limited, fixed budgets in order to provide services, which can result in inadequate access to&#xD;
      effective treatment for patients. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a gold-standard&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic treatment for depression and anxiety. In order to improve access to&#xD;
      treatment, community mental healthcare settings often provide CBT in a group format for&#xD;
      patients experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms. However, typical protocols for delivering&#xD;
      group CBT in a community setting nonetheless require a considerable investment of limited&#xD;
      clinician time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question arises as to whether this is the most efficient and effective use of clinician&#xD;
      time; in other words, per hour spent of clinician time, does this approach maximize the&#xD;
      number of patients experiencing adequate and meaningful clinical improvement? The Institute&#xD;
      for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) developed the Triple Aim, which is a framework describing an&#xD;
      approach to optimizing health system performance by simultaneously pursuing three dimensions,&#xD;
      namely improving the patient experience of care; improving the health of populations; and&#xD;
      reducing the associated per capita costs of care. Studies of psychotherapy rarely pursue all&#xD;
      three of these dimensions simultaneously. Efforts to achieve the best clinical outcome for an&#xD;
      individual often lead to restrictive inclusionary/exclusionary criteria that sacrifice&#xD;
      reaching the wider population; conversely, efforts to improve population health often&#xD;
      prioritize composite overall clinical improvement across an entire group, even though the&#xD;
      change experienced by many of the individuals in the population might not be clinically&#xD;
      meaningful; focusing primarily on cost-effectiveness often sacrifices the individual's&#xD;
      experience and/or the population's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive Psychological Training (APT) is a group-based psychotherapy designed with all of the&#xD;
      dimensions of the Triple Aim in mind simultaneously. In its development, APT drew heavily&#xD;
      upon Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, an evidence-based psychotherapy that itself draws&#xD;
      upon both evidence-based eastern psychotherapeutic practices and CBT, but APT also drew upon&#xD;
      other evidence-based and evidence-supported psychotherapies including interpersonal and&#xD;
      relational approaches, as well as meaning-focused psychoanalytic models. It also drew from&#xD;
      psychology and neuroscience more broadly, as well as from learning theory and from practical&#xD;
      clinical and operational experience. Inclusion/exclusion criteria, group size, number of&#xD;
      sessions, in-session practice and learning, and between-session practice and learning were&#xD;
      all adapted from the perspective of trying to achieve high quality outcomes for a broader&#xD;
      population within more contained costs, and thereby increase access to quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To-date, APT has already demonstrated positive outcomes in pilot research and in community&#xD;
      clinical settings. The purpose of this specific study is to determine whether for a given&#xD;
      population of patients experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety,&#xD;
      APT can facilitate meaningful change for more patients per time spent by clinicians than can&#xD;
      CBT (the gold standard). The significance of this study includes its potential contribution&#xD;
      to determining how best to deploy the limited resource of clinician time in a community&#xD;
      setting in order to best help the most people.&#xD;
