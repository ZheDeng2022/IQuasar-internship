  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer are increasingly being treated with drugs designed to modulate the&#xD;
      response of their immune system, broadly to boost their body's defences against cancer.&#xD;
      However, there is an unmet need to identify which patients are unlikely to benefit. Deciding&#xD;
      on benefit from therapy uses standard imaging methods (e.g. CT scans), which can take time&#xD;
      (months) whereas DNA in the bloodstream could be measured more rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to assess whether changes in the level of circulating tumour&#xD;
      DNA (ctDNA) can quickly determine a patients response. This would enable patients to change&#xD;
      therapies more quickly if they are not responding and reduce exposure to unnecessary side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measuring circulating (plasma) tumour DNA has been described as a 'liquid biopsy' able to&#xD;
      study a tumour without invasive biopsy. By measuring ctDNA at different time points the&#xD;
      investigators can detect tumour changes that indicate if the patient is responding to&#xD;
      treatment or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has been designed as a prospective, open label, non-randomised trial where patient&#xD;
      with advanced oesophageal cancer will be treated with MEDI4736 (durvalumab), a drug designed&#xD;
      to alter the immune system response. Samples will be taken to regularly to measure ctDNA&#xD;
      levels and compared to patients response at 6 months when undergoing standard CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run at a single centre (Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge). Nineteen,&#xD;
      evaluable, patients will receive durvalumab until progression while detailed studies will&#xD;
      assess their tumour and immune response.&#xD;
