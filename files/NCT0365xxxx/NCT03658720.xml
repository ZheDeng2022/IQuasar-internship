  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disintegration time is an important quality attribute of ODTs, and the evaluation of&#xD;
      disintegration time is positioned as a key step in formulation development, manufacturing,&#xD;
      and clinical practice. The standard recommended over-the counter dose of 200mg Nurofen&#xD;
      ibuprofen ODT is one (200mg) to two (400mg) tablets. To reflect this, the disintegration time&#xD;
      of both one (200mg) and two (400mg) tablets will be assessed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been performed assessing in vivo ODT disintegration time and have created&#xD;
      standardised oral conditions by giving water prior to dosing, to moisten/wet the mouth. In&#xD;
      this study it is therefore necessary to standardise the oral conditions as much as possible,&#xD;
      despite the interpersonal variability, to measure the time it takes for the ODT to&#xD;
      disintegrate. For this study, 20 mL of water is swallowed prior to dosing to standardise oral&#xD;
      conditions. Thirty-three healthy volunteers are required to be randomised into the study, to&#xD;
      allow evaluable data to be obtained for 30 subjects. Subjects are given a light meal/snack&#xD;
      and then fast for 2 hours 15 minutes (± 15 minutes) before dosing, in order to bring the oral&#xD;
      cavity environment as close as possible to standard levels and to minimise variability in&#xD;
      salivation. Directly before dosing, subjects drink (with oral cavity rinsing) 20 mL of water.&#xD;
      Subjects are dosed according to the sequence they have been randomised and the ODT&#xD;
      disintegration time assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first dose, subjects complete a washout period of a minimum of 4 hours, in&#xD;
      accordance with the recommended posology, before receiving the second dose. During this&#xD;
      washout period, subjects are given a second light meal/snack (the same as the previous light&#xD;
      meal/snack), timed to allow subjects to fast for 2 hours 15 minutes (± 15 minutes) before the&#xD;
      second dose. Directly before the second dose, subjects drink (with oral cavity rinsing) 20 mL&#xD;
      of water. Subjects then receive the alternative dose to the dose they received during the&#xD;
      first assessment, in accordance with the randomisation sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the disintegration assessments, or upon subject withdrawal, subjects&#xD;
      are asked whether they are experiencing any symptoms or complaints. Any AEs are recorded in&#xD;
      the CRF and followed up as necessary by the Investigator. Subjects then leave the&#xD;
      clinic.Subjects are contacted by the Investigator (or designee) from 24 to up to 48 hours to&#xD;
      ensure any AEs are captured.&#xD;
