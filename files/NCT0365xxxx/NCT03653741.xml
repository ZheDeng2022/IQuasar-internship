      This is a study to evaluate the effects of perampanel, a FDA approved drug for epilepsy, on&#xD;
      commonly performed neurophysiology tests: electroencephalogram (EEG), somatosensory evoked&#xD;
      potential (SEP), brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), and visual evoked potential&#xD;
      (VEP). Many other drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy have been shown to affect the&#xD;
      results of these test but no one has yet examined if perampanel affects these tests. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit 12 healthy normal male subjects. All subjects will have VEP,&#xD;
      SSEP, EEG, and BAER performed before and 1 hour (when Cmax is reached) after receiving 6mg of&#xD;
      oral perampanel. Subjects will also receive a blood draw 1 hour after ingestion of perampanel&#xD;
      for serum perampanel level. In a previous study done at another institution, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers have tolerated a single dose of perampanel at 6 mg quite well. There is no placebo&#xD;
      nor randomization. Subject's participation concludes after completion of post-perampanel&#xD;
      ingestion neurophysiology tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug used in this research study is perampanel, an FDA approved medication for the&#xD;
      treatment of seizures. The study is being done to examine whether the study drug affects the&#xD;
      following non-invasive tests of brain activity: electroencephalogram (EEG), visual evoked&#xD;
      potential (VEP), brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAER), and somatosensory evoked&#xD;
      potential (SEP). Many anti-seizure drugs have been shown to affect these 4 tests.&#xD;
      Anti-seizure medications such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine have been shown&#xD;
      to cause slowing of brain activity on EEGs. To date, there have been no published data on&#xD;
      whether perampanel, affects EEG, VEP, SEP, or BAER. The data from this study may help with&#xD;
      interpretation of these tests in epileptic patients on perampanel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are looking for male participants with no prior chronic medical conditions&#xD;
      to partake in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo the following tests as part of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EEG: this test monitors the electrical activity of the brain through small, metal disks&#xD;
           (electrodes) that are placed on the scalp. The test is painless and after the electrodes&#xD;
           are placed, participants will be asked to lay down as brain activity is monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. VEP: this test is similar to the EEG in that electrodes will be placed on the back of&#xD;
           the head to monitor brain electrical activity. This test looks specifically at what is&#xD;
           happening in the part of the brain that responds to vision, so during the test&#xD;
           participants will be shown visual stimuli like a bright light or image on a screen to&#xD;
           stimulate brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BAER: this test is similar to the EEG in that electrodes will be placed on participant's&#xD;
           head to monitor brain electrical activity. This test looks specifically at what is&#xD;
           happening in the part of the brain that responds to sound, so during the test, different&#xD;
           sounds will be played to stimulate brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SEP: this test is similar to the EEG in that electrodes will be placed on participant's&#xD;
           head to monitor brain electrical activity. This test looks specifically at what is&#xD;
           happening in the part of the brain that responds to touch and body sensations, so&#xD;
           electrodes will also be placed on the arms and legs to stimulate that area with an&#xD;
           electric pulse. This electrical stimulation can cause mild discomfort but is generally&#xD;
           well tolerated. Participants may feel muscles twitch when the electrical stimulation is&#xD;
           given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests are non-invasive and done routinely in the evaluation of neurologic diseases.&#xD;
      They are well tolerated and have no long term side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of the four tests, participants will take a single dose of 6mg pill&#xD;
      of perampanel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perampanel is a drug approved and marketed in the USA for the treatment of epilepsy to&#xD;
      prevent recurrent seizures. In a previous study, healthy volunteers have tolerated a single&#xD;
      dose of perampanel at 6 mg quite well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following taking the pill of perampanel, participants will have their blood drawn:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their blood drawn approximately 1 hour after ingestion of single dose&#xD;
      of perampanel to measure the concentration of the drug in their blood stream. The total&#xD;
      amount of blood taken during the study is approximately 40-60 teaspoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blood draw, participants will repeat the four tests (EEG, VEP, BAER, SEP) as&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no follow up visit. However, the study physician will be available should&#xD;
      participants experience unexpected side effects due to the study. The investigators,&#xD;
      physicians, or sponsors may stop the study or take participants out of the study at any time&#xD;
      should they judge that it is in participants' best interest to do so. For instance, they may&#xD;
      take participants out of the study if they experience a study-related injury or if they are&#xD;
      unable to undergo testing. They may remove participants from the study for various other&#xD;
      administrative and medical reasons. They can do this without consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For trials of drugs, there may be risks. The research doctor will discuss the full extent of&#xD;
      diagnostic, procedural, and drug risks with participants. There may be risks which are&#xD;
      currently unforeseeable. As with all medications, side effects may occur and there may be&#xD;
      additional side effects, including long term effects, which are at present unknown.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important that participants report any adverse reactions to the study doctor&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the period immediately following the study, participants should use caution when driving&#xD;
      or using heavy machinery, since the study drug may cause imbalance, dizziness or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should not take perampanel if theyare allergic to any of the ingredients in the&#xD;
      tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Side Effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perampanel may cause new or worse aggressive behavior, homicidal thoughts or threats,&#xD;
      hostility, anger, anxiety, irritability, being suspicious or distrustful (believing things&#xD;
      that are not true), and other unusual or extreme changes in behavior or mood. Extreme&#xD;
      behavioral changes have not been seen in a study of only a single dose of perampanel, and it&#xD;
      is not expected that participants will develop such behavioral changes. Participants should&#xD;
      contact the study doctor immediately should they experience any of the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiepileptic drugs, including perampanel, may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very&#xD;
      small number of people, about 1 in 500. Subjects should call their healthcare providers right&#xD;
      away if they have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or&#xD;
      worrisome: thoughts about suicide or dying, thoughts of self-harm, attempt to commit suicide,&#xD;
      new or worse depression, new or worse anxiety, feeling agitated or restless, panic attacks,&#xD;
      trouble sleeping (insomnia), new or worse irritability, acting aggressive, being angry or&#xD;
      violent, acting on dangerous impulses, an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania),&#xD;
      and other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Participants should call the study doctor&#xD;
      immediately if they notice any changes in mood, ideas or behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most common side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dizziness, fatigue, sleepiness, irritability, falls, nausea, imbalance, gait problems,&#xD;
      vertigo, and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less commonly seen side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache, anxiety, upset stomach, vomiting, constipation, urinary tract infection, problems&#xD;
      with coordination, rash, bruises, muscle pain, blurry vision, swelling of arms/legs,&#xD;
      numbness, memory problems, confusion, euphoria, low blood sodium level, increase triglyceride&#xD;
      level, skin laceration, pain in extremities, back pain, and head trauma. Though rare, skin&#xD;
      laceration, head trauma, pain in extremities, and back pain are possible with this medication&#xD;
      due to imbalance and dizziness leading to falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) may classify some, but not all, medicines as controlled&#xD;
      substances. Perampanel has been classified as schedule III. Medicines in this category have&#xD;
      an approved medical use but have potential for abuse, physical dependence, or psychological&#xD;
      dependence. The risk is lower compared to drugs in Schedule I and II. Some other&#xD;
      anti-epileptic medicines have also been listed as controlled substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that perampanel may interact with other medicines and herbal supplements that&#xD;
      participants are taking. Before starting the study, the study doctor will determine that they&#xD;
      are not taking anything that can interact with perampanel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the collection of blood samples, participants may experience slight discomfort and a&#xD;
      small amount of bleeding, discoloration or bruising at the site where the needle was&#xD;
      inserted. Clot formation and infections may occur at the puncture site, but this is extremely&#xD;
      rare. Fainting may occur during or shortly after having blood drawn. If faintness is&#xD;
      experienced, participants should lie down immediately to avoid possible injury caused by&#xD;
      falling, and notify the site study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perampanel does not affect the ability of men to father children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of the Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all fours tests (EEG, VEP, BAER, SEP), participants may experience discomfort from the&#xD;
      placement of the electrodes on the scalp. Participants may also experience visual discomfort&#xD;
      when they are shown bright lights during the VEP, as well as hearing discomfort when they&#xD;
      hear sounds during the BAER. Finally, participants may experience brief discomfort during the&#xD;
      SEP when electrical stimulus is created by the electrodes on the arms or legs. These&#xD;
      electrical shocks are done as part of routine exams in patients with possible nerve damages&#xD;
      and are generally well tolerated. There are no long lasting effects from these mild shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts will be made to protect participants' medical records and other personal information&#xD;
      to the extent allowed by law. However, the investigator cannot guarantee absolute&#xD;
      confidentiality. Records of study participants are stored and kept according to legal&#xD;
      requirements and may be part of participants' medical record. Participants will not be&#xD;
      identified personally in any reports or publications resulting from this study. Organizations&#xD;
      that may request to inspect and/or copy participants' research and medical records for&#xD;
      quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or their representatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eisai, Inc. The results of this study may be presented at meetings or in publications;&#xD;
           however, participants' identities will not be disclosed in these presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples may be collected, processed, and reported as necessary for purposes of the&#xD;
      study. In the event anyone involved with this study is exposed to participants' blood or&#xD;
      bodily fluids, it blood may be tested for evidence of hepatitis, AIDS, or other infections&#xD;
      without participants' further consent. Participants will be notified of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By signing the consent form, participants authorize the study doctor to release participants'&#xD;
      study-related records to Eisai, Inc., the FDA, the IRB, or any other regulatory authority. By&#xD;
      signing the consent form, participants authorize access to this confidential information.&#xD;
      Participants also authorize the release of their medical records to Weill Cornell Medical&#xD;
      College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital by any other hospitals or institutions where&#xD;
      participants might receive medical care of any kind while they are participating in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will not be charging participants any fees to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants or their insurance companies will be charged for continuing medical care and/or&#xD;
      hospitalization that is not a part of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated 200 dollars in cash within 2 weeks after completing the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should not expect anyone to pay them for pain, worry, lost income, or&#xD;
      non-medical care costs that occur from taking part in this research study. Participants&#xD;
      should expect no compensation or reimbursement for these costs or any risks and anxieties&#xD;
      associated with any such follow up care. Participants or their insurance companies will also&#xD;
      be charged for any continuing medical care and/or hospitalization that are not a part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
