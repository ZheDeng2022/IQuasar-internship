  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study may provide evidence for whether or not systemic lidocaine infusion offers&#xD;
      significant advantage over truncal regional blocks in gynecology oncology surgery patients in&#xD;
      terms of post-operative analgesia, recovery, and safety profile. Further, it may show whether&#xD;
      there is any increased efficacy of adding truncal regional block or systemic lidocaine versus&#xD;
      intrathecal opioid administration alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic administration of intravenous lidocaine has a number of observed and theoretical&#xD;
      advantages in the perioperative period. Systematic review of perioperative lidocaine&#xD;
      infusions has shown a reduction in early post-operative pain scores in patients undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, positive effects for GI recovery, reduction in post-operative opioid&#xD;
      requirements, reduction in the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting, and decreased&#xD;
      length of hospital stay. They have been shown to modulate the surgery-induced stress response&#xD;
      in colorectal surgery and abdominal hysterectomy. Thoracic epidural analgesia was better as&#xD;
      compared to intravenous lidocaine in a RCT of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal&#xD;
      surgery as part of an enhanced recovery program, though there was similar impact on recovery&#xD;
      of bowel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Truncal regional anesthesia has been utilized in open and closed abdominal operations with&#xD;
      various levels of efficacy. A statistically significant, though marginal clinical analgesic&#xD;
      benefit, by recorded opioid consumption, has been concluded by meta-analysis in patients&#xD;
      undergoing abdominal laparotomy, laparoscopy, or cesarean delivery after US-guided TAP block.&#xD;
      There was not found to be any additional benefit of TAP block in patients who received a&#xD;
      spinal anesthetic that included a long-acting opioid. The interpretation of results was noted&#xD;
      to be limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and analysis, though. The&#xD;
      conclusions of one study of open prostatectomy, as part of an ERP, was that neither systemic&#xD;
      lidocaine nor TAP block improved post-operative analgesia. Both IV lidocaine and TAP block&#xD;
      groups showed a reduction in post-operative opioid consumption, though to an insignificant&#xD;
      degree. It was noted as a possibility that the other interventions as part of the ERP, such&#xD;
      as scheduled administration of IV acetaminophen, could have resulted in the non-significant&#xD;
      decrease in post-operative opioid requirement. A recent review of the use of TAP blocks in&#xD;
      major gynecological, non-obstetric, surgery, including total abdominal hysterectomy,&#xD;
      concluded that TAP blocks may contribute to early post-operative analgesia, with marginal&#xD;
      additional benefit if multimodal analgesic regimens including NSAIDs and acetaminophen are&#xD;
      added. It was hypothesized by the authors that some of the limited benefit might be due to&#xD;
      the fact that US-guided TAP blocks are primarily useful for somatic pain, but that major&#xD;
      gynecologic surgery has a large visceral pain component. There are limited randomized studies&#xD;
      involving Quadratus Lumborum block (QL) at this time. QL block has shown improved analgesia&#xD;
      in abdominal operations as compared to TAP block and is thought to have potentially greater&#xD;
      relief of visceral pain. There is a case report of motor weakness following anterior, lateral&#xD;
      QL block for gynecologic laparoscopy, thought to be related to spread of the block to affect&#xD;
      the L2 dermatome on one side. It has not been determined if this is a common occurrence or&#xD;
      may be affected by the type of QL block performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study, truncal regional anesthesia was used in the UAB Gynecology-Oncology&#xD;
      Surgery Enhanced Recovery Program as an analgesic alternative for those who were not good&#xD;
      candidates for intrathecal opioid injection. A comparison of QL block versus systemic&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion or whether either of these interventions has utility over intrathecal&#xD;
      opioid administration alone has yet to be described.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Eligible patients will undergo current standard enhanced recovery protocol (ERP) gyn-oncology protocol. All patients will receive intrathecal morphine as part of the existing ERP. They will then be randomized to receive; either lidocaine infusion, regional anesthesia truncal block (quadratus lumborum block), or intrathecal morphine alone. Patients will be randomized into either lidocaine (group 1), QL block (group 2), or intrathecal opioid alone (group 3) groups. There will be blinding of the patient and personnel involved in data collection, and patients will undergo either a posterior QL block with local anesthetic (group 2) or simulated QL block (groups 1 and 3; subcutaneous local anesthetic only) pre-operatively. All patients will also undergo a loading dose of lidocaine (groups 1) or saline (group 2 and 3) followed by continuous lidocaine infusion in the lidocaine group (group 1). Primary and secondary endpoints will be measured post-operatively.</masking_description>
