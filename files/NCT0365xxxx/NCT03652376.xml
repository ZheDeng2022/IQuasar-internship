  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of removing eosinophils from peripheral blood (using&#xD;
      treatment with Benralizumab, which is approved for the treatment of severe eosoniphilic&#xD;
      asthma) on circulating dendritic cells in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase III clinical trials demonstrated that benralizumab treatment results in a significant&#xD;
      decrease in exacerbations and a significant increase in lung function and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. However, the precise underlying mechanisms leading&#xD;
      to this clinical benefit of benralizumab treatment are not completely understood. Dendritic&#xD;
      cells are key regulators of the adaptive and innate immune system. There is evidence that&#xD;
      eosinophils have a direct influence on the function of dendritic cells. In addition, there&#xD;
      are multiple indirect interactions between eosinophils and dendritic cells in asthma.&#xD;
      However, there is currently no information on the impact of benralizumab treatment and a&#xD;
      complete removal of circulating eosinophils on the number and phenotype of human dendritic&#xD;
      cells. Benralizumab is chosen for this study because it is the only anti-IL-5 biologic which&#xD;
      results in a complete removal of eosinophils from peripheral blood.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (n=20) will be treated with benralizumab 3 times every 4 weeks, and the effect of this treatment on dendritic cell concentrations and dendritic cell characteristics will be investigated 4 weeks after the last benralizumab dose and after a follow-up of 3 months. There will be a separate control group of subjects (not a treatment or placebo arm) without asthma not treated with benralizumab (to study dendritic cell concentrations and dendritic cell characteristics in patients without asthma and without benralizumab treatment).</intervention_model_description>
