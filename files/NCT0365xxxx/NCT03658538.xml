  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is characterized by lung injury and inflammation caused by noxious particles and gases,&#xD;
      including those emanating from cigarette smoke and air pollution. Despite the clear&#xD;
      detrimental impact of poor air quality on respiratory outcomes, regardless of smoking status,&#xD;
      to investigators' knowledge, there are no studied environmental interventions targeting&#xD;
      indoor air quality to improve respiratory health of smokers, thus ignoring a potential target&#xD;
      for harm reduction. Investigators propose a randomized controlled intervention trial to test&#xD;
      whether targeted reductions of multiple indoor pollutants (PM, SHS and NO2) in homes of&#xD;
      smokers with COPD will improve respiratory outcomes. Investigators have chosen a potent,&#xD;
      multimodal intervention (active air cleaners + Motivational intervention for SHS reduction)&#xD;
      in order to maximize the opportunity to prove that there is a health benefit to active&#xD;
      smokers with COPD from indoor air pollution reduction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with COPD who have higher exposure to indoor pollutants, including particulate matter&#xD;
      (PM), second hand smoke (SHS), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have worse respiratory morbidity&#xD;
      including a higher risk of exacerbations. These effects are not obscured by smoking habit.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, despite the clear detrimental impact of poor air quality on respiratory&#xD;
      outcomes, regardless of smoking status, to investigators' knowledge, there are no studied&#xD;
      environmental interventions targeting indoor air quality to improve respiratory health of&#xD;
      smokers, thus ignoring a potential target for harm reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a randomized controlled intervention trial to test whether targeted&#xD;
      reductions of multiple indoor pollutants (PM, SHS and NO2) in homes of smokers with COPD will&#xD;
      improve respiratory outcomes. Investigators have chosen a potent, multimodal intervention in&#xD;
      order to maximize the opportunity to prove that there is a health benefit to active smokers&#xD;
      with COPD from indoor air pollution reduction. After a one-month run in period in which all&#xD;
      participants will receive smoking cessation strategies including Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) and nicotine replacement therapy, participants unable to quit smoking (n=120) will have&#xD;
      1:1 randomization to receive either 1) multi-component environmental intervention (active&#xD;
      &quot;high-efficiency particulate air&quot;(HEPA) air cleaners + MI intervention for SHS reduction) or&#xD;
      2) sham air cleaners. All participants will continue to receive smoking cessation counseling&#xD;
      throughout the study period, including those that quit smoking during the run in period.&#xD;
      Investigators aim to determine whether a multi-component environmental intervention&#xD;
      (targeting PM, SHS and NO2 reduction) will improve respiratory morbidity (i.e., symptoms,&#xD;
      quality of life, lung function and exacerbation risk) (Specific Aim #1) and intermediate&#xD;
      outcome measures (i.e., markers of airway and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress)&#xD;
      (Specific Aim #2) in smokers with COPD. Investigators anticipate that results from this study&#xD;
      will inform clinical practice guidelines and health care policies aimed at reducing COPD&#xD;
      morbidity and may have broader implications for indoor environmental recommendations for&#xD;
      smokers with chronic disease.&#xD;
