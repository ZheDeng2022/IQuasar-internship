      The trial aims to demonstrate efficacy of the House Dust Mite SLIT-tablet versus placebo as&#xD;

      The trial aims to demonstrate efficacy of the HDM SLIT-tablet versus placebo as add-on&#xD;
      treatment in children and adolescents (5-17 years) with HDM allergic asthma based on&#xD;
      clinically relevant asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the trial will investigate if the treatment has an effect on asthma symptoms&#xD;
      including nightly awakenings due to asthma, asthma medication use, asthma control, lung&#xD;
      function, allergic rhinitis and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, quality of life (QoL) for subjects and caregivers will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-national&#xD;
      phase III trial conducted in Europe and North America. The treatment period will be&#xD;
      approximately 2 years. Subjects will receive a written asthma action plan.&#xD;
