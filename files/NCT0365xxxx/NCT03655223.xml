      Early Check provides voluntary screening of newborns for a selected panel of conditions. The&#xD;
      study has three main objectives: 1) develop and implement an approach to identify affected&#xD;
      infants, 2) address the impact on infants and families who screen positive, and 3) evaluate&#xD;
      the Early Check program. The Early Check screening will lead to earlier identification of&#xD;
      newborns with rare health conditions in addition to providing important data on the&#xD;
      implementation of this model program. Early diagnosis may result in health and development&#xD;
      benefits for the newborns. Infants who have newborn screening in North Carolina will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate, equating to over 120,000 eligible infants a year. Over 95% of&#xD;
      participants are expected to screen negative. Newborns who screen positive and their parents&#xD;
      are invited to additional research activities and services. Parents can enroll eligible&#xD;
      newborns on the Early Check electronic Research Portal. Screening tests are conducted on&#xD;
      residual blood from existing newborn screening dried blood spots. Confirmatory testing is&#xD;
      provided free-of-charge for infants who screen positive, and carrier testing is provided to&#xD;
      mothers of infants with fragile X. Affected newborns have a physical and developmental&#xD;
      evaluation. Their parents have genetic counseling and are invited to participate in surveys&#xD;
      and interviews. Ongoing evaluation of the program includes additional parent interviews.&#xD;

      &quot;Background&quot; Newborn screening (NBS) is a state-based public health program that screens&#xD;
      babies for a panel of over 30 conditions. It is estimated that about 12,500 newborns each&#xD;
      year in the United States are identified with one of the conditions screened in NBS, with&#xD;
      each child receiving the benefit of early treatment. For inclusion in newborn screening there&#xD;
      must be evidence that pre-symptomatic treatment is more effective than treatment after&#xD;
      clinical presentation. Most conditions proposed for newborn screening are rare, however, and&#xD;
      researchers have difficulty identifying sufficient numbers of babies to test the benefits of&#xD;
      pre-symptomatic identification and treatment. This lack of data is central to challenges that&#xD;
      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in&#xD;
      Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) faces when making federal recommendations to states on which&#xD;
      conditions should be included in newborn screening programs. ACHDNC is often asked to&#xD;
      consider conditions for inclusion in newborn screening for which there is limited evidence of&#xD;
      the natural history, prevalence, and especially about the benefit of early treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Rationale&quot; That evidence gap, especially in the rare disease context, makes it important to&#xD;
      develop and test a system to efficiently generate high-quality data about conditions that&#xD;
      have the potential to be candidates for state newborn screening. The Early Check program will&#xD;
      address this gap through screening newborns for a carefully selected panel of conditions,&#xD;
      offered under a research protocol with biological maternal permission, except in cases where&#xD;
      there is a transfer or loss of custody. In cases with a transfer/loss of custody, a legal&#xD;
      guardian can grant permission for the infant to join Early Check. Early Check will identify&#xD;
      pre-symptomatic infants with rare disorders, accelerate the acquisition of data on the early&#xD;
      natural history of rare disorders, and demonstrate the feasibility of a statewide program to&#xD;
      offer voluntary opt-in newborn screening for a panel of conditions not currently included in&#xD;
      states' standard newborn screening. Further, Early Check will facilitate the public health&#xD;
      'on-boarding' of conditions that are ultimately recommended for state newborn screening&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial panel of conditions screened in the Early Check program will change over the&#xD;
      course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current screening panel includes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy (DMD) and related neuromuscular conditions that result in increased CK-MM, and&#xD;
      fragile X syndrome (FXS). SMA and DMD causes progressive weakness and FXS causes intellectual&#xD;
      disability and behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMA has an approved treatment, nusinersen, which has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      infants with infantile-onset SMA. In addition, infants with a shorter disease duration&#xD;
      compared to a longer disease duration had improved outcomes after the start of treatment with&#xD;
      nusinersen, suggesting that earlier identification of SMA would benefit affected infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMD causes progressive inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle fiber degradation, and weakness.&#xD;
      DMD has traditionally been treated with physical therapy, corticosteroids, and ACE inhibitors&#xD;
      to delay the progression of skeletal muscle and cardiac damage. In 2016, the FDA approved&#xD;
      Eteplirsen (Exondys, 51) a promising treatment for a subset of patients with DMD. In 2017 the&#xD;
      FDA approved Emflaza, a corticosteroid also known as deflazacort. In 2019 the FDA approved&#xD;
      Vyondys 53 and in 2020 the FDA approved Viltepso for mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping.&#xD;
      Early diagnosis allows for treatments that might work best if used presymptomatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FXS does not have an approved treatment, although there is evidence that early behavioral&#xD;
      intervention services may improve outcomes. Given that the diagnosis of FXS is made on&#xD;
      average after the child is three years old, early identification through the screening of&#xD;
      newborns may provide benefit to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These conditions are rare; SMA has an estimated incidence of 1 in ~10,000, DMD has an&#xD;
      estimated incidence of 1 in 4000-5000 males, and FXS has an estimated incidence of 1 in&#xD;
      ~4,000 males and 1 in ~4,000-6,000 females. We also propose a sub-study with a secondary&#xD;
      permission process that offers mothers the choice to obtain additional data about the gene&#xD;
      that causes FXS: specifically, whether the infant has a premutation in the gene, which has an&#xD;
      uncertain impact on the infant's learning and development. This uncertainty is the reason why&#xD;
      premutation results are offered separately under a sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a wide range of rare disorders there is evidence that a delayed diagnosis (i.e., the&#xD;
      frequently-described diagnostic odyssey as parents search for a diagnosis) can have negative&#xD;
      health outcomes on children who miss out on treatments or interventions and on families who&#xD;
      experience negative psychosocial impact. Thus, the identification of affected newborns&#xD;
      through Early Check may improve health outcomes for the children and the wellbeing of their&#xD;
      parents and families. The evidence supporting the benefit of newborn identification of SMA is&#xD;
      strong enough that SMA was recently recommended by the ACHDNC to join the Recommended Uniform&#xD;
      Screening Panel (RUSP). In July 2018, the Secretary of HHS endorsed SMA to join the RUSP.&#xD;
      However, there is still some considerable time lag (historically multiple years) before SMA&#xD;
      newborn screening can be implemented by individual states. The inclusion of SMA on the Early&#xD;
      Check panel will provide important data to the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public&#xD;
      Health as they prepare for implementation, without delaying the access of infants with SMA to&#xD;
      the potential benefits of early diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future, Early Check will integrate new conditions to the screening platform as science&#xD;
      advances and funding is secured, and conditions may be removed from the screening platform as&#xD;
      associated research questions are answered and/or conditions achieve inclusion in state&#xD;
      newborn screening programs (as may be the case with SMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall research question is whether Early Check is an effective onboarding program to&#xD;
      inform newborn screening policy decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Check will also provide the infrastructure to facilitate translational research studies&#xD;
      and clinical trials. A dilemma in research in rare diseases is a lack of sufficient numbers&#xD;
      of presymptomatic patients. New treatments are being developed for rare diseases at a rapid&#xD;
      pace. Presymptomatic treatment often has the best potential for effective treatment.&#xD;
      Currently, early identification and intervention is based on the prenatal or early diagnosis&#xD;
      of a sibling of a patient with known disease, which greatly limits the numbers of&#xD;
      presymptomatic patients available for trials. Newborn screening has the greatest potential to&#xD;
      identify presymptomatic infants. Ultimately the research program should more rapidly advance&#xD;
      understanding of diseases and treatments, reducing the length of time for appropriate&#xD;
      conditions to be added to the recommended panel for inclusion in state newborn screening&#xD;
      programs, and provide early identification of affected newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this project will provide important information about the success of Early Check to&#xD;
      feasibly and acceptably implement a large scale, electronically-mediated research approach to&#xD;
      accurately identify affected infants. Results of the research activities and the ongoing&#xD;
      quality assessment will be used to inform the most efficient and judicious translation of&#xD;
      expanded newborn screening into public health in ways that maximize benefit and minimize&#xD;
      potential risk of harm to children and families.&#xD;
