  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this efficacy study is to evaluate how different web-based resources affect&#xD;
      parents' and children's sexual health knowledge; attitudes, efficacy, intentions, and&#xD;
      behaviors about parent-adolescent communication; attitudes about media messages; and media&#xD;
      message deconstruction skills. Parent consumer satisfaction with the resources will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the majority of the students will receive sexual education at least once between&#xD;
      seventh and twelfth grade, the content that they will receive varies greatly. Thus,&#xD;
      adolescents turn to other sources for information about sex including their parents and the&#xD;
      media. However, many parents face challenges in being prepared to discuss sex with their&#xD;
      adolescent child. While over eighty percent of parents are talking with their children ages&#xD;
      10-18 about issues related to sex, far fewer (60%) discuss more difficult sexual topics such&#xD;
      as birth control. These findings suggest that there is a need for evidence-based resources&#xD;
      that teach parents the skills needed to have effective conversations with their adolescent&#xD;
      children about sexual health topics and media messages that promote early and risky sex.&#xD;
