  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of bb2121 versus standard regimens in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (RRMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is anticipated to randomize approximately 381 subjects with RRMM. Approximately 254&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to Treatment Arm A and approximately 127 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to Treatment Arm B.&#xD;
