  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer treatment-induced bone loss and the subsequent risk of fractures in both men and women&#xD;
      impacts not just survivors' quality of life, but is also a significant burden on national&#xD;
      health care. Clinical studies have reported that moderate-intensity resistance exercises&#xD;
      prevent a decline in bone health in female cancer survivors, and that strength training may&#xD;
      reduce complications associated with cancer such as fatigue, muscle wasting, and bone loss.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, only a small percentage of women who have had cancer, engage in and adhere to&#xD;
      a strength training exercise routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed an internet-based application, Thrivors, that guides cancer&#xD;
      survivors through exercise routines with light-to-moderate strength training in the home&#xD;
      setting, and connects them to survivorship resources. In this Phase I proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop and deploy an enhanced version, Thrivors+BH, that disseminates&#xD;
      resistance training exercises specifically impacting bone health (BH), integrated with&#xD;
      video-based interactive feedback and tracking of adherence to exercise routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to validate Thrivors+BH as a novel tool to bridge the gaps between cancer&#xD;
      survivorship, physical activity, value-based care and health care organizations (providers&#xD;
      and payers), to positively impact bone health in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

      Significance: Cancer treatment-induced bone loss and the subsequent risk of fractures in both&#xD;
      men and women is a significant burden on national health care. The number of cancer survivors&#xD;
      in the United States will reach 18 million by 2022 and by 2025, the projected burden of&#xD;
      osteoporosis is $25.3 billion. Cancer patients treated with medications that lower hormone&#xD;
      levels face an increased risk of fractures. Clinical studies report that moderate- intensity&#xD;
      resistance exercises prevent a decline in bone health in female cancer survivors, and that&#xD;
      strength training may reduce complications associated with cancer such as fatigue, muscle&#xD;
      wasting, and bone loss. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of female cancer survivors&#xD;
      engage in and adhere to a strength training exercise routine. Several factors account for&#xD;
      this low level of engagement such as poor awareness of the benefits of exercise, lack of&#xD;
      motivation, and the lack of affordable and easily accessible exercise programs designed for&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Internet-based self-managed programs of exercises and guidance can&#xD;
      potentially address these problems, and can be scaled for broader dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: The Thrivors internet-based platform seeks to shift the current paradigm of poor&#xD;
      adherence to exercise by providing an affordable and accessible means of improving outcomes&#xD;
      for cancer survivors. The proposed product, Thrivors+BH, will be a first-of-its-kind offering&#xD;
      of clinically validated bone health exercises that can be customized to a cancer survivor's&#xD;
      pain and energy levels, with several novel interactive feedback features. The product will&#xD;
      also have supportive modules for connecting with a community of other users, mindfulness&#xD;
      training, nutritional advice and a repository of educational information. The Thrivors&#xD;
      platform is scalable, device-agnostic, and allows analysis of de-identified usage data. With&#xD;
      commercialization potential for healthcare providers and health insurance payers, Thrivors&#xD;
      provides a value-based care delivery model focused on outcomes. There are multiple important&#xD;
      physiologic and psychosocial secondary conditions that could be positively impacted by the&#xD;
      Thrivors platform. For this specific application, the investigators will focus on adherence&#xD;
      to bone health exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized that breast cancer survivors' adherence to an&#xD;
      exercise regimen for bone health can be improved by enhancing the interactive and&#xD;
      customizable features of a cloud-based, device-agnostic delivery method. To test the&#xD;
      hypothesis and to establish the technical feasibility of the product, the investigators&#xD;
      propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Develop an enhanced participant experience platform for bone health-specific&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Thrivors+BH, a module will be developed for participants to input pain and energy levels,&#xD;
      enabling real-time customization of exercise regimens. Modules of clinically validated bone&#xD;
      health exercises with instructional videos will be developed. Additionally, participants will&#xD;
      be able upload and send videos of themselves exercising for feedback and assessment. A&#xD;
      Thrivors Basic version that lacks customization and video content will be developed. Both&#xD;
      versions will contain bone health educational content, mindfulness and nutrition resources.&#xD;
      Milestones: Over a 2-month period, development, usability testing (assessing content,&#xD;
      features, input controls, navigational ease and click-through capabilities) and refinement&#xD;
      will be completed, to enable deployment in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Measure participant adherence and engagement. The two versions of the&#xD;
      platform will be deployed in a 20-week, two-arm randomized controlled trial of 50 breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Adherence to exercise sessions (primary outcome) and platform usage will be&#xD;
      measured by platform software, while user engagement (secondary outcomes) will be assessed by&#xD;
      surveys. Milestones: Differences between primary and secondary outcomes for the control and&#xD;
      intervention groups will be evaluated. Usage statistics, motivational responses and user&#xD;
      feedback will be used to further refine platform features and content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this study will help validate the utility of the Thrivors platform in&#xD;
      improving cancer survivors' adherence and engagement to exercise routines that positively&#xD;
      impact post-treatment recovery. In the near-term, the findings will inform the design of a&#xD;
      12-month Phase II study to evaluate changes in biomarkers of bone health. In the longer term,&#xD;
      the project aligns with the business goal to disseminate the Thrivors platform to a larger&#xD;
      population of male and female cancer survivors across ethnic/racial minority groups, rural&#xD;
      populations, and low socioeconomic status groups. The project also aligns with the mission of&#xD;
      the NCI to develop innovative technology and service delivery models that increase the&#xD;
      adoption, uptake, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions to improve public&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
