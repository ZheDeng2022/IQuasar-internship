  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal hypertension (i.e. blood pressure values &gt;120/70 or 10% higher than diurnal values,&#xD;
      as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ABPM) is particularly frequent in renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients (RTR), despite the use of antihypertensive drugs. Since RTR are also&#xD;
      affected by several sleep disorders (like insomnia, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnoea)&#xD;
      that frankly impair their quality of sleep (SQ), the aim of the present study is to ascertain&#xD;
      whether a relationship exists between nocturnal hypertension and SQ. In fact, both nocturnal&#xD;
      hypertension and sleep disorders may favour the onset or the progression of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, the first cause of death in RTR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects the great majority of renal transplant recipients (RTR) and its&#xD;
      persistence may negatively influence the outcome of the graft. Unfortunately, its diagnosis&#xD;
      is not univocal since office measurement of blood pressure (BP) may reveal a &quot;white coat&#xD;
      hypertension&quot; in normotensive subjects, or might not detect hypertension if pills are taken&#xD;
      immediately before BP control. Therefore for a correct diagnosis the use of ambulatory BP&#xD;
      monitoring (ABPM) is strongly advised. Recent studies employing this methodology have shown&#xD;
      that the prevalence of nocturnal hypertension (i.e. blood pressure values &gt;120/70 or 10%&#xD;
      higher than diurnal values) affects a great number of renal transplant recipients (RTR), even&#xD;
      despite the use of antihypertensive drugs (&quot;non-dipper&quot; patients). It is well known that&#xD;
      nocturnal hypertension enhances the development of cardiovascular diseases, but it is not&#xD;
      clear whether (and to what extent) it also affects the quality of sleep of these patients.&#xD;
      Sleep disturbances like insomnia, restless legs syndrome and sleep apnoea, in fact, are&#xD;
      particularly common in RTR, despite these patients report significantly better quality of&#xD;
      life compared to patients with chronic renal failure under conservative or dialysis&#xD;
      treatment. The working hypothesis of the present study is to evaluate whether any&#xD;
      relationship exists between nocturnal hypertension and sleep quality, since also sleep&#xD;
      disorders may favour the onet and the progression of cardiovascular diseases, the first cause&#xD;
      of death in RTR with functioning graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out on all the available RTR in regular follow-up at the DH of&#xD;
      Nephrology and Renal Transplantation of the University Federico II of Naples (Italy).&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: age &gt;18 years, renal transplant vintage &gt;1 year, stable renal&#xD;
      function in the last 6 month, no change in immunosuppressive nor antihypertensive treatment&#xD;
      in the last 3 months, no intercurrent infection in the last 3 months. Twenty-four hour ABPM&#xD;
      will be performed during the regular follow-up of patients in the investigator's Unit.&#xD;
      Hypertension will be diagnosed when the patient takes antihypertensive drugs or when his . BP&#xD;
      is &gt;130/80 mmHg (24-hour average value), or &gt;135/85 (average values of daily BP) or &gt;120/70&#xD;
      (average values of nocturnal BP). The patient will be considered &quot;non-dipper&quot; when the ratio&#xD;
      Systolic nocturnal BP/Systolic diurnal BP is &gt;0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep quality will be evaluated through a validated version of the Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire a self-rated questionnaire, consisting of 19 questions which assess a wide&#xD;
      variety of factors relating to sleep quality, including estimates of sleep duration and&#xD;
      latency and of frequency and severity of specific sleep-related problems. These 19 items are&#xD;
      grouped into seven-component scores, each weighted equally on a 0-3 scale. The seven&#xD;
      components are then summed to yield a global index (PSQI) ranging between 0 and 21; higher&#xD;
      scores indicate a worse sleep quality (&gt;5, poor sleepers; &lt;5, good sleepers). The seven&#xD;
      components of the PSQI are subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual&#xD;
      sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction.&#xD;
      The relationship between nocturnal hypertension and sleep quality will be evaluated either by&#xD;
      bivariate analysis and by multiple linear regression analyses. In the multivariate model, all&#xD;
      the variables associated to an elevated night/day systolic pressure ratio will be considered&#xD;
      if the P value is 0.10 or less at bivariate analysis. The relationship between increased&#xD;
      night/day SBP ratio and increased PSQI will be also investigated by multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression model.&#xD;
