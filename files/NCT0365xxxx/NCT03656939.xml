    <textblock>
      This observational study based on a population-based EHR database in Yinzhou district of&#xD;
      Ningbo city in China is to estimate incidence rates of seizures (including febrile seizures),&#xD;
      urticaria and angioedema, apnea, and fever among Chinese children after receiving Prevenar&#xD;
      13. In addition, a validation study including validation of International classification of&#xD;
      diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) codes or ICD-10 code based algorithm for identifying all&#xD;
      safety outcomes of interest and a prospective cohort study in a sub-population of the main&#xD;
      study will be conducted in order to offset the potential biased results from the main study&#xD;
      because of potential misclassification of the safety outcomes of interest due to miscoding&#xD;
      and/or undercoding of ICD-10 codes used to identify these safety outcomes in the EHR&#xD;
      database.&#xD;

        <title>Incidence Rate (Per 1000 Person Days) of Urticaria and Angioedema Through 0 to 7 Days After Dose 3</title>
        <description>Incidence rate was calculated as the number of urticaria and angioedema events experienced during the specified risk window (0-7 days post-vaccination) divided by the observed time at risk, multiply by 1000. Urticaria represents an allergic reaction. Angioedema is an area of swelling (edema) of the lower layer of skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes.</description>

        <title>Incidence Rate (Per 1000 Person Days) of Urticaria and Angioedema Through 0 to 7 Days After Dose 4</title>
        <description>Incidence rate was calculated as the number of urticaria and angioedema events experienced during the specified risk window (0-7 days post-vaccination) divided by the observed time at risk, multiply by 1000. Urticaria represents an allergic reaction. Angioedema is an area of swelling (edema) of the lower layer of skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes.</description>

        <title>Incidence Rate (Per 1000 Person Days) of Urticaria and Angioedema Through 0 to 7 Days After All Doses</title>
        <description>Incidence rate was calculated as the number of urticaria and angioedema events experienced during the specified risk window (0-7 days post-vaccination) divided by the observed time at risk, multiply by 1000. Urticaria represents an allergic reaction. Angioedema is an area of swelling (edema) of the lower layer of skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes.</description>

Urticaria represents an allergic reaction. Angioedema is an area of swelling (edema) of the lower layer of skin and tissue just under the skin or mucous membranes.</description>
