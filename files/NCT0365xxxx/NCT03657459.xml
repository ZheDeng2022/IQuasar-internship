  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of recognition of HF danger signs and lack of understanding of how to control and&#xD;
      minimize danger signs could lead to their escalation and prompt all-cause and HF-related&#xD;
      health care resource utilization (HCRU). Investigators hypothesize that patients must&#xD;
      understand HF danger signs to have self-confidence in recognizing them and in taking steps to&#xD;
      minimize or eliminate their occurrence post hospital discharge. Investigators will determine&#xD;
      if video education in HF danger signs recognition and control prior to discharge (and&#xD;
      post-discharge) reduces all-cause and HF-related HCRU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most frequently cited danger signs of heart failure (HF) are new onset or worsening of&#xD;
      fatigue, dyspnea and edema. In previous research, patients did not recognize worsening HF,&#xD;
      due to 3 primary reasons: (1) danger signs were non-specific and misinterpreted as stress, an&#xD;
      external force or another comorbidity, (2) danger signs were unrecognized due to the subtle&#xD;
      nature of worsening status, or (3) when patients eliminated or minimized activities that&#xD;
      prompted danger signs, they interpreted the results as improvement in status. Lack of&#xD;
      recognition of HF danger signs and lack of understanding of how to control and minimize&#xD;
      danger signs could lead to their escalation and prompt all-cause and HF-related health care&#xD;
      resource utilization (HCRU). Investigators hypothesize that patients must understand HF&#xD;
      danger signs to have self-confidence in recognizing them and in taking steps to minimize or&#xD;
      eliminate their occurrence post hospital discharge. The purposes of this trial are to&#xD;
      determine if video education in HF danger signs recognition and control prior to discharge&#xD;
      (and post-discharge) reduces all-cause and HF-related health care resource utilization. The&#xD;
      intervention will be administered during hospitalization, and patients and family members&#xD;
      will receive a link to a website and a DVD to review videos as often as desired&#xD;
      post-discharge. The primary end-point is 30-day HF-related hospitalization. 732 patients (658&#xD;
      + 10% attrition) with decompensated HF will be enrolled from multiple hospitals.&#xD;
