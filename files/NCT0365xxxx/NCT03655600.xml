      This study seeks to determine the feasibility of recruiting and training participants in&#xD;
      self-acupressure, for women undergoing primary breast cancer surgery or delayed&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery. The study seeks to determine also if self-acupressure is effective in&#xD;
      reducing the need for opioids post-surgery and the effects on other life factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic pain following breast cancer surgery is a significant problem for women. There are&#xD;
      over 3 million women in the United States living as breast cancer survivors. Sustained&#xD;
      post-surgical pain is one of the most troubling side-effects for these women and continues to&#xD;
      affect around 25-60% of breast cancer survivors, with approximately half classifying pain as&#xD;
      being moderate to severe. Chronic cancer-related pain is associated with increased fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, sleep disruption, and decreased quality of life and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pre- and post-operative pain are significant predictors of sustained pain following&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery, but are insufficiently managed. The etiology of persistent breast&#xD;
      cancer related pain following surgery is multifactorial and may be the direct effect of&#xD;
      cancer or cancer treatment (e.g. surgery). Known risk factors for this chronic pain include&#xD;
      younger age, higher body mass index, type of surgery (axillary lymph node dissection), and&#xD;
      presence of a mood disturbance. Cancer patients may develop pain from neurotoxicity from&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation may also play a role, and causes persistent pain in 13 -&#xD;
      26% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the most significant factors that determine persistent pain following breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery are the degree of pre-surgical pain and acute post-surgical pain. Recent reports have&#xD;
      suggested that treatments aimed at reducing these factors may be effective at preventing the&#xD;
      development of chronic pain following breast cancer surgery. Existing pre-emptive treatments&#xD;
      to reduce this acute surgical pain include the use of nerve blocks and/or pharmacologic&#xD;
      agents such as opioids, NSAIDs, ketamine, and gabapentin. While some pharmacologic approaches&#xD;
      yield clinically meaningful reductions in post-operative pain in the research setting, there&#xD;
      remains controversy in the field. For example in breast surgery specifically, a recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis showed that thoracic paravertebral blocks have a statistically significant&#xD;
      effect on reducing chronic pain, but the effect was not clinically meaningful and was&#xD;
      associated with procedural risks such as vascular puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the risk of developing pain following breast cancer surgery, women also report&#xD;
      increased acute and chronic surgical pain following breast reconstruction surgery. In one of&#xD;
      the first studies to examine pain post-reconstruction surgery, Wallace et al. found that the&#xD;
      incidence of pain one year following breast cancer mastectomy plus reconstruction was 49% as&#xD;
      compared to 31% for mastectomy alone. This increase was both statistically and clinically&#xD;
      significant, and remains a current undertreated problem. Overall many women develop&#xD;
      persistent pain after breast cancer surgery following either tumor removal or breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. We know that this is influenced by acute pre- and post-surgical pain, but&#xD;
      unfortunately the existing measures available for clinicians to prevent persistent&#xD;
      post-surgical pain are not adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are commonly used analgesics in the perioperative surgical setting; however, they are&#xD;
      accompanied by significant limitations. Opioids are the most common pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention used for acute perioperative surgical pain. They are known to decrease pain via&#xD;
      activation of specific receptors (mu, delta, and kappa), which inhibit neuronal firing&#xD;
      resulting in reduced nociceptive activity. Although widely prescribed there are significant&#xD;
      limitations for opioid use including tolerance, addiction, diversion, and even mortality.&#xD;
      There were over 33,000 opioid deaths in the US in 2016 alone and the majority of these have&#xD;
      been from opioid prescriptions. The US is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic wherein&#xD;
      Americans constitute only 5% of the global population yet we consume over 80% of the world's&#xD;
      opioid supply. Unfortunately, while opioids are needed in the surgical setting, the problem&#xD;
      of increased opioid use is itself compounded by surgery. Patients receiving even low-risk&#xD;
      surgeries are 44% more likely to become de novo long-term opioid consumers. With respect to&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery, the odds of developing chronic opioid consumption following mastectomy&#xD;
      increases by approximately 300%. Although the reason(s) for developing chronic opioid&#xD;
      consumption are largely unknown, patients that receive a new opioid prescription within 7&#xD;
      days post-surgery, as compared to those who do not, are more likely to still be receiving&#xD;
      opioids one year out. Thus acute pre-surgical and post-surgical pain, in addition to being&#xD;
      risk factors for persistent chronic pain, may also increase the probability of becoming a&#xD;
      chronic opioid consumer. There is an unmet need for analgesic interventions that are opioid&#xD;
      sparing in the breast cancer surgical setting. This study proposes that acupressure may be&#xD;
      one such option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupressure Self-administered acupressure is one possible safe, self-management technique&#xD;
      which may be effective for improving post-operative pain and opioid consumption. Acupressure,&#xD;
      a technique derived from acupuncture, is a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in&#xD;
      which pressure is applied to specific acupoints on the body using a finger or small device,&#xD;
      to treat disease. Prior research has demonstrated that acupressure, self-administered by&#xD;
      women with breast cancer, significantly reduced clinically significant pain by approximately&#xD;
      one-third and was superior to standard therapies. Moreover, these self-rated improvements&#xD;
      were maintained up to one month after treatment was discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupressure has been found to be effective for acute post-surgical pain, but no studies have&#xD;
      examined the impact on the development of chronic pain or acute and chronic opioid use in any&#xD;
      patient population. Four previous studies in diverse patient populations (appendectomy,&#xD;
      cesarean section, gastric cancer, and knee arthroscopy) have found that acupressure delivered&#xD;
      by an acupressure practitioner was able to significantly decrease post-surgical pain compared&#xD;
      to either usual care or sham acupressure from as early as 60 minutes after surgery to as long&#xD;
      as 3 days post-surgery, however no study has measured pain beyond 3 days post-surgery.29-32&#xD;
      As such, it is unknown what impact if any acupressure has on the development of chronic pain&#xD;
      post-surgery. Also, no study has examined the impact of acupressure on either acute or&#xD;
      chronic opioid use. In contrast, the one study that used an acuband (a band worn around the&#xD;
      wrist with a nub over the acupressure point to provide stimulation) at the P6 point commonly&#xD;
      used to treat nausea and vomiting had no impact on post-surgical pain 24 hours after&#xD;
      receiving an appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with a lack of research on acupressure's impact on chronic pain and opioid use the&#xD;
      impact of this intervention on breast cancer patients undergoing surgery (mastectomy,&#xD;
      lumpectomy, delayed or immediate reconstruction) is unknown. This study is a pilot randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to explore this intervention in 72 breast cancer patients scheduled for&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
