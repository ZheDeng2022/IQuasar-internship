  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive either different dosages of HK-001 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio&#xD;
      in 1 of the 7 dose cohorts. After single dose administration, followed by an independent Data&#xD;
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting for safety assessments (including the available&#xD;
      plasma pharmacokinetic profile), the subjects will be allowed to receive (Z)-BP or placebo&#xD;
      twice a day orally at the study site for 14 consecutive days and follow up on the 28th day&#xD;
      after the last dose administration by a site visit. The study drugs (including placebo) will&#xD;
      be administered at the study site by following the investigator's instructions to either&#xD;
      perform blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation or maximize the treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 7 cohorts and subjects will be randomized into cohorts consisting of 8 subjects&#xD;
      each (6 active and 2 placebo controls per cohort). Dose cohorts will be escalated&#xD;
      sequentially from low to high dose (50 mg, BID; 100 mg, BID; 150 mg, BID; 225 mg, BID; 300&#xD;
      mg, BID; 400 mg, BID; 525 mg, BID) by following a modified Fibonacci sequence, and based on&#xD;
      the decision of an independent DSMB at a set time point. Following all subjects of a cohort&#xD;
      complete the safety and PK evaluation after receiving the last dose administration, a cohort&#xD;
      at the next dose level will be launched if the DSMB does not identify significant safety&#xD;
      concerns after reviewing safety data and PK profiles.&#xD;
