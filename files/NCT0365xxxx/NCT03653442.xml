  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal (or neuraxial) anaesthesia is still considered the first choice technique for elective&#xD;
      Caesarean section as simple, quick, reliable and cheap. However, this anaesthetic method can&#xD;
      be burdened by maternal hypotension with significant maternal and foetal implications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension induced by neuraxial anaesthesia (NA-induced hypotension) is defined as systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (SBP) less than 100 mmHg or a decrease of 20-30% from baseline values. The&#xD;
      incidence of hypotension could exceed 71% and can cause, if serious and prolonged, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, lost of consciousness, placental hypoperfusion and foetal acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two alternative hypotheses to explain why hypotension might be so commonly&#xD;
      diagnosed after regional analgesia during labour: preload reduction theory and afterload&#xD;
      reduction theory. A non-invasive continue haemodynamic monitoring could be useful in&#xD;
      detecting pregnant women with a positive preoperative supine stress, at increased risk for&#xD;
      clinically significant hypotension during Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. These&#xD;
      women seem more likely to benefit from optimizing the administration of fluids and&#xD;
      vasoconstrictors to maintain pressure and cardiac output at basal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of clinical need of therapy to counteract symptomatic hypotension (dependant&#xD;
      variable) will be sought by using regression logistic analysis. Putative variable to include&#xD;
      in the model will be selected through clinical and statistical criteria. Univariate screening&#xD;
      will be performed assuming the usual cut-off of p&lt;0,1 and taking into account the biological&#xD;
      relevance. The final variable to challenge in the multivariate model will be selected&#xD;
      according to the parsimony criteria in order to avoid overfitting and multicollinearity.&#xD;
