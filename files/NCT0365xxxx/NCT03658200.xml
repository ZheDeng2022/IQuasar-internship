      Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is a non-invasive imaging tool widely used for various&#xD;
      indications. Contrast media (CM) is used to enhance the intravascular lumen and organ&#xD;
      parenchyma, depending on the indication. Recent technical advances in CT scan techniques&#xD;
      allow for a very fast scan acquisition with substantially increased image quality in terms of&#xD;
      temporal and spatial resolution. However, with faster scan acquisition, challenges arise with&#xD;
      regard to CM bolus timing. The risk of outrunning the CM bolus in these fast acquisitions is&#xD;
      higher, resulting in a decreased intravascular attenuation and subsequent hypothetical&#xD;
      increase in non-diagnostic image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have investigated the reduction of CM volume. When reducing the CM volume,&#xD;
      the total injection time decreases and the window of peak enhancement shortens and becomes&#xD;
      more narrow. The latter increases when injecting small CM volumes with higher flow rates.&#xD;
      Although the peak enhancement increases, the window of peak enhancement decreases more&#xD;
      rapidly. Thus, when administered with the same flow rate, the peak of the enhancement curve&#xD;
      will be lower, narrower and faster compared to larger CM volumes. This, in combination with&#xD;
      the faster scan acquisition makes the timing of the start of the scan highly important, since&#xD;
      scanning at the peak enhancement is necessary to achieve a diagnostic image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New bolus tracking auto-delay software (Fully Automated Scan Technique, FAST, Siemens&#xD;
      Healthineers) automatically estimates the delay needed to scan at the peak of the enhancement&#xD;
      curve. With help of this software, the optimal individual scan delay and enhancement can be&#xD;
      achieved, and the risk of non-diagnostic scans should decrease. Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the performance of the Bolus Tracking Auto-Delay (FAST) software in patients&#xD;
      receiving a standard chest CT with regard to the number of non-diagnostic scans (&lt; 300 HU)&#xD;
      and compare this with standard care (manual set pre-scan delay).&#xD;

      Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is a non-invasive imaging tool widely used for various&#xD;
      indications. Contrast media (CM) is used to enhance the intravascular lumen and organ&#xD;
      parenchyma, depending on the indication. Recent technical advances in CT scan techniques&#xD;
      allow for a very fast scan acquisition with substantially increased image quality in terms of&#xD;
      temporal and spatial resolution. These faster scan times account for a significant reduction&#xD;
      in radiation dose, which is desirable in light of the &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot;&#xD;
      (ALARA) principle. Another advantage of the newer 'high-end' scanners is the use of lower&#xD;
      tube voltages and lower CM volumes, since many studies have shown that CM volumes can be&#xD;
      reduced with usage of lower tube voltages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with faster scan acquisition, challenges arise with regard to CM bolus timing. The&#xD;
      risk of outrunning the CM bolus in these fast acquisitions is higher, subsequently leading to&#xD;
      a decreased or even non-diagnostic enhancement (in Hounsfield Units (HU)). In addition,&#xD;
      decreased CM volumes due to usage of lower tube voltages also add to the risk of outrunning&#xD;
      the bolus. When reducing the CM bolus, the injection time decreases and the window of peak&#xD;
      enhancement is shorter and more narrow. Also, when injecting these smaller CM volumes at&#xD;
      higher flow rates, although the peak enhancement is increased, the window of peak enhancement&#xD;
      decreases more rapidly. Thus, when administered with the same flow rate, the peak of the&#xD;
      enhancement curve will be lower, narrower and faster compared to larger CM volumes. This, in&#xD;
      combination with the faster scan acquisition makes the timing of the start of the scan (scan&#xD;
      start delay) highly important, since scanning at the peak enhancement is necessary to achieve&#xD;
      a diagnostic image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine scan delay, two techniques frequently used in daily clinical routine are the&#xD;
      'test bolus' and 'bolus tracking' technique. With the first, a smaller CM bolus is&#xD;
      administered before the actual scan, and the time to peak of the intravascular enhancement is&#xD;
      determined with help of dedicated software (DynEva, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim,&#xD;
      Germany). When using the 'bolus tracking' technique, no additional CM volume is administered.&#xD;
      A region of interest (ROI) is placed in a large artery of interest (e.g. ascending or&#xD;
      descending aorta), and a threshold enhancement is set prior to the scan (e.g. 100 HU).&#xD;
      Repetitive low dose scans are acquired at the same level and the arrival of the CM bolus is&#xD;
      followed. Once the threshold is reached, the scanner automatically starts the scan. Between&#xD;
      reaching the threshold and the actual start of the scan, a manual post-tracking delay is set&#xD;
      prior to scanning. This delay is necessary for both the table movement of the scanner to the&#xD;
      start of the scan and the breath hold command. The problem is that this manual post-tracking&#xD;
      delay is set prior to the scan, without information of the patient's cardiovascular dynamics&#xD;
      (e.g. cardiac output). Since cardiac output can vary greatly inter- and intra-patient, this&#xD;
      fixed post-tracking delay may not be appropriate for all patients. Scanning with a&#xD;
      sub-optimal post tracking delay could potentially result in suboptimal arterial enhancement&#xD;
      and insufficient diagnostic quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With new bolus tracking auto-delay software (Fully Automated Scan Technique, FAST, Siemens&#xD;
      Healthineers) the incidence of scans made at a suboptimal attenuation could be reduced. This&#xD;
      software is similar to the 'bolus tracking' technique, the difference is that the manual&#xD;
      post-tracking delay is calculated automatically by the software. During the low-dose&#xD;
      repetitive scans at the level of the ROI, the attenuation in the ROI is used to predict the&#xD;
      optimal enhancement curve. The software takes the injection protocol, tube voltage and&#xD;
      patient parameters into account. A previously acquired database of numerous enhancement&#xD;
      curves is consulted to predict a best fitted enhancement curve of the individual patient. The&#xD;
      software then calculates the optimal post-tracking scan delay to scan at the peak&#xD;
      enhancement. Thus, the optimal individual scan delay and enhancement based on the patients&#xD;
      physiology can be achieved, and the risk of non-diagnostic scans should decrease. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study aims to evaluate the performance of the FAST software in patients receiving&#xD;
      standard chest CT with regard to the number of non-diagnostic scans (&lt; 300 HU) and compare&#xD;
      this with standard care (manual set pre-scan delay).&#xD;
