  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ID-Cap System is classified as an ingestion event marker (IEM), a Class II medical&#xD;
      device. The system is intended to record time-stamped ingestions with the ingestible sensor,&#xD;
      ID-Tag which transmits a signal to a wearable device, the ID-Cap Reader. In this study, 12-18&#xD;
      subjects will ingest capsules containing ingestible sensors while wearing the Reader and&#xD;
      being observed in a clinic setting.&#xD;
