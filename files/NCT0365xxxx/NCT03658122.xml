    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the usefulness of Parent-Child Care (PC-CARE), a brief behavioral&#xD;
      intervention for children with difficult behaviors. It will test whether PC-CARE can help&#xD;
      families who talk to their pediatricians about behavior problems by improving parent-child&#xD;
      relationships, decreasing disruptive behaviors, and improving parents' knowledge and use of&#xD;
      effective parenting strategies. Pediatricians who observe or are told their 2-10-year-old&#xD;
      patients have difficult behaviors, such as aggression, disobedience, tantrums, trouble&#xD;
      focusing, and/or angry and irritable behaviors, will refer patients to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a first assessment, parents will complete questionnaires about the child's behaviors,&#xD;
      parents and children will participate in a 12-minute play observation, and children will have&#xD;
      their heart rate and blood flow measured during a 6-minute play observation. After this&#xD;
      assessment, families will be randomly assigned either to begin PC-CARE right away or to wait&#xD;
      about two months to begin PC-CARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who begin right away will attend weekly one-hour appointments for six weeks. During&#xD;
      appointments, parents and children report on difficult behaviors from the week, learn new&#xD;
      positive communication, regulation, and behavior management skills, are observed during a&#xD;
      4-minute play observation, are coached to use the skills (i.e., have the therapist tell the&#xD;
      parent how to use skills while interacting with the child), and discuss how to incorporate&#xD;
      these skills at home. Parents and children are also asked to play together for five minutes&#xD;
      daily at home. At the end of the six weeks, parents and children will complete the same&#xD;
      assessments they did at the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who wait to begin PC-CARE will be asked to complete the same questionnaires and&#xD;
      observations again before beginning PC-CARE. They will then receive the same treatment as&#xD;
      families who began PC-CARE right away. All families will be called one- and six- months after&#xD;
      ending PC-CARE to complete a brief questionnaire about the child's behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parents' positive communication with children will improve with PC-CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parents will report less parenting stress after PC-CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parents will report fewer child behavior problems after PC-CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Children will show lower stress reactivity (heart rate and blood flow) after PC-CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Parents will report similar levels of child behavior problems one- and six-months after&#xD;
           completing PC-CARE&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current study proposes offering Parent-Child Care (PC-CARE; Timmer et al., 2018), a brief&#xD;
      (6-session) behavioral intervention, to children from 2-10 years of age within the primary&#xD;
      care building with the goal of improving parent-child relationships, decreasing child&#xD;
      disruptive behaviors, and improving parents' knowledge and use of effective parenting&#xD;
      strategies, as well as better integrating behavioral health treatments within the primary&#xD;
      care setting. To assess the acceptability of integrating these services within primary care,&#xD;
      the investigators will examine the proportion of families who participate in treatment out of&#xD;
      the total number referred, and the proportion of families completing treatment. To determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of PC-CARE in meeting treatment goals, this study uses a randomized control&#xD;
      trial study design with a PC-CARE treatment group and a waitlist control group. To better&#xD;
      understand the effects of the intervention and potential mechanisms related to improvements&#xD;
      in children's disruptive behaviors, the study uses multiple assessment modalities, including&#xD;
      parent-report questionnaires, behavioral observations, and physiological data during&#xD;
      parent-child interactions. The investigators will additionally assess maintenance of&#xD;
      treatment gains by conducting follow-up assessments at one- and six-months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Increase acceptability of integrative primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The proportion of families who agree to treatment with be at least 75% of those who are&#xD;
      referred, and the retention rate for completing PC-CARE will be at least 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Caregiver-child dyads that receive PC-CARE when compared to the waitlist control group&#xD;
      will report higher levels of satisfaction with their primary care provider and medical office&#xD;
      (as measured by the Pediatrics Satisfaction Survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Improve pediatricians' ability to detect child mental health service needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: The total number of referrals per month will increase over the two-year grant period;&#xD;
      demonstrating pediatricians' enhanced ability to recognize the need for behavioral services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Improve parenting skills&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Caregiver-child dyads that receive PC-CARE when compared to the waitlist control group&#xD;
      will show significant increases in positive communication skills (as measured by PC-CARE&#xD;
      observational coding) from pre to post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Caregivers that receive PC-CARE will report higher levels of parenting competence (as&#xD;
      measured by the Brief Parenting Stress Index [PSI4-SF]) compared to the waitlist control&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Improve child behavioral problems and self-regulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. PC-CARE trained parents, compared to the waitlist control group, will report significant&#xD;
      decreases in levels of child behavior problems (as measured by the Weekly Assessment of Child&#xD;
      Behavior [WACB] and Behavior Assessment Schedule for Children, 3rd Edition [BASC-3]) from pre&#xD;
      to post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. For children with trauma histories, those who complete PC-CARE with their caregivers,&#xD;
      compared to the waitlist control group, will show improvements in trauma symptoms from pre-&#xD;
      to post-intervention (as measured by the Early Childhood Traumatic Stress Screen [ECTSS] or&#xD;
      the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screener [CATS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. After completing PC-CARE with their caregivers, children will show lower levels of&#xD;
      autonomic stress reactivity compared to their pre-treatment levels and compared to the&#xD;
      waitlist control group (as measured using the Biopac MP150 acquisition unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: Maintain positive treatment effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Caregivers will report similar levels of child behavior problems (as measured by the WACB)&#xD;
      one and six months after treatment as they did at the post-treatment assessment, indicating&#xD;
      the treatment gains were maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting recruitment, the investigators will meet with physicians at the pediatrics&#xD;
      clinic to discuss the value of integrated primary care, explain the PC-CARE program, and&#xD;
      discuss observed behaviors or parent concerns that would warrant referral to the program, and&#xD;
      teach them how to make referrals. The investigators will provide the primary care physician&#xD;
      (PCP) with information about our research study and intervention and will educate them on&#xD;
      appropriate clients. When a PCP feels a child would meet criteria for this study, the PCP&#xD;
      will provide the caregiver with the recruitment flier and ask for consent to provide the&#xD;
      client's information to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers that consent to participate in this research study will complete the pre-treatment&#xD;
      assessment with their children and then be placed in either the waitlist control group or in&#xD;
      the treatment group. Those placed in the treatment group will actively participate in 6&#xD;
      weekly sessions of PC-CARE treatment and respond to a one-month and six month follow-up phone&#xD;
      call to provide support and check up on the child's functioning. Caregivers placed in the&#xD;
      waitlist control group will participate in the pre-treatment assessment and after&#xD;
      approximately two months will be contacted to complete another pre-treatment assessment and&#xD;
      to participate in 6 weekly sessions of PC-CARE treatment and afterward will respond to a&#xD;
      one-month and six month follow up phone call to provide support and check up on the child's&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pre-treatment assessment, parents will complete various questionnaires related to&#xD;
      child behavior, parenting stress, and satisfaction with the pediatrics clinic. Parents and&#xD;
      children will participate in a video-recorded 12-minute observational assessment of&#xD;
      parent-child dyads as they play together in three semi-structured play situations that are&#xD;
      analogs of typical parent-child interactions. Each of the 4-minute scenarios will be coded in&#xD;
      the moment by the therapist, and later by a research assistant who is blind to the dyad's&#xD;
      treatment group. While the therapist introduces PC-CARE to the caregiver, a trained&#xD;
      researcher will work with the child to acquire cardiac physiological signals. Using a&#xD;
      combination of age-appropriate explanations, books, and/or puppets, the researcher will&#xD;
      explain how the device listens to the child's heart and how it is attached with stickers.&#xD;
      Pediatric-grade adhesive electrodes will be applied to the child's torso and connected to an&#xD;
      amplifier to record the signals using flexible wires. Physiological signals will be collected&#xD;
      using a Biopac MP150 acquisition unit. The ECG100C amplifier will be used to collect&#xD;
      electrocardiogram data. Children will then watch a 2-min neutral film clip in order to&#xD;
      collect a resting measure of autonomic activity. Following this, they will complete two&#xD;
      challenging tasks. First, children will have 3-minutes to work on a difficult puzzle on their&#xD;
      own. Second, children will spend 3-minutes working on a difficult tangram puzzle with their&#xD;
      caregivers. The difficulty of the materials will be age-adjusted. At the end of the&#xD;
      assessment, the therapist will provide information about PC-CARE, identify treatment goals,&#xD;
      and indicate whether the family has been assigned to waitlist control group or the treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment phase of this study, parents and children will attend weekly one-hour&#xD;
      PC-CARE sessions for six weeks. At the beginning of these sessions, parents will complete a&#xD;
      brief measure of child behaviors for the week. Then parents, children, and therapist will&#xD;
      discuss behaviors from the week and identify behavioral goals for the session. The therapist&#xD;
      will then teach new positive communication, self-regulation, and/or behavior management&#xD;
      strategies to the parent and child together. The parent-child dyad will then be observed from&#xD;
      behind a two-way mirror while they play for four minutes. The therapist will then coach the&#xD;
      parent to use the newly learned skills by speaking to the parent via an ear-piece from behind&#xD;
      the mirror. The session ends with the therapist reviewing progress with the parent and child&#xD;
      and identifying a plan for incorporating new skills into the home environment. Parents and&#xD;
      children are also assigned 'Daily CARE' to spend five minutes playing together daily and to&#xD;
      use the new skills throughout the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis showed that in order to detect a large-sized effect (i.e., f=0.40,&#xD;
      eta-squared = .138) with a power of 80, which is appropriate for a wait-list control design,&#xD;
      this study would need a sample size of at least 25 families per group (Cohen, 1988). With an&#xD;
      estimated attrition rate of 10%, the investigators plan to recruit 28 dyads for each group,&#xD;
      comparison and control (Total N = 56) over the two-year study period. Information will be&#xD;
      entered and stored in a Microsoft Access database, designed to score standardized measures&#xD;
      and store all information relevant for data analysis. Standardized measures will be&#xD;
      double-entered to ensure accuracy of scoring; reliability estimates will be assessed for all&#xD;
      information that is &quot;judged&quot; or &quot;coded.&quot; Each dyad (parent and child) will be identified by a&#xD;
      unique ID composed of the child/participant's assigned subject identification (ID), the time&#xD;
      in treatment (should the child receive PC-CARE more than once), and an indicator of which&#xD;
      caregiver at any particular time in treatment is the participant in question (e.g., primary&#xD;
      participant is mother, secondary participant is father). Data are stored on a secure&#xD;
      University of California Davis Children's Hospital server, which is password-protected and&#xD;
      backed up daily. Physiological data will be acquired using a University of California Davis&#xD;
      issued laptop computer and identified only with the unique ID. Raw data files will be&#xD;
      uploaded to a secure University of California Davis Children's Hospital server.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6-8 months</time_frame>
    <description>WACB is a 9-item measure of child behavior plus one item regarding parenting stress. Frequency of behaviors (1=never to 7=almost always) and whether behaviors need to change (1=yes, 0=no) are recorded at pre-treatment, each weekly session, post-treatment, one month post-treatment, and six months post-treatment. The parenting stress severity score has a range of 1-7, with higher number indicating more stress. The parenting stress need to change score is either 0 or 1, with 1 indicating the stress level needs to change. The severity of behavior problems is a total score (sum of the 9 behavior problem frequency scales) with a range of 9-63. The behavior problem need to change score is a total score, with a range of 0-9. For both scales, higher scores indicate more problems.</description>
