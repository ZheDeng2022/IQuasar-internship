      To date, there is little data on the consumption of young adults in detention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to document the prevalence of problematic cannabis use&#xD;
      before incarceration among juveniles detained in the various detention centers in the PACA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the prevalence of cannabis use over the course of life, last year and last month;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the prevalence of harm and risky behavior associated with the use of a psychoactive&#xD;
           substance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  associated addictions and first and foremost tobacco&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the determinants (socio-demographic, socio-economic, environmental, etc.) of problem use&#xD;
           and cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter cross-sectional study aimed at establishing an exhaustive picture of&#xD;
      the defined population region over a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The holder of the parental authority exercise and the individual agreeing to participate in&#xD;
      the study must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sign an informed consent a no objection card&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete a car book and hetero-questionnaires. The time of handover is evaluated at 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAST questionnaire will be used to answer the main purpose of the study and to identify&#xD;
      consumers with problematic cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAST scores will be calculated. Abnormal CAST proportions will be presented along with their&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals. The links between the score and the various variables identified as&#xD;
      determinants will be tested using uni and multivariate analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;

      To date, there is little data on the consumption of young adults in detention when they are&#xD;
      the first consumers in the general population in France and they represent a particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable population within the prison population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      objectives The main objective of this project is to document the prevalence of problematic&#xD;
      cannabis use before incarceration among juveniles detained in the various detention centers&#xD;
      in the P.A.C.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to document:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the prevalence of cannabis use over the course of life, last year and last month;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the prevalence of harm and risky behavior associated with the use of a psychoactive&#xD;
           substance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  associated addictions and first and foremost tobacco&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the determinants (socio-demographic, socio-economic, environmental, etc.) of problem use&#xD;
           and cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This is a multicenter cross-sectional study aimed at establishing an exhaustive&#xD;
      picture of the defined population (juvenile detainees in the P.A.C.A.) region over a 12-month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The holder of the parental authority exercise and the individual agreeing to participate in&#xD;
      the study must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sign an informed consent a no objection card&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete a car book and hetero-questionnaires. The time of handover is evaluated at 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAST questionnaire will be used to answer the main purpose of the study and to identify&#xD;
      consumers with problematic cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAST scores will be calculated. Abnormal CAST proportions will be presented along with their&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals. The links between the score and the various variables identified as&#xD;
      determinants (socio-demographic, socio-economic, environmental, other addictions, etc.) will&#xD;
      be tested using uni and multivariate analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The assessment of the health status and needs of this extremely vulnerable&#xD;
      population is a prerequisite for defining specific regional objectives and for establishing a&#xD;
      coherent and coordinated effective health intervention within the community. prisoner in&#xD;

    <description>the CAST questionnaire will be used to answer the main objective of the study and to identify consumers with problematic cannabis use. This is a validated self-questionnaire in France (Legleye et al., 2011), specific to the adolescent population, which is interpreted according to the score obtained. It includes 6 items with answer modes coded from 0 to 4. The total score obtained by summing these 6 items can therefore vary from 0 to 24. We define users without risk for a score of less than 3, users with low risk for a score greater than or equal to 3 and less than 7, and finally those with a risk of problematic use for a score greater than or equal to 7</description>
