      In this study, investigators designed a double-blind randomized trial to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety between sodium valproate, amisulpride and MECT combination therapy in&#xD;
      clozapine-treated refractory schizophrenia (CTRS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental illnesses worldwide that affects&#xD;
      approximately 1% of the worldwide population and result in a heavy economic burden to&#xD;
      affected family. Antipsychotics are the main stay of treatment of schizophrenia, however,&#xD;
      there are still approximately 1/3 schizophrenia patients who does not responded to the&#xD;
      antipsychotic agents, and these patients easily develop into treatment-refractory&#xD;
      schizophrenia (TRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clozapine is the only evidence based effective medication for treatment-refractory&#xD;
      schizophrenia (TRS). In spite of its prominent efficacy, approximately 1/3-2/1&#xD;
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia (TRS) treated with clozapine still present with&#xD;
      significant residual psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. As such, over time, clinicians&#xD;
      struggled to find strategies to improve outcome by augmenting the concomitant psychiatric&#xD;
      treatments, including not only combining antipsychotics but also combining a mood stabilizer&#xD;
      or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug with multi receptor blocking effect and has a low affinity&#xD;
      for dopamine D2. Studies of traditional antipsychotics have suggested that maximal efficacy&#xD;
      occurs with dopamine D2 occupancy of 70% or more, while clozapine's dopamine D2 occupancy&#xD;
      levels less than 60%. Amisulpride has a highly selective blocking effect on dopamine D2 and&#xD;
      dopamine D3 receptors and has no affinity for any other known receptors. Its unique dopamine&#xD;
      receptor blocking effect may selectively enhances the limited dopamine D2 blocking effect of&#xD;
      clozapine, making it possible to be a suitable and effective drug for combination with&#xD;
      clozapine. A number of promising studies that have augmented clozapine with amisulpride, have&#xD;
      shown psychiatric symptoms improvement in TRS versus those on clozapine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and antiepileptic drugs, such as sodium valproate,&#xD;
      shares anticonvulsant properties and anticonvulsant effect relate to clinical efficacy. In&#xD;
      1983, Sackeim et al. pointed out that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced cortical&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) depletion may be the reason for its anticonvulsant action. In&#xD;
      addition, the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on the gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)&#xD;
      system was confirmed by several studies. Interestingly, it has been reported that the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of sodium valproate combined with antipsychotics is closely related to&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growing evidence suggests that the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems interact with each&#xD;
      other through cytokines, hormones, and neurotransmitters. The activation of the immune system&#xD;
      may be involved in the neuropathological changes occurring in the central nervous system.&#xD;
      Among several components of immune pathogenesis, aberrant cytokine signaling is considered as&#xD;
      one of the key contributors. Many cytokines have been speculated to be involved in the&#xD;
      pathological process of schizophrenia. IL-2 acts as a growth factor for T cells, NK cells and&#xD;
      B cells, abnormalities of IL-2 serum levels or its production were found in acute&#xD;
      schizophrenia cases. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine, which plays significant role in&#xD;
      neurobiological functions like neuronal differentiation and survival, synaptic transmission&#xD;
      and brain morphometry. The abnormal expression of IL-6 can be found in both first-episode and&#xD;
      chronic schizophrenia. TNF-α is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines, which&#xD;
      expressed mainly by macrophages. Previous studies have found that the expression of TNF-α is&#xD;
      abnormal in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety between sodium&#xD;
      valproate, amisulpride and MECT combination therapy in clozapine-treated refractory&#xD;
      schizophrenia during a 12 weeks period. In addition, the effect of combined therapy on plasma&#xD;
      cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α) will be evaluated.&#xD;
