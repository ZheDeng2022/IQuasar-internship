      Determine the value of the initial measurement of the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes&#xD;
      (RET-He) for predicting the response to martial treatment for patients with a solid tumor&#xD;
      with a functional martial deficiency as defined NCCN2016 (with or without inflammation). The&#xD;
      aim is to refine the current definition of functional martial deficiency in order to best&#xD;
      adapt the iron prescription in oncology by giving iron only if necessary, i.e. if the RET is&#xD;
      low.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common clinical situation in oncology. It contributes to the asthenia and thus to&#xD;
      the decrease in the quality of life of the patient. In addition, it is considered an&#xD;
      independent pejorative prognostic factor according to a literature review of 2001. An&#xD;
      appropriate management of the latter is therefore paramount. To do this, it is necessary to&#xD;
      successfully define its origins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, RET-he was studied for the first time in the cancer patient. This analysis showed&#xD;
      that there is a good negative predictive value of RET-he for a cut-off of 32 PG, i.e., that&#xD;
      above this value the iron deficiency is unlikely. Iron deficiency anemia was defined by&#xD;
      hemoglobin below 11 g/dl, serum iron less than 40 Μ g/dl, and TSAT less than 20%. However,&#xD;
      this study had some limiting factors. First, patients were not separated according to cancer&#xD;
      pathology: solid tumors versus malignant hemic. In addition, previous treatments, such as the&#xD;
      administration of ASE, iron and/or globular pellets, have not been taken into account. The&#xD;
      number of patients with anemia and iron deficiency was limited (n = 23). Despite these&#xD;
      different biases, this study is the first to demonstrate the interest of this parameter in&#xD;
      the management of anemia in the patient in oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the data are consistent with the potential interest of the hemoglobin content of&#xD;
      reticulocytes in the diagnosis of martial deficiency. This is why the purpose of this project&#xD;
      is to establish a RET-He study in anaemic patients with a solid tumor to determine if this&#xD;
      endpoint could be included in a diagram of the management of anemia in oncology, particularly&#xD;
      for To detect subpopulations (responder patient or not to iron IV) in patients with a&#xD;
      functional martial deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included as they are taken care of in the facility. A delay of about 3&#xD;
      months is necessary for the information to be complete and validated. The file will be taken&#xD;
      out at regular intervals to inform the patient's follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of the therapy to correct anemia (administration of iron IV (associated or&#xD;
      not to an ASE) is the responsibility of the referring physician or other prescriber doctor by&#xD;
      delegation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different follow-up points for each patient will be the standard assessments made&#xD;
      according to the NCCN recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment 1: between J21 (= 3 wk) and J35 (= 5 wk) after the introduction of a&#xD;
           treatment (= J0) : the blood test must include at least one NFS and reticulocytes with&#xD;
           RET-He (carried out in the ICO laboratory). This assessment will allow an intermediate&#xD;
           evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment by the doctor in order to envisage a&#xD;
           possible implementation under ASE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment 2: between J36 (= 6 wk) and J84 (= 12 wk) after the introduction of a&#xD;
           treatment (= J0). The blood test must include at least one NFS (carried out in the ICO&#xD;
           laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exclusion from the protocol will be carried out in a second step if the patient receives a&#xD;
      globular pellet transfusion between the initial blood test and the assessment 1. The results&#xD;
      of the assessment 2 will not be taken into account if the patient has a transfusion between&#xD;
      the assessment 1 and the assessment 2.&#xD;
