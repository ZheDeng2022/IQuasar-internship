  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current epidemic of obesity relates to the transition from traditional to industrialised&#xD;
      diets. The present project investigates the effect on body energy of recommending the&#xD;
      consumption of traditional &quot;home meals&quot;, which may be a useful recommendation against&#xD;
      obesity. A randomized controlled trial design is applied assigning participants to a&#xD;
      recommendation of consuming during 12 weeks either &quot;home meals&quot; or &quot;healthy meals.&quot; Frequency&#xD;
      of consumption of energy-dense foods and of exercise is monitored throughout the&#xD;
      intervention; weight and body fat are measured at baseline and at four-week intervals. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that consuming more frequently &quot;home meals&quot; reduces at least as much weight and&#xD;
      adiposity as &quot;healthy meals&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global health problem that requires effective intervention. In Mexico, 2 out of&#xD;
      3 adults are classed as overweight or obese. Weight gain from frequent consumption of energy&#xD;
      dense food impairs the metabolism of lipids and glucose which causes the inflammatory state&#xD;
      that underlies development of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. Mexican women&#xD;
      with overweight or obesity consume on average 12 times per week food rich in sugar or fat.&#xD;
      This indicates a high prevalence of unhealthy eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such unhealthy habits are however determined by the modern environment. The raise in food&#xD;
      availability is associated with increase in body weight at population level. Diverse studies&#xD;
      indicate also an increase in the number of fast food outlets together with an increase in the&#xD;
      frequency of eating out of the home. Therefore, people are exposed to abundance of unhealthy&#xD;
      food that leads to acquire the habit of consuming them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informative education on &quot;healthy&quot; eating is a main intervention to abate obesity levels&#xD;
      in the population. However, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is still increasing. In&#xD;
      fact, if this trend continues, in 2025, 32 million of Mexican adults will achieve the&#xD;
      diagnosis of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New perspectives for intervention are needed against obesity. We propose &quot;home meals&quot; as a&#xD;
      novel strategy to enhance the effectivity of educative messages on &quot;healthy&quot; eating that&#xD;
      generally presents food out of their cultural context. Our definition of &quot;home meal&quot;&#xD;
      considers not only the physical space where foods are consumed but also a typical socially&#xD;
      accepted preparation based on local foods. This proposal about &quot;home meals&quot; is partly made&#xD;
      because the raise of obesity in the population coincides with the replacement of traditional&#xD;
      diet by consumption of industrialised unhealthy food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project develops an intervention that compares &quot;home meals&quot; vs. &quot;healthy meals&quot;&#xD;
      with regards to their effect on weight and body fat. The aim is to test if the recommendation&#xD;
      of eating &quot;home meals&quot; has a slimming effect and how it compares to that of the standard&#xD;
      isocaloric recommendation of eating &quot;healthy meals.&quot; The hypothesis is that because &quot;home&#xD;
      meals&quot; are culturally tailored, they would be easier to practice, and so a similar&#xD;
      weight/body fat loss to the &quot;healthy meals&quot; would be at least achieved.&#xD;
