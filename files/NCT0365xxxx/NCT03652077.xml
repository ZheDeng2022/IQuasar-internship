    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with locally advanced or metastatic tumors who are not eligible for any&#xD;
             available therapy likely to convey clinical benefit (locally advanced disease must not&#xD;
             be amenable to resection with curative intent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have disease progression after treatment with available therapies&#xD;
             that are known to confer clinical benefit or who are intolerant to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to safely undergo pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies&#xD;
             (core or excisional).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children based on protocol-defined&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values at screening outside the protocol-defined ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of colony-stimulating factors within 14 days before Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within protocol-defined&#xD;
             intervals before the first administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
        mumps, rubella, chicken pox/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin, and&#xD;
        typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus&#xD;
        vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines are live-attenuated&#xD;
        vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past (ie, with use&#xD;
             of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or&#xD;
             history of other malignancy within 2 years of study entry with the exception of cured&#xD;
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer,&#xD;
             prostate intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other&#xD;
             noninvasive or indolent malignancy, or cancers from which the participant has been&#xD;
             disease-free for &gt; 1 year, after treatment with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active HBV or HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of study drug or formulation components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with an anti-TIM-3 antibody for any indication.&#xD;
