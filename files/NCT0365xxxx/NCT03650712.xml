      Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes has been identified by the CF community as one of the top&#xD;
      ten priorities for CF research. In CF clinical decline due to dysglycemia begins early, prior&#xD;
      to diagnosis of diabetes and increases mortality from pulmonary disease. There is presently&#xD;
      no way to determine who, of those with dysglycemia, will experience clinical compromise.&#xD;
      However, the CF Center in Milan has found that measurable age- and sex-dependent variables on&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) predict β-cell failure-the primary driver of decline in&#xD;
      CF. the investigators propose a multi-center trial to develop nomograms of age and sex&#xD;
      dependent reference values for OGTT-derived measures including glucose, insulin, c-peptide,&#xD;
      and the resultant OGTT-derived estimates of β-cell function, β cell sensitivity to glucose,&#xD;
      and oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and to determine correlation of these with&#xD;
      clinical status (FEV-1, BMI z score, number of pulmonary exacerbations over the past 12&#xD;
      months). In a subset of the cohort the investigators will perform additional studies to&#xD;
      determine possible mechanisms driving abnormal β cell function, including the role of lean&#xD;
      body mass (as measured by DXA), impact of incretin (GLP-1, GIP) and islet hormones (glucagon,&#xD;
      pancreatic polypeptide) on β cell function and the relationship of reactive hypoglycemia and&#xD;
      catecholamine responses to β cell function, as well as the relationship of β cell sensitivity&#xD;
      to glucose as determined by our model to abnormalities in blood glucose found in a period of&#xD;
      free living after the study (determined by continuous glucose monitoring measures (Peak&#xD;
      glucose, time spent &gt;200 mg/dl, standard deviation). the investigators will also develop a&#xD;
      biobank of stored samples to allow expansion to the full cohort if warranted and to enable&#xD;
      future studies of dysglycemia and diabetes in CF. the investigator's eventual goal is&#xD;
      utilization of the nomograms to determine the minimum number of measures to accurately&#xD;
      predict risk for clinical decline from dysglycemia in CF.&#xD;

      A. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Mellitus (CFRD) has been identified by the CF community as&#xD;
      one of the top ten priorities for CF research1. In CF, clinical decline due to dysglycemia&#xD;
      begins early, prior to the diagnosis of CFRD2 and increases pulmonary decline and mortality3.&#xD;
      However, current definitions of dysglycemia were derived from non-CF populations, and&#xD;
      unfortunately, there is presently no way to determine who, of those with CF and dysglycemia,&#xD;
      will experience morbidity, mortality or greatest risk for CFRD. However, the CF Center in&#xD;
      Milan found that measurable age and sex dependent variables on oral glucose tolerance testing&#xD;
      (OGTT) strongly predict β-cell failure 4- the primary driver of clinical decline. We propose&#xD;
      a multi-center trial to determine age and sex dependent reference for fsOGTT-derived&#xD;
      estimates of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in the US CF population, and to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship of these measures to CF-relevant clinical outcomes as well as&#xD;
      exploring potential mechanisms that may be driving beta cell functional decline. Furthermore,&#xD;
      we will collect these data in the new age of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance&#xD;
      regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies, to define a model that will be most relevant for our&#xD;
      current generation of CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine age and sex dependent reference values from OGTT and&#xD;
      OGTT-derived estimates of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in a diverse population of&#xD;
      475 non-diabetic children and adults with CF, at 4 centers with EnVision Emerging Leaders as&#xD;
      site-PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Much like standard growth charts with means and standard-deviation based&#xD;
      percentiles, fsOGTT values (glucose, insulin, c-peptide) and the resultant fsOGTT-derived&#xD;
      estimates of β-cell function (beta cell sensitivity to glucose, oral glucose insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity) will fall along an age and sex-dependent continuum which will be consistent&#xD;
      across CF patients at four different US centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the relationship between OGTT reference values and estimates of&#xD;
      β-cell function and insulin sensitivity to clinically relevant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The fsOGTT-derived values of insulin, glucose and C-peptide in combination with&#xD;
      estimates of β-cell function (beta cell sensitivity to glucose, OGIS) will correlate with&#xD;
      important markers of clinical status (FEV-1, BMI Z score, number of pulmonary exacerbations&#xD;
      over the past 12 months) in an age and sex dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 (exploratory): To gather additional measures in a subset of this large cohort&#xD;
      to illuminate the relationship between normal ranges of beta cell function (as determined&#xD;
      above) to possible mechanisms driving abnormal beta cell function, including: abnormal lean&#xD;
      body mass, abnormalities of hormones that regulate beta cell function (specifically incretins&#xD;
      (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)), and&#xD;
      islet hormones (glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP)), abnormalities of counter-regulation&#xD;
      to abnormal insulin secretion (catecholamine levels), and free-living glucose measures&#xD;
      collected by continuous glucose monitoring. Additionally, stored serum from 475 patients with&#xD;
      exceptionally well characterized metabolic profiles provides an unprecedented opportunity to&#xD;
      help inform future research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Lower lean body mass as assessed by DXA is associated with beta cell glucose&#xD;
      sensitivity in an age and sex dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Patterns of islet hormone and incretin secretion are age and sex dependent and&#xD;
      β cell glucose sensitivity will correlate with PP and GIP, but not with glucagon and GLP-1&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3c: Reduced β cell glucose sensitivity is associated with higher rates of reactive&#xD;
      hypoglycemia with inappropriate catecholamine and glucagon response during OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3d: identifiable CGM measures (ex. Peak glucose, time spent &gt;200 mg/dl, standard&#xD;
      deviation) will correlate with model derived outcomes specifically β cell glucose sensitivity&#xD;
      in an age and sex-dependent manner&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) is an independent cause of increased rates of&#xD;
      premature death in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)3. Because of this, the CF community has&#xD;
      recognized CFRD as one of their top ten research priorities1. Importantly, abnormalities of&#xD;
      blood glucose metabolism (dysglycemia) are present in CF likely from birth5 and cause&#xD;
      increasingly rapid lung function decline and loss of healthy body mass years before the&#xD;
      diagnosis of CFRD is made2. However, it is unclear at what point individuals might benefit&#xD;
      from treatment of dysglycemia, as the treatment itself can be an additional burden.&#xD;
      Furthermore, with the increasing use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR) modulators, the natural history of CFRD development and progression is likely to&#xD;
      change. Thus, it is imperative that we better understand which CF patients with dysglycemia&#xD;
      are at the greatest risk of excess mortality due to dysglycemia and progression to CFRD. The&#xD;
      primary defect leading to dysglycemia in CF is inadequate insulin secretion secondary to&#xD;
      abnormal function of the beta cell6. Importantly, understanding beta cell dysfunction is&#xD;
      essential to addressing every form of diabetes mellitus, not just CFRD. However, the gold&#xD;
      standard tests for beta cell function (hyperglycemic clamp and tracer studies) are complex&#xD;
      and therefore they are not easily utilized in large-scale studies. Due to this, there has&#xD;
      been extensive effort on the part of many centers to develop methods to assay beta cell&#xD;
      function from more readily accessible data points and, ideally, clinically useful ones. Dr.&#xD;
      Andrea Mari, from the Institute of Neuroscience in Italy, has developed a model, which can&#xD;
      derive multiple indices of beta cell function from frequently sampled OGTT, with excellent&#xD;
      concordance to the gold standard hyperglycemic clamp. This is especially relevant in the CF&#xD;
      population where OGTT testing is the recommended modality for diabetes screening. Dr. Mari's&#xD;
      model has been well-validated in normal subjects7, subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and in subjects with pre-diabetes8 and is an accepted alternative for the assessment&#xD;
      of beta cell function in large studies where clamp protocols are difficult or impossible9.&#xD;
      Importantly, Dr. Alberto Battezzatti, a pediatric endocrinologist at the CF center in Milan,&#xD;
      Italy, with a long dedicated career interest in CFRD, has expanded Dr. Mari's modeling to the&#xD;
      CF population. Dr. Battezzati has shown that there are strong relationships between the&#xD;
      insulin, glucose and C-peptide levels measured during 3 hour OGTT testing and the age and sex&#xD;
      of CF subjects4. Our goal, in concert with Dr. Battezzati and colleagues is to develop normal&#xD;
      ranges for these measures or, in essence, a &quot;growth chart&quot; for the OGTT in CF patients that&#xD;
      can accurately predict beta cell dysfunction and eventual progression to CFRD. Next steps are&#xD;
      to simplify the model to so that 2-3 discrete samples will accurately predict progression to&#xD;
      CFRD and morbidity in CF subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a collaboration with Dr. Battezzati and the Italian CF centers. the&#xD;
      investigators will validate the Italian model in a large and diverse US population, and&#xD;
      correlate it to specific clinical outcomes relevant to morbidity and mortality in CF, which&#xD;
      will allow for development of predictors in the model specific to US subjects and ensure&#xD;
      clinical relevance to our patients. Furthermore, the investigaros will collect these results&#xD;
      and follow patient outcomes in this new era of CFTR modulator therapy, developing a model&#xD;
      that will be most relevant for the current generation of patients with CF. This will&#xD;
      establish age and sex-dependent &quot;normal ranges&quot; for glucose, insulin and c-peptide values&#xD;
      from OGTT as well as determinants of beta cell function derived from OGTT. Establishment of&#xD;
      normal ranges of these measures will allow the determination of which patients with CF are&#xD;
      the lost abnormal and eventually determine who, within a given glucose tolerance category in&#xD;
      CF will experience clinical compromise and progress to CFRD. The long-term goal will be to&#xD;
      develop from these normal ranges, including normal ranges for indices of beta cell function&#xD;
      and insulin resistance, the most predictive time points and assays to develop a simplified&#xD;
      model that will optimally predict risk of clinical decline in a CF patient of a given age and&#xD;
      sex. The ideal model will consist of 2- 3 discrete time points to accurately predict clinical&#xD;
      deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All four of the investigators on this grant have established or are developing a long term&#xD;
      career focus on Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Mellitus and dysglycemia in Cystic Fibrosis.&#xD;
      This project represents a significant opportunity to characterize a large cohort of subjects&#xD;
      with well-defined dysglycemia and beta cell dysfunction in collaboration with an&#xD;
      equally-large international cohort with matching data sets. It represents an unprecedented&#xD;
      opportunity to fully explore the depth and breadth of dysglycemia in CF as well as to&#xD;
      investigate the impact dysglycemia has on the health of people with CF. The long term value&#xD;
      of this project is also enhanced by the establishment of a biorepository of stored samples&#xD;
      that will be obtained from this cohort. This will allow the ability in the future to query&#xD;
      these samples to further investigate the natural history and pathophysiology of CFRD, and&#xD;
      potentially biomarkers with in a large cohort with clearly and accurately defined beta cell&#xD;
      function. This group has unique assets to complete this task as we represent four unique CF&#xD;
      centers; all with dedicated CF endocrinologists recognized as Emerging Leaders in CF&#xD;
      Endocrinology by the EnVision program, with coordinated mentorship though that program by the&#xD;
      leading expert in the field of CFRD, Dr. Antoinette Moran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the recommended screening test for CFRD is the oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      (OGTT)10. Although abnormalities on this test predict long term outcomes in CF, the&#xD;
      diagnostic endpoints we currently use are based on data from other adults with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and are not specific to CF. There is emerging evidence that CF patients who do not&#xD;
      meet formal criteria for glucose abnormalities by OGTT are still experiencing clinical&#xD;
      decline11,12. Therefore, there remains a knowledge gap regarding how we can best predict&#xD;
      clinical decline. Given that the primary pathology in CF is insulin deficiency, it is&#xD;
      reasonable to extrapolate that measures of beta cell function would be the best indicators of&#xD;
      outcomes in CF patients. Typical simplified methods of assessing beta cell function (such as&#xD;
      HOMA-B) utilize primarily fasting measurements, which are inappropriate in CF where fasting&#xD;
      abnormalities develop after the onset of frank CFRD and long after clinical decline is&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Andrea Mari has extensive data showing the effectiveness of his model in evaluating beta&#xD;
      cell glucose sensitivity (the ability of the beta cell to respond to respond to changes in&#xD;
      glucose concentration)7,13,14. The OGTT itself has poor reproducibility, however beta cell&#xD;
      glucose sensitivity as measured from frequently sampled OGTT has significantly better&#xD;
      reproducibility, with a coefficient of variation around 15-20%7,15. This model of beta cell&#xD;
      glucose sensitivity is an extremely accurate parameter to assess glucose control and has been&#xD;
      found to be a significant predictor for the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in&#xD;
      non-diabetic and pre- diabetic populations. This model allows, as well, measurement of first&#xD;
      phase insulin secretion (termed &quot;rate sensitivity&quot; - which is directly comparable to the&#xD;
      acute insulin response obtained from the gold standard IVGTT)16. This is significant, as loss&#xD;
      of first phase insulin secretion is the initial abnormality in the progression to CFRD. This&#xD;
      model is highly reproducible, and has also been studied longitudinally15,17 (see figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data -islet and incretin hormones:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Larson Ode has devoted her career to understanding the origins of dysglycemia in CF. Her&#xD;
      work has upended previous dogma, finding that up to 39% of CF children 3 months to 5 years of&#xD;
      age may have dysglycemia18. However, it is not yet known what underlying mechanisms drive&#xD;
      dysglycemia in CF. In a previous small dataset (n=25 CF, n=9 control), 9 of 25 CF subjects&#xD;
      had dysglycemia (all controls were normal). Stored blood was assayed for islet and incretin&#xD;
      hormones to interrogate the difference between children with and without dysglycemia. CF&#xD;
      children with abnormal glucose tolerance had higher GIP levels (p&lt;0.03) and a trend toward&#xD;
      lower GLP-1 levels compared to normal CF subjects (p= 0.06). All CF subjects had abnormally&#xD;
      low PP levels (p&lt;0.01). Glucagon levels were uninformative (unpublished data- see Figure 1).&#xD;
      This implies that incretin and islet hormones may play a role in dysglycemia in CF. However,&#xD;
      data from larger and older cohorts are needed to fully understand incretin and islet hormone&#xD;
      patterns in people with CF. This proposed project will establish a biobank which will allow&#xD;
      the study of age based progression in biomarkers of islet dysfunction throughout a diverse&#xD;
      cohort including a large age-range of subjects. The deep understanding of CF typical beta&#xD;
      cell function changes with age that will be established by this cohort will allow greatly&#xD;
      improved understanding of the progression of dysglycemia in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience with CGM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Chan currently has a CFFT Shwachman grant to investigate the role of CGM in CF. She also&#xD;
      has previously used CGM in other studies, enrolling over 100 obese youth to undergo OGTTs and&#xD;
      wear CGM in order to better understand simpler measures of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      screening in the obese adolescent population19,20. Although her CGM in CF study is currently&#xD;
      active, recruitment will be ending soon and will not overlap with the timing in this proposed&#xD;
      study. The present proposal, with its target enrollment of 475 individuals with CF, offers an&#xD;
      unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of CGM and its relationship with the&#xD;
      proposed model and its novel age- and sex-specific outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience with hypoglycemia research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Moheet has extensive experience in diabetes research with special expertise in the gold&#xD;
      standard tests for beta cell function (insulin clamp studies). His research utilizes methods&#xD;
      relevant to the study of in vivo metabolism in human subjects, particularly use of both&#xD;
      hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic insulin clamps methodologies. His research has examined the&#xD;
      underlying pathogenesis in development of defective counterregulatory response to&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. Dr. Moheet's substantial background in&#xD;
      hypoglycemia research would be invaluable in the conduct of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting and reactive hypoglycemia after meals is common in CF patient without diabetes21.&#xD;
      Reactive hypoglycemia can be particular bothersome and difficult to manage in some patients&#xD;
      with CF. Hypoglycemia has also been frequently reported during OGTT in CF with reported rates&#xD;
      for 3 hour OGTT between 15-59%22,23. A recent systematic review noted that, however, that the&#xD;
      pathophysiology is poorly understood and highlighted the need for high quality studies to&#xD;
      examine the possible etiologies underlying reactive hypoglycemia in CF24. This proposed study&#xD;
      will address this knowledge gap by evaluating counterregulatory hormones including glucagon&#xD;
      and catecholamines during hypoglycemia and assessing symptomatic hypoglycemia via a validated&#xD;
      and structured questionnaire25. This proposed study will provide an unprecedented opportunity&#xD;
      to examine the possible mechanisms underlying reactive hypoglycemia in CF in a large cohort&#xD;
      of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data-body composition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Granados has previously investigated the association between body composition (% fat and&#xD;
      LBM by DXA) and measurements of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitivity (Insulin&#xD;
      Sensitivity Index - Matsuda (ISIMatsuda)) and β-cell insulin secretion (Φtotal) in 15 CF&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic insufficiency between 12-24 years old (mean BMI 19.5 ± 2.87 kg/m2).&#xD;
      Her preliminary data showed that insulin resistance significantly correlated with weight&#xD;
      z-scores (HOMA-IR:r=0.48, p=0.003) and ISIMatsuda (r=-0.46, p=0.004). She also found a&#xD;
      positive correlation between Φtotal, (measurement of insulin secretion in response to&#xD;
      glucose) and fat % in the subjects with CF without diabetes (r=0.69, p=0.004). Moreover,&#xD;
      there was a trend in those with lower fat % and higher LBM to have better insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (ISIMatsuda:r=-0.45, p=0.09).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis Primary hypothesis: Much like standard growth charts with means and&#xD;
      standard-deviation based percentiles, fsOGTT values (glucose, insulin, c-peptide) and the&#xD;
      resultant fsOGTT-derived estimates of β-cell function (beta cell sensitivity to glucose, oral&#xD;
      glucose insulin sensitivity) will fall along an age and sex-dependent continuum which will be&#xD;
      consistent across CF patients at four different US centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: The fsOGTT-derived values of insulin, glucose and C-peptide in&#xD;
      combination with estimates of β-cell function (beta cell sensitivity to glucose, OGIS) will&#xD;
      correlate with important markers of clinical status (FEV-1, BMI Z score, number of pulmonary&#xD;
      exacerbations over the past 12 months) in an age and sex dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Lower lean body mass as assessed by DXA is associated with beta cell glucose&#xD;
      sensitivity in an age and sex dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Patterns of islet hormone and incretin secretion are age and sex dependent and&#xD;
      β cell glucose sensitivity will correlate with PP and GIP, but not with glucagon and GLP-1&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3c: Reduced β cell glucose sensitivity is associated with higher rates of reactive&#xD;
      hypoglycemia with inappropriate catecholamine and glucagon response during OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3d: Identifiable CGM measures (ex. Peak glucose, time spent &gt;200 mg/dl, standard&#xD;
      deviation) will correlate with β cell glucose sensitivity in an age and sex dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment The University of Minnesota CF center has 332 CF patients eligible&#xD;
      for this study. The University of Iowa has 144 eligible subjects. The University of Colorado&#xD;
      pediatric center has approximately 225 eligible subjects. Washington University in St. Louis&#xD;
      has 236 eligible subjects. Experience from recruiting previous OGTT based studies in these&#xD;
      centers suggests 40-60% of CF subjects will agree to participate. It is expected that&#xD;
      approximately 160 subjects/year will participate, collectively over all the sites, to reach a&#xD;
      total of 475 subjects by the end of the 3 years of the study.&#xD;

           of the subjects will complete additional assessments evaluating the exploratory&#xD;
           endpoints. The goal is that 1/3 of the total subjects will participate in these&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA scan 1) A DXA scan will be obtained the date of the study visit or within a 2 week period&#xD;
      from the OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Hologic Inc. (Bedford, MA, USA) machines will be used to standardize results CGM&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) A blinded CGM Freestyle LibrePro (Abbott Diabetes Care Inc) will be placed on the back of&#xD;
      the upper arm. Participants will be asked to wear the CGMS for up to 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The CGMS does not require calibration, but participants will be asked not to wear the&#xD;
           monitor in water deeper than three feet, or to keep it submerged longer than 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will also be instructed not to change any of their current dietary or&#xD;
           activity habits so that free-living glucose data are collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They will also be asked to complete a simple log of their activity and dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects will be given the option of personally returning the CGM and log-sheet to the&#xD;
           CTRC or be provided a self-addressed, stamped envelope to return the device and&#xD;
           log-sheet at the completion of the recording period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Using software that accompanies the CGM recorder, reports will be generated for each&#xD;
           subject providing a summary of the sensor glucose data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. These results will be converted into raw data in an excel spreadsheet and saved on a&#xD;
           password-protected, secure network server, via a local computer, in a locked office to&#xD;
           which only the investigators will have access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. These raw data include sensor glucose values obtained every 15 minutes during device wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. We will review CGM tracings to analyze additional variables including: i. area under the&#xD;
      total CGM curve ii. number of excursions &gt;140 mg/dl and &gt;200 mg/dl iii. maximum sensor&#xD;
      glucose after first meal of the day, maximum sensor glucose, sensor glucose mean iv. standard&#xD;
      deviation and other measures of glycemic variability v. Measures of hypoglycemia specifically&#xD;
      % time spent &lt;60 and &lt;70mg/dl. The Freestyle Libre Pro system has been approved in Europe and&#xD;
      has been studied in children as young as 4 years of age for up to 14 days of sensor wear. It&#xD;
      does not display blood glucose information in real time, and participants will not be given&#xD;
      the capability to view the CGMS data during the study. This CGM does not require any&#xD;
      calibration or training and can easily be removed and returned Laboratory assays&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical research assays&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sample size estimates/ Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using 187 subjects from a single Italian center, the Italian group has previously defined the&#xD;
      75.0 quantile for various glucose tolerance and beta cell function parameters, including&#xD;
      beta-cell glucose sensitivity. As the goal of the present project is to develop the 5th to&#xD;
      95th quantiles, due to the clinical relevance of cut offs based on the 5th and 95th&#xD;
      percentile, sample size for the present project was calculated to estimate the 95.0 quantile&#xD;
      of a covariate-dependent quantile curve with a pre-specified precision. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable of the quantile curve is beta-cell sensitivity to glucose and the predictor variable&#xD;
      is age. On the basis of the available data 4 we expect a linear relationship between&#xD;
      beta-cell glucose sensitivity and age with no heteroskedasticity. Therefore the minimum&#xD;
      sample size needed to estimate the 95.0 quantile of beta-cell glucose sensitivity -for-age&#xD;
      with a 90% probability for it to lie between the 90.5 and 97.4 quantiles (with respect to&#xD;
      symmetric tolerance evaluated on a logit scale) is 475 subjects31. For the other outcomes&#xD;
      (glucose, insulin, c-peptide) the minimum sample size is smaller than the 475 subjects needed&#xD;
      for primary endpoint of beta cell glucose sensitivity. The University of Minnesota CF center&#xD;
      has 332 CF patients eligible for this study. The University of Iowa has 144 eligible&#xD;
      subjects. The University of Colorado pediatric CF center has 225 eligible subjects.&#xD;
      Washington University in St. Louis has 236 eligible subjects. Historically at the University&#xD;
      of Minnesota and the University of Iowa, we have had excellent enrollment rates of CF&#xD;
      subjects in CFRD studies, so we expect about 40-60% of eligible subjects to enroll at some&#xD;
      point over the 3 year duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation and quality control A formal DSMP will be in place for this project. Please&#xD;
      see attached DSMP. There will be no need for efficacy analysis as this is not an&#xD;
      interventional study.&#xD;
