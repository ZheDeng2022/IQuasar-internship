  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections are the second most common community-acquired infections. Even if&#xD;
      extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) cause fewer urinary tract&#xD;
      infections, their proportion is increasing. New recommendations were published by ANSM in&#xD;
      2015, with specific recommendations for infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.&#xD;
      In this study, we wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of a recall of the 2015&#xD;
      recommendations in the form of a table attached to the ECBU report, associated with hygiene&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This prospective, multi-center, non-interventional study was conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Labazur laboratory over two 2-month periods, one without modification&#xD;
      of the laboratory's practices, the other with the addition of documents on the CBEU report.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the adequacy of prescriptions to ANSM 2015 recommendations.&#xD;
