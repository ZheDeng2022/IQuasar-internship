      The proposed research will conduct a fully-powered efficacy trial of this approach in areas&#xD;
      with large populations of AA and H/L MSM and high HIV incidence: Jackson, MS, Los Angeles,&#xD;
      CA, and Boston, MA. High-risk MSM who have not tested for HIV in the last year will be&#xD;
      recruited from MSM-oriented &quot;hook-up&quot; mobile apps, and assigned to receive either (1) HBST&#xD;
      with post-test phone counseling/referral (&quot;eTEST&quot; condition), (2) &quot;standard&quot; HBST without&#xD;
      active follow-up, or (3) reminders to get tested for HIV at a local clinic (&quot;control&quot;&#xD;
      condition) at three month intervals over the course of 12 months. The investigators will&#xD;
      explore the impact of the eTEST system on key outcomes, including rates of HIV testing,&#xD;
      receipt of additional HIV prevention services, and PrEP initiation, compared with standard&#xD;
      HBST or clinic-based testing reminders alone. The investigators will also explore the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of the eTEST system under various scenarios compared with relying on&#xD;
      traditional, clinic-based testing alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, and new&#xD;
      infections continue to increase particularly among African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino&#xD;
      (H/L) MSM. Past studies estimate that up to 50% of these new infections originate from the&#xD;
      approximately 20% of MSM who are unaware of their status. Expanded HIV testing can produce&#xD;
      reductions in incidence when implemented on a broad scale by facilitating earlier diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. Rates of HIV testing are particularly low among AA and H/L MSM, and innovative&#xD;
      approaches to encourage testing may help address high incidence in these men. Home-based,&#xD;
      self-testing (HBST) for HIV offers considerable promise for increasing the number of MSM who&#xD;
      are aware of their status by overcoming key barriers to clinic-based testing, such as&#xD;
      inconvenience and confidentiality concerns. HBST may also be particularly well-suited for AA&#xD;
      and H/L MSM, given that stigma and mistrust of medical care contribute to low testing rates.&#xD;
      Despite its promise, however, many are concerned that HBST does not sufficiently connect&#xD;
      users with critical post-testing resources, such as confirmatory testing and care among those&#xD;
      who test positive, and that these limitations may result in delayed linkage to care.&#xD;
      Existing, FDA-approved HBST kits provide a free, 24-hour helpline that offers these services&#xD;
      to those who seek it, but few users do, and this &quot;passive&quot; approach may miss critical&#xD;
      opportunities to engage with MSM for further prevention services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these challenges, the investigators developed a mobile health platform (&quot;eTEST&quot;)&#xD;
      that uses internet-of-things (IoT) technologies to monitor when HBST users open their tests&#xD;
      in real time, allowing the investigators to provide timely, &quot;active&quot; follow-up counseling and&#xD;
      referral over the phone after they do so. In a pilot study, the investigators show that&#xD;
      providing HBST by mail at regular intervals boosted rates of any/repeat HIV testing among&#xD;
      high-risk MSM compared with clinic-based testing reminders. Moreover, those who received&#xD;
      follow-up phone counseling after HBST were more likely to receive risk reduction counseling,&#xD;
      to consult with a medical provider about PrEP, and to initiate PrEP. Given these promising&#xD;
      results, the proposed research will conduct a fully-powered efficacy trial of this approach&#xD;
      in areas with large populations of AA and H/L MSM and high HIV incidence: Jackson, MS, Los&#xD;
      Angeles, CA, and Boston, MA. High-risk MSM who have not tested for HIV in the last year will&#xD;
      be recruited from MSM-oriented &quot;hook-up&quot; mobile apps, and assigned to receive either (1) HBST&#xD;
      with post-test phone counseling/referral (&quot;eTEST&quot; condition), (2) &quot;standard&quot; HBST without&#xD;
      active follow-up, or (3) reminders to get tested for HIV at a local clinic (&quot;control&quot;&#xD;
      condition) at three month intervals over the course of 12 months. The investigators will&#xD;
      explore the impact of the eTEST system on key outcomes, including rates of HIV testing,&#xD;
      receipt of additional HIV prevention services, and PrEP initiation, compared with standard&#xD;
      HBST or clinic-based testing reminders alone. The investigators will also explore the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of the eTEST system under various scenarios compared with relying on&#xD;
      traditional, clinic-based testing alone.&#xD;
