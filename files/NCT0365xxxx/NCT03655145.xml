    <textblock>
      The MAC-HAPLO-MUD trial is a randomized prospective phase III trial comparing HLA 10/10&#xD;
      matched unrelated donor and haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      after myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients, age 15 years or older, with Acute&#xD;
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Myeloproliferative Syndrome&#xD;
      (SMP) or Myelodysplastic Syndromes (SMD) and requiring allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Primary endpoint is the 1-year progression free survival without acute grade&#xD;
      II-IV GvHD and without moderate and severe chronic GvHD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An unrelated adult donor who is HLA-matched to the recipient at the allele-level (at HLA-A,&#xD;
      -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1) is considered the best choice in the absence of an HLA-matched&#xD;
      sibling for patients needing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, using matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited by (1) a prolonged time to identify&#xD;
      and schedule donation for some MUD allowing some patients to relapse before transplantation&#xD;
      can be performed, and (2) limited availability of fully HLA-MUD for the non-Caucasian&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative donors are used for transplantation in patients without a fully-MUD including&#xD;
      single HLA mismatched unrelated donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood and grafts from&#xD;
      haploidentical related donors but are associated with higher non-relapse mortality and&#xD;
      delayed immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent strategy for haploidentical (haplo) related donor SCT (haplo-SCT) has improved&#xD;
      dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From retrospective studies, haplo-SCT with PTCy are associated with similar overall and&#xD;
      progression-free survivals as with MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT), but with lower&#xD;
      rates of toxicity and graft versus host disease (GvHD), and thus potentially better results&#xD;
      than MUD-SCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Haplo-SCT with PTCy is thus&#xD;
      highly discussed nowadays motivating prospective trials to confirm the benefit of this&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen in adults with high risk&#xD;
      hematological malignancies, few retrospective non-controlled registry studies recently&#xD;
      suggest that outcomes after haplo-SCT using PTCy approach might also be superior in terms of&#xD;
      GVHD free survival to that after MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to address this question, in a randomized prospective phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing HLA 10/10 MUD and haplo-SCT after MAC regimen. The stem cell source&#xD;
      will be bone marrow for haploidentical SCT and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) for&#xD;
      HLA-matched unrelated transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the 1-year progression free survival without acute grade II-IV GvHD&#xD;
      and without moderate and severe chronic GvHD.&#xD;

-Relapse evaluation:&#xD;
For myeloid malignancies, the relapse will be defined by the reappearance of leukemic cells after SCT.&#xD;
For ALL, the relapse will be defined by: the reappearance of leukemic cells after SCT and/or an increase of at least 50 % of the smallest measure of any lymphnode considered abnormal in the pre-transplantation period for patients in partial response and in non-responders and/or the appearance of any new lesion in comparison with the pre-transplantation period evaluation.&#xD;
- GvHD evaluation:&#xD;
Grading of acute GVHD will be performed according to the classification of Glusckberg.&#xD;
Grading of chronic GVHD will be performed according to the NIH classification.</description>

EBMT criteria for grading VOD severity in adult patients are based on the level of bilirubin and its rate of change, liver function (transaminase), weight increase, renal function and the kinetic of their onset (Mohty et al., 2016). This grading system is divided into five categories as following: mild, moderate; severe, very severe; and death.&#xD;
