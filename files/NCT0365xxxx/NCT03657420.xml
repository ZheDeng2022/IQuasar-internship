    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs that will be administered are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABI-009 (nab-rapamycin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ABI-009 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved pomalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment options for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ABI-009 (study drug) will be safe and slow&#xD;
      the progress of the disease when used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone,&#xD;
      depending on what type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABI-009 is an inhibitor of an overactive biological pathway in the cancer cells. Pomalidomide&#xD;
      is an immunomodulatory agent and believed to work by affecting the growth signals that keep&#xD;
      cancer cells alive. Dexamethasone is a steroid which is believed to kill cancer cells. The&#xD;
      investigators hope that the combination of ABI-009 with pomalidomide and dexamethasone will&#xD;
      help stop the growth of the cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is the highest dose of ABI-009 (nab-rapamycin) when administered in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone that dose not cause unacceptable side effects. The maximum tolerated dose is determined in clinical trials by testing increasing doses on different groups of people until the highest dose with acceptable side effects is found.
