      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of IRX-2 when given together with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and nivolumab in treating patients with liver cancer that has come back or&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body and does not response to treatment. Biological therapies,&#xD;
      such as IRX-2, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving IRX-2, cyclophosphamide, and nivolumab may&#xD;
      work better than the IRX?2 regimen alone in treating patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of combination IRX?2 regimen and nivolumab in&#xD;
      anti?PD?1/PD?L1 naive patients who have failed or not tolerated at least one line of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX?2 regimen combined with nivolumab using&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune modified RECIST&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the rate of 6?month progression?free survival in patients treated with&#xD;
      combination IRX?2 regimen with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate median progression?free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after therapy with the&#xD;
      combination IRX?2 regimen and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic assay&#xD;
      (MHC?PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]&#xD;
      and immune cell profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to&#xD;
      treatment with combination IRX?2 regimen and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IRX-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV&#xD;
      on day 1, and IRX-2 subcutaneously (SC) for 10 days between days 4 and 15. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients receive booster IRX-2 SC at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.&#xD;
