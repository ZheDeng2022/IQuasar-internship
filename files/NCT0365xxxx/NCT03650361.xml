        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male or non pregnant female aged ≥ 12 and ≤ 40 years with a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
             of acne vulgaris.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are 18 years of age or older (up to the age of 40 inclusive) must have&#xD;
             provided IRB approved written informed consent. Subjects ages 12 to 17 years of age&#xD;
             inclusive must have provided IRB approved written assent; this written assent must be&#xD;
             accompanied by an IRB approved written informed consent from the Subject's legally&#xD;
             acceptable representative (i.e., parent or guardian). In addition, all Subjects or&#xD;
             their legally acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA&#xD;
             authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a minimum ≥ 25 non-inflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed&#xD;
             comedones) AND ≥ 20 inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules and pustules) and ≤ 2&#xD;
             nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts), at baseline on the face. For the&#xD;
             purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the&#xD;
             facial treatment area. When counting facial acne lesions, it is important that all&#xD;
             lesions be counted, including those present on the nose. Lesions involving the eyes,&#xD;
             lip and scalp should be excluded from the count. Subjects may have acne lesions on&#xD;
             other areas of the body which will also be excluded from the count, treatment, and the&#xD;
             Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) evaluation (e.g., on the back, chest and arms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a definite clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris of severity grade 2,&#xD;
             3, or 4 as per the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to refrain from using all other topical acne medications or&#xD;
             antibiotics during the 12-week treatment period for acne vulgaris, other than the&#xD;
             Investigational Product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female Subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically&#xD;
             sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 1 year), in addition to having a negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control from&#xD;
             the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last administration of&#xD;
             study drug. For the purpose of this study the following are considered acceptable&#xD;
             methods of birth control: oral or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches,&#xD;
             Depo-Provera® (stabilized for at least 3 months); NuvaRing® (vaginal contraceptive);&#xD;
             Implanon™ (contraceptive implant) double barrier methods (e.g. condom and spermicide);&#xD;
             IUD, or abstinence. If a subject who was abstinent becomes sexually active during the&#xD;
             study, a 2nd acceptable method of birth control should be documented. A sterile sexual&#xD;
             partner is NOT considered an adequate form of birth control. Hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
             should not be initiated or changed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All male Subjects must agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their&#xD;
             partners, from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last&#xD;
             administration of study drug. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.&#xD;
             Female partners should use an acceptable method of birth control as described in the&#xD;
             above Item Number 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
