  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the SENSITACT system is to activate an adaptive kinesthetic stimulation to treat&#xD;
      apnea-bradycardia events on preterm infants, while minimizing deleterious effects, in&#xD;
      particular arousals that can be due either to respiratory efforts or to kinesthetic&#xD;
      stimulation itself. This novel system will provide an alternative treatment to&#xD;
      apnea-bradycardia, with improved patient comfort and autonomy. In particular, it may become a&#xD;
      complementary solution for the current treatments (Manual stimulation by caregivers,&#xD;
      continuous or intermittent nasal positive pressure ventilation and methylxanthine therapies)&#xD;
      that do not appear to be optimal and usually only allow a partial reduction in the number and&#xD;
      severity of apneas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis behind the SENSITACT system is that kinesthetic stimulation can terminate&#xD;
      apneas-bradycardias with minimal patient arousal. The aim is to stimulate mechanoreceptors&#xD;
      through the skin by kinesthetic stimulation on the lower abdominal zone. This is a region of&#xD;
      the body that is covered with Pacinian corpuscles, a very sensitive kind of mechanoreceptors,&#xD;
      which respond to rapid vibrations on the skin (200-300 Hz). Vibro-tactile stimulation of&#xD;
      these mechano-receptors will trigger a reaction typical of the startle reflex. This reflex&#xD;
      causes 1) an immediate myotonic reaction and 2) a widespread autonomic response. The former&#xD;
      should have a direct effect on obstructive respiratory disorders with an increase in chin&#xD;
      muscle tones within 80 to 100 ms. The latter should act on central respiratory disorders,&#xD;
      with activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Since both responses are mediated via&#xD;
      sub-cortical nervous center, it is expected that patient arousal will be limited. Preliminary&#xD;
      clinical studies on adult patients conducted by LTSI, Sorin CRM and CHU de Grenoble&#xD;
      (Skin&amp;SAS, HYPNOS, EKINOx), that have used the same PASITHEA stimulation device have&#xD;
      confirmed activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a significant reduction in the&#xD;
      duration of apnea or hypopnea events, while no differences were observed on patients' sleep&#xD;
      architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SENSITACT system is able to detect apneas-bradycardias in real-time, so that kinesthetic&#xD;
      stimulation can be triggered to stop respiratory disorders very early during the event.&#xD;
      Detection is performed within the SENSITACT controller station that receives data from all&#xD;
      sensors connected to the Patient Monitor in real-time. As soon as the early signs of an&#xD;
      apnea-bradycardia are detected, the SENSITACT controller sends a trigger signal to the&#xD;
      PASITHEA stimulator that immediately activates kinesthetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesthetic stimulation is stopped when a normal condition (normal cardiac rhythm) is&#xD;
      detected or when a maximum number of stimulation pulses have been reached.&#xD;
