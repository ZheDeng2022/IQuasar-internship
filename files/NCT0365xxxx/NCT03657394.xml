    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a study on non-vigorous infants at birth to determine if&#xD;
      umbilical cord milking (UCM) results in lower rate of moderate to severe hypoxic ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HIE) or death than early clamping and for infants who are non-vigorous at&#xD;
      birth and need immediate resuscitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a brain injury caused by inadequate blood flow and&#xD;
      oxygen delivery to the neonatal brain. Almost all infants with severe HIE and 30-50% infants&#xD;
      with moderate HIE either die or develop significant developmental delay, cerebral palsy or&#xD;
      other disabilities.The incidence of HIE is 1-3 per 1,000 term births in developed countries&#xD;
      and 15-20 times higher in developing countries (Worldwide, 0.5 to 1 million infants develop&#xD;
      HIE each year). Therapeutic hypothermia is the only proven therapy for infants with HIE. Even&#xD;
      after receiving therapeutic hypothermia, one-half of all infants with moderate and severe HIE&#xD;
      die or develop neurological and functional impairment. Therapeutic hypothermia is not widely&#xD;
      available and ineffective in developing nations.There is an urgent need for a new therapy for&#xD;
      neonates with HIE, which can complement hypothermia and be readily available in developing&#xD;
      nations. Stem cell transplantation is a potential therapy for infants with HIE. Umbilical&#xD;
      cord blood is a rich source of stem cells. Umbilical cord milking (UCM) may have similar&#xD;
      effect as autologous umbilical cord blood cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests a placental transfusion in term infants may be a&#xD;
      neuroprotective mechanism that can also facilitate cardiovascular transition for neonates&#xD;
      depressed at birth and result in decreased mortality and improved neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes. Infants with HIE, due to varied complications during the birth process, have poor&#xD;
      perfusion due to fetal blood volume loss to the placenta. However, the most common method of&#xD;
      providing placental blood, delayed cord clamping (DCC) cannot be performed since infants with&#xD;
      HIE are non-vigorous and providers often need to perform resuscitation immediately after&#xD;
      birth. The World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      (ACOG) also does not recommended DCC in neonates who are non-vigorous (limp, pale, and not&#xD;
      breathing) at birth and require immediate resuscitation. Umbilical cord milking (UCM) or&#xD;
      gently squeezing cord blood toward the baby, is an alternative to DCC, which can achieve&#xD;
      significant placental transfusion without delaying resuscitation. Further, UCM can be&#xD;
      completed as quickly as immediate cord clamping (ICC) and UCM requires minimal training and&#xD;
      no additional staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that UCM will reduce the number of infants developing moderate&#xD;
      to severe HIE or death in neonates who are non-vigorous at birth compared to early cord&#xD;
      clamping (ECC). This will be a cluster crossover randomized controlled trial. Each hospital&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to use either ECC or UCM for any infant who is non-vigorous at&#xD;
      birth and needing resuscitation over a period of 6 months. Then the site will change to the&#xD;
      other method for an additional 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>The delivering practitioner will place the newborn below the level of the incision (at the edge of the table) at C/S and a second team member will milk the cord four times. For vaginal delivery, the delivering obstetrician, midwife or perinatal provider will hold the infant against their body or place the infant on the mother's abdomen and the cord will be milked either four times by the obstetrical provider or by a second team member. For the cord milking procedure, the obstetrical provider will milk 20-30 centimeters length of the umbilical cord over two seconds, repeating three additional times as described previously. This time is not significantly different from the time for ECC.</description>
