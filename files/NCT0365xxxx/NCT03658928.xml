      ICAN was a non-interventional study to explore the EGFR gene mutation status, clinical&#xD;
      outcome and recurrent risk factors in early stage Chinese NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology&#xD;
      after complete resection (NIS-OCN-DUM-2009/1). The study had enrolled 571 patients from Apr.&#xD;
      2010 to Dec. 2010 in 24 sites located in the mainland of China. The study had completed and&#xD;
      major results showed that EGFR mutation rate was 55.1% and 3-year DFS rate was 61.7% in early&#xD;
      stage Chinese NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after complete resection. Postoperative&#xD;
      pathologic stage, gender, surgical and resection types had a statistically significant&#xD;
      association with 3-year DFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is ICAN extension study with the purpose to collect the overall survival data from&#xD;
      previous ICAN study. Approximately 571 patients who participated in ICAN study will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the overall survival of early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after&#xD;
           complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the updated DFS of early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after&#xD;
           complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the treatment pattern after tumor recurrence of early stage NSCLC with&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma histology after complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study in&#xD;
           real-world setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the risk factors of OS for early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology&#xD;
           after complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study in real-world setting, such as&#xD;
           EGFR mutation status, gender, smoking history, treatment pattern after recurrence, etc.&#xD;
