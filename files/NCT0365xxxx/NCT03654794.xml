  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are highly variable and may result in graft rejection&#xD;
      (underdosing) or toxicity (overdosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of transplant rejection and the toxicity of tacrolimus can be reduced by&#xD;
      pharmacological therapeutic monitoring of the molecule, based on the measurement of residual&#xD;
      blood concentrations. Nevertheless, some patients are victims of rejections or toxic signs&#xD;
      even though their blood concentrations are in the therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus diffusion in&#xD;
      mononuclear cells as well as the kinetics of effect of the drug on its target protein&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Factors responsible for pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus are multiple: compliance,&#xD;
      diet, drug interactions and also genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP 3A5) and&#xD;
      efflux protein ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of tacrolimus is based on inhibition of calcineurin in T cells.&#xD;
      Therefore, tacrolimus intra-lymphocyte concentration may be a finer marker of the risk of&#xD;
      transplant rejection or toxicity. The degree of inhibition of calcineurin in the T lymphocyte&#xD;
      could also be a pharmacodynamic marker more relevant than the blood concentration. The&#xD;
      hypothesis that the ABCB1 efflux pump is the main factor limiting the diffusion of tacrolimus&#xD;
      into mononuclear cells is advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diffusion of tacrolimus into mononuclear cells and the impact of the ABCB1 efflux pump on&#xD;
      this diffusion have not been studied to date. The effect kinetics of the drug on calcineurin&#xD;
      in mononuclear cells is also unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus diffusion in&#xD;
      mononuclear cells as well as the kinetics of effect of the drug on its target protein:&#xD;
      calcineurin in the presence or absence of an efflux pump inhibitor ABCB1 at room temperature&#xD;
      and at 4 Â° C (in order to inhibit all transport proteins) from blood obtained from 18&#xD;
      patients undergoing bleeding as part of maintenance treatment for hemochromatosis.&#xD;

    <description>The study is conducted with mononuclear cells obtained from patients undergoing phlebotomy as part of a hemochromatosis treatment.&#xD;
The blood samples will be recovered immediately after their completion. 40 mL of blood will be collected and the mononuclear cells separated using a ficoll gradient.&#xD;
