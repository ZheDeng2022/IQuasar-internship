      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using the BrainSonix BX Pulsar&#xD;
      1002 low-frequency and Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsations (LIFUP) in human subjects&#xD;
      suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The patients selected will already be&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo surgery for resection of the temporal lobe, and the investigational&#xD;
      therapy will be applied to the temporal lobe at least one day prior to its scheduled removal.&#xD;
      The study is intended to provide preliminary evidence of safety, and establish the&#xD;
      feasibility of LIFUP treatment as evidenced by a modulation of the Blood-oxygenation level&#xD;
      dependent (BOLD) signal in functional MRI (fMRI), and normal findings from histological&#xD;
      examination of the resected brain tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive and controllable suppression of regional brain activity may open new avenues for&#xD;
      the treatment and management of epilepsy. There is good evidence that direct stimulation of&#xD;
      epileptogenic sources can powerfully suppress seizure rates, but so far minimally invasive&#xD;
      attempts have shown limited success. Currently, there are no approved non-invasive procedures&#xD;
      for seizure suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a promising new potential treatment, because it can target any&#xD;
      region in the brain, regardless of depth, with high spatial specificity. FUS allows for the&#xD;
      non-invasive delivery of acoustic energy to a well-localized and circumscribed brain region&#xD;
      of a few millimeters in diameter, depositing mechanical or thermal energy. The possibility of&#xD;
      transcranial application of FUS into deep brain areas has already been demonstrated by the&#xD;
      strategic placement and operation of an array of multiple ultrasound transducers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound based BrainSonix device is a highly novel non-invasive alternative to direct&#xD;
      stimulation. Capitalizing on non-invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU),&#xD;
      BrainSonix, using an animal model, found early evidence of selective suppression of regional&#xD;
      neural activity in the brain. Importantly these effects were non-thermal and reversible.&#xD;
      Further study is required to validate and characterize the degree of suppressive effects on&#xD;
      epilepsy to ensure safe application in human subjects. Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound&#xD;
      Pulsation (LIFUP) differs from HIFU because the intensities of ultrasound used are an order&#xD;
      of magnitude lower than HIFU. Also, whereas ablative HIFU is administered continuously, LIFUP&#xD;
      is administered in short pulses, which reduces energy deposition. The investigators' and&#xD;
      others data have demonstrated that administration of ultrasound, as LIFUP, causes a&#xD;
      significant, but reversible, neuromodulatory effect, while preventing the tissue from being&#xD;
      thermally damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Assessment The initial assessment will be performed shortly after signing the consent&#xD;
      form. The patient will meet with the clinician and baseline demographic information and&#xD;
      general physical information will be collected. The patient will also undergo a&#xD;
      psychiatric/neurological evaluation, including a neurological exam, and several&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric questionnaires using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) self-report, the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI) self-report, a neuropsychiatric battery of tests described in&#xD;
      section 9.2.4 below, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the&#xD;
      Mini-Mental Status Assessment (MMSE). They will also be required to complete an Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) screening questionnaire to detect the presence of any devices that&#xD;
      might present a safety risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 Treatment and Assessment At visit 2, the location of the epileptic focus will be&#xD;
      determined based on previously performed studies as part of the individual's routine epilepsy&#xD;
      evaluation. The location of the epileptic focus will be determined based on previously&#xD;
      performed studies as part of the individual's routine epilepsy evaluation. Brain MRI,&#xD;
      interictal electroencephalogram (EEG), ictal EEG, interictal positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET), ictal PET, interictal single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), ictal&#xD;
      SPECT, interictal magnetoencephalography (MEG), ictal MEG, and magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
      spectroscopy data may be available and utilized to determine each participant's epileptogenic&#xD;
      zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIFUP will be administered to the temporal region on the side to undergo surgery, within the&#xD;
      focus producing seizures (as determined by the comprehensive epilepsy evaluation). LIFUP&#xD;
      session will take place during the 7 days prior to the operation. See Section 8.2.1 for more&#xD;
      details regarding the LIFUP Sonication procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the procedure. Routine&#xD;
      electrode electroencephalography (EEG) will be recorded immediately before and after the&#xD;
      LIFUP sonication session. Recording will last approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same neurological exam and neuropsychiatric questionnaires using the Brief Symptom&#xD;
      Inventory (BSI) self-report, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) self-report, and the&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric battery of tests described above will be performed at Visit 2, as well.&#xD;
      Testing will last approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIFUP Sonication Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) sonications will be conducted using the&#xD;
      LIFUP experimental device BX Pulsar 1002 produced by the Brainsonix Corporation. LIFUP will&#xD;
      be administered to the temporal region on the side to undergo surgery, within the focus&#xD;
      producing seizures (as determined by the comprehensive epilepsy evaluation). In addition the&#xD;
      functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) recording will be done during the LIFUP to&#xD;
      determine the target area of activity and to navigate the focus of the transducer to that&#xD;
      area. The ultrasound will be focused on the highest activity area within the temporal lobe.&#xD;
      Functional MRI of the brain will be obtained throughout the LIFUP session. Initially LIFUP&#xD;
      will be administered below the minimum effective dose determined in previous animal&#xD;
      experiments. Up to 8 sonications will be administered during the LIFUP session. The total&#xD;
      dose of LIFUP is not to exceed 2 min. The total time within the MRI machine will be up to 90&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant is fitted with the transducer they will be placed in the MRI machine&#xD;
      and undergo a series of scans. After placing the transducer over the anterior tip of the&#xD;
      temporal lobe the participant will undergo fMRI BOLD scans with LIFUP excitation: Tone Burst&#xD;
      Duration = 2ms and Pulse Repetition Frequency = 250Hz) at four levels of intensity&#xD;
      (720mW/cm2, 1440mW/cm2, 2880mW/cm2 and 5760mW/cm2). Before increasing the intensity, the&#xD;
      transducer will be moved approximately 5mm posterior. The excitation scans will be analyzed&#xD;
      immediately for evidence of BOLD activation. After the last excitation scan the LIFUP&#xD;
      parameters will be changed to inhibitory parameters: Tone Burst Duration = 0.5ms and Pulse&#xD;
      Repetition Frequency = 100Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Resection and Histology After surgical resection of the anterior temporal lobe,&#xD;
      histology will be performed on the resected tissue to look for evidence of tissue injury not&#xD;
      characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy or previously identified on the routine brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Month Follow-up At three months the epilepsy surgeon will assess the healing of the&#xD;
      surgical wounds and will conduct a Structural MR. The results will be reported back to the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six Month Follow-up At six months the epilepsy surgeon will carry out a neurogical exam, and&#xD;
      several neuropsychiatric questionnaires using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) self-report,&#xD;
      the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) self-report, a neuropsychiatric battery of tests&#xD;
      described in section 9.2.4 below, the MINI, and the Mini Mental Status Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Battery of Tests The following battery of neuropsychiatric tests will be&#xD;
      performed on the study subjects at one of the participant's standard clinical visits, as part&#xD;
      of their standard clinical care and at visit 2 following the LIFUP sonication procedure. This&#xD;
      battery of tests has been designed to not interfere with their standard clinical care. The&#xD;
      Visit 2 scores will be compared to the Visit 1 (Baseline) scores to assess neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      changes as a result of the LIFUP procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seizure Account Participants will be instructed to maintain a daily log of all seizures from&#xD;
      the date of consenting until the date of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Monitoring The patient will be affixed with a heart rate&#xD;
      monitor. A periodic blood pressure check will be performed if the heart rate increases more&#xD;
      than 30% during or immediately after sonication. The investigators' lab has the capacity to&#xD;
      measure those parameters in MRI. If the patient's blood pressure has also increased more than&#xD;
      10% then they will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG Monitoring Routine electrode electroencephalography (EEG) recorded immediately before and&#xD;
      after the LIFUP sonication session. Recording will last approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 30-minute awake EEG using scalp electrodes placed according to the International 10-20&#xD;
      System of electrode placement will be performed immediately before and immediately after the&#xD;
      LIFUP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Safety Analysis The data will be analyzed after the first subject in order to&#xD;
      determine subsequent treatment paradigm in the next 2 subjects. After the first participant,&#xD;
      histology data will also be analyzed by the investigator. If the participant shows&#xD;
      histological damage in the a category (i.e. apoptosis, irreversible blood brain barrier (BBB)&#xD;
      disruption, ischemia) at a given intensity then the investigators will continue with the next&#xD;
      cohort of 2 participants, but the investigators will no longer use that intensity, or higher&#xD;
      intensities. If more than one participant shows histological damage in the same category at&#xD;
      the lowest intensity (720mW/cm2), then the study will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biostatistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® v9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary NC,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses of safety and performance measures will be descriptive in nature.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and&#xD;
      maximum, and categorical variables by a count and percentage. Confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      provided where relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If multiple evaluations are taken in a single patient, statistics described below will be&#xD;
      appropriately modified to accommodate the within patient correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, medical and clinical history variables will be tabulated. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum, and&#xD;
      categorical variables by a count and percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numbers of patients who were enrolled and completed each visit of the study will be&#xD;
      provided, as well as the reasons for all enrollment discontinuations, grouped by major reason&#xD;
      (e.g., lost to follow-up, adverse event). A list of discontinued patients, protocol&#xD;
      deviations, and patients excluded from the efficacy analysis will be provided as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological results in the resected tissue of the anterior temporal lobe will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of all neurological assessment scores at the pre-treatment visit and at the&#xD;
      post-treatment visit will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the number of epileptiform discharges and Epileptiform Discharge frequency (DF)&#xD;
      during a 30-minute period before and a 30-minute period after LIFUP will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in BOLD signal during or after LIFUP sonication will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not have valid data for the efficacy measures will be treated as missing&#xD;
      values. No imputation is planned.&#xD;
