      This is a prospective, open label, dose-escalating, multicenter clinical investigation to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of THIODERM STRONG in the correction of nasolabial&#xD;
      folds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance is assessed using the 5-point Nasolabial Folds Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NLF-SRS) at Week 12 compared to baseline.&#xD;
