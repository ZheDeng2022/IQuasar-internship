  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to find out if a novel phone-based positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention that focuses on improving health behaviors and positive emotions can help&#xD;
      improve mood, health related quality of life, and overall function in patients who have just&#xD;
      undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as part of blood cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a rigorous treatment for blood cancer&#xD;
      patients that can be life-saving, but often causes psychological distress. The investigators&#xD;
      hope that this study will help the research team to develop and implement a positive&#xD;
      psychological intervention designed to help HSCT patients increase positive emotions such as&#xD;
      hope, gratitude, and fulfillment while recovering from a stem cell transplant. Participants&#xD;
      will be selected after receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant treatment&#xD;
      in the past 30 days at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators hope to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, 8-week, phone-based positive&#xD;
           psychology intervention in a small cohort of post-HSCT patients (N = 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore potential benefits of completing the intervention on outcomes of interest, such&#xD;
           as positive affect and overall function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from patients from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record as required for characterization of our population. This&#xD;
      information will include data regarding medical history, current medical variables,&#xD;
      medications, and sociodemographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be approached upon nearing their discharge from the hospital, approximately&#xD;
      30 days after their transplant. Between the time of their discharge and their 100-day&#xD;
      post-transplant visit, there will be three check-in/psychosocial support phone calls at weeks&#xD;
      4, 8, and 12 after discharge to build rapport and discuss their recovery. Then, at week 14,&#xD;
      participants will meet with the principal investigator to complete self-assessment&#xD;
      questionnaires. The participants will then complete an 8-week phone-based positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention, at the end of which the self-assessment questionnaires will be repeated.&#xD;
