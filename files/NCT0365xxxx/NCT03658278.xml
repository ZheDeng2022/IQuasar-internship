  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is twofold: 1) The investigators will evaluate ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging to screen trauma patients to identify patients at increased risk of postoperative&#xD;
      complications associated with sarcopenia. 2) The investigators will evaluate a&#xD;
      commercially-available oral nutritional supplement that has previously been evaluated in&#xD;
      critically-ill intensive care patients and shown benefit for decreasing complications&#xD;
      including decreased wound healing complications, decreased pressure ulcers, decreased&#xD;
      skeletal muscle loss due to immobilization, and decreased one-year mortality.&#xD;

      Following consent, patients will be assigned a unique study identification number (ID). A&#xD;
      master list linking patient ID to patient name and medical record number will be maintained&#xD;
      on a password protected and encrypted departmental server location with access limited to&#xD;
      research staff. Patients will be randomized by the research team using Microsoft Word random&#xD;
      number generator. Patients will not be blinded to their research group, as the experimental&#xD;
      nutrition supplementation group will be asked to consume the nutritional supplement daily for&#xD;
      a period of two weeks following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, the patient's medical record will be reviewed to identify any condition&#xD;
      meeting exclusion criteria. If patient meets inclusion criteria we will obtain the following&#xD;
      data to be recorded in the research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. medical comorbidities necessary to calculate Charlson Comorbidity Index (myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerbrovascular&#xD;
           disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic disorder, peptic ulcer&#xD;
           disease, diabetes without chronic complications, diabetes with chronic complications,&#xD;
           hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, any malignancy, metastatic solid tumor, mild&#xD;
           liver disease, moderate or severe liver disease, HIV/AIDS&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. MSSA/MRSA nasal colonization status (standard preoperative evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. tobacco use history&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. history of DVT or PE&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. other injuries associated with current trauma to calculate Injury Severity Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with operative fixation of their fracture per standard of care.&#xD;
      Within 24 hours of providing informed consent, we will obtain patient weight with a clinical&#xD;
      scale or hospital bed equipped with clinical scale. We will obtain body composition using a&#xD;
      validated handheld ultrasound device that reports fat mass, fat free mass, and % body fat&#xD;
      (BodyMetrix, Intellimatrix, Brentwood, CA). Hand grip strength will be assessed with the&#xD;
      patient's dominant hand, or non-dominant hand if unable to perform due to injury (hand&#xD;
      dynamometer, Hausmann Industries, Northvale, New Jersey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, patients in the treatment group will be asked to consume the nutritional&#xD;
      supplement on a daily basis, in addition to standard nutrition. The control group will have&#xD;
      standard nutrition provided per dietitian recommendation. Patients will have pain medication&#xD;
      and postoperative therapies per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional supplements will be consumed per manufacturer recommendations. Descriptions&#xD;
      of nutritional supplementation are included below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juven is an oral nutritional supplement produced by Abbot Nutrition. It is not considered a&#xD;
      drug and is not under FDA regulation. Juven has been studied in clinical trials and shown to&#xD;
      decrease pressure ulcer occurrence, decrease muscle wasting, and increase collagen deposition&#xD;
      in wound healing (10,11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juven is packaged as a powder containing 24g per pouch and is mixed with 8-10 fl oz water or&#xD;
      juice for consumption. The recommended supplementation schedule is two servings daily in&#xD;
      addition to balanced diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrient data for Juven obtained from manufacturer's website 7/20/2017:&#xD;
      https://abbottnutrition.com/juven Serving size: 24 g (1 packet) L-arginine 7g L-glutamine 7g&#xD;
      Carbohydrate 7.9g Sugars 1g Calcium 200mg Calcium beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate 1.5g&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, we will communicate with patients by mobile phone&#xD;
      messaging on a daily basis to confirm consumption of the investigative nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation. We will also communicate with patients at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and&#xD;
      12 months after surgery to inquire about any complications or hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, patients will be reevaluated in the orthopedic trauma clinic at routine&#xD;
      intervals per standard of care (postoperative visits are typically scheduled at 2 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks, 6 months, and 1 year). Patients will be seen in clinic by orthopedic surgery trauma&#xD;
      staff. All orthopedic trauma staff are included on the research team. As part of routine&#xD;
      clinical follow up visit, research team will review the patient medical record, perform a&#xD;
      focused history and physical exam and document any new hospital readmission, medical&#xD;
      complication, surgical complication. Radiographs will be obtained per standard orthopedic&#xD;
      care to assess fracture healing and no additional radiographs will be obtained for the&#xD;
      purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the patient's first postoperative clinic follow up, we will repeat measures of patient&#xD;
      weight, body composition, and hand grip strength. These measures are expected to take less&#xD;
      than 15 minutes at the time of their clinic appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to complete several questionnaires via RedCap at several times&#xD;
      points during the study. The questionnaires will be completed either in clinic on a tablet or&#xD;
      computer, or a secure link to the study will be emailed to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data collection is planned after one year from the time of surgery.&#xD;
