  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortocoronary bypass surgery is one of the most common operations in the western world. The&#xD;
      goal of the surgeon is to perform a complete revascularization of the coronary arteries with&#xD;
      the best, available bypass material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortocoronary bypass surgery can be performed with (on-pump) or without (off-pump) the heart&#xD;
      lung machine. If the operation is performed without the heart lung machine, the heart is&#xD;
      continuously beating while the surgeon sews the bypass to the diseased coronary artery. In&#xD;
      randomized trials, the benefits of the off-pump technique in the hands of experienced&#xD;
      surgeons in terms of shorter operating times, less transfusions and less pulmonary and renal&#xD;
      complications were proven. A criticism of the off-pump technique is the reduced number of&#xD;
      distal anastomoses, which means that fewer coronary arteries may be connected with bypass&#xD;
      grafts because of the technically sophisticated situation. A worse quality of the connection&#xD;
      (anastomosis) between coronary artery and bypass is often discussed, leading to a bypass&#xD;
      occlusion already in the early stage after surgery resulting in more re-interventions on the&#xD;
      coronary vessels. So-called silent bypass failure without clinical correlation has been&#xD;
      examined in three relevant studies including both, the on- and the off-pump technique, with&#xD;
      inhomogenous results. In addition to the technique, other parameters such as the degree of&#xD;
      narrowing (stenosis) of the diseased coronary artery and collateralization of a closed&#xD;
      coronary artery may play a role in early occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All bypass patients after off-pump surgery receive routinely a computed tomographic&#xD;
      examination of the heart. With this method, silent bypass occlusions without clinical&#xD;
      correlation, i.e. cardiac infarction, elevated cardiac laboratory parameters or ECG changes,&#xD;
      can be detected easily. In case of an occlusion of a relevant bypass, an intervention before&#xD;
      discharge can be planned and performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to investigate the occlusion rate of this retrospective patient cohort after&#xD;
      off-pump surgery and the potential risk factors, that may influence on early graft failure.&#xD;
      We hypothesize, that early graft failure depends not only on the choice of the graft&#xD;
      material, but also on the local grade of coronary stenosis, the collateralisation of occluded&#xD;
      coronary vessels and the intraoperative flow results, as well as on the region of the target&#xD;
      vessel.&#xD;
