  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For people living with long-term physical disabilities, such as spinal cord injury or&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, middle-age (45-64) is a period of great vulnerability for losses in&#xD;
      function and participation. There is an urgent need to develop and test interventions that&#xD;
      can be delivered through existing community service agencies to help these people maximize&#xD;
      their community participation and quality of life. This research will test the efficacy of&#xD;
      one such intervention in a community trial and, thereby, contribute to our understanding of&#xD;
      the intervention's effectiveness and mechanisms of action.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Middle-age (45-64) is a time of health vulnerability for millions of Americans. More than 50%&#xD;
      of individuals in the U.S. will have two or more chronic conditions by age 60, contributing&#xD;
      to increased risk of later disability. However, for individuals with long-term physical&#xD;
      disabilities (LTPDs) such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, these risks are&#xD;
      magnified. This vulnerable population is especially in need of interventions to promote&#xD;
      community participation and improve disease self-management during midlife.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 5 years, our research team has adapted an evidence-based health promotion&#xD;
      intervention designed for older adults to serve middle-aged and older adults with LTPD. The&#xD;
      investigators now have a trial version of this intervention (called &quot;EnhanceWellness for&#xD;
      Disability&quot;; EW-D) with promising findings in pilot testing, ready for a larger community&#xD;
      trial. Through a new partnership with 3 regional Centers for Independent Living, the&#xD;
      investigators can now test this program for people with LTPD in 14 counties in the Northwest&#xD;
      U.S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad, long-term aims of this study are to test the efficacy of this program relative to&#xD;
      two control conditions (an attention-matched health education control and treatment as&#xD;
      usual), in 600 community dwelling adults age 45-64 years with LTPD using modern outcome&#xD;
      scales appropriate for people with LTPD. The primary outcome is the ability to participate in&#xD;
      valued community activities. The investigators will seek to determine whether the&#xD;
      intervention was effective and if so, what mechanisms of change drove the effect. In addition&#xD;
      to self-report, the investigators will also collect objective measures of community activity&#xD;
      via global positioning system (GPS) and travel diaries, in a randomly selected subset of 300&#xD;
      participants. This study's specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the efficacy of eight sessions of EW-D, relative to an attention&#xD;
      control condition or treatment as usual, in middle-aged adults with LTPD. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be the self-reported ability to participate in valued community activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To determine if observed intervention effects are due to (1) improved disease&#xD;
      management self-efficacy, (2) decreased interference due to pain and fatigue, or (3)&#xD;
      improvements in psychological resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses. To determine if 1) intervention effects are maintained at 12 months and&#xD;
      2) intervention effects can be detected in objective, GPS-based measures of activity&#xD;
      (quantified as number of trips outside the home, time outside the home, area of travel, and&#xD;
      activity in established categories). The investigators will also examine the potential&#xD;
      moderating effects of biological sex on treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach is consistent with goals described in recent National Institute on Aging (NIA)&#xD;
      and National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) program announcements, including those&#xD;
      calling for age-appropriate interventions to improve self-management of chronic conditions&#xD;
      (PA 14-344) and those calling for prevention research for adults in midlife (PA-15-098). If&#xD;
      hypotheses are confirmed, this work would support a program that could be used to promote&#xD;
      health and wellness in both able-bodied older adults and middle-aged adults with LTPD, which&#xD;
      would be novel to the field and could improve reach.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The investigators propose to make available to interested researchers a data file (de-identified to remove any variables from which it would be possible to identify any individual participant) any data used in a published article, at the time that it is accepted for publication. That is, at the request of an outside researcher, the investigators will create and share a data file that includes all of the variables used in the published article and a list of the variables in the data file (along with their variable labels). Any investigators who request these data will receive (1) a copy of the published article (which will describe the source of the data); (2) the variable list/variable labels; and (3) a data set.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will become available after the main study results are published.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Although any shared data will be stripped of identifiers prior to release, given the very specific nature of the study sample (middle-aged adults with disabilities) it is possible that those who access this data could potentially identify subjects with unusual characteristics or combinations of unusual characteristics. Therefore, the investigators will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_access_criteria>
