  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BTI320&#xD;
      compared to placebo in addition to metformin and/or sulfonylureas on glycemic control over 12&#xD;
      weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, multi-center study with two treatment arms. Study duration will be&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks. Participants will ingest 4 g BTI320 or matching placebo approximately&#xD;
      10 minutes before starting a meal, 3 times per day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Eight&#xD;
      study visits will be scheduled after the Screening visit: Baseline (day 0), weeks 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 (Visits 2, 4, 6, and 8 respectively) for safety and efficacy assessments and Visits 3, 5,&#xD;
      7 and 9 to remove the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.&#xD;

      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BTI320&#xD;
      compared to placebo in addition to metformin and/or sulfonylureas on glycemic control over 12&#xD;
      weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, multi-center study with two treatment arms. Study duration will be&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks. Participants will ingest 4 g BTI320 or matching placebo approximately&#xD;
      10 minutes before starting a meal, 3 times per day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed not to take the Investigational Medicinal Product with other&#xD;
      drugs at the same time. Additional mealtime medication must be taken after consumption of the&#xD;
      meal. A nutritionist, dietitian, or study personnel will provide instructions to subjects&#xD;
      regarding dietary intake and the need to keep a detailed food record in an online calorie&#xD;
      counter and have it entered into an electronic data capture during the study period. In&#xD;
      general, subjects will be asked to follow normal meal plans recommended to patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. Non-compliance will be defined as taking &lt;80% or &gt;120% of Investigational Medicinal&#xD;
      Product during any outpatient evaluation period (visit to visit). Subjects who are&#xD;
      non-compliant will be replaced to meet the goal of 60 evaluable subjects. Eight study visits&#xD;
      will be scheduled after the Screening visit: Baseline (day 0), weeks 3, 6, and 12 (Visits 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, and 8 respectively) for safety and efficacy assessments and Visits 3, 5, 7 and 9 to&#xD;
      remove the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.&#xD;
