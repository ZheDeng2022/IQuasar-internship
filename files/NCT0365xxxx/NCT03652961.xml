      The immune system of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is different from that of people&#xD;
      who do not have RA. The purpose of this study is to examine your immune cells and proteins&#xD;
      before you start to take study medication and after you start treatment with an approved&#xD;
      therapy for RA, abatacept that will be given in combination with Methotrexate and/or&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) that are approved for the treatment of RA. This study will&#xD;
      assess whether you have clinically responded to these medications. This assessment will also&#xD;
      include a study of whether characteristics of your immune system were changed by therapy with&#xD;
      the study drug, abatacept.&#xD;

    <description>Direct quantitation of the frequency of circulating Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-bearing memory B cells as a percentage of total B cells and memory B cells at baseline and at followup as measured by flow cytometry. These will be correlated with clinical response.&#xD;
Flow cytometric determinations of effects on B-cell subsets, to determine whether abatacept normalizes disease-associated increases in activated memory B cells, and the plasmablast expansions that are associated with active RA disease.&#xD;
Serum will be collected for cytokine/chemokine profiling, which will be highly informative due to the challenge/dechallenge design.&#xD;
Site will count absolute numbers of PBMC in samples obtained from defined volume of blood and calculate percentages of B cell subsets, CD4 vs CD19 ratios. And percentages of Memory vs naïve B cells amongst CD45 positive cells.</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effects of abatacept on circulating Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Immunoglobulin G (IgG), and IgG-ACPA antibody levels, in assays using a panel of matched citrulline- and arginine-containing peptides/self-proteins. Antibody responses will be in standardized assays with relative units per ml, assessed in an ELISA or bead based assay, at 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10,000 dilutions.</description>

    <measure>Quantification of relationships between co-primary endpoints over time and then confirm this relationship by dechallenge of Abatacept after induction of low disease activity at 24 weeks - RAPID-3 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Abatacept therapy that induces clinical benefits, are paralleled by reductions (i.e., normalization) in the in vivo representation of disease-associated anti-citrullinated protein antigen (ACPA) memory B cells after 6 months of treatment. Response will be measured by RAPID-3 questionnaire.&#xD;
The RAPID3 includes a subset of core variables found in the Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire HAQ (MD-HAQ, scoring of physical function from 1-10 , a patient global assessment (PGA) for pain from 1-10, and a PGA for global health from 1-10. RAPID3 scores are quickly tallied by adding subsets of the MD-HAQ.&#xD;
-Scoring 1-10 where 10 is maximal activity&#xD;
A patient who scores between 0-1.0 is defined as near remission (NR); 1.3-2.0 as low severity (LS); 2.3-4.0 as moderate severity (MS); and 4.3-10.0 as high severity (HS).</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI is a clinical composite score for following patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
CDAI = SJC(28) + TJC(28) + PGA + EGA SJC(28): Swollen 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) TJC(28): Tender 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) PGA: Patient Global disease Activity (patient's score of overall RA disease activity on a scale 1-10 where 10 is maximal activity) EGA: Evaluator's Global disease Activity (evaluator's score of overall RA disease activity on a scale 1-10 where 10 is maximal activity) INTERPRETATION Remission CDAI ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity CDAI &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity CDAI &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity CDAI &gt; 22 A CDAI reduction of 6.5 represents moderate improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SJC(28): Swollen 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) Joint Assessor will conduct a standard 28 tender and swollen joint count of patient at each visit throughout the trial. The swollen joint count is the amount of inflamed synovial tissue, and the tender joint count scores the level of pain. This score will be used in the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) calculation.</description>

    <description>DAS28 is calculated according to the formula that is composed of the number of tender joints and swollen joints, patient's global assessment of disease activity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 1-10 (10 is maximal activity) , and C-reactive protein (CRP) lab results.&#xD;
CRP is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/L.</description>

                  listed below. Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of&#xD;
                  the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are expected to adhere to&#xD;
                  using contraception with their partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that&#xD;
                  partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the&#xD;
                  vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.&#xD;
&#xD;

                       drugs and must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus&#xD;
                       5 half-lives of the investigational drug plus 30 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete&#xD;
                       abstinence is elected.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy&#xD;
                       tests&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be&#xD;
                       discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete&#xD;
                       abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to&#xD;
                       the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                       the subject.&#xD;

                  conditions that are warnings against the use of TNF inhibitor agents. 13. Current&#xD;
                  clinical findings of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,&#xD;
                  hematological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, psychiatric, cardiac, endocrine,&#xD;
                  neurological, or cerebral disease including severe and uncontrolled infections,&#xD;
                  such as sepsis and opportunistic infections. Concomitant medical conditions that,&#xD;
                  in the opinion of the investigator, might place the subject at unacceptable risk&#xD;
                  for participation in this study. 14. Subjects who have received any live vaccines&#xD;
                  within 3 months of the study drug administration or are scheduled to receive live&#xD;
                  vaccines during the study. Study subjects should not be administered a live virus&#xD;
                  vaccine for a minimum of 3 months f following the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
                  Subjects who are in close contact with others who have received a live vaccine&#xD;
                  may be enrolled at the investigator's discretion. 15. Subjects who have undergone&#xD;
                  a major surgical procedure within the 60 days prior to randomization. 16.&#xD;
                  Subjects for whom 5 or more joints cannot be assessed for tenderness or swelling&#xD;
                  (i.e. due to surgery, fusion, amputation, etc.). 17.Subjects who are prisoners,&#xD;
                  or compulsory detained.&#xD;
