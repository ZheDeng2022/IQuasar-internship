      The development and validation of a concise, practical, on-line, self-administered,&#xD;
      self-archiving, and self-scoring PRO questionnaire for routine clinical use in refractive&#xD;
      surgery is the primary study objective. Secondary objectives are to gather outcome data from&#xD;
      patients before and after surgery in each of the following domains comprising key elements of&#xD;
      vision related quality of life: spectacle dependence; quality of vision; eye comfort;&#xD;
      freedom; emotional well-being; and overall satisfaction with the results of surgery. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing refractive surgery at Moorfields Private Outpatient Clinic will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study in the validation phase.&#xD;

      Specific aims of the study The investigators aim to take a novel PRO questionnaire from the&#xD;
      conceptual framing stage through a well-defined validation pathway including cognitive&#xD;
      interviews, field data collection in the target population, and Rasch modification. Secondary&#xD;
      aims are to take the modified instrument through prospective studies of repeatability and&#xD;
      sensitivity to change. The investigatorsÂ´ ultimate goal is to develop a concise, screen&#xD;
      based, self-administered, self-archiving and self-scoring PRO instrument for use as part of&#xD;
      the National Dataset in Refractive Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1. Conceptual framing and draft development Conceptual framing and draft development for&#xD;
      the questionnaire is complete. This was based on a comprehensive literature review, patient&#xD;
      and surgeon feedback during RCOphth Refractive Surgery Standards development consultation,&#xD;
      and advice from a panel of expert collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators began with a literature review of existing refractive error specific&#xD;
      questionnaires, including the following: (1) National Eye Institute Refractive Quality of&#xD;
      Life (NEI-RQL), (2) Refractive Status and Vision Profile (RSVP), (3) Quality of Life Impact&#xD;
      of Refractive Correction (QIRC), (4) Quality of Vision (QoV), (5) Canadian Refractive Surgery&#xD;
      Research Group Quality of Vision Questionnaire (QVQ), (6) PERK Study Questionnaire, (7)&#xD;
      Multidimensional Quality of Life for Myopia (MQLM) Scale, (8) Myopia-Specific Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MQLQ), (9) Subjective Vision Questionnaire (SVQ), (10) Refractive Error&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale (REQ-Thai), (11) The Freedom from Glasses Value Scale (FGVS), (12) Near&#xD;
      Activity Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ), Catquest questionnaire (CatQuest 9SF), and ocular&#xD;
      comfort index (OCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those questionnaires have been identified as refractive error specific in a recent review&#xD;
      article published in JRS. The ocular comfort index (OCI) addresses ocular surface irritation.&#xD;
      Unlike previous instruments designed to measure eye comfort such as the widely used ocular&#xD;
      surface disease index (OSDI), it is unidimensional and was developed using Rasch fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to FDA recommendations, a conceptual framework is helpful in guiding the&#xD;
      development of a PRO instrument . Following these recommendations, the investigators first&#xD;
      identified the aspects of PRO for refractive surgery to be measured. Each of these aspects or&#xD;
      &quot;domains&quot; is measured by a set of items. The investigators identified and included the&#xD;
      following subscales:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spectacle dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of vision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ocular comfort symptoms /Eye comfort (Eye comfort is used in the questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freedom&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Looking and Feeling Well&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having defined the domains of interest, the next task was to reduce and adapt the pool of&#xD;
      candidate questionnaire items. Winnowing refers to reducing the item pool to the smallest&#xD;
      number of items, making sure that the domain of interest will still be adequately measured.&#xD;
      DeWalt et al. stated that winnowing helps to accurately define and identify those item&#xD;
      characteristics relevant to each domain. Items are deleted if they are considered to&#xD;
      duplicate the information captured, or if they are deemed to be potentially confusing to&#xD;
      respondents. The investigators focused preferentially on items from Rasch weighted&#xD;
      instruments. The investigators also reviewed items within each domain attempting to ensure,&#xD;
      with input from patients and experts, that the most relevant aspects of each domain are&#xD;
      captured by the item sets in the draft instrument. The investigators intended to keep a set&#xD;
      of non-redundant items that are consistent with the domain, universally understood, and&#xD;
      relevant to a wide range of the adult population. Items were revised so they would be&#xD;
      understood by the largest possible number of people. In addition, consistency was sought to&#xD;
      the extent possible in wording, recall interval, and response options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators opted to use four response options based on a balance between parsimony and&#xD;
      adequate sampling. Both the most widely used current instruments (QIRC and CatQuest), after&#xD;
      Rasch modification in development, focus on four response option scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make items more universally understood, slight modifications to item stems and/or response&#xD;
      options from their original form were made in those cases where we believed simplification&#xD;
      was necessary. All changes in wording were then tested versus original versions in cognitive&#xD;
      interviews. Items that were too long or confusing were shortened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2. Cognitive interviews Cognitive interviews will be conducted to optimise face validity&#xD;
      (comprehensibility) of items and response options. Forty participants will be recruited from&#xD;
      the waiting rooms of the Refractive Surgery Service at Moorfields Private Eye Hospital&#xD;
      (Consultant Bruce Allan MD). The sample should include 20 males and 20 females of different&#xD;
      age and educational background (highest degree). A trained interviewer (Andreas Frings MD)&#xD;
      will conduct all of the cognitive interviews. Participants will be asked to describe in their&#xD;
      own words what each item is asking, and in some cases to compare different ways of asking the&#xD;
      same question. These interviews will be helpful because subjects can directly provide input&#xD;
      and suggestions on every item considered for inclusion. As a result of these interviews,&#xD;
      items could be further simplified, some words could be deleted, some items could be reworded,&#xD;
      and some parts of the stems could be added to response options for clarity. The revised&#xD;
      survey will then be used for field testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3. Field testing and item calibration After questionnaire refinement resulting from&#xD;
      cognitive interviews, the investigators will gather completed questionnaire data from a&#xD;
      representative cross-section of the target patient population for Rasch fitting. Step 2 is&#xD;
      the major component of the validation study and is described in detail below.&#xD;
