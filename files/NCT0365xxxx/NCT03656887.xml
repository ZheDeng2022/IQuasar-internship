  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major public health problem that has been growing steadily in recent years. Its&#xD;
      prevalence is very high in the elderly, in whom there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia in elderly diabetics has serious consequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased cardiovascular morbidity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased risk of falling,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impairment of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycaemia is also a risk factor for dementia in type 2 diabetes. The frequency of&#xD;
           asymptomatic and atypical hypoglycemia has been shown to be greater in the elderly, but&#xD;
           the exact prevalence of hypoglycemia in the elderly remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly diabetic patients in institutions are particularly fragile and have more frequent&#xD;
      cognitive problems than non-diabetic subjects. A study conducted in this population of&#xD;
      patients showed that a third of them had HbA1C &lt;6.5%, which suggests a higher frequency of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia though the figures were not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore decided to conduct a study to assess the frequency of hypoglycemia in order to&#xD;
      better understand the contributing factors and to improve the management of this fragile&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
