  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Revita™ System is being investigated to assess the ability to improve glycemic control in&#xD;
      conjunction with diet and exercise in patients with Type 2 diabetes who are inadequately&#xD;
      controlled with oral anti-diabetic medications. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of the Fractyl DMR Procedure using the Revita™ System compared&#xD;
      to a sham procedure. At 24 weeks, subjects randomized to the DMR procedure be continued to be&#xD;
      followed per protocol till 48 Weeks and the Sham treatment arm will be offered to cross over&#xD;
      to receive the DMR treatment and will be followed per protocol for 24 weeks post treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled prospective multi-center clinical&#xD;
      investigation of subjects with T2D sub-optimally controlled on two oral anti-diabetic&#xD;
      medications, one of which must be metformin, comparing the Fractyl DMR procedure using the&#xD;
      Revita™ System to a sham procedure. All subjects will participate in a 4 week oral&#xD;
      anti-diabetic medication run-in period before the procedure to confirm inadequate blood&#xD;
      glucose control in conjunction with medication compliance and nutritional counseling.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all criteria after screening are randomized 2:1 (DMR to sham), with double&#xD;
      blinding (subject and endocrinologist/Sponsor). The endoscopist is not blinded.&#xD;

    <description>The Fractyl DMR procedure utilizes the Revita™ Catheter to perform hydrothermal ablation of the duodenum. The catheter is delivered trans-orally over a guide-wire to first inject saline to lift the sub-mucosal space, followed by an ablation of the duodenal mucosa. Subjects who receive the DRM treatment are followed for 48 weeks while Sham subjects who cross over and undergo the DMR procedure at 24 weeks are followed for further 24 weeks post treatment. Sham subjects who choose not to cross over are discontinued from the study.</description>
