  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this study is to develop a technique that is capable of&#xD;
      identifying neurophysiological biomarkers sensitive enough to detect preclinical dementia by&#xD;
      integrating Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI). More specifically, this project has two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. To characterize cortical excitability and its relation to cognitive function using&#xD;
           single-pulse TMS paradigm in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. To delineate cortical plasticity and its association to cognitive function using&#xD;
           repetitive TMS paradigm and resting-state fMRI in MCI and healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques to artificially and precisely stimulate brain tissue are increasingly recognized&#xD;
      as valuable tools both in clinical practice and in cognitive neuroscience studies among&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive approach to&#xD;
      stimulate the brain. Importantly, unlike other invasive brain stimulation techniques (e.g.,&#xD;
      surgical deep brain stimulation), no surgery, anesthesia, or sedation is involved. Instead,&#xD;
      TMS involves placing a magnetic coil on the surface of the head. This coil then generates a&#xD;
      magnetic field that is about the same strength as the magnetic field used by MRI machines,&#xD;
      and when this magnetic field rapidly alternates, the neurons under the coil are excited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive guidelines have been published by experts in the field to ensure safe use, and the&#xD;
      thousands of patients &amp; research participants who have received TMS in compliance with these&#xD;
      guidelines demonstrate the safety of this practice. Depending on the method of use, TMS is&#xD;
      very versatile -- it can be used to study research questions pertaining to the neural&#xD;
      circuitry of the brain, it can be used as a diagnostic device, and it can be used&#xD;
      therapeutically to treat various neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators intend to further study the potential for diagnostic&#xD;
      applications of TMS. More specifically, TMS and brain imaging techniques will be used in&#xD;
      combination in order to more sensitively diagnose dementia - perhaps even before symptoms&#xD;
      emerge. Right now, there is no reliable method for doing so and it is difficult to&#xD;
      distinguish between the forgetfulness of healthy aging and the early signs of disease. Our&#xD;
      approach may provide a more sensitive diagnostic tool, which is likely to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In total, 60 participants will be recruited to participate in this trial. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to recruit 30 patients with MCI and 30 age-matched healthy adults. The age range for&#xD;
      inclusion will be 18-80, and the mean age of the healthy cohort will be matched with the mean&#xD;
      age of the MCI cohort. The following revised Mayo Clinic criteria for MCI will be used: (1)&#xD;
      cognitive concern expressed by a physician, informant, participant, or nurse; (2) impairment&#xD;
      in 1 or more cognitive domains (memory, language, visuospatial skills, or executive&#xD;
      functions); (3) essentially normal functional activities; and (4) absence of dementia.&#xD;
      Individuals with MCI will have Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE, Appendix 19) scores between 18&#xD;
      and 23 (inclusive) and have a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score of 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol comprises a single testing visit, comprised of four separate components:&#xD;
      a) Resting-state fMRI, b) Single-pulse TMS paradigm, c) theta-burst rTMS paradigm, and d) a&#xD;
      brief motor task performed on an iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tasks will be repeated before and after the theta-burst rTMS paradigm (c). Therefore,&#xD;
      the testing visit is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) --&gt; (d) --&gt; (b) --&gt; (c) --&gt; (b) --&gt; (a) --&gt; (d)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will enable investigators to study the following both before and after the rTMS&#xD;
      paradigm: 1) connectivity patterns comprising the functional networks of the brain, 2)&#xD;
      measures of cortical excitability derived from single-pulse TMS, and 3) upper extremity motor&#xD;
      speed &amp; acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic stimulation will be performed with a high-power MagPro X100 (MagVenture Inc.&#xD;
      Denmark)(Appendix 11). When the TMS machine delivers stimuli, patients may feel and/or a&#xD;
      clicking/tapping sensation under the coil. Participants will be given ear buds as an&#xD;
      additional safety precaution to protect hearing during the TMS session. Prior to beginning&#xD;
      the TMS session, the research team will make sure the participant is as comfortable as&#xD;
      possible in the TMS chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Pulse TMS Paradigm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the device will need to be calibrated for each individual because everybody has a&#xD;
      different sensitivity to the magnetic fields generated by TMS. The TMS device will be&#xD;
      calibrated to ensure the participant is receiving the lowest possible &quot;dose&quot;. To do so, the&#xD;
      TMS coil will be placed on the scalp directly above the region of the brain that is&#xD;
      responsible for finger motions, which is a specific region of the motor cortex located on the&#xD;
      pre-central gyrus. The TMS coil will then deliver pulses that incrementally escalate until a&#xD;
      level is reached that causes their hand to twitch (specifically, thumb and pointer finger).&#xD;
      This will be visually observed and recorded quantitatively with electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
      sensors. The amount of energy required to make their hand twitch is called the &quot;motor&#xD;
      threshold&quot; and it varies for everybody. This &quot;motor threshold&quot; will then be used to calibrate&#xD;
      the machine for the TMS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A figure-of-eight TMS coil will be held over the motor cortex at the optimum scalp position&#xD;
      to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI)&#xD;
      muscle. In addition to observing the finger movement visually, the investigators will also&#xD;
      attach surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes to the skin on the right FDI. The electrodes&#xD;
      will detect any activity in muscles, which will yield a more accurate measurement for&#xD;
      personal &quot;motor threshold&quot;. The exact location that elicits a motor response in the&#xD;
      contralateral FDI is referred to as the &quot;hot spot&quot;. This location will be recorded using the&#xD;
      real-time TMS 3D Neuronavigation System (Localite TMS Navigator, Germany,&#xD;
      http://www.localite.de/en/products/tms-navigator/#c572) to ensure testing consistency in the&#xD;
      following trials. Localite is a software package used in conjunction with TMS equipment. It&#xD;
      incorporates an infrared camera to record location of the TMS coil relative to the&#xD;
      participants head. This allows researchers to reliably place coil in the same precise&#xD;
      location throughout the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resting motor threshold (RMT) is defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that produces&#xD;
      a liminal MEP (about 50 μV in 50% of 10 trials) at rest. The active motor threshold (AMT) is&#xD;
      generally defined as the minimum stimulus intensity that produces a liminal MEP (about 200 μV&#xD;
      in 50% of 10 trials) during isometric contraction of the tested muscle. Both RMT and AMT will&#xD;
      be expressed as a percentage of the magnetic stimulator maximal output. The RMT and AMT data&#xD;
      from individual participants will serve as a baseline measure of excitability to guide the&#xD;
      intensity of our following single-pulses and repetitive TMS protocols, respectively. This&#xD;
      will be performed for the left hemisphere. The researchers will also use the Parameter&#xD;
      Estimation Sequential Testing (PEST) algorithm to more efficiently identify the RMT and AMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the motor threshold and &quot;hot spot&quot; is identified for the participant, the TMS coil will&#xD;
      be placed over the &quot;hot spot&quot; that was previously recorded by the Localite Navigator software&#xD;
      and set the stimulus intensity at 80% of the participants uniquely identified AMT. For&#xD;
      example, if the active motor threshold of a specific individual is determined to be 40% of&#xD;
      the MagPro's maximal output, then the device intensity will be set to 32% of maximal output&#xD;
      for the single pulse protocol (32 equals 80% of 40%, the AMT in this example). At this time,&#xD;
      8 TMS pulses are applied (separated by 6 seconds) as the TMS coil is fixed on the &quot;hot spot&quot;.&#xD;
      This step is repeated in increasing increments (i.e., 10% of AMT) up to an intensity&#xD;
      equivalent to 150% of the participant's AMT. This protocol consists of 64 single-pulse&#xD;
      stimuli, which will be delivered repeatedly 6 seconds apart. This procedure is safe and&#xD;
      follows standard single-pulses TMS protocols that have been published previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-pulses TMS protocol will be performed twice, both before and after the rTMS&#xD;
      protocol. Each single-pulses TMS protocol will last approximately 30 minutes. Combined, this&#xD;
      equates to 128 stimuli during the &quot;Single Pulses TMS&quot; paradigms. Throughout the single-pulse&#xD;
      protocol, participants will be asked to touch their pinky and thumb fingers to provide a&#xD;
      subtle background voluntary contraction. This will 'facilitate' the motor pathway and lower&#xD;
      the threshold for stimulation intensity throughout the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocol, a patterned rTMS paradigm called intermittent theta&#xD;
      burst stimulation (iTBS) will be used. The iTBS consists of three biphasic TMS stimuli&#xD;
      presented at 50 Hz, repeated every 200 ms for 2 seconds at an intensity of 80% of AMT (e.g.,&#xD;
      if AMT is determined to be 40% of maximal output, TMS will be delivered at 32% for this&#xD;
      protocol). Therefore, each stimulation train will last for two seconds (30 stimuli per train)&#xD;
      with an inter-train interval of 8 s. This rTMS protocol is comprised of 10 iTBS trains,&#xD;
      totaling 300 stimuli from the magnetic coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this rTMS protocol, the coil will be placed over the &quot;hotspot&quot; of the left hemisphere.&#xD;
      The rTMS protocol will only be performed once and it will last approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will occur in the same building, in a room adjacent to the TMS device. For their safety,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to leave all metal objects and personal items (e.g., wallet,&#xD;
      phone, jewelry) in the waiting room of the MRI center before entering the scanner room.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to lie on their backs and remain still for the duration of the MRI&#xD;
      scan. They will be given earplugs to dampen the noise and to protect their hearing while they&#xD;
      are in the scanner. A Velcro strap may also be place over the forehead and foam pillows will&#xD;
      be provided to minimize head movement during the scans. Every effort will be made to make&#xD;
      participants as comfortable as possible during the scan, including blankets for warmth and&#xD;
      cushions to be placed under the knees/back to reduce stress from lying on one's back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be reminded prior to the scan that their participation is voluntary and&#xD;
      they may signal to stop the scan at any time. There is an intercom system in the scanner,&#xD;
      which will enable the participants to communicate with the MRI technician and member (s) of&#xD;
      the research team for the entire duration that they are in the scanner. Additionally, they&#xD;
      will be able to immediately stop the exam at any time, either by squeezing a signal ball&#xD;
      placed in their hand, which will alert the MRI technician in the control room, or by raising&#xD;
      their legs, which will be seen by the experimenter in the control room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, no contrast agent will be used in our collection of MRI data. Also, all MRI data&#xD;
      will be acquired in &quot;resting-state&quot; so participants will just be asked to relax and remain&#xD;
      still for the duration of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, MRI data will be collected on a Siemens 3.0 Tesla Skyra Magnet equipped&#xD;
      with a 32-channel head coil. Total scan time will be 30 minutes. The order of sequences will&#xD;
      be as follows: localizer scan (62 seconds), a Structural MPRAGE (9 minutes), a resting-state&#xD;
      fMRI scan (5 minutes), and a diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scan (14 minutes). The localizer&#xD;
      will be collected using the following parameters - direction: inferior to superior, TR= 8.6&#xD;
      ms, echo time (TE)=4.0 ms, flip angle = 20, FOV=250 mm, 5 slices, 7 mm slice thickness.&#xD;
      High-resolution structural images will be acquired using a T1-weighted spoiled gradient&#xD;
      recalled (SPGR) sequence (TR= 22ms; TE= 5.4ms; FOV= 25.6cm; flip angle= 20°; in-plane matrix&#xD;
      size= 256 x 256; slice thickness= 1mm; number of slices= 172). Whole-brain resting-state fMRI&#xD;
      data will be collected using T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) (TR= 1.5s; TE= 30ms; FOV=&#xD;
      25.6cm; flip angle= 90°; in-plane matrix size= 64 x 64; slice thickness= 4mm), resulting in&#xD;
      functional data from 39 axial slices with isotropic voxels of 4mm3. During the resting-state&#xD;
      fMRI scan, participants will fixate on a cross-hair with eyes open. DTI images will be&#xD;
      acquired in the axial plane using a diffusion sensitized parallel EPI sequence that measures&#xD;
      diffusion in 86 directions (b-factor= 1000 s/mm2; TR= 7s; TE= 82.5ms; field of view (FOV)=&#xD;
      25.6cm, matrix= 128 x 128, 2mm interleaved slices; parallel acceleration factor= 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resting-state fMRI data will be preprocessed using a pipeline&#xD;
      (http://wiki.biac.duke.edu/biac:analysis:resting_pipeline) and tools in the Oxford Centre for&#xD;
      Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL version 5.0.5, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). The&#xD;
      preprocessing steps include slice-time correction, MCFLIRT for motion correction, Brain&#xD;
      Extraction Tool (BET) for brain extraction, and FLIRT for normalization to the MNI 152 T1&#xD;
      template (Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada). The investigators will regress&#xD;
      out signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid on the basis of masks created in FSL&#xD;
      FAST and smoothed the data with a 5 mm kernel using FSL SUSAN. Temporal band-pass filtering&#xD;
      will limit the data to frequencies in the 0.001 to 0.08 Hz band. Following the recommendation&#xD;
      of Power et al., the investigators will perform motion scrubbing using a frame-wise&#xD;
      displacement threshold of 0.5 and timecourse variance threshold (DVARS) of 0.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Measure: Motor Task&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use iPads equipped with the digital computer software Cantab (Cambridge&#xD;
      Cognition Ltd., England) for our behavioral measures. Cantab is a cloud-based, computerized&#xD;
      cognitive assessment software that is a well-validated tool for academic research. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to use 1) Motor Screening Task, 2) Paired Associates Learning Test (on a&#xD;
      tablet) to measure functions of motor and memory, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Screening Task requires the participants to touch the flashing cross, which is shown in&#xD;
      different locations on the screen. The outcome measures include the accuracy of pointing and&#xD;
      reaction time.&#xD;
