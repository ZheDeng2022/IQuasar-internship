      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. An&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were&#xD;
      destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a&#xD;
      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving sirolimus and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      together with total-body irradiation followed by an umbilical cord blood transplant,&#xD;
      sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil works in treating patients with hematologic cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the one- and two-year survival of patients with hematologic malignancies&#xD;
           treated with a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine,&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation followed by umbilical cord blood&#xD;
           transplantation and post-transplant immunosuppression comprising sirolimus and&#xD;
           mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the six-month nonrelapse mortality of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the presence of chimerism in patients treated with this regimen at days 21,&#xD;
           60, 100, 180, and 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of neutrophil engraftment by day 42 in patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of platelet engraftment by six months in patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
           (GVHD) at day 100 in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at one year in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the probability of overall survival within one or two years in patients&#xD;
           treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the probability of progression-free survival within one or two years in&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of relapse or disease progression within one or two years in&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients are stratified into five disease groups: 1.&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in&#xD;
      first chronic phase and second chronic phase [CP2] after myeloid blast crisis; 2. acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, CML CP2 post lymphoid blast crisis, 3. large-cell&#xD;
      B and T-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma; 4. chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma; 5. Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously on days -6 to&#xD;
           -2 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -6. Patients who did not undergo prior autologous&#xD;
           transplant or who received ≤ 1 course of prior multiagent chemotherapy or no severely&#xD;
           immunosuppressive therapy in the past 3 months also receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV&#xD;
           on days -6 to -4. All patients also undergo total-body irradiation on day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Umbilical cord blood transplant: Patients undergo umbilical cord blood transplantation&#xD;
           on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression: Sirolimus will be administered starting at day -3&#xD;
           with 8mg-12mg mg oral loading dose followed by single dose 4 mg/day with a target serum&#xD;
           concentration of 3 to 12 mg/mL. Levels are to be monitored 3 times/week in the first 2&#xD;
           weeks, weekly until day +60, and as clinically indicated until day +100&#xD;
           post-transplantation. In the absence of acute GVHD sirolimus may be tapered starting at&#xD;
           day +100 and eliminated by day +180 post-transplantation. Patients also receive&#xD;
           mycophenolate mofetil IV on days -3 to 5 and then orally on days 6-30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 320 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
