  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of islet cell transplants for&#xD;
      the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It has been shown that normal control of blood&#xD;
      sugar levels can prevent progression of complications (such as kidney disease, nerve damage,&#xD;
      and vascular disease) from diabetes. This research study is designed to see if normal blood&#xD;
      sugar control can be achieved by transplanting pancreatic islet cells into your liver, which&#xD;
      may reduce or eliminate your need for insulin. Patients may qualify to participate in this&#xD;
      research study if they have type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least five years and meet at&#xD;
      least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experience hypoglycemic unawareness - Defined as inability to tell when blood glucose is&#xD;
           low (for example, may not feel symptoms such as shaking, sweating, and rapid heartbeat&#xD;
           that usually signify that glucose is low)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have been hospitalized several times in the past year for low blood sugar and/or high&#xD;
           blood sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, kidney problems, or neuropathy&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Enrolling subjects must have Type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years, complicated&#xD;
        by at least one of the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin&#xD;
        management efforts. (Intensive management is defined as monitoring of glucose values at&#xD;
        home no less than three times each day and by the administration of three or more insulin&#xD;
        injections each day. Such management must be monitored in close cooperation with an&#xD;
        endocrinologist or primary care physician, as defined by at least three contacts during the&#xD;
        previous 12 months. If an endocrinologist did not participate in the ongoing management&#xD;
        effort during the past year, then an independent endocrinologist must assess the adequacy&#xD;
        of the management efforts prior to enrollment.) The complicating situations are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic&#xD;
        symptoms at plasma glucose levels of &lt; 54 mg/dL, b. Metabolic lability/instability,&#xD;
        characterized by two or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia and which is associated with a&#xD;
        blood glucose below 54 mg/dl OR two or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis over&#xD;
        the last year, c. Despite efforts at optimal glucose control, progressive secondary&#xD;
        complications of diabetes as defined by: i) Retinopathy-a minimum of a three step&#xD;
        progression using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading system&#xD;
        44,or an equivalent progression as certified by an ophthalmologist familiar with diabetic&#xD;
        retinopathy, or ii) Nephropathy-a confirmed rise of 50 µg/min (72 mg/24h) of&#xD;
        microalbuminuria or greater over at least three months (beginning anytime within the past&#xD;
        two years) despite the use of an ACE inhibitor, or iii) Neuropathy-persistent or&#xD;
        progressing autonomic neuropathy (gastroparesis, postural hypotension, neuropathic bowel or&#xD;
        bladder) or persistent or progressing severe peripheral painful neuropathy not responding&#xD;
        to usual management (e.g., tricyclics, gabapentin, or carbamazepine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe co-existing cardiac disease, characterized by any one of these conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recent myocardial infarction (within past six months), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Angiographic evidence of non-correctable coronary artery disease, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam (functional testing is required&#xD;
                  for all subjects, with a stress echo test recommended for subjects with a history&#xD;
                  of ischemic disease). Patients unable to perform an exercise stress&#xD;
                  echocardiogram test will undergo adenosine vasodilator stress test, and if there&#xD;
                  is a history of bronchospasm, will undergo dobutamine stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active alcohol or substance abuse-includes cigarette smoking (must be abstinent for&#xD;
             six months). Active alcohol abuse should be considered using the current NIAAA&#xD;
             definitions, whereby alcohol abuse is defined by a pattern of drinking that is&#xD;
             accompanied by one or more of the following situations within a 12-month period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Failure to fulfill major work, school, or home responsibilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Drinking in situations that are physically dangerous, such as while driving a car&#xD;
                  or operating machinery;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurring alcohol-related legal problems, such as being arrested for driving&#xD;
                  under the influence of alcohol or for physically hurting someone while drunk;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Continued drinking despite having ongoing relationship problems that are caused&#xD;
                  or worsened by the effects of alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Psychiatric disorder making the subject not a suitable candidate for transplantation,&#xD;
             e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression that is unstable or&#xD;
             uncontrolled on current medication. (A psychological or psychiatric consultation is&#xD;
             required only if considered necessary by some current indication or history.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of non-adherence to prescribed regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active infection including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV, or TB (or under treatment&#xD;
             for suspected TB)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any history of or current malignancies except squamous or basal skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. BMI &gt; 26 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. C-peptide response to arginine stimulation (5 gm I.V.) (any C-peptide ≥ 0.3 ng/mL at&#xD;
             2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 min post-infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Age less than 18 or greater than 65 years&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Baseline Hb &lt;10.5 gm/dL in women, or &lt;13 gm/dL in men&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Baseline LFT's outside of normal range with the exception of Gilberts Syndrome. (An&#xD;
             initial LFT test panel with any values &gt;1.5 times upper limits of normal will exclude&#xD;
             a patient; a re-test for any values between normal and 1.5 times normal should be&#xD;
             made, and if the values remain elevated above normal limits, the patient will be&#xD;
             excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence of gallstones (subjects may be eligible two weeks after a laparoscopic&#xD;
             cholecystectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Portal hypertension, detected by baseline duplex ultrasonography (assessment of&#xD;
             direction of flow in right, left and main portal vein [antegrade (normal) or&#xD;
             retrograde (abnormal indicative of portal hypertension)]; hemangioma in liver on&#xD;
             baseline ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Untreated proliferative retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Positive pregnancy test, intent for future pregnancy or male subjects' intent to&#xD;
             procreate, failure to follow effective contraceptive measures, or presently&#xD;
             breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Evidence of sensitization on PRA (determined by demonstration of positive results for&#xD;
             anti-HLA antibodies using solid phase immunoassay with soluble HLA Class I molecules&#xD;
             as a target, or a general PRA panel with reactivity &gt;20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Insulin requirement &gt;0.7 IU/kg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. HbA1C &gt;12%&#xD;

             and/or fasting triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Under treatment for a medical condition requiring chronic use of steroids aa. Use of&#xD;
             coumadin or other anticoagulant therapy (except aspirin) or subject with PT/INR &gt;1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
             27. Addison's disease. All subjects should be screened with a basal 8:00 a.m. cortisol&#xD;
             test. Results less than the lower limit of normal indicate further testing (e.g., a&#xD;
             Cortrosyn stimulation test) to rule out adrenal insufficiency. Abnormal ACTH&#xD;
             stimulation test will be an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
