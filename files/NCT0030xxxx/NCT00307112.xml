    <textblock>
      A bacterium called Group A Steptoccoccus or &quot;strep&quot; is commonly found in the nose and throat&#xD;
      of healthy adults and children and can cause a variety of illnesses. If this bacterium&#xD;
      infects another part of the body one or more times, children may get Rheumatic heart disease&#xD;
      (RHD). The purpose of this community based study is to see how many children between 5-15&#xD;
      years of age have RHD in Leon, Nicaragua. The study will also help to determine if the usual&#xD;
      methods of detecting this disease are working. Researchers hope that this study will help to&#xD;
      develop vaccines that may prevent &quot;strep&quot; infections to Nicaragua and other parts of the&#xD;
      world. About 3,600 children will take part in the study. The children will participate for a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 day and have a 6 month follow-up visit if they are identified as possible or&#xD;
      probable RHD cases. Study procedures will include clinical exams and echocardiograms to&#xD;
      determine the presence of RHD.&#xD;

      Group A streptococcal (GrAS) infections are responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      syndromes, ranging from uncomplicated throat infections to life-threatening invasive&#xD;
      infections. Some cases of uncomplicated and untreated pharyngitis may trigger the onset of&#xD;
      acute rheumatic fever (ARF) accompanied by rheumatic heart disease (RHD). ARF is the most&#xD;
      common cause of heart disease in children around the world and is associated with early&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The most cost-effective method of preventing ARF and RHD would be&#xD;
      vaccine prevention of the streptococcal infections that trigger the disease. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the overall burden of RHD in developing countries is unknown. This information is needed to&#xD;
      adequately assess the potential risk- and cost-benefits of a GrAS vaccine that may eventually&#xD;
      be introduced in countries where ARF and RHD are prevalent. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the prevalence of RHD among children aged 5-15 in Leon. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination of the&#xD;
      heart in an area of suspected high prevalence of RHD (Leon). This is an uncontrolled,&#xD;
      observational, community-based study designed to provide detailed information about the&#xD;
      prevalence of RHD in children in León, Nicaragua. Children and adolescents between the ages&#xD;
      of 5 and 15 will be eligible for enrollment. Centro de Investigación en Demografía y Salud&#xD;
      (CIDS - Center for Investigation of Demography and Health) staff will visit randomly selected&#xD;
      dwellings with children between the target ages of 5 and 15 years, explain the nature and&#xD;
      purpose of the study, and obtain signed informed consent from the parents or guardians of the&#xD;
      children to collect demographic information. The study will also be discussed with all&#xD;
      children 13 years of age or older, and their verbal agreement to participate in the study&#xD;
      will be sought. After informed consent has been obtained and children are enrolled, CIDS&#xD;
      staff will administer a questionnaire to capture the children's demographics. All enrolled&#xD;
      children and their parent(s) from a given area will be offered transportation to the&#xD;
      rheumatic heart disease clinic at HEODRA by van. CIDS staff will arrange the examinations and&#xD;
      transportation and will inform the families appropriately. All children whose&#xD;
      parent(s)/guardian provide informed consent will have at least one study visit at HEODRA. On&#xD;
      the day of the scheduled clinic visit, the families will be informed again in detail about&#xD;
      the RHD research study and written informed consent will again be obtained. All children who&#xD;
      participate in the study will have an auscultation and a screening echocardiogram as part of&#xD;
      the study. Those children who are identified by auscultation and/or by echocardiography to be&#xD;
      in the &quot;probable or possible rheumatic heart disease&quot; groups will be asked to return for&#xD;
      repeat echocardiography 6 months after their first examination. The primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints of the study will be clinical diagnosis of RHD as confirmed by echocardiogram.&#xD;
