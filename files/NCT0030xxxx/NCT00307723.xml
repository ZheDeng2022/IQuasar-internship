  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine the safety of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and&#xD;
      gemcitabine in combination with external beam radiation therapy(Phase I portion) as well as&#xD;
      to begin to collect information about whether this combination treatment is effective in&#xD;
      treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (Phase II portion).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The combination of all three drugs and radiation treatment has never been given to&#xD;
           people before, therefore, we are going to add just one additional drug at a time for&#xD;
           safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first group of participants (3-4) who enroll on the study will receive 5-FU,&#xD;
           radiation therapy with the added drug oxaliplatin, this is called Regimen level 1. If&#xD;
           these participants have few or easily manageable side effects, then another group of&#xD;
           participants will be enrolled and will receive 5-FU, radiation, oxaliplatin with the&#xD;
           addition of bevacizumab this is called Regimen level 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The combination of study drugs and radiation will last about 6 weeks, this 6 week period&#xD;
           is called a cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen Level 1 will receive the following: oxaliplatin intravenously on days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
           22, 29, and 36; 5-FU infused by a continuous infusion on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26,&#xD;
           29-33, and 36-38; radiation therapy Monday-Friday to complete on day 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen Level 2 will receive the following; bevacizumab intravenously on days 1, 15, and&#xD;
           29; oxaliplatin intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36; 5-FU infused by&#xD;
           continuous infusion days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38; radiation therapy&#xD;
           Monday-Friday to complete on day day 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following are tests and procedures that will be performed during cycle 1: physical&#xD;
           examination; blood work, urine sample. perfusion CT scan on day 12 (for those&#xD;
           participants enrolled at Massachusetts General Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of cycle 1, CT scans will be performed to evaluate the participants disease&#xD;
           status before they receive combination gemcitabine and bevacizumab. If the scans show&#xD;
           the tumor has reduced in size and can be surgically removed, then surgery will be&#xD;
           scheduled and the patient will receive gemcitabine and bevacizumab about 4 weeks after&#xD;
           the surgery. If the scans show the tumor can not be removed, the patient will receive&#xD;
           the gemcitabine/bevacizumab combination about 4 weeks after completing cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycles 2-5 consist of: gemcitabine given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28&#xD;
           days; bevacizumab given intravenously on days 1 and 15 every 28 days. During cycles 2-5&#xD;
           the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical examination including&#xD;
           vital signs on day 1 and 15 of each cycle; blood work on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle;&#xD;
           a urine sample on day 1 of each cycle; CT scans will be done every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will take about 7 months to complete the study treatment (longer for those who have&#xD;
           surgery after Cycle 1).&#xD;
