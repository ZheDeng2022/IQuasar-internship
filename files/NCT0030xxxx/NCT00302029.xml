  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about cytomegalovirus (CMV) and how it is&#xD;
      spread between people. One thousand adolescent males ages 12-17 years will participate in&#xD;
      this study. Participants will be given a questionnaire about risk factors for CMV. A small&#xD;
      blood sample (2-3 teaspoons) will be taken to test for CMV infection. Subjects that are CMV&#xD;
      seronegative may participate in the second part of this study, which will involve returning&#xD;
      to the clinic at regularly scheduled visit times to provide blood, urine, and saliva (spit)&#xD;
      samples. This part of the study will take at least 24 months to complete. Subjects that test&#xD;
      positive for CMV during the 2nd portion of the study will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      3rd part of the study. This part of the study will require 8 regularly scheduled visits to&#xD;
      provide blood, urine and saliva samples, over a 12-month period. The maximum amount of time a&#xD;
      subject will participate in the study is 36 months.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to: (1) to determine the prevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      infection and risk factors for infection in adolescent males; (2) to prospectively define the&#xD;
      incidence and to evaluate risk factors for acquisition of CMV infection in adolescent males;&#xD;
      and (3) to provide preliminary data on the duration and magnitude of CMV in the urine,&#xD;
      saliva, and blood in those subjects who seroconvert during the study. Approximately 1000&#xD;
      males aged 12 to 17 years will be recruited from adolescent clinics at Cincinnati Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Texas Medical Branch at&#xD;
      Galveston in order to obtain 225 CMV-seronegative subjects (75 at each site) to complete the&#xD;
      Prospective Risk Factor Analysis. Patient participation will last a minimum of 24 months with&#xD;
      8 scheduled visits for the prospective seroepidemiology study. Patients who seroconvert will&#xD;
      be invited to join the viral load analysis portion of the study, which consists of 8&#xD;
      scheduled visits during a 12 month period. The maximum duration of the study is 36 months,&#xD;
      but will depend on the timing of seroconversion and entry into the viral load analysis. The&#xD;
      study is divided into 3 parts: Seroprevalence, Prospective Risk Factor Analysis, and&#xD;
      Prospective Viral Load Analysis. In the Seroprevalence portion of the study, after subjects&#xD;
      have completed informed assent and parents or guardian consent, a small amount (10 mL) of&#xD;
      blood will be obtained from subjects for evaluation of CMV antibody by commercial ELISA.&#xD;
      Participants will be given a CMV fact sheet. Subjects will be contacted by phone with results&#xD;
      of CMV antibody testing and the implications. They will be given the opportunity to receive&#xD;
      the fact sheet again and discuss this information with study personnel, if they desire. Also&#xD;
      at this visit, subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      detailed questionnaire regarding possible risk factors for CMV infection. For those subjects&#xD;
      14 years of age and older, the questionnaire will include questions about sexual practices.&#xD;
      Risk factors for CMV infection will then be compared between those subjects who are&#xD;
      seropositive and those who are seronegative. Subjects who are CMV seronegative will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the Prospective Risk Factor Analysis portion of the study to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of CMV infection and risk factors for acquisition in adolescent&#xD;
      males. Eligible subjects will be identified and provided with a description of the study by a&#xD;
      research nurse or study coordinator. Subjects will be asked to sign a separate assent and&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      recruitment will require approximately 1 year. Every 3 months, urine (For CMV culture and&#xD;
      polymerase chain reactions [PCR]) and serum samples (for CMV antibody and PCR) will be&#xD;
      collected from the subjects and analyzed for identification of CMV infection. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating risk factors at each 3-month visit. For&#xD;
      those subjects who are 14 years of age or older, the questionnaire will include questions&#xD;
      about sexual practices. If the subject tests positive for CMV, he will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      separate consent to participate in the third phase of the study. In the Prospective Viral&#xD;
      Load Analysis, subjects who seroconvert during the second portion of the study will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an evaluation of the duration and magnitude of CMV levels in blood,&#xD;
      urine, and saliva. Subjects will be seen every month for 4 months followed by every 2 months&#xD;
      for 8 months for collection of these specimens.&#xD;
