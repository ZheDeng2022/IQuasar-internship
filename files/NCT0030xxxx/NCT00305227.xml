      Recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIS) continue to be a major health problem in women and&#xD;
      are now complicated by increasing antibiotic resistance. New preventive approaches are&#xD;
      needed. Because most women with RUTI lack the normal protective Lactobacillus (LB) in their&#xD;
      vaginal flora, we hypothesized that restoration of LB would reduce RUTIS. In this trail,&#xD;
      women with recent UTI are randomized to receive either LB or placebo vaginal capsules and are&#xD;
      followed for side effects, for colonization with LB and for occurrence of RUTI over hte next&#xD;
      four months.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the vaginal suppository&#xD;
      LACTIN-V (Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05) as well as the efficacy of LACTIN-V use in&#xD;
      preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTI) in women. Study subjects will include&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women with a history of frequent RUTI. As part of this study, we will also&#xD;
      evaluate growth of lactobacilli and urinary tract infection(UTI)-causing bacteria in the&#xD;
      vaginas of women following use of LACTIN-V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: LACTIN-V is composed of L. crispatus. L. crispatus is a bacteria found to grow&#xD;
      naturally in the vaginas of healthy women. It is felt to be important in preventing vaginal&#xD;
      infection and UTI. With regard to prevention of UTI, L. crispatus is thought to prevent the&#xD;
      growth of UTI-causing bacteria (such as E. coli) in the vagina, and so prevent these&#xD;
      UTI-causing bacteria from being able to enter the female urethra and cause infection in the&#xD;
      bladder (cystitis). There is epidemiologic evidence to support this prevention mechanism, as&#xD;
      absence of L. crispatus and related lactobacilli from the vagina has been associated with&#xD;
      vaginal E. coli growth and with UTI. Scientific evidence supports the ability of lactobacilli&#xD;
      to prevent vaginal E. coli growth by out-competing E. coli in vaginal colonization, and&#xD;
      through the production of toxins such as lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LACTIN-V contains a specific strain of L. crispatus, CTV-05, which was isolated from the&#xD;
      vagina of a healthy woman. It was prepared as a vaginal suppository with the purpose of&#xD;
      restoring growth of healthy L. crispatus in the vaginas of women who experience frequent&#xD;
      RUTI. As indicated above, these women often have a deficiency of healthy vaginal lactobacilli&#xD;
      growth, and therefore may not experience the protective function of these natural organisms.&#xD;
      It is hoped that use of LACTIN-V will lead to vaginal growth of protective lactobacilli in&#xD;
      these women wich will, in turn, prevent the vaginal growth of E. coli and other UTI-causing&#xD;
      bacteria. Phase 1 and 2 studies of LACTIN-V to date have shown this &quot;probiotic&quot; to be safe&#xD;
      and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impetus for this study is the urgent need for non-antibiotic strategies to prevent UTI.&#xD;
      UTI is one of the most common bacterial infections. It leads to substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      health care costs. Frequent use of antibiotics for treatment of and prophylaxis against UTI&#xD;
      is contributing to the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which are also making it&#xD;
      more difficult to treat UTI. Therefore, the potential advantage of LACTIN-V is that it is a&#xD;
      natural product that may prevent UTI without the use of antibiotics. If it proves to be&#xD;
      efficacious, it could decrease the morbidity and health care costs associated with UTI as&#xD;
      well as decrease overall antibiotic use and the corresponding prevalence of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance among UTI-causing bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of LACTIN-V, compared to&#xD;
      placebo, in pre-menopausal women with recurrent uncomplicated UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of LACTIN-V, compared to placebo, in reducing the incidence of&#xD;
           Symptomatic and Probable UTI (defined below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy of LACTIN-V, compared to placebo, in decreasing the time to&#xD;
           recurrence of Symptomatic and Probable UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the efficacy of LACTIN-V, compared to placebo, in reducing the prevalence of&#xD;
           Asymptomatic UTI (defined below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate vaginal growth of CTV-05 in subjects using LACTIN-V compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate vaginal growth of lactobacilli in subjects using LACTIN-V compared to&#xD;
           subjects using placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate vaginal growth of E. coli in subjects using LACTIN-V compared to subjects&#xD;
           using placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic UTI: One or more UTI symptoms (dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain,&#xD;
      flank pain), with a positive urine culture. In symptomatic subjects, a positive urine culture&#xD;
      is defined as &gt;= 10^2/ml of an UTI-causing bacteria. UTI episodes will be recorded as&#xD;
      Symptomatic UTI if a negative urine culture at Visit 2, or at another interim study visit,&#xD;
      confirms resolution of the prior UTI (in order to distinguish a new Symptomatic UTI from a&#xD;
      Persistent UTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymptomatic UTI: A positive urine culture in a subject who reports no urinary symptoms. In&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects, a positive urine culture is defined as &gt;= 10^5/ml of an UTI-causing&#xD;
      bacteria. UTI episodes will be recorded as Asymptomatic UTI if a negative urine culture at&#xD;
      Visit 2, or at another interim study visit, confirms resolution of the prior UTI (in order to&#xD;
      distinguish a new Asymptomatic UTI from a Persistent UTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable UTI: One or more UTI symptoms (dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, flank&#xD;
      pain) in a subject who contacted a healthcare provider and was treated with antibiotics for a&#xD;
      UTI without confirmatory urine culture. UTI episodes will be recorded as Probable UTI if a&#xD;
      negative urine culture at Visit 2, or at another interim study visit, confirms resolution of&#xD;
      the prior UTI (in order to distinguish a new Probable UTI from a Persistent UTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent UTI: A positive urine culture following antibiotic treatment for a UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Procedures: This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      LACTIN-V. Subjects will include 100 pre-menopausal women with a history of frequent RUTI who&#xD;
      are currently or recently being treated for a symptomatic UTI with&#xD;
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is one of several antibiotics&#xD;
      considered standard-of-care for treatment of symptomatic UTI. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      such that 50 women will receive LACTIN-V at a dose of 5x10^8 CFU/suppository and 50 women&#xD;
      will receive placebo. LACTIN-V and placebo are to be taken once per day for five days during&#xD;
      the first week of use followed by once per week for 10 weeks on Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43,&#xD;
      50, 57, 64, and 71 for a total of 15 doses over 11 weeks. Subjects will undergo five&#xD;
      scheduled visits and receive two telephone calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 is the Screening Visit. This visit will take place during or soon after evaluation&#xD;
      for a symptomatic UTI. The following will occur during Visit 1: informed consent, review of&#xD;
      eligibility, history, physical exam, pelvic exam, Pap smear, urine pregnancy test, and&#xD;
      screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, bacterial vaginosis, yeast, and trichomonas.&#xD;
      Subjects will provide urine samples for microscopic analysis, dipstick analysis, culture, and&#xD;
      antibiotic susceptibility testing and vaginal fluid specimens for laboratory assessment of&#xD;
      vaginal growth of lactobacilli (including CTV-05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 is the Randomization Visit and represents Week 1 of the study. Visit 2 will take&#xD;
      place 3-10 days after completion of antibiotic therapy for UTI. Subjects will have their&#xD;
      eligibility confirmed and undergo a focused pelvic exam without speculum or bimanual exam&#xD;
      unless clinically indicated, have a screening test for bacterial vaginosis, yeast, and&#xD;
      trichomonas, and have a repeat pregnancy test. Subjects will also provide urine and vaginal&#xD;
      fluid specimens as in Visit 1. Subjects will then be randomized to LACTIN-V or placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will place the first suppository under supervision and will be instructed to use a&#xD;
      7-day study calendar to record study product use and related symptoms during the first week,&#xD;
      and to use a 10-week study calendar to record study product use and related symptoms&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4-7 phone call: The purpose of this phone call is to assess use of the study product as&#xD;
      well as any associated symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will occur during Week 2, days 8-14 following randomization. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      about study product use, adverse events, and symptoms. Subjects will undergo focused physical&#xD;
      and pelvic exams without speculum or bimanual exam unless clinically indicated. Subjects will&#xD;
      have a screening test for bacterial vaginosis and provide urine and vaginal fluid specimens&#xD;
      as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 will occur during Week 11 and will be similar to Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 will occur during Week 16. The procedures for Visit 5 will be similar to those of&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4. However, during this visit, subjects will undergo a complete pelvic exam&#xD;
      including speculum and bimanual exams and undergo a repeat pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 Month telephone call: The purpose of this phone call is to assess the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events, symptoms of UTI, new UTI or other medical diagnoses,and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above schedules visits, subjects will be asked to come to the research&#xD;
      clinic for Unscheduled Visits if they experience any adverse events or new symptoms of UTI.&#xD;
      During these unscheduled visits, subjects will undergo history, physical and complete pelvic&#xD;
      exams, screening tests for bacterial vaginosis, yeast, and trichomonas, as well as for other&#xD;
      sexually transmitted diseases as clinically indicated. Subjects will provide urine samples&#xD;
      for microscopic analysis, dipstick analysis, culture, and antibiotic susceptibility testing.&#xD;
      Subjects will provide vaginal fluid samples for assessment of CTV-05, lactobacillus, and E.&#xD;
      coli growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects diagnosed with a Symptomatic UTI during the study will be treated with an&#xD;
      antibiotic. They will then be asked to return to the study clinic for a follow-up urine&#xD;
      culture two weeks later to confirm UTI resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wet mount slides of vaginal fluid (all Visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine dipstick testing (all Visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine pregnancy testing (Visits 1, 2, and 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pap smear (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia by culture (Visit 1, other visits as indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinalysis (all Visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine culture (all Visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gram stain and culture of vaginal fluid specimens (All Visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rep-PCR for CTV-05 (Visits 2-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA amplification of vaginal flora (all Visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The primary cohort for analysis will be the intent-to-treat (ITT)&#xD;
      cohort. The ITT cohort is defined as subjects who are randomized in the study. Other cohorts&#xD;
      to be evaluated will include the modified ITT, Evaluable, and according-to-protocol cohorts.&#xD;
