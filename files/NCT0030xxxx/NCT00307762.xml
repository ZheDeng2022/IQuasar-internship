    <textblock>
      This is a trial aiming to evaluate the difference of effectiveness between two therapy&#xD;
      methods in patients with acute stroke. The other aim is to use Navigated Brain Stimulation&#xD;
      (NBS)to analyze changes in brain networks during the recovery and as the consequence of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body-weight supported gate trainer rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gait-oriented traditional physiotherapy Patients in physiotherapy group will have 75 min&#xD;
           physiotherapy daily every workday. This includes 20 minutes walking exercises in the&#xD;
           traditional group while 20 minutes of gait trainer therapy in the gait trainer group.&#xD;
           The evaluation of effectiveness of therapy in each group is made after three weeks'&#xD;
           therapy and at six months. The goal is to have 40 patients until the end of June 2006.&#xD;

      This study has been started in 2003 as a randomized study comparing rehabilitation with gait&#xD;
      trainer and traditional gait-oriented physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * From the beginning of 2005, all patients have been evaluated using NBS (Navigating Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation), a magnetic stimulation device. This stimulation is performed on day 3, 10 and&#xD;
      15 and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total number of patients recruited in the study is 57, seventeen (17) patients in&#xD;
           gait trainer group and twenty (20) patients in the group of traditional physiotherapy.&#xD;
           From the year 2005 onwards, ten (10 control patients have been recruited. Those patients&#xD;
           have been selected with the exactly the same criteria as those who have been included in&#xD;
           the treatment groups. The control patients have exactly the same evaluations at same&#xD;
           time points, but their rehabilitation takes place according to the principles obeyed in&#xD;
           the neurology clinic. Thus, they have not been randomised in any of the two treatment&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since the start of study, ten (10) patients have withdrawn from the study from various&#xD;
           reasons (drop outs). One patient before randomization, 5 patients in the gait trainer&#xD;
           group, one patient in the traditional physiotherapy group and 3 patients in the control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thus, the final group consists of 17 patients in the gait trainer group, 20 patients in&#xD;
           the traditional therapy group and 10 patients in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be 25 patients who have underwent the whole procedure of NBS: 9 patients in&#xD;
           the gait trainer group, 8 patients in the traditional therapy group and 8 patients in&#xD;
           the control group. The last 6-month follow-ups will take place in late August/early&#xD;
           September 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of combining navigated magnetic brain stimulation (NBS)in the rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention study is to evaluate the change in brain networks during the recovery process,&#xD;
      to see possible differences in these networks due to different rehabilitation methods and/or&#xD;
      good vs. poor recovery. In connection with the magnetic stimulation, a 60-channel EEG map&#xD;
      will be taken in order to measure the electrical spread of the induced neural electrical&#xD;
      activity, which describes the state of the connections of the damaged brain area to other&#xD;
      parts of the brain as well as of possible activation of new neural connections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This arrangement allows a unique opportunity to study the re-organisation of brain structures&#xD;
      after stroke and brain plasticity in general in recovering brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation of functional recovery, a combination of relevant scales of motor function&#xD;
      will be measured during the study. Those are: Rivermead Mobility Index, Rivermead Motor&#xD;
      Assessment , Modified Motor Assessment Scale, Functional ambulation Category, Physical Cost&#xD;
      Index, 6-minute walking time. In addition, Barthel index, Scandinavian Stroke Scale and NIH&#xD;
      Scale will be performed in the beginning and at the end.&#xD;
