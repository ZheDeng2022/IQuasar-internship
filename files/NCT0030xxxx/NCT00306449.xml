    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to determine whether weight gain may be prevented by a&#xD;
      small group seminar-based two-year educational intervention on healthy lifestyle in freshmen&#xD;
      at the Faculté de médecine de l'Université de Sherbrooke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year randomized, controlled intervention study to test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      small group seminar-based educational intervention on healthy lifestyle to prevent weight&#xD;
      gain in young healthy university students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : We hypothesize that a small group seminar-based educational intervention on&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle may prevent weight gain in young healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recrutment of participants : First and second year students will be recruted at the 'Faculté&#xD;
      de médecine et des sciences de la santé' of the University of Sherbrooke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-randomisation visit will be performed to verify eligibility and exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      to perform the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements (please, see below);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exam;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard questionnaire on dietary and physical activity habits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Canadian fitness test (to estimate VO2&#xD;
           max)(www.ecoledudos.uqat.uquebec.ca/chroniquep/03preparationphysique/evaluer/#physitest)&#xD;
           ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fasting blood sample to mesure plasma glucose, insulin, plasma lipids. Serum samples&#xD;
           will be stored at -80C for future analyses (adipokines, inflammation markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Block randomization according to gender and tertile of BMI of each participant&#xD;
      to either the control (no intervention) or intervention (small group seminars) group will be&#xD;
      performed once the entire cohort will be recruited at the beginning of the academic year&#xD;
      using computer-generated numbers. One investigator will enroll all the study participants and&#xD;
      another that will have no contact with the participants will generate the allocation&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard questionnaire will be administered to collect the following data: gender, age,&#xD;
      study program, medical history, and physical exam results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures will be performed at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight (kg),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height (m) (by standing stadiometre- mean of three measures),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist circumference (cm) (midway between iliac crest and last rib end of a normal&#xD;
           expiration - mean of 3 measures),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lean mass by electrical bio-impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of physical activity : Using a standard questionnaire (Sallis JF et al. Am J&#xD;
      Epidemiol 1985;121:91-106) (reported in METs) and performed at 0, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of dietary habits : Standard 3-day food record at 0, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical fitness (VO2 max): Canadian Home Fitness Test at 0, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (60 ml) at 0 and 24 months: Plasma (15 ml) and serum (15 ml) will be collected&#xD;
      after a 8 to 12 hour fast to measure blood glucose; total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total&#xD;
      triglycerides (with calculation of LDL-c using the Friedwal formula). Samples will be stored&#xD;
      at -80C for future determination of plasma insulin, adipokines and serum inflammatory&#xD;
      markers. These analyses will allow us to explore the relationship between weight gain and&#xD;
      change in these biological parameters in our study population and to determine whether&#xD;
      prevention of weight gain may also be associated with early prevention of metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities associated with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small group seminars (10 to 12 students) in the treatment group vs. no specific intervention&#xD;
      (other than measurements described above) in the control group. The duration of seminars will&#xD;
      be approximatively 30 to 60 minutes and will be given every two weeks for the first two&#xD;
      months of follow up and every four weeks for the remaining follow up period, except for&#xD;
      summer break (July and August) when seminars will not be given. A multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      including endocrinologists, a physical education specialist and a dietician designed the&#xD;
      seminars that will be delivered by an endocrinology resident and a physical education&#xD;
      graduate student. The first three seminars will be aimed at increasing knowledge on weight&#xD;
      gain and its complications, national dietary recommendations (Canadian Food Guide) and&#xD;
      exercise categories, expected benefits and recommendations for the maintenance of health. The&#xD;
      remaining seminars will be designed to introduce behavioral modification methods using&#xD;
      discussion on problem-solving, goal-setting and monitoring strategies. Some seminars will&#xD;
      focus on behavioral strategies to maintain a healthy lifestyle during specific periods such&#xD;
      as final exams, holidays, winter and vacations. The monitors themselves as well as older&#xD;
      students successful at keeping an active lifestyle will be offered as role models to promote&#xD;
      a positive image of a healthy lifestyle. Compliance with the intervention will be defined as&#xD;
      attending at least 60% of the seminars.&#xD;
