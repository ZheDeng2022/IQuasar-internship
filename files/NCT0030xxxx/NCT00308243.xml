  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the inhalation of sodium pyruvate will reduce lung damage in patients&#xD;
      with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) by its ability to reduce levels of toxic reactive oxygen and&#xD;
      nitrogen compounds associated with the chronic inflammatory component of the disease. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of inhaled sodium pyruvate in 0.9%&#xD;
      sodium chloride (saline) solution in people with CF. Further, to determine whether inhaled&#xD;
      sodium pyruvate will improve lung function, as determined by spirometry, or reduced&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in induced sputum of people with CF.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, lethal inherited disease of Caucasians.&#xD;
      Approximately 30,000 people in the United States and 70,000 worldwide have a diagnosis of CF.&#xD;
      It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. The&#xD;
      clinical manifestations characteristic of CF include progressive bronchiectatic lung disease&#xD;
      with thick mucus production and colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The CFTR gene&#xD;
      mutation results in altered cell transport properties, which affect both chloride and&#xD;
      glutathione secretion. Chronic inflammation, associated with activated neutrophils and&#xD;
      macrophages, is a common feature of CF. Highly reactive toxic oxygen (superoxide anion, free&#xD;
      hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide) and nitrogen species (nitric oxide, peroxynitrites) are&#xD;
      abundant in the chronic inflammatory response in CF and appear to play a prominent role in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of this disease. These reactive oxygen and nitrogen species have been shown&#xD;
      to be directly toxic to various mammalian tissues, including lung, via DNA damage and cell&#xD;
      membrane lipid peroxidation. In addition, elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide and nitric&#xD;
      oxide have been demonstrated in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with CF,&#xD;
      asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Clearly reactive oxygen and nitrogen&#xD;
      species are implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of lung diseases including CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium pyruvate is an antagonist of both reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. It also has&#xD;
      the potential to increase intracellular levels of thiol compounds, major sources of&#xD;
      intracellular anti-oxidants. Sodium pyruvate has been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      agent that can reduce the number of infiltrating neutrophils and levels of oxygen radicals at&#xD;
      wound sites, thereby limiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Thus, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the inhalation of sodium pyruvate will reduce lung damage in patients with&#xD;
      CF by its ability to reduce levels of toxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species associated&#xD;
      with the chronic inflammatory component of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a Phase I Safety Study that will be conducted in three Stages. The study is&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety of administering sodium pyruvate inhalation therapy to CF&#xD;
      subjects once a day for one day, then twice a day for one day, and finally, twice a day for&#xD;
      four weeks. All testing, including the screening visit and Stage 1, and Stages 2 and 3, will&#xD;
      be conducted at the University of Minnesota (UMN) General Clinical Research Center GCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - Single dose inhalation - 24 hours (n=15) Participants with CF will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of sodium pyruvate (5 ml in physiological saline) via a Pari-Jet hand-held nebulizer&#xD;
      (Pari LC PlusÂ® nebulizer system) , and will be followed at UMN GRC for four hours with a&#xD;
      follow up telephone interview at 24 hours. Three concentrations (0.5 mM, 1.5 mM, and 5.0 mM)&#xD;
      of sodium pyruvate solution will be studied. Five subjects will receive the lowest&#xD;
      concentration of sodium pyruvate solution; then another five subjects will receive the middle&#xD;
      dose of sodium pyruvate solution; and finally a third group of five subjects will receive the&#xD;
      highest dose of sodium pyruvate solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in Stage 1 will have one 6-hour visit at UMN GCRC. Following administration&#xD;
      of a single 5-mL dose of either 0.5 mM, 1.5 mM, or 5.0 mM sodium pyruvate in 0.9% saline&#xD;
      solution, the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Inhalation of Study Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 0.5 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 1 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 2 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 4 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum Induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 1 Hr&#xD;

      SaO2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 0.5 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 1 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 2 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 4 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and Urine Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 4 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 4 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital Signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post inhalation 4 Hr&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters for safety monitoring will include spirometry, vital signs, ECG, SaO2, and&#xD;
      routine blood and urine analysis, which will be conducted pre- and post- inhalation of sodium&#xD;
      pyruvate. Follow up telephone interviews will also be conducted for each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to efficacy, spirometry, and induced sputum samples will be monitored pre- and&#xD;
      post- inhalation of sodium pyruvate. Induced sputum samples will be evaluated for cellular&#xD;
      content (total WBC and differential) and the fluid content assessed for total protein, total&#xD;
      DNA, elastase, glutathione (GSH and GSSG), H2O2 and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and&#xD;
      IL-8, TNF-alpha).&#xD;
