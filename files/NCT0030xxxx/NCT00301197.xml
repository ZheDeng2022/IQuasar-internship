  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem. At least 15 million American adults are obese, and&#xD;
      the number is rising. Childhood obesity is also increasing in prevalence and currently&#xD;
      affects approximately 11-22 percent of children aged 6 to 11. Childhood obesity is associated&#xD;
      with serious negative physical, emotional, and social consequences. Obese children are at&#xD;
      high risk for becoming obese as adults; 24-44 percent of obese adults were obese as children.&#xD;
      The risk of an obese child becoming an obese adult is especially high when at least one&#xD;
      parent is obese. To date, adult obesity is known to be resistant to treatment. In contrast,&#xD;
      promising long-term effects have been found with children who received behavioral&#xD;
      family-based weight loss treatment. However, even with state-of-the-science programs, a&#xD;
      substantial percentage of children (i.e., over 40 percent) regain all or most of the weight&#xD;
      lost once treatment ends. The proposed study examined the efficacy of two intervention&#xD;
      strategies designed to improve the long-term maintenance of weight loss in children relative&#xD;
      to discontinued treatment contact following an active weight loss treatment phase (no&#xD;
      maintenance treatment control (NTC).&#xD;

      This is an efficacy study comparing two intervention strategies designed to improve the&#xD;
      long-term maintenance of weight loss in children compared to a no maintenance treatment&#xD;
      control group. In this study, overweight children between the ages of 7-12 years old&#xD;
      participated along with their overweight parents in a 20-week behavioral, family-based weight&#xD;
      loss treatment. Following weight loss treatment, participants were randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two 4-month maintenance interventions or to a no-continued treatment control. The&#xD;
      Behavioral Skills Maintenance intervention (BSM) will confront the declining motivation to&#xD;
      engage in weight-maintenance behaviors, incorporate specific skills for weight maintenance,&#xD;
      and teach coping skills and relapse prevention techniques. The Social Facilitation&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment will use an innovative, socially-based approach to enhance peer&#xD;
      support, increase parental instrumental support, improve body image, and teach effective&#xD;
      responses to teasing as methods for sustaining weight maintenance behaviors (i.e., healthy&#xD;
      diet and physical activity). It is expected that children participating in BSM and SFM&#xD;
      interventions will demonstrate better outcomes at the point of the weight maintenance&#xD;
      intervention cessation than children not provided any maintenance treatment. It is further&#xD;
      hypothesized that the developmentally appropriate focus and more pervasive and sustaining&#xD;
      nature of the SFM treatment targets relative to BSM targets will result in better weight&#xD;
      maintenance outcomes for SFM than BSM children. Follow-up assessments will occur at the end&#xD;
      of the maintenance phase of treatment, as well as at 12 and 24 months following the initial&#xD;
      weight loss treatment. Effective maintenance treatments in children will have a substantial&#xD;
      impact on children's immediate and future physical, psychological, and social well being.&#xD;
