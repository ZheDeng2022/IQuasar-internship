      This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of an 12 and 26-week&#xD;
      aripiprazole administration to schizophrenic outpatients who maintain stable (no change with&#xD;
      dosage, usage, route of the most recent antipsychotic drugs) symptoms and discontinued&#xD;
      previous antipsychotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aripiprazole (10~30 mg/day) will be orally administered for 12 weeks followed by an extension&#xD;
      phase for a maximum of an additional 14 weeks (total of 26 weeks).&#xD;
