  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with malignant melanoma&#xD;
      with the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Melanoma vaccine. It will establish the proper&#xD;
      vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The&#xD;
      vaccine contains killed melanoma cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of&#xD;
      a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response&#xD;
      to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer&#xD;
      cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain&#xD;
      stable or shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with malignant melanoma may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines&#xD;
      will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase&#xD;
      I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the&#xD;
      vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase&#xD;
      II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be&#xD;
      safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 3 months for the&#xD;
      remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 6 months for the next 2&#xD;
      years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical examination Blood tests X-rays and various scans (nuclear&#xD;
      medicine/CT/MRI) FACT-G Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the&#xD;
      patient's general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment,&#xD;
      monthly during treatment, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It&#xD;
      includes questions on the severity of cancer symptoms and the ability to perform normal&#xD;
      activities of daily life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to statistics of the American Cancer Society, an estimated 55,000 individuals will&#xD;
      be diagnosed with malignant melanoma and 8,000 will die of the disease this year in the&#xD;
      Unites States despite all current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to&#xD;
      melanoma vaccine therapy using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans&#xD;
      in attempt to vaccinate patients against their melanoma The expression of the murine&#xD;
      alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase [alpha(1,3)GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of&#xD;
      alpha(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These&#xD;
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs&#xD;
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of&#xD;
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most&#xD;
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally&#xD;
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies&#xD;
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with advanced stage&#xD;
      melanoma will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a trivalent vaccine&#xD;
      composed of irradiated allogeneic melanoma cell lines (HAM-1, HAM-2 and HAM-3). These cell&#xD;
      lines have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based&#xD;
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha(1,3)GT gene. Endpoints of the study include&#xD;
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and&#xD;
      immunological responses.&#xD;
