      The purpose of this study is to compare red blood cell folate levels in women who are taking&#xD;
      oral contraceptives with or without folic acid&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown an association between increased folic acid (a synthetic form of folate, a&#xD;
      B-vitamin) intake and reduction of a birth defect referred to as neural tube defects (NTDs).&#xD;
      If women using contraception were to receive a combination of an oral contraceptive and folic&#xD;
      acid, they may have the benefit of increased blood folate levels, which could reduce the risk&#xD;
      of NTDs. This is a multi-center, double-blind study designed to study red blood cell folate&#xD;
      levels in women who are taking oral contraceptives with or without folic acid. Patients will&#xD;
      receive oral contraceptives with or without folic acid for 8 cycles of 28 days each. The&#xD;
      study will consist of 2 parts of 4 cycles each. All patients will receive oral contraceptives&#xD;
      throughout both parts of the study, patients may or may not receive folic acid in combination&#xD;
      with the oral contraceptive during 1 or both parts of the study. The concentration of red&#xD;
      blood cell folate will be determined by laboratory tests after Cycles 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8.&#xD;
      Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, electrocardiograms, physical examinations,&#xD;
      laboratory tests) will be performed throughout the study. Patients may also participate in an&#xD;
      optional portion of the study in which their genetic material is analyzed to see if contains&#xD;
      something that would affect the way folic acid is used by their bodies. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that women taking an oral contraceptive with folic acid will have increased levels of red&#xD;
      blood cell folate compared to women taking an oral contraceptive without folic acid. Some&#xD;
      women who receive the oral contraceptive with folic acid during the first four cycles will be&#xD;
      transitioned to an oral contraceptive without folic acid for Cycles 5-8. In this group of&#xD;
      women, the rate of decrease in red blood cell folate levels will be measured. Norgestimate&#xD;
      250 micrograms (mcg)-ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg tablets, with or without folic acid 400 mcg, 2&#xD;
      tablets taken by mouth daily between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. for 8 cycles of 28 days&#xD;
      duration each for a total of 224 days&#xD;
