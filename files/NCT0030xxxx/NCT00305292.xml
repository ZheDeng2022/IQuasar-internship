  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UCSF Pain Clinical Research Center (PCRC) is conducting a study of the effects of&#xD;
      modafinil (Provigil®; Vigiver, Alertec), alcohol and the combination on alertness, mood,&#xD;
      visual motor and cognitive performance, and pain sensation. Modafinil is a stimulant drug&#xD;
      marketed as a wakefulness and alertness promoting medication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exact mechanism of action is unclear, and evidence has been gathered supporting a variety&#xD;
      of different mechanisms including activity in a part of the brain that regulates wakefulness&#xD;
      and alertness. The interaction between modafinil and alcohol has not been studied. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to expand knowledge of the mood, memory, decision making, and pain&#xD;
      relieving effects of each drug and how modafinil alters the effects of alcohol.&#xD;
