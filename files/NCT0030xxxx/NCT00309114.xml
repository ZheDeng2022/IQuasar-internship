    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in patients with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI) and is linked to major undesired results or complications including death. The&#xD;
      bladder of SCI patients, especially those with indwelling catheters, is usually colonized by&#xD;
      bacteria, some of which do and others which do not cause symptoms of UTI. Bacteria that do&#xD;
      not cause symptoms are often called benign colonizers and are often left untreated because&#xD;
      they may provide some protection against infection with more harmful bacteria. This idea of&#xD;
      using benign bacteria to prevent infections with symptoms is called bacterial interference. A&#xD;
      prototype strain, Escherichia coli 83972, was shown to begin and continue for extended&#xD;
      periods of time non symptom causing colonization of the human bladder and to hold back&#xD;
      symptom causing infections of the neurogenic bladder. Data from pilot studies at two medical&#xD;
      centers indicated that bacterial interference might be a useful therapy for reducing the rate&#xD;
      or frequency of UTI in SCI patients. Because almost all SCI patients have a UTI at some time,&#xD;
      and also the large costs of treating this infection, studying the impact of bladder&#xD;
      colonization with E. coli 83972 on the rate of symptom causing UTI has an amazing potential&#xD;
      for improving the quality of life of SCI patients and decreasing the cost of health care.&#xD;
      Like with other preventive plans such as vaccination, for instance, it is important to&#xD;
      explore the effectiveness of this new preventive approach. The project is a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, double blind, multi-center study that deals with specific pieces of bacterial&#xD;
      interference in SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES: Placing non symptom causing bacteria (E. coli 83972) into SCI patients' bladders&#xD;
      reduces the rate of symptom causing UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. SPECIFIC AIM: Determine how bladder colonization with E. coli 83972 or similar bacteria&#xD;
      affects the rate of symptom causing urinary tract infections in a large group of SCI and&#xD;
      Spina Bifida patients by conducting a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be take place in a total of 7 medical centers that care for Spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI) and Spina Bifida patients. A total of 160 patients will be allowed to take&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will interview patients by telephone and in person who express an&#xD;
      interest in taking part in the study. After an informed consent and HIPAA documents are&#xD;
      reviewed and all of the patients questions are answered, then they will be asked to sign&#xD;
      these two forms. Then a code number will be assigned to each patient and used along with&#xD;
      their initials to identify them for the remainder of the study. All study participants will&#xD;
      have a complete history and physical examination including ASIA classification, serum&#xD;
      creatinine and a urine culture immediately upon entry into the study. One of the following 3&#xD;
      diagnostic tests must be completed within the 3 months before the study: KUB, IVP, or&#xD;
      non-contrast abdominal CT scan. A voiding cystourethrogram with fluoroscopy (VCUG) alone or&#xD;
      as part of a video urodynamics evaluation must be completed within 1 year before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and sample size: Enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      bladder inoculation either with E. coli 83972 (experimental group) or with placebo (control&#xD;
      group). This randomization ratio was selected because around 1/3 of colonized subjects are&#xD;
      expected to remain colonized for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder inoculation: At study entry, a urine culture and sensitivity test will be completed&#xD;
      using a fresh mid stream (after the urine is flowing) urine sample removed via a catheter&#xD;
      into the bladder. Subjects will stop all actions to prevent or slow urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (UTI) for at least two weeks upon entry into the study. Each subject will be treated with&#xD;
      correct antibiotics for 7 - 10 days and any existing urinary catheter changed three days&#xD;
      after starting antibiotic treatment. Forty-eight to 72 hours or (80 to 90 hours for&#xD;
      fluoroquinolone antibiotics) after completion of antibiotics, the urine will be re-cultured&#xD;
      and the lower urinary tract inoculated with E. coli 83972 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most subjects, even those with external condom catheters, have worn a Foley catheter at some&#xD;
      time, and would be expected to know the catheter size that best fits them. Subjects will be&#xD;
      inoculated on three consecutive days. Inoculation will consist of putting into the bladder&#xD;
      via a sterile catheter 10 ml of normal saline alone or containing E. coli 83972. Subjects who&#xD;
      are incontinent at low bladder volumes will be monitored with a Foley catheter balloon&#xD;
      blocking the bladder neck or diversion stoma for 30 minutes after inoculation. After 30 min.,&#xD;
      the clamp will be released and the bladder allowed to drain for an additional 30 min. The&#xD;
      bladder inoculation will be repeated a second time unless an unexpected adverse event&#xD;
      (complication) is encountered. After the catheter is un-clamped for the second time, the&#xD;
      subject will be observed for 30 min. before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the 48-hour culture from the sample taken just prior to inoculation is positive for&#xD;
      bacteria, and E. coli 83972 colonization was not present in the sample, another antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment/inoculation cycle will be attempted. The timing of the second attempt will be&#xD;
      decided by the CORE director and the local principal investigator. At the correct time,&#xD;
      another 7-10 day course of antibiotic therapy will be repeated. Three days after starting&#xD;
      antibiotics, any existing urinary catheter will be changed. Forty-eight to 72 hours or (80 to&#xD;
      90 hours for fluoroquinolone antibiotics) after completion of this course of antibiotics, the&#xD;
      urine will be re-cultured and then the bladder re-inoculated. If the 48 hour culture taken&#xD;
      just prior to this inoculation is again positive for any bacteria other than E. coli 83972,&#xD;
      and E. coli 83972 colonization is not present as a result of the second inoculation cycle, a&#xD;
      third cycle of antibiotic treatment/inoculation will be attempted. The timing of the 3rd&#xD;
      attempt will be decided by the CORE director and the local principal investigator. No further&#xD;
      colonization attempts will be made in study participants who are not colonized after three&#xD;
      sets of attempts. We will continue to monitor subjects in this group for the remaining months&#xD;
      of the study, but for analysis purposes, they will be treated as &quot;never colonized&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inoculated subjects who remain without symptoms will return to their study center to have&#xD;
      a urine sample collected and a brief medical interview one week after inoculation and monthly&#xD;
      for the remaining 12 months. The CORE director can allow a subject who lives far from any&#xD;
      center to mail their monthly urine samples directly to the CORE. All needed supplies such as:&#xD;
      urine specimen containers, proper shipping containers, labels, pre-paid postage, etc.â€¦ will&#xD;
      be provided at no cost to the subject. The subject's study site will contact them to conduct&#xD;
      the brief medical interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 12 months, subjects will receive an antibiotic to clear E. coli 83972 from&#xD;
      their bladder and the study will be finished. If a subject experienced an adverse event&#xD;
      (something unexpected) during the study, they will be followed by the research staff until&#xD;
      the event has gone back to normal or resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth of E. coli 83972 in the urine will indicate bladder colonization. Subjects will be&#xD;
      considered colonized as long as E. coli 83972 is present and even if there are other bacteria&#xD;
      in the urine. Subjects who develop symptoms of a UTI will be treated with proper antibiotics&#xD;
      guided by susceptibility patterns for the bacteria(s) grown from urine cultures. Urine&#xD;
      cultures collected prior to starting treatment will be tested for E. coli 83972. It is&#xD;
      important to note that although the method of bladder inoculation carries some risk of&#xD;
      causing symptoms of a UTI, that risk is rather small and will be shared by all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exists a risk that clamping of the bladder for 30 minutes may result in autonomic&#xD;
      dysreflexia in some patients, especially those who dump urine. All subjects will be asked&#xD;
      about a history of autonomic dysreflexia or any unexpected response to bladder filling prior&#xD;
      to inoculation. Before beginning inoculation, urodynamics data will be reviewed. All subjects&#xD;
      with a lesion level above T7 will have their blood pressure (BP) monitored every 3 - 5&#xD;
      minutes while the catheter is clamped. If the subject reports any symptoms associated with&#xD;
      autonomic dysreflexia; e.g., headache, sweating, flushing and so forth, or if the BP monitor&#xD;
      records a systolic or diastolic BP 20 mm Hg above baseline or in any case, if the systolic BP&#xD;
      exceeds 150 or the diastolic BP exceeds 100 mm Hg, the catheter will be un-clamped.&#xD;
      Monitoring will continue until the subject is without symptoms with their baseline BP's.&#xD;
      Interventions, including elevating the head of the bed, lowering the legs, as well as&#xD;
      pharmacologic measures (nitropaste, nifedipine, etc.) will be used if needed. The use of&#xD;
      pharmacologic measures and any other measures will follow the Clinical Procedures Guidelines&#xD;
      for acute management of autonomic dysreflexia published by the Paralyzed Veterans of America.&#xD;
