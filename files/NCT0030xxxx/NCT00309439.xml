      The problem is the lack of data from randomized controlled trials to throw light on the&#xD;
      ALA-prostate cancer issue. There is therefore a need to acquire evidence from a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study to illustrate the effect of ALA on a surrogate marker for prostate cancer,&#xD;
      namely prostate specific antigen (PSA). Demonstration that atrial fibrillation recurrence was&#xD;
      reduced after cardioversion and that there was no adverse effect of 1 years of ALA feeding on&#xD;
      PSA would go a considerable way to providing the required evidence that ALA in the human diet&#xD;
      has no adverse effect on the prostate and so allow its use for cardiovascular risk reduction.&#xD;
      hypothesis: The effect of ALA on PSA levels over time will be no different from the control,&#xD;
      so providing supportive data for the view that ALA is not cancer promoting.&#xD;

      In addition disturbing news on alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has recently been reviewed by&#xD;
      Brouwer and colleagues (J Nutr:2004). Their analyses suggests that ALA, as found in canola&#xD;
      oil and other healthy foods, may cause prostate cancer even though there is good evidence&#xD;
      that canola oil will prevent heart disease. This issue urgently needs further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies largely from the Harvard group, but suggested by additional studies from Uruguay&#xD;
      and Spain, a link has been identified between ALA intake and prostate cancer. The Harvard&#xD;
      studies are cohort studies where groups of approximately 40,000 doctors or health&#xD;
      professionals have been followed up for periods of 10 years and the dietary intakes of ALA&#xD;
      related to the subsequent development of aggressive prostate cancer. It must be stressed that&#xD;
      these are not randomized crossover studies which are the currently accepted gold standard for&#xD;
      evidence-based medicine and regulatory decision making. Nevertheless they raise concern over&#xD;
      the health profile of a fatty acid with a growing reputation for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      prevention and a component of other healthy foods such as walnuts, flax, canola and soy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same Harvard group identified the deleterious effects on cardiovascular health of trans&#xD;
      fatty acids in their cohort studies and this has resulted in a major effort to remove trans&#xD;
      fatty acids from the food supply. On the other hand their identification of the benefits of&#xD;
      vitamin E in their cohort studies has not been confirmed by subsequent randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials. Although Dr Willett, the senior member of the Harvard group, has drawn surprisingly&#xD;
      little attention to the negative findings with ALA, it remains a sticking point with&#xD;
      regulators in the current debate over the inclusion and use of ALA in the food supply. This&#xD;
      concern has been sufficient for the Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada to&#xD;
      ask for a full proposal from us before we start studies on ALA in the prevention of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation due the apparently negative impact of ALA consumption on prostate cancer.&#xD;
