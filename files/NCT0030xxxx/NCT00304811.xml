      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of treatment for bacteremic MRSA&#xD;
      infection with vancomycin alone, vancomycin plus gentamicin, vancomycin plus rifampin, and&#xD;
      vancomycin plus gentamicin and rifampin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment of bacteremic infection (infection associated with positive blood cultures) due to&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus has become increasingly problematic as a result of the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of strains that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics (so-called&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA). About 70% of hospital-related strains of&#xD;
      S. aureus are MRSA, and, in the past 4 years, the incidence of MRSA in community-acquired&#xD;
      infection has risen to about 50%; these data are quite representative of what is being seen&#xD;
      elsewhere in the United States and other parts of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteremic MRSA infections are highly problematic for at least two reasons: (1)they are&#xD;
      serious, with substantial morbidity and about a 25% rate of mortality in middle-aged adults,&#xD;
      the principal patients in our system; and (2)available antibiotic therapy is suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-MRSA era (before 1982 in the United States), treatment of bacteremic S. aureus&#xD;
      infection with a beta-lactam antibiotic such as nafcillin produced a uniform microbiological&#xD;
      cure (Musher DM, McKenzie SO: Infections due to Staphylococcus aureus. Medicine 56:383-409,&#xD;
      1977). This means that, in the absence of an untreated focus of infection that required&#xD;
      surgical removal (such as a myocardial abscess), antibiotics rapidly sterilized the blood&#xD;
      stream. This does not mean that no one died; deaths from complications of infection remained&#xD;
      common. But, at autopsy, there was generally no evidence for active infection. Extensive&#xD;
      literature examined the question of whether gentamicin should be added to nafcillin to treat&#xD;
      this kind of disease (reviewed critically in DM, Verner EF: Treatment of Infections due to&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus. IN The Staphylococci, Ed. by J Jeljascewicz, Gustave Fischer Verlag,&#xD;
      Stuttgart, New York, pp.407-419, 1986). Gentamicin produced a synergistic bactericidal effect&#xD;
      agains S. aureus in vitro and in animal models. In humans, the addition of gentamicin was&#xD;
      associated with more rapid sterilization of the blood stream, but prolonged gentamicin&#xD;
      therapy was also associated with nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, in the MRSA era, treatment with vancomycin is associated with persistence of&#xD;
      bacteremia (positive blood cultures) and death from active infection. We have recently&#xD;
      participated in a prospective observational study that documented the association between&#xD;
      vancomycin treatment, persistently positive blood cultures, and persistence of active&#xD;
      infection during treatment of S. aureus bacteremia with vancomycin (Chang F-Y, McDonald BB,&#xD;
      Peacock, Jr. JE, Musher DM, et al. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: recurrence and the&#xD;
      impact of antibiotic treatment in a prospective multicenter study. Medicine 82:333-339,&#xD;
      2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There appears to be a very close correlation between the outcome of treatment for serious S.&#xD;
      aureus infection and the bactericidal activity of the treating antibiotic in vitro using&#xD;
      conventional techniques (Musher DM, Verner EF: Treatment of infections due to Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus. IN The Staphylococci, Ed. by J Jeljascewicz, Gustave Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, New&#xD;
      York, pp.407-419, 1986). We recently showed that adding low concentrations of gentamicin to&#xD;
      vancomycin led to substantial synergistic bactericidal activity against MRSA (Shelburne SA,&#xD;
      Musher DM, Hulten K, Ceasar H, Lu MY, Bhaila I, Hamill RJ. In-vitro killing of&#xD;
      community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with drug combinations.&#xD;
      Antimicrob Agents Chemother 48:4016-9, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based in part on the analogy of nafcillin for treating methicillin-susceptible S. aureus&#xD;
      infection, and in part of in vitro studies such as ours (cited above), some physicians&#xD;
      regularly add gentamicin to vancomycin for treating MRSA infection. Others, without even the&#xD;
      in vitro support, add rifampin either instead of gentamicin or together with gentamicin.&#xD;
      There are no clinical studies to support or to refute any of these clinically motivated&#xD;
      usages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, at present, about one-third of patients with MRSA bacteremia at VAMC are treated with&#xD;
      vacomycin plus gentamicin, and two-thirds receive vancomycin alone; some in each group&#xD;
      receive rifampin. The decisionto add gentamicin is made a haphazard fashion. Our proposal is,&#xD;
      once MRSA has been identified in acceptable regimens by stratifying patients prospectively to&#xD;
      vancomycin alone or vancomycin plus gentamicin, and further stratifying each of those groups&#xD;
      to be with or without rifampin.&#xD;
