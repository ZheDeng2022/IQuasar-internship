  <brief_title>Study Comparing the Safety of Switching From Lamivudine to Adefovir Dipivoxil Versus Overlapping Lamivudine and Adefovir Before Adefovir Dipivoxil Monotherapy in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In earlier clinical studies, when patients who have been on lamivudine (LAM) were switched to&#xD;
      adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), some patients developed ALT flares with an elevation of ALT &gt; 10 x&#xD;
      the upper limits of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were no cases of hepatic decompensation with the flares, however. The transition&#xD;
      methods were varied among physicians from no overlapping to overlapping for 1 to 3 months&#xD;
      with LAM and ADV. There is still some uncertainty about the optimal approach to switching&#xD;
      from LAM to ADV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the safety of directly switching to ADV to a protocolled switch after&#xD;
      a period of overlap of 12 weeks. This will facilitate pro-active switching in patients on LAM&#xD;
      and will also highlight genotypic resistance ahead of phenotypic resistance as a reason to&#xD;
      switch patients. Data to date have only been presented as part of a controlled study in&#xD;
      patients with clinically evident LAM-resistance. This study will enroll patients who still&#xD;
      have serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression whilst receiving LAM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic HBV infection is an important worldwide cause of morbidity, mortality and source of&#xD;
      potential new infections. There are an estimated 350 million carriers of HBV in the world. In&#xD;
      China, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10-15% of the population are&#xD;
      chronically infected. In North America and Northern Europe, infection and carrier rates are&#xD;
      much lower, usually below 1%. Intermediate carrier rates of 1-5% are found in Southern Europe&#xD;
      (e.g., Italy, Greece and Spain), parts of South and Central America, the Middle East and&#xD;
      Japan. Persistent infection develops in over 90% of perinatally infected children and in&#xD;
      3-10% of people who become infected after the age of 6 years. Worldwide, it has been&#xD;
      estimated that more than one million people die annually due to HBV-related end stage&#xD;
      diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B is to reduce a patient's risks for progressive&#xD;
      liver disease through prolonged suppression or eradication of HBV infection and to arrest or&#xD;
      ameliorate HBV-related liver damage.&#xD;
