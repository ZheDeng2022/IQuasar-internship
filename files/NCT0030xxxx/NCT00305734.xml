  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with gemcitabine works in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer. Bortezomib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together&#xD;
      with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Assess the response probability (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete&#xD;
      and partial responses) and 3-month progression-free survival rate in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who are treated with bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary I. Estimate 1-year progression-free survival and assess quantitative toxicities in&#xD;
      this group of patients treated with bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the response probability (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) in&#xD;
      the subset of patients who progress on bortezomib, with measurable disease at the time of&#xD;
      progression, and go on to receive bortezomib and gemcitabine hydrochloride combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate 1-year overall survival of all patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate 6-month progression-free survival from the start of combination therapy and&#xD;
      assess quantitative toxicities in the subset of patients who progress on bortezomib and&#xD;
      receive combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Explore, in a preliminary manner, the relationship between changes in Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      DNA level, NF-kB DNA-binding activity, and methylation status of E-cadherin promoter with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study of bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete&#xD;
      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of treatment with bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience disease progression on single-agent bortezomib and did not receive&#xD;
      prior gemcitabine hydrochloride may begin combination therapy within 10-28 days of the last&#xD;
      dose of bortezomib. Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 8 and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a CR receive 2 additional&#xD;
      courses beyond the confirmed CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
