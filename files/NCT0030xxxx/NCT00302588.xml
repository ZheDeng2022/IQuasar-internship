      Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is defined as biopsy-proven metastasis of an epithelial&#xD;
      malignancy in the absence of an identifiable primary site after complete history and physical&#xD;
      examination, basic laboratory studies, chest X-ray and additional directed studies indicated&#xD;
      by positive findings during the initial work-up. It is characterized by its slow local&#xD;
      development and its high metastatic potential.1,2 Patients with CUP represent 4-10% of all&#xD;
      new cancer patients.3,4 The presenting sites of metastasis identified pathologically,&#xD;
      radiographically or by physical examination were found most frequently in the lymph nodes&#xD;
      (37.1%), followed by the liver, bone, lung, pleura/pleural space, brain, peritoneum, adrenal&#xD;
      and skin. Of the lymph nodes of metastasis, the supraclavicular cervical area is the leading&#xD;
      site (31.3%), followed by the mediastinum, axilla, retroperitonium, and inguina.5 The&#xD;
      incidence of metastatic cervical CUP (MCCUP) varies between 2% and 9% of all head and neck&#xD;
      cancers.6-8 The level of cervical metastatic involvement may give some clue as to the likely&#xD;
      primary site. A submandibular mass (level I) would most commonly be related to a primary in&#xD;
      the oral cavity or skin. Level II nodes, including the jugulodigastric node, may point to a&#xD;
      primary in the oral cavity, oropharynx, or supraglottic larynx. Tumours of the nasopharynx&#xD;
      generally spread to level II or the posterior triangle, as well as retropharyngeal nodes.&#xD;
      Middle and lower jugular nodes (levels III and IV) are more likely related to a laryngeal or&#xD;
      hypopharyngeal cancer. Metastatic disease restricted to the supraclavicular region is often&#xD;
      due to an infraclavicular primary site.9 The prognosis is different according to the involved&#xD;
      lymph node level and possible primary site. Modern cancer management relies heavily on&#xD;
      recognition of the primary tumor; thus the absence of a primary site poses major diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic problems. The patient benefits from identification of the initial tumor site&#xD;
      because postoperative irradiation ports may be reduced and because surveillance for&#xD;
      recurrence may be improved.10 In order to identify the likely primary site of MCCUP and&#xD;
      compare the prognoses of known and unknown primary groups, we report the results according to&#xD;
      the different levels of metastatic cervical lymph nodes.&#xD;
