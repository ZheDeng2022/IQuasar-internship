      The purpose of this research is to identify cases from patients who have been referred for&#xD;
      consultation to the Infectious Disease Section at the VAMC, Houston, and to compare them with&#xD;
      other cases of CAP in order to determine whether there are features that might enable non-CAP&#xD;
      cases to be distinguished from CAP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Guidelines to treat community acquired pneumonia (CAP) have been developed and widely&#xD;
      promulgated by important professional societies in the past 10 years. The impetus to do so&#xD;
      came from the observation that practicing physicians were using a wide array of approaches to&#xD;
      this common infection, many of which were substandard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) have&#xD;
      been leaders in this field, publishing recommendations separately between 1993 and 2003. The&#xD;
      PI served on the IDSA committee and coauthored the publication in 2000 and the update in&#xD;
      2003. In 2004, a decision was made by the two professional societies to merge the committees&#xD;
      and make a single joint set of recommendations; the PI is a member of that joint committee&#xD;
      and a new document is being prepared for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI has observed a tendency to apply these guidelines to cases that might masquerade as&#xD;
      CAP but are actually attributable to other conditions, such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and&#xD;
      histoplasmosis. Further, the recommendations do not adequately cover pneumonia due to&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research is to identify cases from the consult records of the Infectious&#xD;
      Disease Section at the VAMC, Houston, and to compare them with other cases of CAP in order to&#xD;
      determine whether there are features that might enable non-CAP cases to be distinguished from&#xD;
      CAP.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects who were seen in calendar year 2004 because they were thought to have CAP,&#xD;
             but who, upon further evaluation, plainly did not, and consultation was sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  case control is diagnosis of CAP with verification by all or nearly all of the&#xD;
             following features: presence of cough, increased sputum, fever, leukocytosis and a&#xD;
             distinct new pulmonary infiltrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  among the case controls, if the diagnosis of CAP was made despite the absence of the&#xD;
             cardinal features of CAP, as cited above, the investigators will not include the case.&#xD;
