  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed phase II trial will investigate the combination of irinotecan, carboplatin and&#xD;
      bevacizumab along with radiation in the treatment of patients with limited-stage SCLC. This&#xD;
      study differs from our &quot;maintenance&quot; bevacizumab trial in that bevacizumab will begin with&#xD;
      the initial chemotherapy treatment. Irinotecan/platinum regimens are emerging as standard&#xD;
      treatments for patients with extensive-stage disease. Adding a novel minimally toxic agent to&#xD;
      this regimen up front may further enhance this doublet's efficacy without contributing to&#xD;
      toxicity. This trial will be one of the first clinical trials to evaluate a combination of&#xD;
      targeted therapy and chemotherapy in the up front treatment of a common solid tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive 4 courses of irinotecan, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy will begin concurrently with the third course of systemic treatment. The&#xD;
      intervals between chemotherapy courses will be 28 days.Patients will be completely restaged&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy prior to beginning treatment with&#xD;
      maintenance bevacizumab. Those with progressive tumor or serious toxicity will come off&#xD;
      study. Those with stable disease or objective tumor responses will continue treatment with&#xD;
      restaging every 12 weeks for a minimum of 6 cycles (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction chemotherapy regimen Irinotecan: 60mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, and 15 Carboplatin:&#xD;
           AUC=4 day 1 only Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV days 1, 15 Cycles are repeated every 28 days&#xD;
           for four courses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy 1.8 Gy, single daily fractions, concurrently with the third course of&#xD;
           chemotherapy e to a total dose of 61.2 Gy (34 fractions). Patients obtaining complete&#xD;
           remission or near complete remission will also receive prophylactic whole brain&#xD;
           radiotherapy, given within one month after all therapy is completed (total dose 24Gy in&#xD;
           2Gy daily fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance Bevacizumab Bevacizumab alone at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV days 1 and 15 each&#xD;
           cycle, for a maximum of 6 additional cycles (6 months) with restaging every 12 weeks.&#xD;
