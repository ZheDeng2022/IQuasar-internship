  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past 15 years, however, the superior immunosuppressive efficacy of CsA and the&#xD;
      well-known toxicity of long-term steroid therapy have prompted trials of steroid withdrawal&#xD;
      from renal allograft recipients at various intervals after transplantation. Steroid&#xD;
      withdrawal or avoidance must be balanced against the associated risk of precipitating acute&#xD;
      allograft rejection. Moreover, with the current immunosuppressive regimens, by 10 years&#xD;
      approximately 50% of grafts will have been lost due mainly to chronic rejection or the&#xD;
      side-effects of immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, the quest for therapies that might induce&#xD;
      specific immune tolerance - ideally via short-term interventions that would target only the&#xD;
      pathogenic immune response and leave the protective host immune response unimpaired - has&#xD;
      provided a &quot;holy grail&quot; for transplant immunologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The humanized IgG monoclonal antibody Campath-1H has been hypothesized to provide enough&#xD;
      immunosuppression that would allow maintenance therapy with low-dose CsA, and possibly&#xD;
      reprogramming the immune system so to encourage tolerance processes. Despite Campath-1H&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimens have been claimed to induce a condition of &quot;almost tolerance&quot;,&#xD;
      this has not been proved nor evidence of development of persistent regulatory immune&#xD;
      responses long-term post transplant has been provided. Thus, characterizing phenotypically&#xD;
      and functionally distinct subsets of T-regulatory cells possibly generated selectively in&#xD;
      non-rejecting transplant recipients in Campath-1H-based immunosuppressive regimens may help&#xD;
      to find new noninvasive markers of immune system activation to tailor immunosuppressive&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of Campath-1H, low dose sirolimus&#xD;
      versus Campath-1H, low dose CsA, both in addition to low dose MMF on phenotypic and&#xD;
      functional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients in a steroid-free regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last 40 years have been a period of remarkable evolution of organ transplantation from&#xD;
      nothing to a well-established form of treatment with good short-term results. These findings&#xD;
      were achieved mainly using the conventional triple-drug regimen with cyclosporine (CsA),&#xD;
      azathioprine (or mycophenolate mofetil, MMF), and steroids. During the past 15 years,&#xD;
      however, the superior immunosuppressive efficacy of CsA and the well-known toxicity of&#xD;
      long-term steroid therapy have prompted trials of steroid withdrawal from renal allograft&#xD;
      recipients at various intervals after transplantation, Few transplant centers have also&#xD;
      adopted a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen. Reported benefit of eliminating steroids&#xD;
      from immunosuppressive regimens of CsA-treated renal transplant recipients have included&#xD;
      improvement of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and, in children,&#xD;
      acceleration of growth. Avoiding these steroid-related side effects would contribute to&#xD;
      improve long-term outcome of the grafts. These and other benefits of steroid withdrawal or&#xD;
      avoidance must be balanced against the associated risk of precipitating acute allograft&#xD;
      rejection. Moreover, with the current immunosuppressive regimens, by 10 years approximately&#xD;
      50% of grafts will have been lost due mainly to chronic rejection or the side-effects of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, the quest for therapies that might induce specific immune&#xD;
      tolerance - ideally via short-term interventions that would target only the pathogenic immune&#xD;
      response and leave the protective host immune response unimpaired - has provided a &quot;holy&#xD;
      grail&quot; for transplant immunologists. We now have a number of extremely powerful&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs and antibodies with different mechanisms of action and the stage is&#xD;
      set for a move from current continuous high dose immunosuppressive maintenance therapy to low&#xD;
      dose or no maintenance immunosuppression. Indeed, true tolerance can occur in man, examples&#xD;
      being successful bone marrow transplantation and patients with liver grafts who have stopped&#xD;
      immunosuppression after years of good function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The humanized IgG monoclonal antibody Campath-1H with a unique target CD52 on T, B&#xD;
      lymphocytes and monocytes has been used to eliminate lymphocytes from the blood for more than&#xD;
      a month in kidney transplant recipients. Given its potent but safe effect of depleting T and&#xD;
      B cells, Campath-1H has been hypothesized to provide enough immunosuppression that would&#xD;
      allow maintenance therapy with low-dose CsA, and possibly reprogramming the immune system so&#xD;
      to encourage tolerance processes. This has been formally tested in 31 patients undergoing&#xD;
      first cadaver renal allograft. The results with a mean two year follow-up have been&#xD;
      encouraging, 29 patients having good graft function without receiving maintenance steroids.&#xD;
      Similar results have been achieved recently combining Campath-1H and full dose sirolimus in&#xD;
      renal transplant recipients. Twenty-three out of 24 patients had good graft function 1 year&#xD;
      post transplant. However, most patients were on a lipid-lowering agent to counteract the&#xD;
      hyperlipidemic effect of sirolimus. It should be also considered that in both clinical trials&#xD;
      acute rejection episodes early post transplant occurred in 20-25% of the patients. Thus, to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of hyperlipidemia associated with the current full-dose of sirolimus, while&#xD;
      minimizing the risk of rejection, a combination regimen of low dose sirolimus and low dose&#xD;
      MMF is worth investigating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite Campath-1H immunosuppressive regimens have been claimed to induce a condition of&#xD;
      &quot;almost tolerance&quot;, this has not been proved nor evidence of development of persistent&#xD;
      regulatory immune responses long-term post transplant has been provided. Thus, characterizing&#xD;
      phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets of T-regulatory cells possibly generated&#xD;
      selectively in non-rejecting transplant recipients in Campath-1H-based immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimens may help to find new noninvasive markers of immune system activation to tailor&#xD;
      immunosuppressive protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study in adult kidney transplant recipients is designed with the following&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To compare the effect of Campath-1H, low dose sirolimus versus Campath-1H, low dose&#xD;
      CsA, both in addition to low dose MMF on phenotypic and functional profiles of peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in kidney transplant recipients in a steroid-free regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare in the two groups of kidney transplant recipients at 6 and 12 months post-Tx:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of acute allograft rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time course of graft function (as serum creatinine concentration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time course of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for antihypertensive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for statins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood glucose and need of antidiabetic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 h urinary protein excretion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and graft survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of major adverse events (post-transplant anuria, major infections, cancer,&#xD;
           abnormal liver function tests, and abnormal hematological blood cell count)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an extension of the project, patients still on the study at month 12 post-transplant, with&#xD;
      no biopsy evidence of acute or chronic rejection, persistent donor specific unresponsiveness&#xD;
      and intact 3rd party response in MLR, presence of immune regulatory cells in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood will undergo a program of sequential withdrawal of the maintenance low dose&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Group 1 (n=11): Campath-1H, low dose sirolimus, low dose MMF These patients&#xD;
      will receive Campath-1H at day 0 of transplant. Low dose sirolimus (target to trough&#xD;
      concentration of 5-10 ng/ml) and low dose MMF (750 mg twice a day) will be given orally&#xD;
      starting on the day of transplant (the first few days through nasogastric tube).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylprednisolone (500 mg) will be administered intravenously on day 0, 1, and 2&#xD;
      posttransplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first treatment will be performed 30 min before the dose of Campath-1H, to minimize&#xD;
      reactions to cytokine release. Group 2 (n=10): Campath-1H, low dose CsA, low dose MMF The&#xD;
      patients will receive Campath-1H at day 0 of transplant. Low dose CsA (target blood C2 level:&#xD;
      450-750 ng/ml) and low dose MMF (750 mg twice a day) will be given orally starting on the day&#xD;
      of transplant (the first few days through nasogastric tube). Methylprednisolone will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously on day 0 (500 mg), 1 (250 mg), and 2 (125 mg) post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first treatment will be performed 30 min before the dose of Campath-1H, to minimize&#xD;
      reactions to cytokine release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed at the Clinical Research Center for Rare Disease Aldo eCele&#xD;
      Daccò of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design All patients entering the study will be managed according to standard protocols&#xD;
      already in use at the participating Centers.A tissue sample will be taken from the kidney&#xD;
      just after harvesting from the donor and, by percutaneous renal biopsy, at the end of the 12&#xD;
      month follow-up for morphological evaluation. Beside conventional histological examination.&#xD;
      immunostaining for cytokines, and possible mediators of chronic renal injury (ET-1, TGF-β,&#xD;
      RANTES) will be performed. Clinical parameters will be monitored at least every month.&#xD;
      Functional parameter will be evaluated at month 6 and 12 post-transplant. Moreover,blood CsA&#xD;
      C2, blood sirolimus trough levels, and plasma MMF trough levels will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo immunophenotyping of circulating peripheral blood leukocytes at&#xD;
      different time points post-transplant. All patients will also undergo lymphocyte function&#xD;
      assays at different time points posttransplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assays will be performed pre-transplant, at day 15 and 30 post-transplant (or at the&#xD;
      time of acute rejection and after recovery of graft function), at month 6, 12 post-transplant&#xD;
      or at the time of any biopsy due to chronic deterioration of graft function and at the time&#xD;
      of graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time points cytokine detection in antigen-activated T cells will be measured by&#xD;
      ELISPOT assay.&#xD;
