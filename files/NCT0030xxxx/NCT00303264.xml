  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Functional dyspepsia&quot; has been defined loosely as &quot;pain or discomfort centered in the upper&#xD;
      abdomen.&quot; The symptoms can also include fullness, early satiety, bloating, belching, nausea,&#xD;
      retching and vomiting. These symptoms may present with or without the co-existence of&#xD;
      symptoms of heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Functional dyspepsia is a&#xD;
      diagnosis of exclusion in which other disease states, such as ulcer, cancer, etc. are ruled&#xD;
      out and the source of the pain is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for most patients presenting with dyspeptic symptoms has been with&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI), regardless of whether or not the patient's symptoms include&#xD;
      acid-related conditions, e.g., heartburn, GERD, etc. Although PPI treatment has yielded some&#xD;
      success in these patients, there is a significant population of patients whose dyspeptic&#xD;
      symptoms are not adequately treated with PPI's alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of dexloxiglumide in the treatment of the&#xD;
      symptoms of functional dyspepsia in patients whose dyspeptic symptoms are not being treated&#xD;
      adequately with PPI's.&#xD;
