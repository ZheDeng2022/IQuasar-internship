  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To determine the effectiveness of the rectal trumpet compared to the standard care&#xD;
      in maintaining skin integrity in patients with fecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (H1): There will be no difference in the failure rates of rectal area skin&#xD;
      integrity between subjects receiving the rectal trumpet and those receiving treatment as&#xD;
      usual (staqndard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To determine the ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and level of patient comfort&#xD;
      with the rectal trumpet compared to the standard care in patients with fecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (exploratory) hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be differences in the ease of use of the devices, costs of the devices, and&#xD;
      patient comfort relative to the devices.&#xD;

      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of 80 adult male and female patients in the Wilmington Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (WICU), Surgical Critical Care Center (SCCC), Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), and 6D&#xD;
      Step-Down, TSU, 5A, 5E/W, will be recruited. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of two groups (experimental: rectal trumpet or standard treatment:&#xD;
      Hollister fecal incontinent collector).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Patients who meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diarrhea - two episodes of loose or watery stool in a 12 hour period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. English-speaking patient or guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intact skin, may be discolored without breakdown&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Doctor's order for rectal trumpet (if randomized to treatment group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded from this study if any of the following are&#xD;
      present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. prolapsed anal sphincter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. active rectal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. bleeding precautions&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. rectal tone rated 1 (gaping) or 2 (lax)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection instruments used in this study are investigator-developed (see Appendix A&#xD;
      - Data Collection Tool). Data will be collected by study and unit nurses at baseline, every&#xD;
      eight hours, and PRN throughout the duration of the study. Data will have subject&#xD;
      identification removed and subject number assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital pictures of patients with any identifying marks (e.g., tattoos, birthmarks,&#xD;
      piercings) will have these marks edited out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison study will be conducted. The staff nurse will identify patients with two or&#xD;
      greater episodes of loose or watery stool in a 12 hour period and contact study team. Study&#xD;
      team member will determine if patient meets additional inclusion criteria #2, #3, #4, and #5&#xD;
      and does not have exclusion criteria #1, #2 or #3. Once this is determined, the study team&#xD;
      member will approach patient or family for consent to participate in study. After consent is&#xD;
      obtained, study team member will evaluate patient for remaining exclusion criteria (#4).&#xD;
      Rectal tone will be assessed and rated by performing a digital rectal exam. If assessed tone&#xD;
      is rated gaping (1) or lax (2), patient is excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting all study criteria will be randomized to either the rectal trumpet group or&#xD;
      the standard treatment. The Numeric Pain Intensity Scale (0-10) or staff observation of&#xD;
      physiological indicators (e.g., restlessness, sweating, tachycardia, lacrimation, pupil&#xD;
      dilatation, poor ventilator synchrony) for disoriented or unresponsive patients will be used&#xD;
      prior to and immediately after placement of either device in order to assess patient comfort.&#xD;
      Comfort will be assessed every 8 hours on all oriented patients using the Numeric Pain&#xD;
      Intensity Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For placement of rectal trumpet (Rusch nasopharyngeal airway-32FR): Patient's skin is&#xD;
      cleansed with Smith and Nephew Personal cleanser and rinsed thoroughly with water to remove&#xD;
      any soap residue and dried. Apply 3M no sting barrier film to provide skin protectant. Attach&#xD;
      the shaft end of the trumpet to a urinary drainage bag. Using hemostats, clamp the tubing&#xD;
      beneath the sample port of the drainage bag. Instill 5cc of mineral oil through the flange&#xD;
      end of the trumpet, being careful not to over fill or spill mineral oil onto flange. Release&#xD;
      the clamp and allow the mineral oil to drain into urinary drainage bag. If possible, place&#xD;
      patient into side-lying position with knees drawn toward the chest. Fold flange into&#xD;
      quarters, insert into the rectum. Pull back gently until there is slight resistance. Secure&#xD;
      the drainage bag to the bed frame. Drainage tubing should be positioned to prevent tension or&#xD;
      pull on trumpet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff will be educated on proper placement of both devices and need for&#xD;
      reapplication/reinsertion of either device prior to study initiation. Education will be&#xD;
      provided to staff on the following units: SCCC, MICU, 6DSD, and WICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be assessed every 8 hours and PRN for signs of skin breakdown, stool&#xD;
      leakage around devices, dislodgement, or discomfort from devices using the Numeric Pain&#xD;
      Intensity Scale for oriented patients. Failure of the fecal incontinent collector will&#xD;
      include: leakage within 24 hours of application X 2 attempts at placement, or skin breakdown.&#xD;
      Failure of the rectal trumpet will include: leakage X 2 around trumpet with proper&#xD;
      positioning within a 24 hour period, skin breakdown, expelling trumpet with continuation of&#xD;
      diarrhea X 3 in a 24 hour period, or if the oriented patient, when assessed for discomfort&#xD;
      every 8 hours, rates discomfort 2 points above previous rating level of discomfort or&#xD;
      requests removal of device due to discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected digital pictures of patients' skin will be taken to establish inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability with respect to skin assessment and to provide photographic evidence of skin&#xD;
      maintenance, healing, or failure with use of either device. A representative from the Medical&#xD;
      Photography department will instruct investigators on digital photographing of patients'&#xD;
      skin. Completion of trial will be the return of continence, stool becoming formed, discharge&#xD;
      from unit of study, or 14 days whichever comes first.&#xD;
