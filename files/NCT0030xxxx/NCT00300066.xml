    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess serum cystatin C as a marker of kidney function&#xD;
      (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) in children aged 2-14. The individual production rate and&#xD;
      possible extra renal elimination of cystatin C based on body composition data is included to&#xD;
      develop new algorithms to estimate GFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, day-to-day variation on serum cystatin C is investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today, children's kidney function (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) can be monitored by two&#xD;
      methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. indirectly by serum creatinine, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. directly by injection of a radioactive substance followed by several blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first method is inaccurate with many drawbacks, whereas the latter is precise but&#xD;
      time-consuming and unpleasant for the child. Therefore, there is a need for a new method for&#xD;
      investigating GFR in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum cystatin C is a small protein that is produced with a constant rate in all nucleated&#xD;
      cells in the body. It meets many of the characteristics of an ideal marker of GFR because of&#xD;
      the way it is excreted in the kidneys. However, earlier studies have not proven serum&#xD;
      cystatin C to be convincingly better than serum creatinine. Why? If there is considerable&#xD;
      extra renal elimination, serum cystatin C alone isn't enough to estimate GFR. Therefore, the&#xD;
      individual production rate and possible extra renal elimination of cystatin C are included in&#xD;
      this study. To assess these factors, the children are submitted to bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (BIS) to estimate their body composition, including body cell mass as cystatin C&#xD;
      is produced in all nucleated cells. To validate the BIS data, dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) will be conducted on 100 of the included children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on serum cystatin C and the individual, age-corrected extra renal elimination rate of&#xD;
      cystatin C, new algorithms to calculate GFR can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, day-to-day variation in serum cystatin C and BIS data, which is expected to be&#xD;
      low, is investigated in 100 of the included children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day-to-day variation on serum cystatin C is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum cystatin C raises parallel to falling GFR with time, which means that serum&#xD;
           cystatin C can be used to monitor changes in kidney function in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on body composition, regression analysis and serum cystatin C values, GFR can be&#xD;
           estimated in children aged 2-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. GFR calculated as stated above is a more precise measurement of kidney function and&#xD;
           changes in kidney function than GFR estimated from serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data of body composition estimated by BIS do not deviate from data estimated by DEXA&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Day-to-day variation in data for body composition measured by BIS is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes 200 children aged 2-14 who are referred for routine examination of GFR&#xD;
      in two Departments of Nuclear Medicine.&#xD;
