    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal&#xD;
      disease, responsible for 8% to 10% of the cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western&#xD;
      countries. At comparable levels of blood pressure control and proteinuria, patients with&#xD;
      ADPKD have faster decline in glomerular filtration rate than those with other renal diseases&#xD;
      and do not seem to benefit to the same extent of ACE inhibitor therapy. A reasonable&#xD;
      explanation for the above findings is that in ADPKD progression is largely dependent on the&#xD;
      development and growth of cysts and secondary disruption of normal tissue. Thus,&#xD;
      renoprotective interventions in ADPKD - in addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure and proteinuria and to limit the effects of additional potential promoters of&#xD;
      disease progression such as dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be&#xD;
      specifically aimed to correct the dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and&#xD;
      matrix interactions characteristic of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence that specific receptors for somatostatin are present in the kidney tissue, arises&#xD;
      the possibility that somatostatin treatment in patients with ADPKD might inhibit fluid&#xD;
      formation and eventually induce the shrinking of renal cysts.To evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      the safety of long-acting somatostatin in ADPKD patients, a prospective cross-over controlled&#xD;
      study has been recently performed. This pilot study demonstrated the safety of six month&#xD;
      treatment of long-acting somatostatin in patients with ADPKD. Moreover, the percent increase&#xD;
      of total kidney volume was significantly lower in patients on somatostatin than in placebo.&#xD;
      Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a long-term study in ADPKD patients&#xD;
      aimed to document the efficacy of the somatostatin treatment in preventing further increase&#xD;
      or even reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts,&#xD;
      eventually halting kidney disease progression.&#xD;

      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal&#xD;
      disease, responsible for 8% to 10% of the cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At comparable levels of blood pressure control and proteinuria, patients with ADPKD have&#xD;
      faster decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than those with other renal diseases and&#xD;
      do not seem to benefit to the same extent of ACE inhibitor therapy. A reasonable explanation&#xD;
      for the above findings is that in ADPKD progression is largely dependent on the development&#xD;
      and growth of cysts and secondary disruption of normal tissue. Thus, renoprotective&#xD;
      interventions in ADPKD - in addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      and proteinuria and to limit the effects of additional potential promoters of disease&#xD;
      progression such as dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be&#xD;
      specifically aimed to correct the dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and&#xD;
      matrix interactions characteristic of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid filling renal cysts in human polycystic kidney is formed mainly by a secretion&#xD;
      process of the tubular epithelium lining the cysts. Secretion and re-absorption take place at&#xD;
      approximately the same rate, with secretion slightly higher, so that the amount of fluid in&#xD;
      the cysts increases slowly over time. The same process, via the secondary active chloride&#xD;
      transport, is also involved in the secretion of fluid into the lumen of proximal tubules in&#xD;
      teleost and elasmobranch fishes. Of interest, this process of chloride transport can be&#xD;
      markedly inhibited by somatostatin, as demonstrated in the shark rectal gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, somatostatin analogues have become available and used with negligible side effects&#xD;
      for long-term treatment of tumors (up to 8-12 months). To evaluate the tolerability and the&#xD;
      safety of long-acting somatostatin in ADPKD patients, a prospective cross-over controlled&#xD;
      study has been recently performed. This pilot study demonstrated the safety of six month&#xD;
      treatment of long-acting somatostatin in patients with ADPKD. Moreover, the percent increase&#xD;
      of total kidney volume was significantly lower in patients on somatostatin than in placebo.&#xD;
      Preliminary data on late stage ADPKD also suggest that loss of renal function in these&#xD;
      patients closely correlates with the increase in kidney volume taken by small cysts (&lt;5 mm3),&#xD;
      but not total cyst volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a long-term study in ADPKD patients&#xD;
      aimed to document the efficacy of the somatostatin treatment in preventing further increase&#xD;
      or even reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts,&#xD;
      eventually halting kidney disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the study is to compare the effects on disease progression of three year&#xD;
      treatment with long-acting somatostatin or placebo in patients with ADPKD and normal renal&#xD;
      function or mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Specifically, the following aims will be&#xD;
      pursued:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To compare in somatostatin and placebo ADPKD groups the change over baseline of the&#xD;
      total kidney volume at 1 and 3 years follow-up (estimated by gadolinium contrast enhanced and&#xD;
      T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. As secondary efficacy endpoints, the following parameters (absolute and percent change&#xD;
           over baseline by MRI analysis) will be compared in the two ADPKD groups at baseline, at&#xD;
           1 and 3 years follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Renal cyst volume&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total renal parenchymal volume&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Residual renal volume&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Renal parenchymal volume taken up by small cysts (&lt;5 mm3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Additional functional parameters will be compared in the two groups at baseline and at&#xD;
           1, 2, 3 years follow-up as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GFR (plasma iohexol clearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GFR (over baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  RPF (plasma PAH clearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum creatinine concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diuresis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  24 h urinary protein excretion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  24 h urinary albumin excretion rate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Protein, albumin, creatinine concentrations on spot morning urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Protein /creatinine ratio on spot morning urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Albumin/creatinine ratio on spot morning urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary sodium, urea, glucose, phosphorus concentrations (24 hr samples)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine osmolality (calculated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlation analyses between MRI and functional parameters will be also performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients enrolled in this long-term follow-up study are those with ADPKD and normal&#xD;
      renal function or mild to moderate renal insufficiency (estimated GFR &gt;40 ml/min/1.73 m2 by&#xD;
      MDRD equation), no evidence of associated systemic, renal parenchymal or urinary tract&#xD;
      disease and no specific contraindication to the study drug.&#xD;
