      Evolution of pain and neural injury will be evaluated at 2 years or longer after the onset of&#xD;
      AHZ by multiple measures. Assessments at 2 years or longer will be compared to those&#xD;
      collected during the first 6 months after HZ in order to test whether or not sensory function&#xD;
      and cutaneous innervation continues to normalize beyond 6 months in subjects who recover from&#xD;
      HZ without severe PHN.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pain, nerve trunk inflammation, and neuronal injury are hallmarks of acute herpes zoster&#xD;
      (AHZ). We hypothesize that the development of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) strongly depends&#xD;
      on two factors: 1) the severity of the initial neural injury and 2) the ability to recover&#xD;
      from the initial neural injury. To test this hypothesis, we will prospectively follow 150&#xD;
      patients at high risk for development of PHN. Evolution of pain and neural injury will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 2-6 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and at 2 years or longer after the onset&#xD;
      of AHZ by multiple measures. Assessments at 2 years or longer will be compared to those&#xD;
      collected during the first 6 months after HZ in order to test whether or not sensory function&#xD;
      and cutaneous innervation continues to normalize beyond 6 months in subjects who recover from&#xD;
      HZ without severe PHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary analysis of study data showed reduced innervation in HZ skin, mirror image skin&#xD;
      and distant control skin in the acute phase of HZ that was not specific to the persistence of&#xD;
      pain at 3 months. The innervation appeared to recover more fully by 6 months in distant&#xD;
      control skin than in mirror-image skin and HZ skin, despite the fact that the subjects were&#xD;
      continuing to experience a further reduction in their zoster-associated pain. This suggests&#xD;
      that the symptoms of pain and sensory dysfunction are not due to a mere loss in overall&#xD;
      innervation density. The proposed subsequent â‰¥ 2 year study visit and analysis will allow us&#xD;
      to directly correlate pain resolution with resolution of sensory and innervation&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;

        Males and females aged 50 or older with outbreak of herpes zoster occurring less than 6&#xD;
        weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females aged 50 or older and in stable general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to understand and follow the instructions of the investigator, including the pain&#xD;
             intensity rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have an acute outbreak of cervical, thoracic or lumbosacral HZ with&#xD;
             unilateral skin rash and pain; the diagnosis will be based on physical examination and&#xD;
             review of available medical records confirming the outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The outbreak of herpes zoster must have occurred less than 6 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. PHN pain must be of at least moderate severity, defined as self-report of average pain&#xD;
             level of 20 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The AHZ outbreak is complicated by stroke or myelopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with facial or cranial AHZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with signs of spinal cord or brainstem injury from HZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are considered unreliable as to study compliance or adherence to&#xD;
             scheduled appointments as determined by the Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients, who are undergoing active treatment for cancer, are infected with the Human&#xD;
             Immunodeficiency Virus, or are being acutely and intensively immunosuppressed&#xD;
             following a transplantation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Bleeding disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with known skin pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of topical steroids, capsaicin, local anesthetics or topical aspirin/NSAID&#xD;
             preparations within two weeks of the study sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Another pain problem of equal or greater severity than AHZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Allergy or idiosyncratic reaction to lidocaine or capsaicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Neurological dysfunction or psychiatric disorder severe enough to interfere with&#xD;
             assessment of pain and sensory systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has received neuroablative nerve blocks or neurosurgical procedures for AHZ pain prior&#xD;
             to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who are unable to read or speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Those, in the opinion of the investigator, who are unlikely to comply with the study&#xD;
             protocol or who are unsuitable for any other reason.&#xD;
