  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study hypothesis of this study is to determine whether there is a greater&#xD;
      percentage of patients achieving a triglyceride level of &lt;200 mg/dL with the combination of&#xD;
      simvastatin 20 mg and fenofibrate 160mg than with either simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy or&#xD;
      fenofibrate 160mg monotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis and is often characterized by&#xD;
      dyslipidemia with hypertriglyceridemia,low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and modestly&#xD;
      elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and&#xD;
      fibrates improve lipoprotein metabolism and decrease coronary disease risk. Statins and&#xD;
      fibrates affect different aspects of lipoprotein metabolism and each improve lipid metabolism&#xD;
      complimentarily. Statins lower total cholesterol and LDL while fibrates decrease triglyceride&#xD;
      concentrations and elevateHDL cholesterol. Since individual lipid parameters have been shown&#xD;
      to be independent cardiovascular risk factors, it is especially important to target all lipid&#xD;
      parameters to levels outlined in treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel ill (NCEP ill) guidelines&#xD;
      have set target therapeutic levels for coronary heart disease (CHD) and CHD risk equivalents&#xD;
      (including diabetes).Many patients, however, are not able to achieve optimal levels with a&#xD;
      single lipid-controlling agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is particularly evident among diabetics, who often have multiple dyslipidemias and are&#xD;
      less likely to achieve effective lipid control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several small clinical trials have demonstrated that fibrate and statin dual therapy combine&#xD;
      the specific effects of the two drugs by significantlyreducing total and LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      while increasing HDL cholesterol, though problems are associated. Previous studies, conducted&#xD;
      mainly with a gemfibrozil/cerivastatin combination, showed an increased incidence of side&#xD;
      effects (myopathy, hepatotoxicity) and high cost. This problem was again addressed in a small&#xD;
      study of74 patients randomized to combined or alternate-day simvastatin and fenofibrate&#xD;
      therapy. Surprisingly, in this study, no cases of myopathy were reported, even among patients&#xD;
      receiving combined simvastatin and fenofibrate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lipids in Diabetes Study (LDSH Study) examined the fenofibrate and cerivastatin&#xD;
      combination in a large-scale trial of 4,000 patients. This study was stopped early because&#xD;
      study treatment included cerivastatin, which was withdrawn from the United States market in&#xD;
      2001. Consequently, the results' utility will be limited in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional studies evaluating lipid therapies capable of meeting more aggressive treatment&#xD;
      guidelines outlined in NCEP ill, especially among diabetic patients, are required. We propose&#xD;
      a twelve-month study of simvastatin, micronized fenofibrate, and combination therapy among&#xD;
      patients with controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary objectives ofthis study will&#xD;
      be to assess the safety and efficacy of combined micronized fenofibrate and simvastatin&#xD;
      therapy versus micronized fenofibrate or simvastatin monotherapy. Secondary objectives will&#xD;
      include evaluation of combined micronized fenofibrate and simvastatin therapy versus&#xD;
      micronized fenofibrate or simvastatin monotherapy on novel lipid parameters and serological&#xD;
      markers associated with significantly increased cardiovascular risk. The benefits of the&#xD;
      study will be numerous. First, we will be able to detennine the efficacy of each treatment&#xD;
      arm in achieving the more aggressive lipid level targets outlined in NCEP ill. Second, this&#xD;
      trial, unlike previous studies, will assess the safety and efficacy of each treatment arm&#xD;
      specifically among diabetic patients. Third, the length of therapy will allow adequate, yet&#xD;
      efficient, evaluation of the tertiary endpoints, which include novel risk factors not&#xD;
      previously assessed with combination therapy.&#xD;
