  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18 F-fluoride Positron emission tomography (PET) is able to demonstrate and quantify the&#xD;
      metabolic activity locally in the skeleton (1). This technique should, therefore, also be&#xD;
      able to demonstrate a dramatic decrease in the metabolic activity in localized monostotic&#xD;
      Paget's disease lesions after therapy. In this condition, indeed, the usual biological&#xD;
      markers may be unhelpful to assess the efficacy of therapy, because they are usually&#xD;
      comprised in the normal range for single pagetic localizations, even before therapy (2). The&#xD;
      main purpose of this trial is to assess the early and long term response of pagetic bone to&#xD;
      bisphosphonate therapy.&#xD;

      I. Background of the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paget's disease of bone is a condition characterized by a focal exuberant increase in bone&#xD;
      remodeling, resulting in a number of important architectural abnormalities, potentially&#xD;
      leading to bone deformity and bone fragility. This condition may be polyostotic or&#xD;
      monostotic. Biological markers of bone remodeling, mainly alkaline phosphatase and markers of&#xD;
      bone resorption such as urinary hydroxyproline, are commonly utilized to assess Paget's&#xD;
      disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a monostotic Paget's disease is most frequently accompanied by biological markers&#xD;
      still in the normal range (1). Conventional 99mTc MDP bone scan is able to localize the&#xD;
      lesion. However, the changes observed with this technique after therapy and when the disease&#xD;
      recurs do not help much to guide the clinician (3). Indeed, there can be some improvement on&#xD;
      the conventional bone scans whereas on the X-ray films, worsening of the pagetic lesions&#xD;
      might simultaneously be observed (4). The recurrence of the condition could also be missed by&#xD;
      conventional bone scans (4). Therefore, PET scan using 18 Fluoride should by its metabolic&#xD;
      approach be able to demonstrate the local activity of Paget's disease, to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of active drugs and to evidence the local recurrence of the disease, better than the&#xD;
      conventional existing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Experimental approach and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 20 patients suffering from a Paget's disease of bone (polyostotic: n = 6; monostotic: n&#xD;
           = 14) will be studied prior to and after 1, 6, and 12 months of bisphosphonate therapy.&#xD;
           The polyostotic cases will serve to the preliminary feasibility study. A localized&#xD;
           Paget's disease will include isolated Pagetic lesions in bones of the face and or the&#xD;
           skull, the spine and of the (lower or upper) limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Paget's disease confirmed by X rays will be quantified by biological parameters of bone&#xD;
           remodeling: total alkaline phosphatase, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, serum&#xD;
           C-telopeptide (CTX), urinary NTx corrected by creatinine in a morning spot urine after&#xD;
           an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routine biological parameters such as creatinine, full blood count, serum calcium,&#xD;
           phosphate and magnesium, as well as 25OH vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D and iPTH will&#xD;
           also be performed at the start and after therapy. A total duration of 5 years should be&#xD;
           considered for the completion of the whole study. 18 Fluoride will be produced by the&#xD;
           cyclotron, localized in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
           18F-fluoride is produced by the 18O(p,n) 18F nuclear reaction by bombarding an enriched&#xD;
           H218O target with protons. 185 Mbq 18F will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Scans will be performed on a Siemens ECAT HR+ PET scanner. This machine consists of 32&#xD;
           rings of BGO (bismuth germanium oxide) detectors (40.5x43.9x30 mm size) yielding 63&#xD;
           transverse slices (2.425 mm thickness) in a 16.2 cm axial FOV. In 2D mode, the&#xD;
           resolution of the HR+ scanner is typically 5.4 mm and 5.0 mm FWHM at 10 cm in the&#xD;
           transaxial and axial directions, respectively. A dynamic acquisition centered on pagetic&#xD;
           bones will be performed over 60 minutes, starting immediately at tracer injection. Data&#xD;
           will be reconstructed by filtered backprojection and iterative methods, with attenuation&#xD;
           correction obtained from a transmission scan performed before tracer injection. Dynamic&#xD;
           acquisition will allow us to modelize the tracer uptake and calculate the influx&#xD;
           constants by means of multi-compartmental analysis. Kinetic modeling has been shown to&#xD;
           better discriminate between normal, osteoporotic and Pagetic bones (Cook et al, SNM&#xD;
           2001, Toronto) and we assume that small changes in bone metabolism during therapy will&#xD;
           be more precisely assessed by kinetic modeling than by simple semi-quantitative indexes&#xD;
           such as standardized uptake values (SUV). Nevertheless, we will prospectively compare&#xD;
           different models and SUV measurements to further identify the most appropriate&#xD;
           quantification method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective radiation dose equivalent is 0.027 mSv/Mbq 18F-fluoride. Target organ is the&#xD;
      urinary bladder wall (due to the urinary excretion of the unbound fraction of the tracer)&#xD;
      with an estimated radiation dose of 0.25 mGy/MBq.&#xD;
