  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, three-period crossover study to examine the&#xD;
      likeability of a single dose of OROS MPH (CONCERTAÒ 90mg) and a single dose of Long-acting&#xD;
      MPH (RITALIN LAÒ 90mg). Hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: OROS-MPH (CONCERTAÒ) will be later than SODOS-MPH (RITALIN LAÒ) in its Tmax&#xD;
      (time to Cmax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The subjective feelings of detection and likeability would be greater for&#xD;
      SODOS-MPH (RITALIN LAÒ) than for an equivalent total dose of OROS-MPH (CONCERTAÒ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our recent work has suggested that the potential euphoriant risk associated with MPH may be&#xD;
      moderated by the oral delivery system in which a longer delivery system may be safer than the&#xD;
      immediate release one. OROS-MPH's pharmacokinetic profile uses an increasing delivery of MPH&#xD;
      over the day (ascending pharmacokinetic curve). It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID&#xD;
      treatment. Another new long-acting MPH formulation is the spheroidal oral drug absorption&#xD;
      system (SODAS). SODAS-MPH consists of capsules with two types of beads in a 1 to 1 ratio.&#xD;
      Evaluating whether different long acting formulations of MPH will differ in their rate of&#xD;
      onset of MPH action (plasma level) is of high clinical, scientific and public health&#xD;
      relevance. Since the rate of delivery of MPH is a key factor previously associated with&#xD;
      detection and likeability of MPH.&#xD;

             unit, and have used a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least one&#xD;
             month prior to screening and willing to continue use during the study. Medically&#xD;
             acceptable forms of birth control include abstinence, hormonal contraceptives,&#xD;

             determined to be not clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
