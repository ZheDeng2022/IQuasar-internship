      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. The key feature of glaucoma is&#xD;
      damage to the optic nerve head with loss of retinal ganglion cells and local tissue&#xD;
      remodeling. Neuronal cell death in glaucoma occurs by apoptotic mechanisms1. Apoptosis of&#xD;
      neurons also plays a major role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. An association between glaucoma and these disorders has been described&#xD;
      2-4. Furthermore, it has been reported that the olfactory function is disturbed in these&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases5-6. We hypothesize that similar olfactory alterations may occur in&#xD;
      glaucoma which is in fact a local neurodegenerative disease.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Background and rationale of the study Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of&#xD;
                blindness worldwide. The key feature of glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve head&#xD;
                with loss of retinal ganglion cells and local tissue remodeling. Neuronal cell&#xD;
                death in glaucoma occurs by apoptotic mechanisms1. Apoptosis of neurons also plays&#xD;
                a major role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's&#xD;
                disease. An association between glaucoma and these disorders has been described&#xD;
                2-4. Furthermore, it has been reported that the olfactory function is disturbed in&#xD;
                these neurodegenerative diseases5-6. We hypothesize that similar olfactory&#xD;
                alterations may occur in glaucoma which is in fact a local neurodegenerative&#xD;
                disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study objectives Primary Objective: To test the olfactory function in glaucoma&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Investigational plan Chronic glaucoma patients will be assessed regarding&#xD;
                inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinical criteria. A basic otorhinolaryngological&#xD;
                examination addressing the possible exclusion criteria will be performed prior to&#xD;
                the Sniffing Sticks test battery. A simple questionnaire regarding an olfactory&#xD;
                status of the patient will be filled out. The olfactory performance of glaucoma&#xD;
                patients will be compared to the existing age-matched normative database.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Design Single center cohort study, normative database as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Selection of study population&#xD;
&#xD;
                I. Number of subjects Thirty consecutive glaucoma patients, age 18 - 70, will be&#xD;
                recruited from the glaucoma consultation at the University Eye Clinic Basel.&#xD;
&#xD;
                II. Prestudy screening A detailed medical and ophthalmic history will be recorded&#xD;
                and all patients will complete an ophthalmologic examination (best corrected visual&#xD;
                acuity, intraocular pressure measurements, slit-lamp examination, indirect&#xD;
                fundoscopy) as well as an otorhinolaryngological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
                III. Inclusion criteria Diagnosis of chronic open-angle glaucoma will be based on&#xD;
                the presence of typical glaucomatous disc damage and visual field defects. Only&#xD;
                patients with a recent gonioscopic examination and at least two visual field&#xD;
                examinations will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
                IV. Exclusion criteria Occludable iridocorneal angles, a history of current,&#xD;
                chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease, a history of retinal or&#xD;
                neuroophthalmologic disease that could result in visual field defects, need for any&#xD;
                concomitant medications that may interfere with the evaluation of olfactory&#xD;
                function, a history of past or active alcohol or drug abuse, smoking, a history of&#xD;
                olfactory disturbance related to identifiable local factors, and any local&#xD;
                condition that could lead to hyposmia/anosmia or interfere with the olfactory&#xD;
                function, such as polyps, chronic sinus infection, sub(acute) viral or bacterial&#xD;
                infection, history of sinus surgery, will be considered as an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                V. Study medication NA&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Study protocol I. General restrictions on subjects NA&#xD;
&#xD;
                II. Dietary restriction NA.&#xD;
&#xD;
                III. Description of study days On the experimental day a detailed history will be&#xD;
                taken and a complete ophthalmologic examination including best corrected visual&#xD;
                acuity, slit-lamp examination, indirect fundoscopy, and intraocular pressure&#xD;
                measurement will be performed (KG). Based on these examinations and chart data, the&#xD;
                patient shall be classified as glaucoma patient. A basic otorhinolaryngological&#xD;
                screening examination will follow, the patient will fill an olfactory questionnaire&#xD;
                and the Sniffing Sticks test battery will be performed (AWL).&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Efficacy variables I. Outcome variables Odor threshold score (0-16), odor&#xD;
                discrimination task score (0-16), Odor identification score (0-16), composite score&#xD;
                (sum of the three above).&#xD;
&#xD;
           II. Follow-up safety investigations NA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods of evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Sniffing Sticks test battery7 Commercially available felt-tip pens, 14 cm long and&#xD;
           with an inner diameter of 1.3 cm, are filled with 4 mL of liquid odorants or odorants&#xD;
           dissolved in propylene glycol. For odor presentation the cap is removed by the&#xD;
           experimenter for approximately 3 seconds and the pen's tip is placed 2 cm in front of&#xD;
           the examined nostril. Three tests are performed. Odor threshold for n-butanol is&#xD;
           assessed using a single-staircase, triple-forced choice procedure. Sixteen dilutions are&#xD;
           prepared. Three pens are presented at randomized order, with two containing only the&#xD;
           solvent. The patient's task is to identify the odor-containing pen. The score ranges&#xD;
           from 0 to 16. In the odor-discrimination test, the patient has to determine which of the&#xD;
           three presented pens smell differently. A total of 16 triplets is presented to the&#xD;
           patient, and thus the score ranges from 0 to 16. Odor identification is assessed by&#xD;
           means of 16 common odors, using a multiple choice technique with a list of four&#xD;
           descriptors. The score ranges also from 0 to 16. The composite score is the sum of three&#xD;
           scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Biometric methods Mann-Whitney U-test, p&lt;0.05 being considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Statistical model Olfactory scores of glaucoma patients will be compared to the&#xD;
                age-matched normative database by means of Mann-Whitney U-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Study power No power calculations were performed, as there are no prior pilot&#xD;
                studies.&#xD;
