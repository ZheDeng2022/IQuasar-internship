  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the side-effect profile and efficacy of sustained&#xD;
      release, OROS® and TTS, dosage forms of oxybutynin with immediate release (IR) oral&#xD;
      oxybutynin and with placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) refers to the involuntary loss of urine in sufficient amounts to be&#xD;
      considered a social or health problem. While it is a psychologically distressing and socially&#xD;
      disruptive, UI is believed to be an under reported and under diagnosed medical condition.&#xD;
      This is a Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study&#xD;
      with 1 week of single-blinded placebo run-in. Patients will be randomized to 6 weeks&#xD;
      double-blind treatment with oxybutynin or placebo. The primary hypothesis to be tested in&#xD;
      this study is that the treatment difference in the change in incontinence episodes per week&#xD;
      after 6 weeks of treatment in the double-blind phase between individual oxybutynin-treated&#xD;
      group and combined placebo group is equal to zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive oral OROS® containing oxybutynin, immediate release oral oxybutynin&#xD;
      (1.7 or 2.5 mg) or TTS oxybutynin (60 cm2) daily for 7 weeks.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women, aged 40 years or older, with screening PUD demonstrating an average urinary&#xD;
             frequency of 10 per 24 hours and urge incontinence episodes ³10 times per week and £&#xD;
             60 times per week, and CMG demonstrating detrusor contraction and/or severe &quot;must&#xD;
             void&quot; urge (score = 2) at a bladder filling volume of less than or equal to 400 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with mixed incontinence provided that symptoms and/or signs of stress&#xD;
             incontinence are not the predominant manifestation of UI and urge incontinence&#xD;
             episodes associated with urgency can be differentiated from urge incontinence episodes&#xD;
             not associated with urgency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are mentally intact and capable of understanding and following the study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each patient must be determined to be in good general health prior to study&#xD;
             participation. The evaluation will be based on the medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical examination (general, genital, pelvic, rectal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory tests including blood chemistry profile (glucose, blood urea nitrogen, uric&#xD;
             acid, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, total bilirubin,&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate&#xD;
             dehydrogenase, sodium, potassium, creatinine, bicarbonate and chloride)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinalysis with microscopic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  And electrocardiogram (EKG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (Ccr) will be estimated as 0.85 x (140-Age) x (body weight in Kg)&#xD;
             ¸ (72 x serum creatinine in mg/dl). The estimated Ccr must be greater than 50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normotensive with supine blood pressure between the range of 100 - 140 mm Hg systolic&#xD;
             and 65-90 mm Hg diastolic, and no clinically significant postural hypotension 30&#xD;
             seconds and 2 minutes after standing. If patients are taking antihypertensive&#xD;
             medications (may include calcium channel blockers but not undissolvable dosage forms),&#xD;
             they must be normotensive on their antihypertensive medications. Patients should be on&#xD;
             a stable dose of antihypertensive medications for at least 90 days before screening&#xD;
             for the study and there should be no plan to change the dose of antihypertensive&#xD;
             medications during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-menopausal women must be using a medically acceptable and effective birth control&#xD;
             method (birth control pills or implants, IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, condoms with&#xD;
             spermicide or spermicide-containing sponges) and have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with positive urine cultures at screening may be treated with antibiotics and&#xD;
             if urine cultures are negative following treatment and if the patient has been off&#xD;
             antibiotics for a period of one week these patients may be rescreened. The patient's&#xD;
             urine cultures should be negative before the patient begins recording the screening&#xD;
             urinary diary and before the CMG&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
