      Vasoactivity of topical drugs may be of prognostic relevance in glaucoma. There is very&#xD;
      little information for a major class, the prostaglandin analogues with regard to this aspect.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of travoprost 0.004% and latanoprost&#xD;
      0.005% on choroidal blood flow and retinal vascular diameter in glaucoma patients. After&#xD;
      washout of current topical medication, intraocular pressure (IOP) in both eyes (Goldmann&#xD;
      applanation tonometry), choroidal blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) and retinal vessel&#xD;
      diameter (Retinal Vessel Analyzer) in one randomly selected eye will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      after two weeks and after 4 weeks of treatment with travoprost or latanoprost QD, in a&#xD;
      randomized, double masked 2-way cross-over study in 20 open angle glaucoma patients.&#xD;

      Background Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Chronic primary open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma is the most common form among Caucasian patients. The key feature of glaucoma is&#xD;
      damage to the optic nerve head, which is not necessarily related to an increase in&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP). The actual therapeutic armamentarium for glaucoma includes&#xD;
      miotics, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, oral and topical carbonic anhydrase&#xD;
      inhibitors, and prostaglandin analogues, the latter being the latest addition to the&#xD;
      armamentarium and the most potent topical IOP lowering drugs. Besides IOP, ocular blood flow&#xD;
      alterations have been incriminated in glaucoma. Hence, it is of relevance to assess the&#xD;
      effect of anti-glaucomatous drugs on ocular blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study Vasoactivity of topical drugs may be of prognostic relevance in&#xD;
      glaucoma. There is very little information for a major class, the prostaglandin analogues&#xD;
      with regard to this aspect. The vascular activity of two prostaglandin analogues, travoprost&#xD;
      0.004% and latanoprost 0.005%, which are already on the Swiss market, will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives Primary Objective: To assess the effect of two prostaglandin analogues,&#xD;
      travoprost 0.004% and latanoprost 0.005% on choroidal blood flow in primary open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To assess the effect of travoprost 0.004% and latanoprost 0.005% on&#xD;
      retinal vascular diameter in primary open-angle glaucoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational plan Primary open-angle-glaucoma patients will be assessed regarding&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. After a washout of current topical medication (beta-blockers&#xD;
      and prostaglandin analogues: 4 weeks; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and&#xD;
      alpha-agonists: 2 weeks; Pilocarpine: 1 week), half of the patients (17 patients) will be&#xD;
      treated with travoprost 0.004% for 1 month while the other 17 patients will be treated with&#xD;
      latanoprost 0.005% for the same duration. Efficacy and safety variables will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 1 month of treatment. After this first period, the&#xD;
      patients will be washed out for 4 weeks and baseline efficacy and safety parameters will be&#xD;
      obtained. Afterwards, the patients will be treated with the other compound. Again, efficacy&#xD;
      and safety variables will be assessed after 2 weeks and after 1 month of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Single center, randomized, double masked 2-way cross-over design. Randomization The&#xD;
      patients will be divided in two groups, and each group will alternatively be started with&#xD;
      either travoprost 0.004% or latanoprost 0.005%. Recruitment and management will be carried&#xD;
      out by a study nurse masked to baseline blood flow measurement results. Masking and&#xD;
      randomization procedures will be entrusted to Alcon PHARMACEUTICAL AG. The drug products for&#xD;
      this study will be prepared by the following procedure: Each product will be labeled during&#xD;
      independent labeling operations. For this study four different products will have to be&#xD;
      labeled: travatan medicin A, travatan medicin B, xalatan medicin A and xalatan medicin B.&#xD;
      Each labeling operation will start and end with a line clearance procedure and each labeling&#xD;
      order will be 100% inspected by a person that is independent from the person who will do the&#xD;
      labeling. On each label the patient number will indicated. The labeling order will be&#xD;
      initiated by using the randomization list that indicates which product has to be labeled for&#xD;
      which patient. The randomization sequence will be pulled from a uniform distribution with an&#xD;
      arbitrary seed (Randomization Performed with SAS 8.2 on NT using RANUNI [seed]). During each&#xD;
      independent labeling operation also the disclosure labels will be provided with the same&#xD;
      patient number than indicated on the open label. After release of each independent labeling&#xD;
      procedure, the assembly of the packaging of two carton boxes in an assembly carton box will&#xD;
      start for each patient. The assembly box will also be also labeled with patient&#xD;
      number/investigator number and protocol number. Release of the labeled samples will always be&#xD;
      done by an independent QA department.&#xD;
