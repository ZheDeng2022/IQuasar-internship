  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of treatment with nitazoxanide vs.&#xD;
      vancomycin for diarrheal disease due to Clostridium difficile in patients who have failed&#xD;
      previous treatment with metronidazole.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrheal disease associated with&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. This is a debilitating condition with substantial morbidity and a&#xD;
      mortality that used to be said to be around 2-3%, but that has recently been shown by us&#xD;
      (Clin Infect. Dis, July, 2005) and others (Pepin et al, Clin. Infect. Dis., July, 2005) to be&#xD;
      substantially higher -- approximately 15-20%. There has been an enormous increase in this&#xD;
      disease at the VA medical center during the past two years, just as has occurred at other&#xD;
      hospitals throughout the United States and the developed world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although orally administered vancomycin was the first drug to be approved in treating C.&#xD;
      difficile colitis, and remains the only one with the official approval by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration, the currently recommended therapy for this condition is metronidazole, given&#xD;
      orally. This drug was recommended because: (1) the cost of vancomycin was exceedingly high;&#xD;
      (2) there was concern that vancomycin-resistant bacteria might appear in hospitals if the&#xD;
      drug was used to treat large number of patients; and (3) these recommendations were made at a&#xD;
      time that the cure rate from metronidazole was thought to approach 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently shown that 23% of patients fail to respond to initial therapy with&#xD;
      metronidazole, and another 27% relapse after treatment (Musher et al, Clin Infect Dis, July,&#xD;
      2005). Others have confirmed these observations (Pepin et al, Clin Infect Dis, July 2005).&#xD;
      The options for treating failure or relapse are limited. Another course of metronidazole may&#xD;
      cure about one-half of patients. Oral vancomycin may be used, but this drug also has a&#xD;
      failure rate of 10-20% and the concerns about its use remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this background, we became interested in studying nitazoxanide. This is an FDA&#xD;
      approved drug, marketed in the United States and widely used throughout the world to treat&#xD;
      parasitic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract; several million children have been treated&#xD;
      with this drug during the past decade. The drug acts by interfering with anaerobic metabolic&#xD;
      pathways, and it has been shown to have excellent in vitro activity against C. difficile. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that this drug was both safe and effective as an alternative in patients who&#xD;
      have diarrheal disease caused by C. difficile. The IRB approved a double-blind protocol to&#xD;
      compare metronidazole with nitazoxanide, and we have completed that trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study were very favorable. A 10-day course of oral nitazoxanide produced&#xD;
      a cure of symptoms at 7 days of about 90% and a cure without relapse at 31 days of about 79%&#xD;
      compared to 84% and 56%, respectively, for metronidazole. Because of the small numbers of&#xD;
      subjects, these differences were not statistically significant, but the results certainly&#xD;
      appeared promising. A manuscript has just been submitted to Clin Infect Dis describing this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now propose to compare nitazoxanide to vancomycin in the group of patients most in need of&#xD;
      alternative therapy, namely those who have been treated with metronidazole and have failed or&#xD;
      have had a recurrence of disease after an initial response.&#xD;
