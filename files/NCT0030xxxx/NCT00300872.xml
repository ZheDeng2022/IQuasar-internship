  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) briefly means cessation of breathing during sleep at least 5&#xD;
      times per hour. SDB is a common disorder affecting 9 to 24% of the middle-aged and overall 4%&#xD;
      of the middle-aged male population suffers from the Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA)&#xD;
      i.e. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) with associated daytime sleepiness. Several major&#xD;
      epidemiological studies have shown that SDB is not only an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      hypertension but it is also strongly associated with heart failure and stroke. The mechanism&#xD;
      for the linkage between SDB and cardiovascular consequences is not fully determined. Vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a soluble 34-46 kD angiogenic heparin-binding&#xD;
      glycoprotein. This cytokine regulates multiple endothelial cell functions including vascular&#xD;
      permeability and vascular tone and some data suggest that it may contribute to the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic process. Recent studies have shown increased plasma and serum concentrations&#xD;
      of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with OSA and there were correlations&#xD;
      between VEGF concentrations and the severity of OSA, as indexed by the minimum oxygen&#xD;
      saturation level and the frequency of the upper airway obstruction per hour of sleep. A&#xD;
      recent non-randomized study with a small sample size has shown a significant decrease in&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in patients in whom nocturnal&#xD;
      hypoxia improved after 1 year of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite robust evidence showing improvement of symptoms, cognitive function and quality of&#xD;
      life in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients treated with nasal CPAP, there are&#xD;
      nevertheless conflicting data whether Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can reduce&#xD;
      daytime blood pressure (BP) in patients with OSA. Two randomized placebo controlled studies&#xD;
      have shown reduction of 24-hr systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA) patients after 1 month of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      therapy while other investigators have shown no such benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, sham-placebo controlled study aims to assess 1) the effect of nasal&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) over a period of 3 months on 24 hr blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP); and 2) whether any change in BP and plasma Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is&#xD;
      related to the baseline severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) compliance.&#xD;

      Subjects and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to carry out a prospective, randomized sham placebo-controlled parallel study on&#xD;
      140 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with OSA, as defined by overnight sleep study&#xD;
      showing apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;10 per hour of sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness or&#xD;
      two of the following symptoms: choking or gasping during sleep, recurrent awakenings from&#xD;
      sleep, unrefreshed sleep, daytime fatigue and impaired concentration.1 The patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Respiratory Clinic, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, HK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) [Healthdyne Alice 4, USA] will be performed for&#xD;
      every subject on the first night recording electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, submental&#xD;
      electromyogram, bilateral anterior tibial electromyogram, electrocardiogram, chest and&#xD;
      abdominal wall movement by inductance plethysmography, airflow measured by a nasal pressure&#xD;
      transducer [PTAF2, Pro-Tech, Woodinville, WA, USA]and supplemented by an oral thermister, and&#xD;
      finger pulse oximetry as in our previous studies.2-4 Sleep stages will be scored according to&#xD;
      standard criteria by Rechtshaffen and Kales. 5 Apnoea is defined as cessation of airflow for&#xD;
      &gt; 10 seconds and hypopnea as a reduction of airflow of &gt;50% for &gt; 10 seconds plus an oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation of &gt; 3% or an arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) from the&#xD;
      overnight sleep study with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;10/hr, each patient will be&#xD;
      interviewed by the physician on duty and randomized into 2 groups receiving either nasal&#xD;
      therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment or sham continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP), via a balanced block design, after completion of recording of 24 hr&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure (BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring(ABPM):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) will be fitted with the Ultralite Ambulatory&#xD;
      Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) (Spacelabs Medical, Redmond, WA) via an arm cuff as&#xD;
      out-patients during normal activities and monitored for 48 hrs prior to commencement of&#xD;
      therapeutic or sham continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. The patients' arm&#xD;
      circumference will be measured at the biceps level and an appropriate sized arm cuff will be&#xD;
      applied. The machine will be programmed for cuff inflation measurement every 30 minutes for&#xD;
      48 hrs and can only be removed for bathing. Patients will be asked to abstain from&#xD;
      caffeine-containing products during this time but to continue their normal daily activities.&#xD;
      Patients will record the time they retire to bed and the subsequent time of waking in order&#xD;
      to identify the sleep period. Data gathered before 6pm on the second evening will be&#xD;
      discarded to allow for acclimatization and the analysis will be performed with the second 24&#xD;
      hr of data (6pm to 6am).6 Data will be manually checked for artifact by our respiratory&#xD;
      fellow, who will be blinded to the treatment status of the patient. Forty-eight hrs before&#xD;
      the end of the therapeutic or sham continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 3 months,&#xD;
      the patients will be fitted with the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring(ABPM) machine and&#xD;
      the same procedure repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of blood samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen ml of fasting venous blood will be taken from each patient after the overnight PSG.&#xD;
      Plasma will be separated within 2 hours in a refrigerated centrifuge, aliquoted and stored at&#xD;
      -70C until assayed. Plasma VEGF will be measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay&#xD;
      technique using a commercially available kit (R &amp; D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Serum lipids will&#xD;
      be checked as it has been reported that Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also&#xD;
      increases in patients with hyperlipidemia, with and without atherosclerosis.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) vs Sham placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or sham continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment arm will be offered a 30-minute daytime trial of&#xD;
      nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. Each patient will be given a&#xD;
      basic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) education program by our respiratory nurse&#xD;
      supplemented by education brochure.4 The nurse will fit a comfortable continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) mask from a wide range of selection for the patient, who will then be&#xD;
      given a short trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy with the Autoset&#xD;
      (Resmed, Sydney, Australia) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device for those in&#xD;
      the therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) arm for approximately 30 minutes&#xD;
      for acclimatization in the afternoon. Attended continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      titration will be performed with the Autoset auto-titrating device on the second night of the&#xD;
      PSG study for the group randomized to the therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) arm.2-4 All the patients in the therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      arm will be prescribed the Horizon LT 8001 continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device&#xD;
      (De Vilbiss, Somerset, PA, USA) with a time counter recording machine run time. The&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressure for each patient will be set at the&#xD;
      minimum pressure needed to abolish snoring, obstructive respiratory events and airflow&#xD;
      limitation for 95% of the night as determined by the overnight Autoset continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) titration study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients randomized to the subtherapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) arm&#xD;
      will have the CPAP units set to the lowest pressure (4 cm of water pressure) and 6 extra 4mm&#xD;
      holes will be inserted in the collar of the main tubing at the end of the mask to allow air&#xD;
      escape and to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing.8,9 They will be given a trial of 30 minutes&#xD;
      for acclimatization before starting continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients in each arm will be followed up at the Respiratory clinic separately at 1&#xD;
      month and 3 months and the objective continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance&#xD;
      will be measured from the time counter. Although the 2 different treatment arms are explained&#xD;
      in the patient information, the patients will not be aware of whether they are receiving&#xD;
      therapeutic or sham continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The research nurse&#xD;
      responsible for randomization of patients to different treatment arms will not participate in&#xD;
      outcome assessments, which will be conducted by a different team of nurses who are not aware&#xD;
      of the randomization status of the patients.9 At the end of the study (ie 3 months), all&#xD;
      patients in the subtherapeutic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) arm will be&#xD;
      readmitted for AutoSet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration to establish&#xD;
      their long-term therapeutic pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to commencement of nasal therapeutic or sham continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP), all patients have to go through several measurements. These include assessment of&#xD;
      subjective sleepiness with the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)10, quality of life with the&#xD;
      Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI).11 The ESS is a questionnaire specific to&#xD;
      symptoms of daytime sleepiness and the patients are asked to score the likelihood of falling&#xD;
      asleep in eight different situations with different levels of stimulation, adding up to a&#xD;
      total score of 0 to 24.10 The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) has 35&#xD;
      questions organized into four domains: daily functioning, social interactions, emotional&#xD;
      functioning and symptoms with a fifth domain, treatment-related symptoms, to record the&#xD;
      possible negative impacts of treatment. The Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) has a&#xD;
      high degree of internal consistency, face validity as judged by content experts and patients&#xD;
      and construct validity as shown by its positive correlations with the Short Form-36 Health&#xD;
      Survey questionnaire (SF-36) and the improvement in scores in patients successfully&#xD;
      completing a 4 weeks' trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).11 It contains&#xD;
      items shown to be important to patients with sleep apnea and is designed as a measure of&#xD;
      outcome in clinical trials in sleep apnea, and has been applied previously in our Chinese&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 4 All&#xD;
      patients will have to complete the Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and Sleep Apnea Quality of&#xD;
      Life Index (SAQLI) at baseline, 1 month and 3 months after treatment.&#xD;
