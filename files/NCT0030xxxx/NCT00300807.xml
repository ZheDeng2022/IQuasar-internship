      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and virologic activity of&#xD;
      escalating single and multiple doses of XTL6865, a mixture (1:1) of two human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (HCV-AbXTL68 and HCV-AbXTL65), in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of XTL6865 in the&#xD;
      presence and absence of viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center design of&#xD;
      ascending single doses in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In&#xD;
      addition to Placebo, the following XTL6865 doses will be administered: 5 mg, 20 mg, 75 mg,&#xD;
      250 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg, and 2400 mg. No patient will be enrolled in more than one dose&#xD;
      level. At each dose level, 3 patients will receive XTL6865 and 1 patient will receive the&#xD;
      Placebo. After the single dose infusion, the patients will be followed for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If certain criteria are met and the safety review of the 1200 mg dose cohort data determines&#xD;
      that XTL6865 was safely administered and tolerated at that dose level, the patients in the&#xD;
      600 mg and 1200 mg dose levels are eligible for the multiple dosing phase. Infusions of 600&#xD;
      mgs will be given to 4 eligible patients, one infusion per day, for 5 days. One patient will&#xD;
      receive Placebo and 3 patients will receive XTL6865 600 mg. The patients will be followed for&#xD;
      6 additional weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If certain criteria are not met, the 2400 mg dose cohort will be infused. After the safety&#xD;
      review has determined that XTL6865 was safely administered and tolerated, the patients in the&#xD;
      1200 mg and 2400 mg dose levels are eligible for the multiple dosing phase. Infusions of 1200&#xD;
      mgs will be given to 4 eligible patients, one infusion per day, for 5 days. One patients will&#xD;
      receive Placebo and 3 patients will receive XTL6865 1200 mg. The patients will be followed&#xD;
      for 6 additional weeks.&#xD;

             state, patients should be able to delay administration of prescribed anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             medicine for several hours without anticipating undue risk of medically significant&#xD;
             increases in blood pressure. Patient should be on a stable anti-hypertensive regime&#xD;
