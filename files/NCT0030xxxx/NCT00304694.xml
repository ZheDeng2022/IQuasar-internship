      18F-FDG PET, a whole-body imaging technology based on glucose metabolism, can effectively&#xD;
      detect subclinical and clinical therapeutic responses at stages that are earlier than those&#xD;
      detected by conventional approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a prospective study to evaluate therapeutic response using 18F-FDG PET&#xD;
      before and after induction chemotherapy for locally advanced NPC patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In order to improve locoregional control and to eradicate micrometastases for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), induction chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the preferred therapeutic approach.Although it would be&#xD;
      of great advantage to identify non-responder during or immediately after therapy to formulate&#xD;
      an alternative treatment strategy, non-invasive methods for early evaluation of therapeutic&#xD;
      response for advanced NPC patients have not been fully evaluated. Decrease of tumor volume in&#xD;
      anatomical images and relief of symptoms in clinical follow-up have been used in many&#xD;
      conventional approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. However, an effective&#xD;
      therapy could very well have resulted in early subclinical alterations in tumor physiology&#xD;
      and biochemistry. These alterations may have occurred long before changes in the tumor mass&#xD;
      become apparent. Thus therapeutic effect may not be assessed accurately using the&#xD;
      conventional anatomical imaging studies, such as CT and MRI.Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET, a whole-body imaging technology based on glucose metabolism, can effectively&#xD;
      detect subclinical and clinical therapeutic responses at stages that are earlier than those&#xD;
      detected by conventional approaches.We therefore propose to conduct a prospective study to&#xD;
      evaluate therapeutic response using 18F-FDG PET before and after induction chemotherapy for&#xD;
      locally advanced NPC patients.&#xD;
