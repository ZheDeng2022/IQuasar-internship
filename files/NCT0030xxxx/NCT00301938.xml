  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 7-hydroxystaurosporine when&#xD;
      given together with perifosine in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute&#xD;
      leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. 7-Hydroxystaurosporine&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as perifosine, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving&#xD;
      7-hydroxystaurosporine together with perifosine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Define the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of UCN-01&#xD;
      (7-hydroxystaurosporine) administered after perifosine in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or high risk myelodysplastic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of UCN-01 administered after perifosine in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of perifosine administered after UCN-01 in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Document responses in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Observe the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of both perifosine and UCN-01 when administered in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study the pharmacodynamics of perifosine alone, UCN-01 alone, and in combination in&#xD;
      leukemic blast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of 7-hydroxystaurosporine. The first&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the study are assigned to arm 1. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      is determined in arm 1, subsequent patients are enrolled in arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine every 6 hours on day 1 followed by&#xD;
      a maintenance dose once daily on days 2-28 of course 1 and then once daily on days 1-28 in&#xD;
      all subsequent courses. Patients also receive 7-hydroxystaurosporine intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      3 hours on day 4. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 7-hydroxystaurosporine&#xD;
      until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive 7-hydroxystaurosporine IV over 3 hours on day 1 at the MTD determined&#xD;
      in group I. Patients also receive oral perifosine as a loading dose every 6 hours on day 4&#xD;
      followed by a maintenance dose once daily on days 5-28 of course 1 and then once daily on&#xD;
      days 1-28 in all subsequent courses. In both groups, treatment repeats every 28 days for â‰¥ 2&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve&#xD;
      a complete remission (CR) or a CR with incomplete hematologic recovery receive 4 additional&#xD;
      courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients who achieve a partial remission or hematologic&#xD;
      improvement may continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then periodically&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
