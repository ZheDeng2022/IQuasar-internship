      This is a multi-center, open label, uncontrolled, non-comparative phase I/II study in&#xD;
      patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma who are eligible for second, third, or&#xD;
      fourth line therapy. Patients will be enrolled sequentially into four dose cohorts. The&#xD;
      feasibility of administrating Revlimid (R) in combination with Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone&#xD;
      (AD) and the MTD of the combination will be determined in the phase I part of the study (Part&#xD;
      A). When the MTD has been established, the efficacy of the combination will be further&#xD;
      evaluated in the phase II part of the study Part B)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease that is characterized by the malignant proliferation&#xD;
      of plasma cells. It is the second most common hematological malignancy, is invariable fatal.&#xD;
      The primary approach for treatment of multiple myeloma is systemic chemotherapy. Conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy with melphalan and prednisone (MP) has increased the survival from 12-17 months&#xD;
      to approximately 3 years. But several other studies have shown that combination therapy with&#xD;
      addition of other agents such as cyclophosphamide, nitroureas or anthracyclins does not&#xD;
      improve the prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma. During the past few years it has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation can prolong the overall survival of myeloma patients and therefore became the&#xD;
      standard of care for younger patients. Since it has been demonstrated that high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy is also well tolerated by the elderly high dose chemotherapy is recommended for&#xD;
      patients up to an age of about 70 if there is no relevant comorbidity. Thus, the development&#xD;
      of more effective regimens for the teatment of relapsed or refractory myeloma patients is&#xD;
      urgently needed. Treatment with corticosteroids alone can induce responses in both primarily&#xD;
      resistant and relapsed patients with myeloma. High pulse dexamethasone (40mg daily d1-4, 9-12&#xD;
      and 17-21) showed response rates of 27% in primarily unresponsive patients and 21% in&#xD;
      relapsed patients, which were initially responsive. In combination with anthracyclins like in&#xD;
      the VAD-regimen (vincristin, adriamycin, dexamethasone)response rates of about 31% were&#xD;
      achieved in primary unresponsive patients whereas the response rate was 65% in patients who&#xD;
      relapsed, but had previously responded to therapy. Thus, the combination of dexamethasone&#xD;
      with anthracyclines and vincristin achieve a certain anti-myeloma activity in relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory patients. Nevertheless due to the neurotoxicity, treatment with vincristin of&#xD;
      elderly patients is critical and limited. Therefore substitution of vincristine by a less&#xD;
      toxic agent with high anti-myeloma activity like the new thalidomide analogues (see below)&#xD;
      could reduce toxicity and improve the therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline and dexamethasone&#xD;
      containing regimens. Protocol DSMM VII Page 7/52 29.09.2004 Version 1.1 dexamethasone&#xD;
      containing regimens. One interesting drug with substantial anti-myeloma activity in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory myeloma is thalidomide. Thalidomide has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      induce remissions in about one third of relapsed myeloma patients if given as a single agent&#xD;
      therapy. Response rates evaluated in phase-II studies could be improved up to 55% if&#xD;
      thalidomide was administered in combination with other drugs such as glucocorticoids. However&#xD;
      substantial side effects were observed such as somnolence, constipation and neuropathy. These&#xD;
      observations led to development of derivatives of thalidomide in order to reduce toxicity and&#xD;
      to improve efficacy. The thalidomide analogues represent a new class of active drugs based on&#xD;
      immunmodulatory and direct anti-myeloma effects which have been demonstrated to have a&#xD;
      greater potency to inhibit growth of MM and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo than&#xD;
      thalidomide. In a phase I study heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      myeloma were treated with CC-5013 (RevlimidTM, lenalidomide). Revlimid at doses up to 25&#xD;
      mg/day was safe and well tolerated. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was myelosupression at a&#xD;
      dose level of 50 mg/day. In contrast to thalidomide treatment with CC- 5013 showed no&#xD;
      significant side effects like somnolence, constipation or neuropathy. In addition 29 % of the&#xD;
      subjects achieved a &gt; 50% paraprotein reduction, 71% a reduction of &gt; 25%. Preliminary phase&#xD;
      II data showed in about 20 % of relapsed myeloma patients a &gt; 50% reduction of paraprotein, a&#xD;
      &gt; 25% reduction could be observed in about 50%. No additional toxicity was observed in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone. Thus, Revlimid as a single agent is well tolerated and has a&#xD;
      profound anti-myeloma activity in patients with refractory or relapsed disease. These data&#xD;
      suggest that Revlimid combined with chemotherapy could lead to enhanced anti-myeloma effects&#xD;
      with acceptable toxicities. The present study will investigate the safety and the efficacy of&#xD;
      intermittent dosing of CC-5013 (Revlimid) combined with Dexamethasone and Doxorubicin in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed or refractory myeloma. Objectives Primary Objectives&#xD;
