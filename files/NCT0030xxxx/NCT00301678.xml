      RATIONALE: Decreasing the amount of fat in the diet and increasing fruit, vegetable, and&#xD;
      fiber intake may help prevent some types of cancer. Giving participants easy-to-read&#xD;
      personalized written nutrition materials and a personalized videotape may help improve eating&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well personalized nutrition education improves&#xD;
      the eating habits of healthy participants who eat an unhealthy diet.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and test an innovative intervention (tailored &quot;take-home&quot; video tapes with&#xD;
           accompanying low literacy tailored written materials) to help participants improve their&#xD;
           eating habits, particularly decreasing fat and increasing fiber, fruit, and vegetable&#xD;
           intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the above approach with work sites using&#xD;
           process measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of this approach in&#xD;
           achieving dietary change relevant to cancer prevention, as compared to written tailored&#xD;
           materials only or usual care materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the differential costs of the above educational approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study cognitive/behavioral (psychosocial) factors associated with decreasing fat and&#xD;
           increasing fruit and vegetable consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition education materials will be mailed out in 3 different sets and will vary depending&#xD;
      on which of three experimental conditions the company is assigned. The groups are:&#xD;
      Non-Tailored Written (NT), Tailored Written (TW) , or Tailored Written and Video (TV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (non-tailored written): Employee receives three sets of written information on&#xD;
           nutrition and other health topics by mail. Upon completion of th study, participants in&#xD;
           this group will receive a packet of written nutrition materials similar to what the&#xD;
           other study groups received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (tailored written): Employee receives three sets of tailored written nutrition&#xD;
           materials in the mail. These written materials will be designed especially for each&#xD;
           employee. They will be based on their answers to the first telephone survey, and from&#xD;
           two later brief sets of questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (tailored written and video): Employee receives three sets of written nutrition&#xD;
           materials and three videos or DVDs in the mail. The written materials and the video/DVD&#xD;
           will be designed especially for each employee. They will be based on their answers to&#xD;
           the first telephone survey and from two later brief sets of questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants receive booster intervention materials by mail at 2 and 4 months after&#xD;
      baseline, following the same procedures as before. Participants receive follow-up telephone&#xD;
      calls at 4 and 8 months after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,520 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
