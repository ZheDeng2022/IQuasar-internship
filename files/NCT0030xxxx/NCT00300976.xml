      (Intervention study) The objective of the study is to confirm the superiority of the&#xD;
      intensive therapy to the conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or&#xD;
      exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus (DM) by a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study in patients with type 2 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Follow-up study) The objective of the follow-up study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy&#xD;
      of intensive versus conventional therapy in the effect on mortality and the prevention of the&#xD;
      incidence or exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus through a&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up research conducted after the multi-center, open-label, randomized&#xD;
      parallel-group study comparing the efficacy of intensive versus conventional therapy in type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients.&#xD;

      intensive therapy to the conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or&#xD;
      exacerbation of vascular complications caused by diabetes mellitus by a randomized controlled&#xD;
      study in patients with type 2 DM. The primary outcome measure is occurrence of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, coronary bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke,&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy, percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty, carotid artery&#xD;
      stenting, or death.&#xD;

      parallel-group study comparing the efficacy of intensive versus conventional therapy in type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients. The primary endpoint is identical to that in the intervention study. In&#xD;
      addition, overall survivalall-cause mortality will be evaluated as a key secondary endpoint.&#xD;

        completion or discontinuation from the randomized controlled study (If the subject is&#xD;
