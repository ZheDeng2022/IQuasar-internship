  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of different amounts of phosphorus in&#xD;
      the diet on hormones that control phosphorus and bone health both in people who are healthy&#xD;
      and in ones who have moderate kidney disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease affects 11% of the US population; over half of those affected have&#xD;
      skeletal manifestations of their renal disease. Renal osteodystrophy is a complex disease, in&#xD;
      which multiple mineral systems and related hormones play a role, including phosphate&#xD;
      homeostasis. Phosphate regulation primarily depends on renal handling of phosphate, which is&#xD;
      partly controlled by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. However, other mediators in this&#xD;
      system clearly exist. Recently, evidence has been accruing that one such factor may be FGF23,&#xD;
      a protein produced by osteogenic cells. States of excess FGF23 are associated with marked&#xD;
      phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and inappropriately low calcitriol. FGF23&#xD;
      levels are measurable in healthy humans and markedly elevated in patients who require&#xD;
      hemodialysis, although its physiologic role in either state is unknown. Some retrospective&#xD;
      evidence suggests that FGF23 is affected by phosphate intake. We are performing a study to&#xD;
      gather data describing the response of FGF23 to changes in dietary phosphorus intake in&#xD;
      healthy men and women and in men and women with moderate renal insufficiency. The specific&#xD;
      aims of this pilot study are: 1) To examine the physiologic effects of alterations in dietary&#xD;
      phosphorus on FGF23 in healthy subjects; 2) To examine the physiologic response of FGF23 to&#xD;
      dietary phosphorus alterations in patients with moderate renal failure; and 3) To assess&#xD;
      whether serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D vary inversely with those of FGF23 when&#xD;
      dietary phosphate is changed. The proposed research plan is a dietary intervention trial in&#xD;
      which we will study the response of serum FGF23 levels to diets with varying phosphorus&#xD;
      contents in healthy adults and adults with moderate renal insufficiency.&#xD;
