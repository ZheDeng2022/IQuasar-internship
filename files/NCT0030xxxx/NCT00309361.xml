  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, blinded, controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and safety of NV-101 administered as a submucosal&#xD;
      injection following completion of a restorative or periodontal maintenance procedure&#xD;
      requiring local anesthesia with an agent containing a vasoconstrictor. Local vasodilation&#xD;
      that results in more rapid clearance of the anesthetic is the proposed mechanism of action.&#xD;

             injections) or use of nitrous oxide or sedatives to perform the scheduled dental&#xD;
             procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled dental procedure takes greater than 60 minutes to complete&#xD;
