  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alport syndrome (AS) represents a form of progressive hereditary nephritis in which the&#xD;
      genetic defect resides in the synthesis of one of several subunits of type IV collagen, the&#xD;
      predominant constituent of basement membranes in renal glomeruli. Renal impairment occurs&#xD;
      with time and severe renal failure with hypertension and uremia represent the end stage of&#xD;
      the disease, even if a high variability in the rate of progression is described.Males are&#xD;
      usually affected by a progressive form of the disease. Affected females with X-linked&#xD;
      syndrome usually have a good prognosis with a mild renal impairment. The disease is also&#xD;
      associated to a sensor neural deafness which can occur in approximately half of the patient&#xD;
      affected and usually correlates with renal impairment. No definite treatment exists in order&#xD;
      to delay the time of dialysis or a kidney transplant. Many studies showed that Angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slow glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline and limit&#xD;
      progression to end stage renal disease (ERDS) and dialysis in several chronic nephropathies&#xD;
      associated with proteinuria. The combination of ACE-I with Angiotensin II receptor&#xD;
      antagonists may reduce proteinuria more effectively than the two drugs alone. Moreover the&#xD;
      addition of statins may synergize the antiproteinuric effects of ACE-I and ATAII antagonists&#xD;
      in experimental models of chronic renal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a standardized multimodal&#xD;
      nephroprotection intervention (Remission Clinic) in Alport patients with renal involvement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alport syndrome (AS) represents a form of progressive hereditary nephritis in which the&#xD;
      genetic defect resides in the synthesis of one of several subunits of type IV collagen, the&#xD;
      predominant constituent of basement membranes in glomeruli, eye, cochlea. From a genetical&#xD;
      point of view, the disease is quite heterogeneous, since we have X-linked, autosomal&#xD;
      recessive and autosomal dominant variants of the syndrome. In most cases (about 80%) the&#xD;
      model of inheritance is X-linked and the affected patients are males. Here the mutation stays&#xD;
      on X-chromosome in a gene codifying for alpha-5(IV). In about 15% of patients the inheritance&#xD;
      is autosomal recessive, with a severe disease both in males and females. The involved genes&#xD;
      here are located on chromosome 2 and codifying respectively for alpha-3(IV) and alpha-4(IV)&#xD;
      chains. In a 5% the model of inheritance is autosomal dominant and here the deterioration of&#xD;
      renal function usually occurs more slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical manifestations include microscopic hematuria as the first finding, which can also&#xD;
      became gross hematuria (episodes during upper respiratory infections) or manifest as&#xD;
      intermittent (heterozygous females). Another sign is proteinuria of various degrees. It may&#xD;
      be from insignificant, described in heterozygous females, or a progressive proteinuria&#xD;
      (recessive or X-linked disease). It is evident from clinical studies of Alport patients that&#xD;
      a persistent massive proteinuria, inducing a progressive interstitial fibrosis, indicates a&#xD;
      very poor prognosis. The presence of glomerular podocytes has been described in urinary&#xD;
      sediments of patients with renal diseases, including AS and recent data suggest that&#xD;
      podocyturia could act as a marker for estimating the severity of active glomerular injury and&#xD;
      as a predictor of disease progression. Renal impairment occurs with time and severe renal&#xD;
      failure with hypertension and uremia represent the end stage of the disease, even if an high&#xD;
      variability in the rate of progression is described. The prognosis is variable. Males are&#xD;
      usually affected by progressive form of disease. Affected females with X-linked syndrome&#xD;
      usually have a good prognosis with a mild renal impairment. Some females evolve in a&#xD;
      progressive nephritis. The disease is also associated to a sensorineural deafness which can&#xD;
      occur in approximately half of the patient affected and usually correlates with renal&#xD;
      impairment. Many studies showed that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slow&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline and limit progression to end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ERDS) and dialysis in several chronic nephropathies. ACE inhibitors delay renal fibrosis&#xD;
      both by an hemodynamic mechanism (reduction of the intraglomerular hypertension, glomerular&#xD;
      hyperfiltration and associated proteinuria) and a non-hemodynamic mechanism (decrease of&#xD;
      angiotensin II, a potent inducer of TGF-β release which is a fibrogenic cytokine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors given to COL4A3 knockout mouse (a model for autosomal-recessive AS) during&#xD;
      pre-symptomatic disease, markedly delayed the onset of proteinuria, progressive renal damage&#xD;
      and uremia. Conversely the same treatment did not improve renal outcome in this mouse model&#xD;
      if fibrosis and impairment of renal function was already present. These results are in&#xD;
      agreement with the findings that ACE inhibitor have beneficial effects against proteinuria,&#xD;
      renal function deterioration and survival in Samoyed dogs, a model for X-linked hereditary&#xD;
      nephropathy closely mimicking human AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover recent clinical data suggest that even in young patients affected by AS a decrease&#xD;
      in proteinuria and a stabilization in renal function result from the use of ACE inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of ACE-I with ATAII antagonists may reduce proteinuria more effectively than&#xD;
      the two drugs alone. Moreover the addition of statins may synergize the antiproteinuric&#xD;
      effects of ACE-I and ATAII antagonists in experimental models of chronic renal diseases.&#xD;
      Statins given with or without inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-system have an additive&#xD;
      effect on reducing proteinuria also in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a multimodel treatment including the&#xD;
      integrated use of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), Angiotensin II antagonists (ATA), non&#xD;
      dihydropyridinic calcium channel blockers (CCBS) and statins in AS and renal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study Primary To evaluate the effect of a standardized multimodal&#xD;
      nephroprotection intervention (Remission Clinic) on overnight urine albumin excretion rate&#xD;
      (UAE) in Alport patients with renal involvement Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of the above treatment on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  regression from macro to micro or normoalbuminuria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  regression from micro to normoalbuminuria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  regression from high-normal albuminuria to low-normal albuminuria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  urinary albumin/creatinine ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  systolic/diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  urinary podocyte excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  albumin-IgG-IgM fractional clearances&#xD;
