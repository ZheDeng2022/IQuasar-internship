  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a DNA HIV&#xD;
      vaccine, pGA2/JS7, followed by a modified vaccinia (smallpox) HIV vaccine, MVA/HIV62, in HIV&#xD;
      uninfected adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through a safe and effective vaccine&#xD;
      that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct, easily produced&#xD;
      in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. Recombinant modified vaccinia&#xD;
      Ankara vaccines have been shown to be safe in humans, and immunogenicity after administration&#xD;
      of both vaccines has been encouraging. When used together, a more robust immunologic response&#xD;
      was associated with DNA HIV vaccine administration followed by modified vaccinia vaccine&#xD;
      administration, compared to using either DNA or vaccinia vaccine alone. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an experimental DNA HIV vaccine prime, pGA/JS7,&#xD;
      followed by a similarly structured modified vaccinia boost, MVA/HIV62, in HIV uninfected&#xD;
      adults. Participants in this study will be recruited only in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be divided into 2 parts. Each participant will be involved with their part of&#xD;
      study for 1 year. Participants in Part 1 will be randomly assigned to one of two different&#xD;
      vaccination groups. Group 1A participants will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo&#xD;
      or 2 lower doses of the DNA HIV vaccine (DNA) at study entry and Month 2, followed by 2 lower&#xD;
      doses of the modified vaccinia vaccine (MVA) at Months 4 and 6. Group 1B will not enroll&#xD;
      until safety and immunogenicity data from Group 1A have been evaluated. Group 1B participants&#xD;
      will receive either placebo or two higher doses of DNA at study entry and Month 2, followed&#xD;
      by two higher doses of MVA at Months 4 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into Part 2 will begin only after safety data from Part 1 are reviewed. In Part 2,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two different vaccination groups. Within&#xD;
      each group, participants will be randomly assigned to receive some series of vaccines or&#xD;
      placebo. Group 2A participants will receive either placebo or the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) from Part 1 of DNA at study entry and MTD of MVA at Months 2 and 6. Group 2B&#xD;
      participants will receive MTD of MVA at study entry and Months 2 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 12 study visits over 12 months for Groups 1 and 2. There will be 11 study&#xD;
      visits over 12 months for Groups 3 and 4. Medication history, a physical exam, an interview,&#xD;
      HIV and pregnancy prevention counseling, and adverse events reporting will occur at all&#xD;
      visits. Blood and urine collection and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will occur at selected&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
