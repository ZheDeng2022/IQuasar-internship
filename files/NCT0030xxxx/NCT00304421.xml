  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of two different drugs, rabeprazole (20 mg)&#xD;
      and pantoprazole (40 mg), and their effects on the amount of acid produced by your stomach on&#xD;
      evening and at night after standard protein meal.&#xD;

      Gastric acid secretion can be divided into two phases: the daytime phase and the nocturnal&#xD;
      phase. Nocturnal acid reflux is presumably more damaging because of loss of salivary&#xD;
      neutralization. The present study is designed to measure effects of rabeprazole and&#xD;
      pantoprazole on post-prandial and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and intragastric pH in H.&#xD;
      pylori-negative volunteers with gastroesophageal reflux disease. These measurement will be&#xD;
      used to compare the degree of inhibition of gastric acid secretion between the two drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects, 18-65 years of age, inclusive, male or female, of any race, who are willing&#xD;

             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test before medication is dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             no history of H. pylori eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have history of GERD with or without antacid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be able to tolerate nasogastric tube placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          4. Treatment with rabeprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole,&#xD;
             prokinetic agent, or bismuth subsalicylate within 30 days before enrollment into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with neoplasia or undergoing treatment for cancer (e.g., chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any condition associated with poor subject compliance (e.g., alcohol abuse, drug&#xD;
             abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of clinically significant abuse of alcohol defined as (1) patterns of alcohol&#xD;
             intake consistent with disruption of normal function in society; (2) history of, or&#xD;
             current existence of any indication of difficulty in abstaining from alcohol for the&#xD;
             required duration of the present protocol; (3) use of any alcohol within one day of&#xD;
             any study period.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Inability of subject to return for scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are poor medical or psychiatric&#xD;
             risks for therapy with an investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of any hypersensitivity reaction to rabeprazole, pantoprazole or any of their&#xD;
             inactive ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any significant evidence at screening of endocrine, cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary&#xD;
             disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any predisposing condition that might interfere with the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, or excretion of drug, or a history of abnormal bleeding tendencies or&#xD;
