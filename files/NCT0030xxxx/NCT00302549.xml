      Corticosteroid combined with cytotoxic drugs has been regarded as the conventional therapy&#xD;
      for Class IV Lupus Nephritis (LN), because of its efficacy in improving patients' long term&#xD;
      survival. However, this treatment fails in some patients, especially those who present with&#xD;
      significant vascular lesion. In addition, cyclophosphamide (CTX) has severe side effects with&#xD;
      a high incidence of marrow inhibition and infection.FK506 (Tacrolimus) is a new calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor. Similar to Cyclosporine (CsA), it inhibits the production of IL-2 and activation&#xD;
      of T cells. Furthermore, it has an added value of inhibiting the production of IL-10 from Th2&#xD;
      cells, thus reducing the production of auto antibodies from B cells.It also exerts its&#xD;
      specific immunosuppressive effects through CsA-insensitive pathway. FK506 could inhibit not&#xD;
      only the activation of naive T cells but also the activation and proliferation of primed T&#xD;
      cells.FK506 is 10 -100 times more powerful than CsA in inhibiting the activation of T&#xD;
      cells.Animal studies on MRL/lpr mice LN model demonstrated that FK506 could significantly&#xD;
      depress the excretion of urine protein and the level of serum anti-dsDNA, inhibit glomerular&#xD;
      cellular proliferation and formation of crescents, and reduce the deposits of immune complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary study showed that FK506 was significantly effective on patients with IV LN,as&#xD;
      indicated by rapid reduction of urine protein, increase in serum albumin, decrease in auto&#xD;
      antibodies together with remission of lesion activity of the renal tissue. However, the&#xD;
      drawbacks of this study were the small sample size and the lack of a controlled group. Hence,&#xD;
      a multi-center controlled study comparing FK506 with cytotoxic agents to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of FK506 on patients with III or IV LN, and explore the effective range&#xD;
      of FK506 blood concentration and the appropriate target patient population would be needed.&#xD;
