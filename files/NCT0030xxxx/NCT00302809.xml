  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables can lower blood pressure, and&#xD;
      a number of lines of evidence suggest that grape products may have such an effect. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether consuming grape juice lowers blood pressure in&#xD;
      individuals with pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated blood pressure (BP) is among the most common and important risk factors for&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. A number of non-pharmacological therapies have successfully been applied to&#xD;
      prevent the development of elevated BP or reduce elevated BP. For example the DASH Study&#xD;
      showed that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low fat dairy products, and reduced in&#xD;
      saturated fat, total fat and cholesterol, substantially lowered blood pressure in&#xD;
      normotensive and hypertensive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the past three years a number of small clinical trials have suggested suggest that&#xD;
      drinking purple grape juice for a period of 6-12 weeks may lower blood pressure individuals&#xD;
      with elevated blood pressure. Other clinical trials have shown that Concord grape juice&#xD;
      improves the function of the vascular endothelium, possibly providing an explanation for the&#xD;
      beneficial effect. However, there is a need for a prospective, controlled study to determine&#xD;
      whether grape juice has a beneficial effect on blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will compare the effect of drinking Concord purple grape juice (7 ml/kg or&#xD;
      about 16 oz/day for a 70 kg person) and the effect of calorie-matched placebo on 24-hour&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure, blood pressure reactivity, and vascular function in men and women&#xD;
      in the category of &quot;pre-hypertension&quot; (defined as blood pressure greater than 120/80, but&#xD;
      less than 149/89 mmHg and Stage 1 hypertension (defined as blood pressure greater than&#xD;
      140/90, but less than 160/100). This study will specifically recruit patients with systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure of 130-159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 85-99 mmHg. The study will be&#xD;
      double blind and have a crossover design with the order of treatment randomized (grape juice&#xD;
      first or placebo first). A dietician will provide all subjects with formal instruction in a&#xD;
      low salt diet, which is the current recommended initial therapy for patients with Stage 1&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 1-week run-in period, subjects will consume each beverage for 8 weeks with a 4-week&#xD;
      rest period between treatments. Blood pressure will be measured before and after each&#xD;
      treatment period using a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording. After each treatment&#xD;
      period, we will measure changes in blood pressure induced by psychological challenge (mental&#xD;
      arithmetic and computer tasks) and by the cold pressor test. In order to gain insight into&#xD;
      the potential mechanisms of benefit, we will also examine the effects of beverage consumption&#xD;
      on endothelial function, stiffness of the central aorta, fasting glucose and insulin, body&#xD;
      weight, and markers of systemic inflammation, including CD40 ligand and C-reactive protein.&#xD;
      Finally, we will store plasma samples for future investigation of other potential effects of&#xD;
      grape juice on the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Concord grape juice will have favorable effects on blood pressure&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
