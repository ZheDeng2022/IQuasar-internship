  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although strong clinical evidence exists that patients with diabetes should achieve certain&#xD;
      clinical goals (i.e. HbA1C, BP, LDL, etc.), to reduce morbidity and mortality national&#xD;
      surveys indicate that only a minority of people with diabetes achieves these goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: combination of nurse case management and enhanced behavior change counseling will&#xD;
      improve outcomes for glycemic control, blood pressure and cholesterol in high risk patients&#xD;
      with Type 2 diabetes when compared to usual care over a 3 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design- The study will be a three year randomized control trial that will select&#xD;
      patients that have either A1C &gt;8.5, LDL &gt;130, or BP &gt;140/90. Nurse case managers, trained in&#xD;
      clinical guidelines and brief behavior change counseling techniques (motivational&#xD;
      interviewing), will aim to foster patient adherence in the experimental group patients. Nurse&#xD;
      case managers will use standing orders to set an implementation of clinical guidelines (for&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and depression) with individual follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 820 patients between the all 9 (6 Hershey Medical Center and 3 Reading Hospital&#xD;
      affiliated clinics) will be sought. One third of the study patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      the underserved Hispanic population in the Reading area. Patients will be randomized by&#xD;
      physician i.e. one physician will be randomly assigned to have all their patients co-managed&#xD;
      by a nurse case manager; the other will have usual care without any contact with nurse case&#xD;
      manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses will be trained and then initiate a small pilot study in July thru August. Full&#xD;
      recruitment and initiation of study will begin in September 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Activities - Each nurse will be responsible for 3 clinics. Nurses will work under the&#xD;
      supervision of the primary care physicians. A set of clinical guidelines will be developed&#xD;
      with physician input that will serve as the over-riding framework for the nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes - Over a three-year period the investigators will evaluate clinical response&#xD;
      (improvements in A1C, BP, LDL, and depression when present) as well as a series of other&#xD;
      measures that will be obtained by surveys (patient satisfaction, quality of life,&#xD;
      self-management behaviors). Provider satisfaction will be measured using a standardized tool.&#xD;
      Finally, cost effectiveness of the intervention and evaluation of the potential barriers to&#xD;
      implementation will be studied.&#xD;

      1. Rationale: Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease and results in high health care&#xD;
           expenditures, the majority of which are due to preventable complications of diabetes.&#xD;
           Current evidence indicates that care of patients with diabetes mellitus falls short of&#xD;
           the standards set by the American Diabetes Association and a large proportion of these&#xD;
           patients do not achieve their treatment goals. Multiple ways to deliver care to patients&#xD;
           with diabetes have been studies. The investigators propose a 3 year&#xD;
           randomized-controlled study to assess impact of the combination of nurse case management&#xD;
           (NCM) combined with enhanced behavior change counseling on glycemic control and&#xD;
           co-morbidity outcomes in high-risk patients with Type 2 diabetes when compared to usual&#xD;
           care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Key Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1. Determine the efficacy of an enhanced nurse case management (NCM)&#xD;
           intervention to promote patient adherence leading to positive clinical outcomes (HbA1C,&#xD;
           LDL, blood pressure, and process measures) in high-risk patients in primary care over a&#xD;
           period of three years. High-risk patients with Type 2 diabetes will be recruited from 9&#xD;
           primary care clinics and randomized to NCM intervention vs. usual care. A major focus of&#xD;
           this proposal is to test the efficacy of NCM in a minority population with high risk of&#xD;
           poor outcomes (approximately 38 % of the study population will be Hispanic). The&#xD;
           investigators anticipate a significant increase in percentage of patients reaching the&#xD;
           goals for HbA1C (&lt; 7.0%), BP (&lt;130/80), LDL (&lt;100 mg/dl) in patients in the NCM group&#xD;
           compared to the control group of usual care. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
           there will be significant improvement in process measures (% patients having a yearly&#xD;
           dilated eye exam, foot exam, urinary screen for microalbuminuria, aspirin use, lipid&#xD;
           evaluation) and depression scores in patients in the NCM group compared to the control&#xD;
           group of usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 2. Quantify the impact of enhanced nurse case management on health-related&#xD;
           quality of life, patient satisfaction, self-management behaviors, and provider&#xD;
           satisfaction. A unique feature of our study is to address the impact of our intervention&#xD;
           on these critical outcomes, which have not been addressed in the existing NCM&#xD;
           literature. The investigators anticipate improved adherence, lower levels of diabetes&#xD;
           specific emotional distress, higher levels of diabetes specific quality of life,&#xD;
           increased patient satisfaction with treatment, and improved provider satisfaction in the&#xD;
           NCM group compared to the usual care group. The following surveys will be completed and&#xD;
           analysed:the PAID survey looking at Emotional distress associated with diabetes, the&#xD;
           ADDQOL (Diabetes specific quality of life) survey, the DTSQ (Patient satisfaction)&#xD;
           survey and the SDSCA (Diabetes self care activities) survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an enriched NCM intervention. The&#xD;
           investigators expect that the NCM intervention will be effective in improving clinical&#xD;
           outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes; however, there may still be barriers to more&#xD;
           widespread adoption unless the benefits of investing in or reimbursing for NCM can be&#xD;
           justified by the costs. Toward that end, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of the intervention from the perspective of the provider, payor, and&#xD;
           society. These cost-effectiveness ratios will help decision makers generate informed&#xD;
           decisions about appropriate and cost-effective treatment for high-risk patients with&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Population: Patients with Type 2 diabetes, older than 18 years of age, will be&#xD;
           identified based on billing data (two visits with ICD-9 code of 250.xx in the preceding&#xD;
           year) and subsequent chart review from nine Hershey Medical Center (HMC) primary care&#xD;
           clinics and three Reading Hospital-affiliated primary care sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Major Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion criteria: Type 2 diabetes, age &gt;18 who are at high&#xD;
           risk based on any one of the following criteria: HbA1C &gt;8.5, LDL &gt;130, or BP &gt;140/90.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Allocation to Groups: a stratified group randomization scheme whereby all patients being&#xD;
           seen by the same doctor will be randomized to the same treatment group. The&#xD;
           randomization will also be stratified by clinic site and size of doctor's practice. One&#xD;
           group will be seen by nurse care managers, the other will continue with standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Summary of Procedures: An initial pilot study will be performed with 60 patients from&#xD;
           HMC and Reading Hospital clinics, for 2 months. This will consist of nurse case&#xD;
           management intervention and feedback from the subjects to improve the study design.&#xD;
           Subjects will be seen at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. This study will end with focus groups of&#xD;
           subjects to give their input as to what they did or did not like about the study, and&#xD;
           how it might be improved. Pilot participants will have the option to enroll into the&#xD;
           main study. No studies will be ordered for research purposes. Pregnancy screening will&#xD;
           occur by verbally asking the subjects whether they believe they could be pregnant, since&#xD;
           risk is very minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main study will enroll 820 subjects at clinics from the Hershey Medical Center and&#xD;
           Reading Hospital, with 2/3 of the subjects being enrolled at HMC, and 1/3 from the&#xD;
           underserved Hispanic population. The study intervention will continue for 3 years.&#xD;
           Patients will be enrolled into the nurse case management group or the control group&#xD;
           dependent upon where they see their physician - randomization will occur in blocks based&#xD;
           on clinics and physicians, not randomly per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the main study, the intervention group patients will have an initial appointment with&#xD;
           a nurse case manager (RN) (50 min) to review medical history, medications and control of&#xD;
           diabetes and co-morbidities. A plan with patient specific treatment goals will be set up&#xD;
           at this appointment. The patients will have follow up appointment set up for 2,4, and 6&#xD;
           weeks to review their progress, obtain standard diabetes laboratories and make necessary&#xD;
           medication adjustments. The patients then will be seen by a nurse case manager on&#xD;
           average once every 2-3 months, and a minimum of every 6 months, depending on their&#xD;
           diabetes control. They will also continue to see their PCP (as scheduled per their PCP,&#xD;
           normally once every 3-4 months). The control group patients will continue to follow with&#xD;
           their PCP as scheduled, there will be no change from their usual care. The patients in&#xD;
           both groups will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires (5 if they are depressed)&#xD;
           assessing their emotional stress with diabetes, quality of life and treatment&#xD;
           satisfaction at baseline and yearly for the study duration (3 years). Subjects will be&#xD;
           randomly audio taped to ensure nurse case managers are following recommended guidelines&#xD;
           of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study outcomes such as HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure will be evaluated at baseline and&#xD;
           then yearly in all patients. No laboratories will be done specifically for research&#xD;
           purposes. The data will be extracted from the Penn State Diabetes Center Registry and&#xD;
           charts (if required).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For cost analysis, the investigators will be tracking outpatient and inpatient costs at&#xD;
           the Hershey Medical Center and the Reading hospitals. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
           will be tracking hospitalization costs outside of the hospitals by obtaining records&#xD;
           from an existing registry managed by the State of Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania Health&#xD;
           Cost Containment Council), identified by social security numbers. This information along&#xD;
           with all other information in the study will be safeguarded with strict confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Major Risks &amp; Discomforts: 1. Loss of confidentiality. 2. increased risk of low blood&#xD;
           sugars with improved glycemic control, therefore the patients will be asked to test&#xD;
           glucose on a regular basis - 2 -5 times daily, depending on their diabetes regimen. They&#xD;
           will have a 24-hour contact phone number, specific to their primary care clinic, to call&#xD;
           if problems arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Confidentiality: All research records, including those of subjects from Reading clinics,&#xD;
           will be coded and kept at HMC. All consent forms will be forwarded to HMC. Records,&#xD;
           audio tapes and the code key will be kept in the Endocrinology office in a locked file&#xD;
           accessible only by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Study Site Location(s): University Physician Health Groups (UPHG) is made up of 10&#xD;
           practice sites. For the purpose of this project 6 of the 10 HMC practice sites will&#xD;
           participate and 3 of the Reading Hospital-affiliated ambulatory sites. All 3 sites are&#xD;
           owned by The Reading Hospital and Medical Center, a non-profit hospital and health care&#xD;
           organization.&#xD;
