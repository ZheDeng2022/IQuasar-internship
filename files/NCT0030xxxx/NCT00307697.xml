    <textblock>
      Currently patients thought to have anxiety or depression by their GPs are referred to the&#xD;
      Primary Mental Health Team (PMHEIT) for psychiatric assessment. This assessment consists of a&#xD;
      one-hour interview with a senior psychiatry registrar or psychiatrist, who then writes a&#xD;
      letter to the referring GP. The letter contains diagnostic information and management&#xD;
      recommendations. It is not current practice to send a copy of this letter to the patient. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients who receive a copy of the psychiatric assessment letter that is&#xD;
      sent to GPs will improve adherence to treatment recommendations; and that patients who&#xD;
      receive a copy of the letter will have improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs will be asked to agree to the participation of their patients. Participants will be&#xD;
      persons over the age of 18 years who are referred to the PMHEIT for assessment and who&#xD;
      receive primary diagnoses of depression or anxiety. After the assessment interview, the&#xD;
      patient will be given an explanatory letter and a consent form. Consenting patients will&#xD;
      complete the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and a SF12 questionnaire to measure&#xD;
      the level of disability they are experiencing due to their mental condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: a control group who will not receive&#xD;
      a copy of the assessment letter, and an experimental group who will be mailed a copy of the&#xD;
      same information that their GP receives. The registrar who conducts the assessment and writes&#xD;
      the report will not know to which group each participant has been assigned. Thus, the content&#xD;
      of the letter will not be affected by knowledge that the patient will or will not see it. The&#xD;
      letter will be sent simultaneously to the referring GP and to experimental group&#xD;
      participants. To ensure confidentiality, the letter will be sent by registered mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks later, participants will be mailed a copy of the DASS. After a week, they will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone and asked for their DASS responses. They will also be asked a brief series&#xD;
      of questions regarding their adherence to the treatment recommendations given in their&#xD;
      assessment letter. When adherence is partial or absent, the interviewer will attempt to&#xD;
      ascertain the reason. This procedure will be repeated at 3 months, except that assessment on&#xD;
      the SF12 will also take place.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2004, the UK National Health Service mandated the practice of sending patients copies of&#xD;
      all correspondence between clinicians involved in their care. Such a policy is consistent&#xD;
      with the principle of autonomy and with the right of the patient to access information about&#xD;
      themselves (Somerville, 1994). It is also supportive of a collaborative model of service&#xD;
      delivery in which patients are viewed as active agents in their own wellbeing, as opposed to&#xD;
      passive recipients of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letter interventions have boosted attendance rates for cervical screening (McDowell, Newell &amp;&#xD;
      Rosser, 1989a), blood pressure checks (McDowell, Newell &amp; Rosser, 1989b), and mammography&#xD;
      follow-up (Saywell et al., 2003). They have also resulted in improved adherence to&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications and lipid lowering agents (Atthobari, Monster &amp; de Jong-van den&#xD;
      Berg, 2004). However, caution has been urged in relation to the use of letters in some&#xD;
      patient subpopulations, such as persons who lack the capacity to consent and patients who&#xD;
      have psychiatric diagnoses (Jelley, van Zwanenberg &amp; Walker, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these cautions, psychiatric patients react positively to the idea of receiving a copy&#xD;
      of the letters containing clinical information that are routinely sent to their GP. At least&#xD;
      three quarters of patients who had never received such a letter wished to do so (Dale,&#xD;
      Tadros, Adams &amp; Deshpande, 2004; Marzanski, Musunuri &amp; Coupe, 2005), and at least 80% of&#xD;
      patients who had received a letter supported the practice (Asch, Price &amp; Hawks, 1991;&#xD;
      Nandhra, Murray, Hymas &amp; Hunt, 2004). Most psychiatric patients wished to continue to receive&#xD;
      such letters, and a number commented that &quot;seeing their problems understood and described&#xD;
      objectively helped them to gain perspective&quot; (Nandhra et al., 2004, p. 41).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some psychiatric patients and practitioners, even those who favour letter interventions in&#xD;
      principle, have expressed reservations. One commonly expressed concern is over the&#xD;
      preservation of patient confidentiality, especially with regard to psychiatric reports that&#xD;
      containing highly personal information (see, for example, Marzanski et al., 2005; Nandhra et&#xD;
      al., 2004). To date, however, there have been no reported breaches of confidentiality in&#xD;
      Britain. In fact, most patients are happy for letters to be mailed to them, as are the carers&#xD;
      of patients with dementia (Harris &amp; Boaden, 2003). Some patients and practitioners are also&#xD;
      concerned that the contents of the letter may cause distress (Marzanski et al., 2005; Nandhra&#xD;
      et al., 2004). However, the reaction reported by most psychiatric patients themselves was&#xD;
      that when they read the letter they did not experience any distress at all. A minority of&#xD;
      patients did initially feel distress, but they reported that once they had regained composure&#xD;
      they found the letter helpful and were glad they had received it (Nandhra et al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An issue that has not yet been clarified is whether receipt of a letter improves adherence to&#xD;
      treatment recommendations in cases of psychiatric illness. This is a critical issue; a recent&#xD;
      review of adherence to antidepressant medication found drop out rates as high as 33%&#xD;
      (Pampallona &amp; Bollini, 2002). The major aim of the current study is to establish whether&#xD;
      adherence to treatment is boosted by a letter intervention. If such an effect is found, it&#xD;
      should follow that increased adherence leads to improved reduction in the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms, and consequently to improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) that receiving the assessment report will improve patient adherence to&#xD;
      treatment recommendations; (2) that receiving the assessment report will improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 200 patients over the age of 18 years who are referred to the Primary Mental&#xD;
      Health Team for assessment and who receive primary diagnoses of a depressive or anxiety&#xD;
      disorder will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A Group (control v. experimental) x Time (baseline x 1 month x 3 month) x Condition&#xD;
      (depressive disorder v. anxiety disorder) will measure (a) patient adherence to treatment&#xD;
      recommendations and (b) the severity of symptoms. In addition, qualitative analysis of&#xD;
      reasons for suboptimal adherence to treatment recommendations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Consent will be sought from General Practitioners who refer patients to the PMHEIT&#xD;
      for psychiatric assessment (see Appendix A). The patients of consenting GPs will form the&#xD;
      participant pool. It is current practice that on referral, patients are given a brochure that&#xD;
      explains the function of the PMHEIT and the assessment procedure. This brochure contains a&#xD;
      section alerting the patient to the fact that they may be asked to participate in research&#xD;
      (see Appendix B). After the clinical interview, patients will be given a participant consent&#xD;
      form which contains information on the research (see Appendix C). If consent is obtained,&#xD;
      patients will complete the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the SF12&#xD;
      questionnaire (a measure of disability). Those whose primary diagnosis is any anxiety or&#xD;
      depressive disorder will be selected for inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. For patients&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental group, the assessment report will be simultaneously sent to the&#xD;
      GP and by registered mail to the patient. Reports will be mailed to referring GPs of control&#xD;
      group participants, but will not be mailed to the patient themselves. These patients will be&#xD;
      mailed a thank-you letter reminding them of the next follow up call (see Appendix D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks after the assessment interview, all participants will be mailed a copy of the&#xD;
      DASS and a reminder letter. One week later, a researcher attached to the Primary Mental&#xD;
      Health Team will contact the participant by phone. She will ask the participant for his/her&#xD;
      responses to the DASS items and will ask a short series of questions regarding adherence to&#xD;
      the treatment recommendations. Where adherence is partial or absent, the interviewer will ask&#xD;
      the reasons (see Appendix E). This procedure will be repeated three months after the initial&#xD;
      interview, when the SF12 will also be administered. On completion of the research, all&#xD;
      participants and their GPs will be mailed a summary of the research findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Criteria for inclusion consist of any of the DSM IV anxiety&#xD;
      disorders or depressive disorders. Exclusion criteria will include a primary substance abuse&#xD;
      disorder (though co-morbid substance abuse will not be an exclusion criterion), significant&#xD;
      personality disorder, psychosis, high suicidal risk or risk of harm to others, or inability&#xD;
      to speak and read English to a standard that allows independent completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaires. Clinician discretion will also be used to exclude participants for whom a&#xD;
      letter would be contraindicated. Assessing clinicians will indicate on their record of&#xD;
      assessment if inclusion in the study is not contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation procedures: Patients will be allocated to groups based on a random number&#xD;
      sequence recorded in sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: A Group (control v. experimental) x Time (Initial x 1 month x 3 month)&#xD;
      x Condition (depressive disorder v. anxiety disorder) factorial ANOVA will be performed. Post&#xD;
      hoc tests may include Tukey and/or Scheffe analyses. Qualitative analysis of responses to&#xD;
      adherence questions will be undertaken using a thematic analysis.&#xD;
