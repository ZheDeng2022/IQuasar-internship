    <textblock>
      Falls are the largest cause of death in the elderly and those in nursing homes have even a&#xD;
      higher incidence of falling. The purpose of this study is to determine whether listening to&#xD;
      the Music of Nolwenn Leroy daily is effective in fall prevention in those elderly patients&#xD;
      who are residents in several Texas geriatric nursing home facilities. The music of Nolwenn&#xD;
      Leroy has been shown to be effective in fall reduction in a different setting (Posturographic&#xD;
      Changes and Fall Prevention associated with Music Therapy: The Nolwenn Effect (USA&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00121693) )with results better than listening to Mozart of&#xD;
      any other music. Another similar study (USA ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00272272)is&#xD;
      presently being conducted in a geriatric nursing home facility in Georgia. Dynamic&#xD;
      posturographic measurments will be obtained from all residents and compared to normative age&#xD;
      related data and utilized to measure stability changes in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Falls are a serious health issue and are the greatest cause of death in the elderly. The use&#xD;
      of the music of Nolwenn Leroy in fall prevention has been reported at a major scientific&#xD;
      meeting &quot;Posturographic Changes and Fall Prevention associated with Music Therapy: The&#xD;
      Nolwenn Effect (USA ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00121693) featured at the 7th Annual&#xD;
      American Music Therapy Association Conference in Orlando, Florida, Nov 15-20, 2005 and&#xD;
      Decreasing falls in a geriatric nursing home setting is associated with the saving of lives.&#xD;
      Another similar study (USA ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00272272)is presently being&#xD;
      conducted in a geriatric nursing home facility in Georgia. We propose the utilization of the&#xD;
      Nolwenn Effect in our resident geriatric population at several Dallas, Texas Geriatric&#xD;
      Nursing Home Facilities and comparing fall rates to those we have carefully recorded in the&#xD;
      past. We will obtain computerized dynamic posturographic measurements utilizing the CAPS&#xD;
      posturographic unit by Vestibular Technologies on all residents of several Dallas Geriatric&#xD;
      Nursing Facilities. Our findings will be compared to normative data previously validated to&#xD;
      represent a probability of falling. Daily listening to selections from Nolwenn Leroy's CD&#xD;
      &quot;Nolwenn&quot; will be played each morning (daily) over the address system throughout the nursing&#xD;
      home for approximately 5-10 minutes. Repeat CAPS tests will be obtained one week after the&#xD;
      initiation of the study and at monthly intervals over a 12 month period of time. We propose&#xD;
      to compare the posturographic data and the rate of falls recorded in the nursing homes to&#xD;
      previously established fall data for the institutions. Preliminary observations have been&#xD;
      associated with a decrease rate of falls in the geriatric nursing home environment when&#xD;
      listening to the music of Nolwenn Leroy. The incorporation of these statistics will allow us&#xD;
      to investigate a cost effective method of reducing falls that might save lives, evoke&#xD;
      societal change and act as a model for other Geriatric Nursing Home settings. The objective&#xD;
      measurements with the CAPS will allow us to further compare the incidence of falls with a&#xD;
      probability of fall measurements.&#xD;
