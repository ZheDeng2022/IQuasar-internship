      Cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx remains the third most common head and neck malignancy,&#xD;
      constituting about 20% of all tumors. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common&#xD;
      histopathologic type of the laryngeal and hypopharyngeal malignancies, accounting for more&#xD;
      than 90% of cancers occurring in this region (1). Lymph node metastasis directly affects the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC (2). The presence of lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis significantly reduces the probability of regional control and survival (3).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the American Cancer Society shows no trend toward an improvement in 5-year&#xD;
      survival rates between patients diagnosed in 1974 to 1976 and 1989 to 1995 (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor metastasis is the hallmark of malignancy, and is probably a result of the interaction&#xD;
      between tumor cells and a supportive microenvironment. Malignant cells that have the&#xD;
      capability to metastasize to a particular organ may have various properties supporting their&#xD;
      tissue invasion or growth such as enhanced adherence to the microvascular cells of the organ,&#xD;
      higher responsiveness to chemotactic signals released from the target organs and increased&#xD;
      response to local soluble or tissue associated growth signals in the target organ (5,6).&#xD;
      Though there are several molecules expressed or produced in cancer cells are considered the&#xD;
      metastatic factors, it remains unknown which factors produced by the lymph node or tissue&#xD;
      affect the metastasis of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemokines are a large family of pro-inflammatory polypeptide cytokines, consisting of small&#xD;
      (7-15 kDa), structurally related heparin-binding proteins. They are grouped into CXC&#xD;
      chemokines and CC chemokines, on the basis of the characteristic presence of four conserved&#xD;
      cysteine residues (7-9). Chemokines are produced locally in the tissues and act on target&#xD;
      cells through G-protein-coupled receptors, which are characterized structurally by seven&#xD;
      transmembrane spanning domains. Chemokines are involved in the attraction and activation of&#xD;
      mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes to sites of inflammatory responses, bacterial or&#xD;
      viral infections, allergy, cardiovascular diseases and wound healing (5, 9-14). Chemokines&#xD;
      are known to also function as regulatory molecules in the leukocyte maturation, trafficking,&#xD;
      and homing of T and B lymphocytes, in the development of lymphoid tissues, and in dendritic&#xD;
      cell maturation (15,16). Other functions of chemokines have been described more recently,&#xD;
      particularly for the CXC chemokines. The role of chemokines in malignant tumors is not clear&#xD;
      yet. Some chemokines may enhance innate or specific host immunity against tumor&#xD;
      dissemination. On the other hand, some may advocate tumor growth and metastasis by promoting&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation, migration or angiogenesis in tumor tissue (5). Reports have&#xD;
      suggested that several types of cancer, such as breast (17), ovary (18), prostate (19),&#xD;
      kidney (20), brain (21), lung (22), and thyroid (23), expressed the chemokine receptor and&#xD;
      used the chemokines to metastasize to the target organ as in the homing of hematopoietic&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDF-1 belongs to the CXC chemokine family and is a ligand for CXCR4 (24, 25). SDF-1 was&#xD;
      initially cloned by Tashiro et al. (26) and later identified as a growth factor for B cell&#xD;
      progenitors, a chemotactic factor for T cells and monocytes, and in B-cell lymphopoiesis and&#xD;
      bone marrow myelopoiesis (24, 27-28). Most of the chemokine receptors interact with pleural&#xD;
      ligands, and vice versa, but the SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system has been shown to involve&#xD;
      a one-on-one interaction (29, 30). Recently, several studies have been conducted to detect&#xD;
      the mRNA expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1 in solid tumors. The results are not uniform, and the&#xD;
      relevance to cancer progression is not determined (31, 32). Sehgal et al. (31, 33) concluded&#xD;
      that CXCR4 plays an important role of proliferation and tumorigenic properties of human&#xD;
      glioblastoma tumors. Muller et al. (34) have reported that SDF-1 signaling through CXCR4&#xD;
      interaction appears to determine the directional migration of breast cancer cells through the&#xD;
      basement membrane. Furthermore in vivo, the interaction between SDF-1 and CXCR4 significantly&#xD;
      represses the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells to lymph node and lung. Barnard and&#xD;
      his colleagues (35, 36) showed the contrary results that CXCR4 mRNA expression was reduced in&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma tissue when compared with noncancerous tissue, but was not changed&#xD;
      in colon, esophageal, and gastric cancer. They also found reduced mRNA expression of SDF-1 in&#xD;
      these malignant tissues (32). Thus, there is a diversity of views on the role of the&#xD;
      SDF-1/CXCR4 receptor ligand system in malignant tissues. And such studies are limited in&#xD;
      laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since metastasis of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer occur frequently through the&#xD;
      lymphatic system, and metastasis is a key prognostic factor for the disease. Evaluation of&#xD;
      the relationship between SDF-1/CXCR4 system and metastasis in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer could help us understand whether this system is important in the metastasis of this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that SDF-1/CXCR4 (ligand/receptor) system plays an important role in&#xD;
      laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate&#xD;
      (1) the distribution of CXCR4 protein expression in cancer and lymph node tissues by means of&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples obtained from surgical operation, (2) the&#xD;
      relationship between CXCR4 expression and clinicopathological findings with special reference&#xD;
      to cancer metastasis, (3)the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the cancer cell lines cells and&#xD;
      tissues, (4) the chemotactic activity and the growth-promoting effect of SDF-1 on cancer cell&#xD;
      lines cells, (5) the role of Src, MAPK, and Akt signal transduction pathway in this response,&#xD;
      (6) the effect of the blocking agent on this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undoubtedly, the findings of this study will help us understand whether SDF-1/CXCR4 system&#xD;
      could be a focal point of anti-cancer research. If laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC that&#xD;
      express high levels of CXCR4 show a consistently higher incidence of lymphatic and distant&#xD;
      metastasis, then blocking SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling may be a novel approach to inhibit metastasis&#xD;
      in these patients. The development of SDF-1/CXCR4 system antagonists will provide opportunity&#xD;
      to improve the survival rate.&#xD;
