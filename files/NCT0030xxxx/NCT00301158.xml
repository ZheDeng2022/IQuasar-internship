      RATIONALE: Physical activity may lower the risk of some types of cancer and other chronic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ways to increase physical activity in urban&#xD;
      adolescents who attend after-school programs.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop educational, promotional, and evaluation materials for use in promoting physical&#xD;
           activity (PA) in community-based after-school programs by multiethnic, urban&#xD;
           adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a series of workshops for promoting physical activities (PAs) that are &quot;a good&#xD;
           fit&quot; in after-school programs for these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine a small set of feasibility tests as a first step towards pursuing funding for&#xD;
           a full-scale experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of print materials for a series of skills-building workshops for these&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of evaluation materials, including self-report survey questions and&#xD;
           structured interview protocols for qualitative assessment of participants' skills in&#xD;
           identifying PAs that are a &quot;good fit&quot; for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Youth participants will be assigned to one of two groups and may be involved in one&#xD;
      or more research activities conducted during after-school hours at a community-based,&#xD;
      after-school program site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus group: Participants, consisting of 5-8 adolescents per focus group, either all&#xD;
           male or all female, attend a single audiotaped focus group with a trained moderator for&#xD;
           60 minutes. Participants complete an anonymous participant information form, and explore&#xD;
           their perceptions of physical activity (PA), perceptions of audience segments among&#xD;
           peers that would be appropriate for tailoring physical promotions, and responses to&#xD;
           images and graphic designs for use in developing print materials. Some participants may&#xD;
           also be eligible to participate in a second focus group and the survey if interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One-on-one interview: Participants attend a one-on-one audiotaped individual interview&#xD;
           with a trained interviewer for 60 minutes. Participants in the first set of interviews&#xD;
           explore their perceptions of PA, their perceptions of the concept of finding PAs that&#xD;
           are &quot;a good fit&quot;, and their perceptions of audience segmentation for promoting PA. In&#xD;
           the second set of interviews, participants test a protocol for qualitative assessment of&#xD;
           adolescents' skills in assessing &quot;good fit&quot; of PA. Participants are involved in a series&#xD;
           of visual and written scenarios depicting a variety of PAs, and use a structured&#xD;
           interview format to identify the PA they most or least enjoy. Participants will also be&#xD;
           asked to elaborate on criteria and experiences on which they based their decisions.&#xD;
           Participants may also participate in the survey if interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey: Participants complete a paper and pencil 60-minute questionnaire about PA&#xD;
           behaviors, attitudes, environments, and person-physical activity skills (i.e., skills in&#xD;
           finding PAs that are &quot;a good fit&quot;). Two weeks later, participants are asked to complete&#xD;
           a second questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Key informant interview (adult): Participants attend a 60-minute, audiotaped interview&#xD;
           with a trained interviewer that focuses on respondents' perceptions of the PA-related&#xD;
           attitudes, behaviors, strengths, and barriers of the young adolescents who participate&#xD;
           in their program, the respondents' experiences with promoting PA in their program&#xD;
           participants, and respondents' suggestions for program elements and logistics to enhance&#xD;
           the feasibility and effectiveness of after-school workshops to promote PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Workshop pilot testing: After data collection from the above field work is completed,&#xD;
           1-2 workshop activities are conducted in cooperation with program leaders at&#xD;
           community-based, after-school programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 420 participants (400 adolescents and 20 adults) will be&#xD;
      accrued for this study.&#xD;
