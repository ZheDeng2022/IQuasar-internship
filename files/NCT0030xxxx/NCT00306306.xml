  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiographic contrast agents are administered to all patients undergoing diagnostic or&#xD;
      interventional catheterization procedures. Injection of contrast enables visualization of the&#xD;
      vasculature with X-ray based fluoroscopy or cineangiographic imaging. Unfortunately, the use&#xD;
      of radiographic contrast agents is often associated with severe adverse side effects,&#xD;
      including acute kidney failure. Acute kidney failure following exposure to an intravascular&#xD;
      contrast agent is also known as Radiocontrast Nephropathy (RCN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic factors that may put a patient at higher risk of developing RCN include:&#xD;
      pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, age, cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (particularly congestive heart failure and low ejection fraction), and dehydration or other&#xD;
      conditions characterized by depletion of effective circulatory volume. These risk factors are&#xD;
      relatively common in patients undergoing catheterization procedures. Treatment of high-risk&#xD;
      patients can be modified, by hydration and/or minimizing contrast volume; however despite&#xD;
      these efforts, RCN remains a well-recognized complication of coronary catheterization&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the frequency and detrimental consequences of RCN, there is a compelling clinical need&#xD;
      for safe and effective therapies to reduce the incidence of RCN. One such potential therapy&#xD;
      is endovascular cooling to induce mild hypothermia. This study has been designed to evaluate&#xD;
      whether endovascular cooling can reduce the incidence of RCN in high-risk patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures.&#xD;
