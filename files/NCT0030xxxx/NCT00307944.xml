  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using Pantoprazole decreases your daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and improves your reaction time when compared to using a placebo (sugar pill).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Half of the patients enrolled in the study will begin the study taking Pantoprazole. The&#xD;
      other half will begin the study taking a placebo (sugar pill). There is an equal chance of&#xD;
      being placed in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two weeks, the patients will stop taking their first batch of medication to allow it to&#xD;
      completely leave their bodies. Then the patients will begin taking the other medication so&#xD;
      that by the end of the study, each patient will have been treated with pantoprazole for two&#xD;
      weeks and placebo for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each two weeks, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding&#xD;
      their daytime sleepiness and reflux symptoms. Patients will also complete reaction time&#xD;
      testing as a measure of daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
