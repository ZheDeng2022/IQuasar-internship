    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Although IL-2 can shrink tumors in about 20 percent of patients with metastatic kidney&#xD;
      cancer and in 15 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma, it is not fully known how the&#xD;
      drug works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To better understand how IL-2 causes tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic kidney cancer or metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  135 patients with melanoma and 110 patients with kidney cancer may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are hospitalized for about 7 days for each treatment. They receive IL-2&#xD;
           intravenously (through a vein) over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 4 days or 12&#xD;
           doses. This constitutes one treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research blood samples are collected daily during the first treatment cycle and for one&#xD;
           or two days following the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be asked to undergo leukapheresis, a procedure for collecting large&#xD;
           quantities of white blood cells. This involves collecting blood through a needle in an&#xD;
           arm vein. The blood is directed through a cell separator where the white cells are&#xD;
           extracted. The rest of the blood (red cells, platelets, and plasma) is returned to the&#xD;
           patient through the same needle or through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 7-10 days after discharge from the hospital, patients return for a second&#xD;
           treatment cycle but without research blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 months after therapy, patients are evaluated with scans, and x-rays, and blood tests&#xD;
           to evaluate the tumor and the effects of the treatment on immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable may continue treatment (without repeating&#xD;
           the full set of research blood samples) as long as they benefit from the treatment and&#xD;
           do not develop unacceptable side effects. Patients who continue treatment are evaluated&#xD;
           every 2 months for 3 to 4 times and then every 3 to 6 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although interleukin-2 (IL-2) was approved as standard therapy by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration for metastasis melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, the mechanism of action&#xD;
           in these patient populations is still not completely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods for studying regulatory T-cells and measuring recently discovered cytokines were&#xD;
           not available during earlier studies of IL-2 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Explore peripheral blood samples of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or melanoma&#xD;
      receiving high-dose IL-2 to identify serum protein levels and lymphocyte phenotypes that may&#xD;
      be associated with or predictive of tumor regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or melanoma who are greater than or equal to&#xD;
           18 years of age, with an ECOG of 0 or 1 who have an expected survival greater than three&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with systemic infections, coagulation disorders, or major medical illnesses of&#xD;
           the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system will be excluded, including patients&#xD;
           with ejection fractions less than 45% or FEV1 or VC less than or equal to 60% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must not have had prior therapy within 28 days, previous IL-2 therapy, be&#xD;
           pregnant, have untreated or clinically significant tumor involvement of the CNS or major&#xD;
           nerve compression, or have greater than 25% estimated hepatic replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aldesleukin 720,000 IU/kg intravenous bolus over 15 minutes every eight hours for up to&#xD;
           12 doses will be administered as a cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seven to 10 days after discharge, a second cycle of treatment will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 mLs of blood for serum and 20 mLs of blood for peripheral blood cells will be&#xD;
           collected daily during the first cycle of aldesleukin administration and the day&#xD;
           following the last dose. 20 mLs of blood for serum and 50 mLs of blood for cell&#xD;
           separation will be obtained on days 2 through 4 following completion of IL-2&#xD;
           administration. On one of these days, an additional 50 mLs of blood for cell separation&#xD;
           or a 2 hour apheresis may be substituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately two months from the beginning of therapy, a response assessment will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with stable or regressing disease will receive a second complete treatment&#xD;
           course. Subsequent courses may be administered if there is evidence of on-going tumor&#xD;
           regression without long-term or irreversible toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first 5 patients of each diagnosis (metastatic renal cell cancer and melanoma)&#xD;
           the following cytokine levels will be assayed: VEGF, CD40L, FASL, TRAIL, GRO-alpha,&#xD;
           IP10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15,&#xD;
           TNF-alpha, TNF-beta; and the following phenotypic markers will be studied: CD3, CD4,&#xD;
           CD8, CD16, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD56, CD80, CD95, CD107a, CD152, FoxP3, annexin V.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first 10 patients have been analyzed, the scope of the tests will be narrowed&#xD;
           to those which show a response to IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially, a total of 127 evaluable patients with melanoma will be enrolled, with a&#xD;
           presumed 15% response rate. With the approval of amendment F, a new accrual ceiling of&#xD;
           200 patients with metastatic melanoma will be established to complete the proposed&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 100 evaluable patients with renal cell carcinoma will be enrolled with a&#xD;
           presumed 20% response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allowing for a small number of inevaluable patients, a total of 200 patients with&#xD;
           melanoma and 110 patients with renal cell carcinoma may be enrolled.&#xD;
