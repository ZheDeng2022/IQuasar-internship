  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Binding Potential in subjects with&#xD;
      ADHD and adults without ADHD: the intent being to demonstrate that C-11 Altropane PET can be&#xD;
      used to differentiate adults with ADHD from healthy control subjects.&#xD;

      This protocol seeks to replicate and extend our investigation of DAT binding in adults with&#xD;
      ADHD with specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine dopamine transporter (DAT) receptor binding potential in adults with ADHD,&#xD;
           using PET scanning with 11C altropane as the ligand. We hypothesize that compared to&#xD;
           adults without ADHD, adults with ADHD will have greater DAT binding that will not be&#xD;
           accounted by psychiatric comorbidity or age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the relationship of DAT binding to clinical features of ADHD. We hypothesize&#xD;
           that DAT binding will be positively correlated with a) severity of ADHD symptoms and b)&#xD;
           neuropsychological and interpersonal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the relationship between DAT binding and genetic risk factors. We hypothesize&#xD;
           that DAT binding will be specifically associated with homozygosity of the DAT (480) gene&#xD;
           in adults with ADHD and not with other ADHD-associated genetic markers (e.g., DRD4-7,&#xD;
           D2, DBH).&#xD;
