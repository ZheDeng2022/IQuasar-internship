      The primary objective of this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pilot study is to&#xD;
      determine if therapies aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol (HMGCoA reductase inhibitor -&#xD;
      simvastatin) or increasing HDL cholesterol (Niaspan) will induce regression of carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque in vivo using MRI imaging techniques. MR plaque morphology at baseline&#xD;
      will be compared to that after 6 and 12 months of therapy and changes in MR characteristics&#xD;
      will be compared to changes in lipoprotein parameters and urinary isoprostanes. The effect of&#xD;
      moderate LDL reduction, aggressive LDL reduction and the combination of aggressive LDL&#xD;
      reduction and HDL elevation on MRI plaque characteristics will be compared by randomly&#xD;
      assigning subjects (n=69) with carotid disease (&gt;30% stenosis by ultrasound criteria) to one&#xD;
      of three treatment arms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and placebo Niaspan (n=23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Simvastatin 80 mg daily and placebo Niaspan (n=23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and active Niaspan (n=23) Treatment group 2 and 3 will have&#xD;
           roughly equivalent LDL lowering because of the synergistic LDL lowering effect of the&#xD;

      FULL PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.0 SYNOPSIS The primary objective of this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pilot&#xD;
      study is to determine if therapies aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol (HMGCoA reductase&#xD;
      inhibitor - simvastatin) or increasing HDL cholesterol (Niaspan) will induce regression of&#xD;
      carotid atherosclerotic plaque in vivo using MRI imaging techniques. MR plaque morphology at&#xD;
      baseline will be compared to that after 6 and 12 months of therapy and changes in MR&#xD;
      characteristics will be compared to changes in lipoprotein parameters and urinary&#xD;
      isoprostanes. The effect of moderate LDL reduction, aggressive LDL reduction and the&#xD;
      combination of aggressive LDL reduction and HDL elevation on MRI plaque characteristics will&#xD;
      be compared by randomly assigning subjects (n=69) with carotid disease (&gt;30% stenosis by&#xD;
      ultrasound criteria) to one of three treatment arms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and placebo Niaspan (n=23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Simvastatin 80 mg daily and placebo Niaspan (n=23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and active Niaspan (n=23) Treatment group 2 and 3 will have&#xD;
           roughly equivalent LDL lowering because of the synergistic LDL lowering effect of the&#xD;
           combination of simvastatin and Niaspan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic carotid disease is the largest single etiological factor known&#xD;
      to produce focal cerebral ischemia (1). Only a small percentage of patients with asymptomatic&#xD;
      carotid atherosclerosis develop stroke but the majority of these have have no warning&#xD;
      symptoms. The degree of internal carotid stenosis at ultrasound angiography, the commonest&#xD;
      methods of assessing the risk of stroke, are poor predictors of stroke in patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (2) and clinical risk factors have a high prevalence but&#xD;
      a low relative risk of stroke in these patients. Most plaque rupture occurs in unstable lipid&#xD;
      rich plaques with thin fibrous caps weakened by inflammation and apoptosis (3). Thus, the&#xD;
      morphological characteristics of carotid plaques may provide important information regarding&#xD;
      ischemic risk of carotid lesions. We, and others, are using high resolution MR imaging (4-6)&#xD;
      to differentiate carotid plaque elements such as the lipid core, the fibrous cap and&#xD;
      hemorrhage with the ultimate goal of determining the ischemic potential of carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipid lowering therapy with statins is considered standard treatment for patients with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia (7-9). Statin therapy reduces LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels, cardiovascular events and death and retards the progression of atherosclerosis as&#xD;
      assessed by noninvasive intima-media thickness (IMT) on carotid ultrasound (10). However, the&#xD;
      optimal degree of LDL cholesterol lowering with statins in patients with atherosclerosis&#xD;
      remains unclear (7,8) - thus there are a number of ongoing large clinical trials comparing&#xD;
      the effect of low dose to high doses of statins on cardiovascular effects in patients with&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis (eg &quot;Treatment to New Targets&quot;). Low HDL cholesterol is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis (11). Niacin&#xD;
      is one of a few effective therapies that significantly elevates HDL levels and was shown to&#xD;
      reduce cardiovascular events in patients with known coronary atherosclerosis prior to the&#xD;
      development of statin drugs (12,13). Increased HDL is thought to promote reverse cholesterol&#xD;
      transport from the peripheral tissues including atherosclerotic plaque (14-16). Presently,&#xD;
      niacin is not considered standard therapy in patients with known atherosclerosis. Niaspan is&#xD;
      a new controlled-release form of niacin that is administered once daily, is better tolerated&#xD;
      than crystalline niacin which is given 3 times a day (17,18). It has been shown to result in&#xD;
      a greater than 30% increase in HDL cholesterol and preliminary data suggest that it is safe&#xD;
      and effective and not associated with hepatotoxicity (19). In the proposed study patients&#xD;
      (n=60) with carotid disease (&gt;30% stenosis by ultrasound criteria) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of three treatment arms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and placebo Niaspan (n=23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Simvastatin 80 mg daily and placebo Niaspan (n=23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Simvastatin 20 mg daily and active Niaspan (n=23) Thus, the effect of Simvastatin 10 mg&#xD;
           (moderate LDL reduction), Simvastatin 80 mg (aggressive LDL reduction) and the&#xD;
           combination of Simvastatin and Niaspan (aggressive LDL reduction and HDL elevation) on&#xD;
           MRI plaque characteristics will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pilot study is to&#xD;
      determine if therapies aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol (HMGCoA reductase inhibitors -&#xD;
      statins) or increasing HDL cholesterol (Niaspan) will induce regression of carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque in vivo using MRI imaging techniques. MR plaque morphology at baseline&#xD;
      will be compared to that after 6 and 12 months of therapy and changes in MR characteristics&#xD;
      will be compared to changes in lipoprotein parameters and urinary isoprostanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Primary End-Point The primary end-point is the change in carotid plaque volume at MRI&#xD;
      after 12 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Secondary End-Points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - change in carotid plaque lipid content at MRI after 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - change in lipid parameters after 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - change in urinary isoprostane excretion after 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;

      placebo Niaspan or (3) Simvastatin 20 mg and active Niaspan. The study will involve 6&#xD;
      outpatient visits to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the Hospital of the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania. Each visit will last approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Number of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty nine (69) subjects with known carotid atherosclerosis will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES The study will involve 6 outpatient visits to the General Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center (GCRC) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Each visit will&#xD;
      last approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Pre-treatment Period All subjects will be asked to come to GCRC for a screening visit.&#xD;
      During this visit, a complete medical history and physical examination will be performed.&#xD;
      Dosage of all chronic medication will be recorded. Supine resting blood pressure, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and the following fasting routine laboratory studies will be performed;&#xD;
      Hematology; hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, white blood count and platelet count Blood&#xD;
      chemistries; sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, fasting glucose, albumin, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, uric acid total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides&#xD;
      lipoprotein (a) and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinalysis Urinary HCG - for women of child bearing potential. Eligible subjects will undergo&#xD;
      a full dietary assessment by the GCRC research dietician using a quantitative questionnaire.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to comply with recommended AHA dietary guidelines so that dietary&#xD;
      intake of macronutrients including fat and cholesterol will be similar across all subjects.&#xD;
      Dietary compliance will be monitored at baseline and each study visit by 24-hour recall of&#xD;
      dietary intake. The Dietary Analysis System (DIETSYS) will be used to analyze the food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaires and the Food Processor Plus (ver 6.0) will be used to analyze&#xD;
      dietary recalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Concurrent Treatment The use of most concurrent medications will not be restricted during&#xD;
      the study period. Indeed, aspirin use and antihypertensive therapies will be encouraged when&#xD;
      appropriate. Lipid lowering medications, other than those in the study will be stopped prior&#xD;
      to randomization. For example all HMGCoA reductase inhibitors will be replaced by simvastatin&#xD;
      at the time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Treatment Period Eligible subjects will be asked to collect a 12-hour urine sample prior&#xD;
      to randomization and bring them to the GCRC on the morning of randomization where they will&#xD;
      be processed and stored until analysis. Baseline blood samples will be collected for&#xD;
      hematology, chemistry and lipoprotein analysis as per screening. Subjects will undergo micro&#xD;
      MRI scans of the carotid arteries in the MRI center adjacent to the GCRC. A subset of&#xD;
      volunteers (n=10) will be asked to undergo a second baseline MRI scan within a week of the&#xD;
      first scan in order to determine the reproducibility of the quantitative MRI technique.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized in a double blind manner to (1) Simvastatin 20 mg and&#xD;
      placebo Niaspan, (2) Simvastatin 80 mg and placebo Niaspan or (3) Simvastatin 20 mg and&#xD;
      active Niaspan. Simvastatin tablets will be provided by Merck Pharmaceuticals, the&#xD;
      manufacturer of Simvastatin. Niaspan tablets (500mg) and matching placebo will be provided by&#xD;
      KOS, the company that manufactures Niaspan. Niaspan will be titrated according to clinical&#xD;
      guidelines - 500 mg at bedtime for 1 month, 1000 mg at bedtime for the next month and finally&#xD;
      2000 mg at bedtime for the rest of the study. At the randomization visit, these specific&#xD;
      instructions for titration of Niaspan or placebo (given in matching tablets in an identical&#xD;
      way) will be discussed and given to each subject with a one-month supply of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Niaspan (KOS Pharmaceuticals) and simvastatin (Zocor; Merck Pharmaceuticals) are&#xD;
      commercially available drugs that are FDA approved for management of hyperlipidemia at the&#xD;
      doses, formulation and route of administration proposed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return visits will be scheduled for 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At each of these visits history,&#xD;
      physical exam and blood testing (hematology, chemistry, fasting lipoproteins) will be&#xD;
      undertaken. In addition, urine collections and MRI studies will be performed at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. Known adverse effects, such as flushing and muscle cramps will be screened for at&#xD;
      each visit. Subjects will be discontinued from the study for the following reasons;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. intolerable side effects from the study medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increase in either ALT or AST greater than 3 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HbA1c&gt;9%&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. uric acid &gt;11.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be asked to increase study medication to 2000mg daily at bedtime after&#xD;
      the second month. Every attempt will be made to titrate the Niaspan/placebo to 2000mg per&#xD;
      day, but if this is not possible the subject will be maintained on the maximal achievable&#xD;
      dose. The duration of the study is 12 months. All assessments will be made by personnel&#xD;
      blinded to the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Duration of the Study The duration of the entire study will be approximately 18 months.&#xD;
      Actual study drug treatment will be of 12 months duration. Each subject will undergo&#xD;
      screening approximately 2 weeks prior to randomization and it is anticipated that subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled over a 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Premature Withdrawal from the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A volunteer may be withdrawn from the trial for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any adverse event thought to warrant withdrawal by the investigator,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poor compliance thought to warrant withdrawal by the investigator,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteer's desire to withdraw from the study at any time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol or entry criteria violation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for withdrawal and the final outcome in cases of adverse events will be&#xD;
      documented on the Case Report Form. Subjects who do not complete the study will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 EFFICACY ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Variables to be measured for Efficacy Assessment Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Carotid&#xD;
      Atherosclerotic Plaques: A variety of MRI techniques have been optimized to permit sufficient&#xD;
      resolution to determine size and composition of atherosclerotic plaque. These include&#xD;
      &quot;black-blood&quot; imaging techniques, fast spin echo sequences, and fat suppression techniques in&#xD;
      addition to customized coils (4-6). Customized surface coils will be constructed to further&#xD;
      improve the signal-to-noise ratio. While the coils and some of the sequences are not FDA&#xD;
      approved as they are custom built, they all fall under the category of &quot;non-significant risk&#xD;
      devices&quot;. These techniques have already been established for this purpose at the MRI center&#xD;
      at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The imaging protocol consists of a&#xD;
      combination of black blood (fast spin echo and double inversion recovery fast spin echo&#xD;
      sequences) and bright blood imaging (time-of-flight MRA sequence) to achieve optimal contrast&#xD;
      between the arterial lumen and the vessel wall. Specifically, the following sequences are&#xD;
      obtained: (1) 3D time of flight (TOF) MRA of the carotid bifurcation; (2) axial T1-weighted&#xD;
      fast spin echo; (3) axial proton density-weighted weighted double inversion recovery fast&#xD;
      spin echo (DIR-FSE) through plaque; and (4) axial T2-weighted weighted DIR-FSE through&#xD;
      plaque. Total plaque volume will be quantified as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque volume = (computer assisted calculation of region of interest-ROI) x (slice thickness)&#xD;
      x (no. of slices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque composition will be estimated using established imaging criteria for the 4 image&#xD;
      contrast weightings (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 Criteria used for identification of plaque constituents. TOF T1-W PD-W T2-W&#xD;
      Calcification Low Low Low Low Hemorrhage High High/Moderate Variable Variable Lipid core&#xD;
      Moderate High High Variable Fibrous cap Moderate/Low Moderate High Variable Note: Intensity&#xD;
      descriptors are relative to intensity of sternocleidomastoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoprotein Determination: Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, lipoprotein&#xD;
      (a) and triglyceride levels will be determined by standardized techniques in the routine&#xD;
      chemistry laboratory of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary Isoprostanes: Urinary isoprostanes will be measured by mass spectrometry / gas&#xD;
      chromatography (GC / MS) as previously described by the PI (20). Following the addition of a&#xD;
      deuterated isoprostane internal standard, urine samples are extracted from the aqueous matrix&#xD;
      by solid phase extraction techniques, purified by thin layer chromatography, derivatized, and&#xD;
      analyzed by GC / MS in the negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mode. Quantification is&#xD;
      accomplished by taking the ratio of the area under the peak of the ion representing the&#xD;
      endogenous compound to that of the internal standard.All subjects who complete the study will&#xD;
      be considered evaluable for efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Criteria for Evaluability of Efficacy Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who complete the study will be considered evaluable for efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 SAFETY ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Variables to be Measured for Safety Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures to be monitored include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. symptoms (flushing, abdominal pain, tiredness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. transaminases&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. uric acid&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Criteria for Evaluability of Safety Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects entered into the trial will be considered evaluable for safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no data available on the effect of therapies on carotid atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque morphology using MRI on which to base sample size estimations. Therefore, sample sizes&#xD;
      are based on the desire to acquire pilot data to allow the determination of the actual&#xD;
      numbers required for a study examining both MR characteristics and clinical endpoints. A&#xD;
      sample size of 69 (23 subjects per arm) will provide 80% power to detect the hypothesized&#xD;
      difference (15%) in the primary endpoint (plaque volume) between 2 different treatment arms&#xD;
      at an alpha of 0.05. The number of subjects needed for future full-scale clinical studies&#xD;
      will be dependent on the coefficient of variation of repeated baseline quantitative MRI scans&#xD;
      and the change in plaque volume (primary end-point) following an intervention. These&#xD;
      parameters will be defined by the proposed pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.0 DATA COLLECTION, MONITORING AND AE REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.1 Case Report Forms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be provided for each subject. Subjects must not be identified&#xD;
      by name on any study documents. Subjects will be identified by the Patient Identification&#xD;
      Number (PIN) and Study Identification Number (SID). All data on the CRF will be legibly&#xD;
      recorded in black ink or typed. Corrections will be made by striking the incorrect entry with&#xD;
      a single line through it and then adding the correct information adjacent to it. The&#xD;
      corrections will be initialed and dated by the investigator or designated qualified&#xD;
      individual. Any requested information that is not obtained as specified in the protocol will&#xD;
      be indicated on the CRFs as &quot;not done&quot; (ND) or &quot;not applicable&quot; (NA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRF design and data management will be performed by the PI and research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will review the research records for accuracy, completeness and legibility. The&#xD;
      investigator or designated qualified individual will make study documents (eg consent forms,&#xD;
      drug distribution forms, case report forms) and pertinent hospital or clinic records&#xD;
      available for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for conformation of the&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4 Adverse Experience (AE) Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Experiences (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study and such events will be&#xD;
      recorded on the Adverse Experience Case Report Forms. An AE is defined as any unfavorable and&#xD;
      unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated&#xD;
      with the use of the study medication, whether or not considered related to the use of the&#xD;
      product. The AEs will be graded on a three-point scale (mild, moderate severe) and a drug&#xD;
      relationship assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any serious or unexpected adverse events will be reported within 24 hours to the FDA and the&#xD;
      IRB of the University of Pennsylvania. Adverse events are defined as serious when they are&#xD;
      fatal, life-threatening or result in in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of&#xD;
      hospitalization. In addition the occurrence of malignancy is always considered serious&#xD;
      adverse advents. Adverse events are considered unexpected if their occurrence, or severity or&#xD;
      frequency have not been previously reported in concomitance with Niaspan or HMGCoA reductase&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol will be reviewed by the committee on Studies involving Human Beings at the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania. A copy of the letter of approval and correspondence with the IRB&#xD;
      will be retained by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
