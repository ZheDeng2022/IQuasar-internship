  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) must perform daily bronchial drainage therapy (BD) to keep&#xD;
      their airways clear of secretions. Many different techniques are available to achieve this&#xD;
      and there is currently no agreement as to which form of therapy is most effective. High&#xD;
      frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO is used for this purpose by CF patients throughout&#xD;
      the United States and abroad. To perform this therapy, the patient wears a vest which fits&#xD;
      over the entire torso and is connected to an air compressor. The compressor generates&#xD;
      oscillating air pulses that are transmitted to the lungs, thereby mobilizing secretions. The&#xD;
      oscillations produced by the most commonly used device have a sinusoidal wave form (The Vestâ„¢&#xD;
      Airway Clearance System, Hill-Rom Inc, St Paul, MN). Previous studies indicate this form of&#xD;
      therapy is as effective as more traditional and cumbersome forms of therapy. The design of&#xD;
      the pulse generator has been recently modified so that the oscillations produced have a&#xD;
      triangular wave form (Respitech Inc, MN). Studies done at the University of Minnesota found&#xD;
      that the air flows induced in the airways can vary substantially depending on the wave form&#xD;
      applied to the chest. At present, the impact of using a triangular wave form on mucus removal&#xD;
      is unknown. The proposed study will compare mucous clearance using a device generating sine&#xD;
      wave oscillations to a device generating triangular wave oscillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Bronchial drainage using a triangular wave form of HFCWO will result in superior&#xD;
      sputum production compared to HFCWO using a sine wave form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial drainage using a triangular wave form of HFCWO may result in sputum with rheologic&#xD;
      properties distinct from sputum produced while using sine wave HFCWO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial drainage using a triangular wave form of HFCWO may result in superior post-therapy&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests compared to pulmonary function tests obtained following therapy with&#xD;
      sine wave HFCWO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perceive bronchial drainage using a triangular wave form of HFCWO as more&#xD;
      comfortable than airway clearance using sine wave HFCWO.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participation in the study will be for 4 days. During initial subject recruitment,&#xD;
      investigators will review inclusion and exclusion criteria with potential subjects. Upon&#xD;
      enrollment, qualifying subjects will be asked to perform their last BD of the day at 8 PM on&#xD;
      the day, but will be allowed to continue with the rest of their routine therapeutic regimen&#xD;
      (including aerosols). They will be instructed to come on day 1 of the study at 8 AM. During&#xD;
      this visit, they will complete a brief questionnaire and undergo an abbreviated physical&#xD;
      exam, concentrating on chest findings. The questionnaire and exam will be used to confirm all&#xD;
      subjects meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The current therapeutic regimen&#xD;
      being followed on day one of the study will be reviewed and the patient will be asked not to&#xD;
      make any changes during the study period. Subjects will then perform pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      spirometry, and lung volumes via body plethysmography. A sputum specimen will be collected&#xD;
      for rheologic studies in a special container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once this is completed, the patient will perform a 30 minute BD session according to the&#xD;
      first treatment of the randomly allocated sequence. The vest, or jacket, worn by the subject&#xD;
      differs for the sine wave and triangular wave devices. Subjects will be blinded as to the&#xD;
      type of system used at each session. Blinding will be accomplished by the patient wearing eye&#xD;
      blinds of the type used commercially for assisting sleep. Investigators will assist the&#xD;
      patient with putting on the HFCWO device. A large, lightweight poncho will then be placed&#xD;
      over the patients head, thereby concealing the vest and attached equipment. The blinds will&#xD;
      then be removed and the patient will subsequently put on a set of ear protectors used&#xD;
      commercially for workers with noise exposure. This will prevent the patients from recognizing&#xD;
      the difference in the sounds produced by the two devices. Only the respiratory therapist&#xD;
      supervising the session will know of the treatment assignment. It is possible the subjects&#xD;
      will be able to differentiate the two devices despite these measures to blind treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects will use the vest devices provided by the investigators rather than bringing their&#xD;
      vest devices from home. Prior to initiating the study, both devices will be tested, and&#xD;
      adjusted as necessary, to ensure &quot;dialed in&quot; pressures and frequencies are accurately&#xD;
      delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this session all the sputum produced will be collected in pre-weighed special&#xD;
      containers and sealed for immediate processing. Patients will use their routine combination&#xD;
      of aerosols in conjunction with the BD session. At the end of the 30 minute session the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to produce a second sputum specimen which will be collected for&#xD;
      rheologic studies in a special container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this is completed, pulmonary function measurements will be repeated. The patient will&#xD;
      then undergo an abbreviated physical exam and complete a brief questionnaire (included in&#xD;
      this application). The 8-item survey instrument focuses on adverse effects and comfort&#xD;
      associated with use of the HFCWO device, primarily using a 5-point scale. Responses to the&#xD;
      experience of using each device will be compared using standard statistical methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be discharged after the measurements are completed and will be asked to&#xD;
      return 3 days later for the second treatment in the allocated sequence. The patient will be&#xD;
      asked to continue in the interim with their daily routines, trying not to make major changes&#xD;
      in physical activity, environmental exposures or fluid intake. For the second treatment, the&#xD;
      patient will be instructed again to perform BD at 8 PM on the evening before the return&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second visit, subjects will undergo the same routine followed during the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sputum that the patient produces during a therapy session will be collected in&#xD;
      pre-weighed specimen containers and sealed immediately. After the specimen is weighed ('raw&#xD;
      wet weight'), the specimen will be centrifuged at 27,000 g for 15 minutes at 4oC and the&#xD;
      supernatant will be carefully and completely discarded. This step eliminates any fluid coming&#xD;
      from saliva that may have contaminated the specimen. The container with the sputum pellet&#xD;
      will be weighed again ('wet weight') and left open in an oven with the temperature set at&#xD;
      150o F for 3 days to allow for complete desiccation. After this, the container will be&#xD;
      weighed again to determine the sputum 'dry weight'. The 'raw wet weight' of the specimen&#xD;
      collected at the end of the session for rheologic studies will be recorded and its dry weight&#xD;
      will be calculated by extrapolation from the 'wet weight' and 'dry weight' obtained in the&#xD;
      larger specimen. The addition of the weights for these two specimens will give the total&#xD;
      sputum production for the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform spirometry and lung volumes determination by body plethysmography at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of each BD session. At the same time, oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      determined by earlobe pulse oxymetry. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and Forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be obtained from the spirometry results; patients will perform&#xD;
      single-breath nitrogen washout. All tests will be performed following the techniques which&#xD;
      are already standard at the pediatric pulmonary laboratory and which follow the strict&#xD;
      American Thoracic Society guidelines . All results will be expressed as the percent of&#xD;
      predicted for age, gender and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum Rheologic Properties The specimen collected at the end of each session will be weighed&#xD;
      and frozen immediately at -70oC. The samples will be sent later to Dr. Bruce Rubin, Wake&#xD;
      Forest University, Winston-Salem NC for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Data Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: For each patient the sputum production during each treatment period will be&#xD;
      determined by recording the total 'wet' sputum weights obtained during each treatment period.&#xD;
      Sputum weights will be averaged for each treatment arm to obtain the mean 'wet' sputum&#xD;
      productions for each treatment, and analyzed by analysis of variance for differences between&#xD;
      the means. The sputum dry weights will be analyzed similarly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Percent change will be calculated for the FVC, FEV1, and Single-breath&#xD;
      nitrogen washout seen in each patient during a given treatment period. The mean percent&#xD;
      change will be calculated for each treatment and differences between these will be analyzed&#xD;
      by analysis of variance. The same procedure will be followed for the rheologic measures.&#xD;
