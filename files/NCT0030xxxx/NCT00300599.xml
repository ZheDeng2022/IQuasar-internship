  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) briefly means cessation of breathing during sleep at least 5&#xD;
      times per hour. Sleep-disordered breathing affects 9 to 24% of the middle-aged and overall 4%&#xD;
      of the middle-aged males suffers from Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) i.e. SDB with&#xD;
      associated daytime sleepiness. Several major epidemiological studies have shown that SDB is&#xD;
      not only an independent risk factor for systemic hypertension but it is also associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, and sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms for the linkage between Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      are not fully determined but surges in sympathetic nerve activity are seen at the end of each&#xD;
      apneic episode accompanied by large rises in systemic arterial blood pressure (BP). The&#xD;
      increased levels of muscle sympathetic nerve activity are diminished by nasal continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Numerous studies have found a hypercoagulable state&#xD;
      in terms of increased clotting factor and platelet activities, and impaired fibrinolysis in&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, ischaemic stroke, and sleep-disordered breathing. Common carotid&#xD;
      artery intima-media thickness (IMT) has been shown to correlate with traditional vascular&#xD;
      risk factors and may predict the likelihood of acute coronary events and stroke. Recently,&#xD;
      carotid artery intima-media thickness has been shown to have positive correlations with the&#xD;
      severity of sleep disordered breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite robust evidence showing improvement of symptoms, cognitive function and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea treated with nasal continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure, there are conflicting short-term data whether continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      can reduce blood pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled study aims to assess the long-term effects of nasal continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure on 1) 24 hr systemic blood pressure; 2) Coagulation state; and 3) Carotid artery&#xD;
      intimal media thickness.&#xD;

      Subjects and Methods: We propose to carry out a prospective, randomized controlled study on&#xD;
      100 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, as defined by&#xD;
      overnight sleep study showing Apnea- hypopnoea index (AHI) &gt;or=5 per hour of sleep plus&#xD;
      Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) ≥10.1 The patients will be recruited from the Respiratory&#xD;
      Clinic, Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), Shatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep assessment: Overnight diagnostic polysomnography(PSG) [Healthdyne Alice 4, USA] will be&#xD;
      performed at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong for every subject on the first night&#xD;
      recording electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, submental electromyogram, bilateral&#xD;
      anterior tibial electromyogram, electrocardiogram, chest and abdominal wall movement by&#xD;
      inductance plethysmography, airflow measured by a nasal pressure transducer [PTAF2, Pro-Tech,&#xD;
      Woodinville, WA, USA]and supplemented by oronasal airflow thermister, and finger pulse&#xD;
      oximetry as in our previous studies.2,3 Sleep stages will be scored according to standard&#xD;
      criteria by Rechtshaffen and Kales.4 Apnoea is defined as cessation of airflow for &gt; 10&#xD;
      seconds and hypopnea as a reduction of airflow of &gt; 50% for &gt; 10 seconds plus an oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation of &gt; 3% or an arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be fitted with the Ultralite&#xD;
      Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (Spacelabs Medical, Redmond, WA) via an arm cuff as&#xD;
      out-patients during normal activities and monitored for 48 hrs prior to commencement of&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure or conservative treatment. The patients' arm&#xD;
      circumference will be measured at the biceps level and an appropriate sized arm cuff will be&#xD;
      applied. The machine will be programmed for cuff inflation measurement every 30 minutes for&#xD;
      48 hrs and can only be removed for bathing. Patients will be asked to abstain from&#xD;
      caffeine-containing products during this time but to continue their normal daily activities.&#xD;
      Patients will record the time they retire to bed and the subsequent time of waking in order&#xD;
      to identify the sleep period. Data gathered before 6pm on the second evening will be&#xD;
      discarded to allow for acclimatization and the analysis will be performed with the second 24&#xD;
      hr of data (6pm to 6am).5 Data will be manually checked for artifact by our respiratory&#xD;
      fellow, who will be blinded to the treatment status of the patient. Ambulatory Blood Pressure&#xD;
      Monitoring will be repeated for all patients with significant OSAS at 3, 6, and 12 months of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative treatment 6 months followed by continuous positive airway pressure 6 months vs&#xD;
      Concurrent continuous positive airway pressure+ Conservative treatment for 12 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome from the overnight&#xD;
      sleep study with Apnoea hyponea index ≥ 5/hr and Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≥10 and completion&#xD;
      of baseline Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring, each patient will be interviewed by the&#xD;
      physician on duty and randomized by computer into either Group 1) Conservative treatment for&#xD;
      the first 6 months followed by therapeutic Continuous positive airway pressure for the next 6&#xD;
      months or Group 2) Conservative treatment plus therapeutic Continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure for 12 months. As sleepiness is the main indication for Continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure treatment, we have decided that a randomized placebo controlled design is not&#xD;
      feasible for this long-term study. The research nurse responsible for randomization of&#xD;
      patients to different treatment arms will not participate in outcome assessments, which will&#xD;
      be conducted by a different team of nurses who are not aware of the randomization status of&#xD;
      the patients.6,7 Group 1: After confirmation of significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,&#xD;
      the patients will be informed about the nature of their disease and the need to start&#xD;
      treatment. They are encouraged to a) avoid sleep deprivation by having sufficient hours of&#xD;
      sleep every night; b) sleep in lateral positions; c) avoid sedatives and alcohol consumption;&#xD;
      and d) lose weight by following a home diet prescribed by a dietitian.8 The patients will be&#xD;
      reviewed at the respiratory clinic at 1, 3 and 6 months to re-assess their sleepiness &amp; body&#xD;
      mass index. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be repeated at 3, 6, and 12 months. On&#xD;
      completion of the conservative treatment and evaluation including ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring at 6 months, patients in group 1 will be started on therapeutic continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure treatment, as outlined under group 2, after an overnight continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure titration study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients in the therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure arm will be given a&#xD;
      short trial of continuous positive airway pressure therapy with the Autoset (Resmed, Sydney,&#xD;
      Australia) device for approximately 30 minutes for acclimatization in the afternoon. Each&#xD;
      patient will be given a basic CPAP education programme by our respiratory nurse supplemented&#xD;
      by education brochure.2 Attended continuous positive airway pressure titration will be&#xD;
      performed with the Autoset auto-titrating device on the second night of the polysomonograph&#xD;
      study. All patients will be prescribed the Horizon LT 8001 continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure device (De Vilbiss, Somerset, PA, USA) with a time counter recording machine run&#xD;
      time. The continuous positive airway pressure pressure for each patient will be set at the&#xD;
      minimum pressure needed to abolish snoring, obstructive respiratory events and airflow&#xD;
      limitation for 95% of the night as determined by the overnight Autoset continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure titration study. 2,3 The patients will be followed up at the Respiratory&#xD;
      clinic at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and the objective continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      compliance will be measured from the time counter. All patients in each arm will be followed&#xD;
      up at the Respiratory clinic regularly and the objective continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      usage will be measured from the time counter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to commencement of conservative treatment or nasal continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      , all patients have to go through several measurements. These include assessment of&#xD;
      subjective sleepiness with the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS),9 quality of life with the&#xD;
      Calgary Sleep Apnoea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI), 10 hemostatic assays (DD, TAT,&#xD;
      fibrinogen, vWF:ag),11 and evaluation of carotid artery initimal media thickness.12-14 The&#xD;
      ESS is a questionnaire specific to symptoms of daytime sleepiness and the patients are asked&#xD;
      to score the likelihood of falling asleep in eight different situations with different levels&#xD;
      of stimulation, adding up to a total score of 0 to 24.9 The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of&#xD;
      Life Index (SAQLI) has 35 questions organized into four domains: daily functioning, social&#xD;
      interactions, emotional functioning and symptoms with a fifth domain, treatment-related&#xD;
      symptoms, to record the possible negative impacts of treatment. It contains items shown to be&#xD;
      important to patients with sleep apnea and is designed as a measure of outcome in clinical&#xD;
      trials in sleep apnea.10 The early version of the Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index&#xD;
      (SAQLI) was applied previously to our study on Chinese obstructive sleep aonoea patients on&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure 2 but an updated version will be applied to this study.15&#xD;
      Carotid artery intimal media thickness will be assessed with B-mode Doppler according to a&#xD;
      standardized scanning protocol for the right and left carotid arteries using images of the&#xD;
      far wall of the distal 10 mm of the common carotid arteries as described by Woo et al&#xD;
      previously.12-14 Carotid scans will be analyzed with a computerized edge-detection system&#xD;
      that have previously been described and validated.12,16 Two end-diastolic frames are&#xD;
      selected, digitized, and analyzed for mean intimal media thickness, and the average reading&#xD;
      from these 2 frames is calculated for both right and left carotid arteries. The carotid scan&#xD;
      operator is blinded to the identity of studied subjects and stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemostatic assays: After resting for 20 min in the sitting position, blood is obtained&#xD;
      following the polysomongraphy recording through an indwelling 22-gauge venous forearm cannula&#xD;
      that has been inserted the night before to minimize hemostatic activation due to emotions&#xD;
      related to an impending venepuncture.11 The first 2 ml of blood will be discarded and another&#xD;
      15 ml of blood will be drawn into sterile ethylenediamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA)-&#xD;
      containing tubes (Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems; Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA).&#xD;
      Plasma samples are obtained by centrifugation in plastic tubes at -80C until further&#xD;
      processing. Plasma TAT and DD levels are measured by ELIZA as per the manufacturers&#xD;
      instructions (Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc., South Bend, Indiana, USA and Diagnostica&#xD;
      Stago, Asnieres, France). Plasma fibrinogen levels (g/l) are determined using a commercially&#xD;
      available assay (Thrombo-S, Dade Behring, Germany). Plasma levels of vWF:ag are measured&#xD;
      following a previously described ELISA 17 using commercial antibodies (DAKO Corp.,&#xD;
      Carpinteria, California, USA) and substrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of interest: Changes in mean systemic blood pressure between group 1 and&#xD;
      group 2 at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome of interest: Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the 2&#xD;
      groups at 6 &amp; 12 months; serial changes of carotid intimal media thickness between the two&#xD;
      treatment groups over 12 months; serial changes in hemostatic assays (TAT, DD, fibrinogen,&#xD;
      vWF:ag) between the two groups at 1 month and 6 months after treatment; Continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure compliance at 6, and 12 months; Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the&#xD;
      Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
