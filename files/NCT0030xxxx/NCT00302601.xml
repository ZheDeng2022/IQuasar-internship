      INTRODUCTION This project assesses both scintigraphic diagnosis and the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      right heart strain in acute pulmonary embolism. The primary purposes are to validate various&#xD;
      scintigraphic methods with pulmonary angiography as the standard of reference (purpose A).&#xD;
      Furthermore, this project examines the relative contributions of 1) vascular obstruction, 2)&#xD;
      vasoactive mediators, and 3) co-morbidity to the generation of right heart strain (purpose&#xD;
      B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND FOR PURPOSE A Acute pulmonary embolism is a life threatening condition. Early&#xD;
      intervention can be lifesaving but treatment is associated with severe side effects. Thus,&#xD;
      establishing accurate diagnosis is necessary. Clinical presentation and physical examination&#xD;
      have proven insufficient for this purpose. This is also true for basic diagnostic&#xD;
      investigations, e.g. electrocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis and chest x-ray, which&#xD;
      are considered standard tests in patients with symptoms consistent with cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several decades lung scintigraphy has been considered a cornerstone in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute pulmonary embolism. Planar two-dimensional images of the pulmonary perfusion are&#xD;
      obtained using a gamma camera after intravenous injection of radiolabelled microparticles,&#xD;
      depicting perfusion defects caused by e.g. a pulmonary embolus. Similarly, ventilatory&#xD;
      function can be assessed two-dimensionally by planar scintigraphic imaging following&#xD;
      inhalation of a radioactive gas or aerosol. Lung scintigraphy has certain limitations,&#xD;
      primarily related to image interpretation. The PIOPED criteria, based on the combined&#xD;
      ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, have gained global acceptance, but are often inconclusive&#xD;
      and give rise to misunderstandings. A different set of interpretation criteria, provided by&#xD;
      the PISA-PED study group, are based solely on perfusion imaging. Opposite the PIOPED&#xD;
      criteria, PISA-PED criteria are always conclusive and exhibits both high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity. The latter have, however, not gained the same widespread acceptance as the&#xD;
      PIOPED criteria. It remains uncertain which set of criteria is the better to confirm or&#xD;
      exclude the diagnosis of acute pulmonary. A prospective trial evaluating both PIOPED criteria&#xD;
      (original and revised) and PISA-PED criteria against a valid standard of reference therefore&#xD;
      seems appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more resource demanding single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has recently&#xD;
      been subject to renewed interest in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, but it remains&#xD;
      unclear whether this technique offers additional information compared to conventional planar&#xD;
      imaging. SPECT offers three-dimensional images, but otherwise the technique is similar to the&#xD;
      methods described for planar images. Combining the PISA-PED criteria and SPECT imaging has&#xD;
      not yet been tested in a prospective trial, but it seems highly relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the diagnosis is often suspected several times in the same patient, the ability to&#xD;
      distinguish acute and chronic changes in the scintigrams are essential. It is, however,&#xD;
      unclear to what extend and how fast the scintigraphic changes resolve. This has great&#xD;
      implications in scintigraphic control of patients recovering from acute pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial regarding the statements above requires a reliable method to test whether the patient&#xD;
      is suffering from acute pulmonary embolism or not: a standard of reference. Pulmonary&#xD;
      angiography is traditionally conceived as the standard of reference in acute pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, but only a few newer studies employ this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND FOR PURPOSE B Right heart strain is a common finding in acute pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
      It is a result of the sudden increase in pressure in the pulmonary circulation.&#xD;
      Ultrasonographic examination of the heart by echocardiography is suitable to demonstrate this&#xD;
      condition and this finding in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism is associated with a&#xD;
      considerably worse prognosis. The degree of right heart strain is not exclusively determined&#xD;
      by extension or size of the embolus. There is substantial evidence of the influence of both&#xD;
      co-morbidity and the release of vasoactive mediators on the extend of right heart strain. The&#xD;
      exact interplay between these three factors is not completely understood in humans. Albeit,&#xD;
      this can have significant implications on therapy, since pharmacological manipulation of&#xD;
      vascular tone in the pulmonary circulation is possible. This treatment is, however, not&#xD;
      without risk, and no well-designed study has yet addressed these issues in patients with&#xD;
      acute pulmonary embolism. Several case reports on successful treatment with vasodilation,&#xD;
      e.g. with inhaled nitric oxide, have been published. A more profound understanding of the&#xD;
      etiology of acute right heart failure in acute pulmonary embolism is therefore desirable.&#xD;
      What is the individual contribution of 1) clot burden, 2) release of vasoactive mediators,&#xD;
      and 3) co-morbidity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, acute pulmonary embolism has been divided into three categories depending on&#xD;
      clinical presentation and echocardiographic findings: 1) massive; in which the patient&#xD;
      suffers from cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. Most authorities agree that these patients&#xD;
      should be treated with fibrinolytic agents. 2) Non-massive; with no signs of shock or right&#xD;
      heart strain. In these patients there is no indication for fibrinolytic agents. 3)&#xD;
      Sub-massive; with no manifestations of shock but echocardiographic findings consistent with&#xD;
      right heart strain. The indication for fibrinolytic treatment in this last group is&#xD;
      unresolved. This study will address whether simple methods, e.g. peripheral blood sampling&#xD;
      and perfusion scintigraphy can determine the primary mechanism in the generation of right&#xD;
      heart strain in the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A later (not yet planned) intervention study based on the abovementioned knowledge could then&#xD;
      address the following question: Should the patient with sub-massive pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      receive treatment with fibrinolytic agents (in the case of major clot burden and minor degree&#xD;
      of pulmonary vasoconstriction) or vasodilators (minor clot burden, major degree of pulmonary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction)?&#xD;
