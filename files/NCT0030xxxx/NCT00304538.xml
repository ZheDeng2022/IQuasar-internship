  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the safest dose of very low dose glucagon to prevent&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in patients with Type I diabetes who use insulin pumps and to measure the the&#xD;
      amount of glucagon in the blood and see how the body responds to the glucagon.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glucagon is currently used to treat severe hypoglycemia. DiObex believes that glucagon&#xD;
      replacement therapy with very low doses of glucagon may prevent hypoglycemia without&#xD;
      compromising effective glycemic control by insulin. In this study very low doses of glucagon&#xD;
      will administered to Type I diabetics who use insulin pumps. The glucagon will be&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously overnight for 6, 9 or 12 hours to see if the number of mild or&#xD;
      impending hypoglycemia events can be safely decreased. Three different doses of glucagon will&#xD;
      be compared to a control infusion.&#xD;
