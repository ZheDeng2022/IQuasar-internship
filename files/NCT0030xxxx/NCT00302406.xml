  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind study looking at the efficacy and satisfaction of Concerta&#xD;
      substitution in adult subjects with ADHD receiving immediate release methylphenidate.&#xD;
      Subjects will be administered a maximum dose of 1.3mg/kg/day of either methylphenidate or&#xD;
      Concerta. The specific hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: ADHD symptomatology in adults with DSM-IV, ADHD will continue to be controlled&#xD;
      in patients switched from MPH IR TID to Concerta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patient satisfaction will not decrease in patients switched from MPH IR TID to&#xD;
      Concerta (ie., all patients will be equally or more satisfied on Concerta as compared with&#xD;
      MPH IR TID.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concerta was specifically developed to replace three times a day immediate release (IR)&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MPH). The clinical advantages offered by this novel compound go beyond ease&#xD;
      of administration. By avoiding the peaks and valleys of serum levels associated with IR MPH,&#xD;
      treatment with Concerta minimizes adverse effects at peaks and break through symptoms at&#xD;
      valleys securing clinical coverage throughout the day, minimizing the risks of adverse&#xD;
      effects from serum fluctuations that can occur with multiple dosing of the IR formulation of&#xD;
      MPH. This unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Concerta is potentially&#xD;
      particularly advantageous in the treatment of adults with ADHD because a) adults with ADHD&#xD;
      tend to be forgetful; b) forgetfulness makes the self administration of treatment three times&#xD;
      a day difficult; c) forgetfulness can lead to poor compliance and drop off of effects over&#xD;
      time with its attendant detrimental effect on clinical control and quality of life. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized by the pharmacy to CONCERTA or to continue MPH IR TID in a ratio of 4:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes: 1) a six-week design to document the response rate 2) assessment of the&#xD;
      impact of either MPH IR or Concerta on functional capacities 3) careful assessment of safety&#xD;
      and tolerability&#xD;

             reasons: a) the assessment instruments are not available and have not been adequately&#xD;
             standardized in other languages; b) our clinical trials facility is located in&#xD;
             Cambridge and not in the MGH main campus without the availability of translators; and&#xD;
             c) even if such translation services were to be available, the assessments in the&#xD;
             English language conducted by English speaking clinicians and raters with English&#xD;
             speaking subjects is already extremely time consuming lasting many hours making it&#xD;
             unfeasible, unrealistic, and of dubious clinical validity to conduct them with a&#xD;
             translator with non English speaking subjects; d) psychiatric questionnaires and&#xD;
             evaluations are taxing and adding the complexity of a translator has the potential to&#xD;
             make the patient experience even more exhausting.&#xD;
