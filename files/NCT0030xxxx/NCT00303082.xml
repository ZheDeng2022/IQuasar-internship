  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial intends to evaluate the efficacy of specially designed probiotics to prevent&#xD;
      premature birth and related neonatal morbidity associated to intra-uterine infection. The&#xD;
      tested probiotics are efficacious to decrease the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that the early administration of those probiotics to pregnant women with&#xD;
      bacterial vaginosis can prevent premature birth through antibiotic activity and modulation of&#xD;
      the immune response to infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is designed to be a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial that will&#xD;
      screen asymptomatic low risk pregnant women without indication of elective premature birth&#xD;
      admitted before the 20th week of pregnancy (Date of LMP and ultrasound) in prenatal care&#xD;
      public services involved in the project in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Relevant prognostic&#xD;
      factors will be registered: history of premature birth, race and low body index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical screening will be followed by a further screening process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. vaginal pH exam will be determined by taking a swab and rolling it on a glass slide that&#xD;
           will be touched by a pH stick . This procedure will immediately exclude patients with pH&#xD;
           &lt; 4,5 from the next step;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The slides from patients with a vaginal pH &gt; 4.4, will be Gram stained and interpreted&#xD;
           according to the criteria of Nugent et al in order to select patients with BV or&#xD;
           intermediate Nugent score (4-10). Patients with Nugent score below 4 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women who are excluded from any of the above steps will be reassessed every 4 weeks,&#xD;
      for new cases of BV/Intermediate score, during the next prenatal care visits, until they&#xD;
      reach the 19th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BV/Intermediate patients will be randomized (centralized blocked randomization process),&#xD;
      after signed informed consent, to receive either probiotics or placebo capsules twice a day&#xD;
      (each capsule with probiotics shall contain &gt; 1 million bacilli of each of 2 selected strains&#xD;
      of lactobacillus: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women shall take the capsules until they reach approximately the 24th week of gestation, the&#xD;
      minimum duration of the treatment being 6 weeks (for those women randomized to the trial by&#xD;
      the 20th week). Capsules will be maintained in refrigerators throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will receive the usual prenatal care at their institutions, which should&#xD;
      follow the related evidence-based municipal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal pH and Nugent scores will be assessed after the end of the treatment for both&#xD;
      treatment groups, so to assess changes in those parameters as partial results regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of the study probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized patients, whether compliant with the treatment regimens or not, will be followed&#xD;
      up for the assessment of the trial endpoints: spontaneous premature birth (&lt;37, &lt;35, &lt;32&#xD;
      weeks of pregnancy) and related neonatal events: early sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,&#xD;
      periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis, besides death and average&#xD;
      hospital stay. Study personnel will abstract that information from delivery and neonatal&#xD;
      records using a pre-tested questionnaire. Definitions and diagnostic methods used for&#xD;
      identifying such conditions will be similar to those recommended by the Vermont- Oxford&#xD;
      Network, issued in 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of adverse events will be monitored with a specific questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence to the treatment will be assessed with specific questioning of the pregnant&#xD;
      woman and by counting the capsules contained in the bottles returned by them at each prenatal&#xD;
      care visit. Reasons for non adherence, including the occurrence of adverse events, will be&#xD;
      looked into in order to propitiate adherence whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special attention will be devoted to avoid undesirable psychological effects derived from the&#xD;
      eventual labeling of women as high risk for premature birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to assure the concealment of the randomization and the blinding of the pregnant&#xD;
      women (identical placebo) and study personnel, including caretakers and the technician who&#xD;
      will be performing the pH and Nugent exams, are described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to add further explanatory power to the present trial, regarding the mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of the study probiotics, a nested case-control study (1 case and 3 controls) will be&#xD;
      carried out to determine the level of selected cytokines (IL-1B, IL1-ra and IL-6) at the&#xD;
      vaginal fluid, before and after treatment, and the occurrence of TNF an IL 6(308 and 174)&#xD;
      polymorphisms, and their association, individually and in interaction, with the study&#xD;
      endpoints (cases). Special vaginal swabs (cytokines) and oral samples (polymorphisms) will be&#xD;
      collected for those purposes and processed accordingly. Written informed consent will be also&#xD;
      sought for such procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was approved by an Institutional Review Board which has sent it for final approval&#xD;
      by the National Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ************************************************************&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size to show efficacy of study probiotics for preventing premature birth less than 35&#xD;
      and 32 weeks (significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.80):&#xD;
&#xD;
      _____________________________________________________________________&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that using the pH &lt;4.5 as a cutoff point for the Nugent assessment will result in&#xD;
           excluding around 40% of the clinically pre-selected women (Hauth et al,2003) but will&#xD;
           only exclude a small percentage of women with NugentÂ´s Intermediate score and related&#xD;
           preterm births,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a non-adherence rate to the treatment regimens of about 5%,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that the incidence in the placebo group of premature birth less than 35 weeks will be&#xD;
           around 6%;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and an efficacy rate of 50% for the study main end-point (premature birth),&#xD;
&#xD;
      the number estimated to be necessary for the randomization phase of the present trial, is&#xD;
      about 1500 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess efficacy regarding premature birth less than 32 weeks, same significance level and&#xD;
      power, the corresponding number is nearly 3000.&#xD;
