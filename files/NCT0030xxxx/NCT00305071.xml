  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In conventional treatment for non-complicated bacterial cystitis, 3-day oral antibiotics&#xD;
      could achieve good cure rate. However, severe lower urinary tract symptoms were most&#xD;
      bothersome and only could be partially relieved by NSAID, detrusor muscle relaxants, minor&#xD;
      tranquilizer or pyridium. Some medication associated side effects were complained while&#xD;
      receiving adjuvant medication treatment, including gastro-intestinal discomfort, dry mouth,&#xD;
      blurred vision, lethargy, or allergic reactions. The irritative bladder symptoms from bladder&#xD;
      inflammation had great impact on the quality of life and well tolerable adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      would have clinical benefit to reduce the discomfort from the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past years, cranberry juice or its extract has been proven to have protective effect&#xD;
      on urothelium to prevent further bacterial ascending infection. The commercial cranberry&#xD;
      extract tablets have good tolerability and showed good effect on symptoms reliving and&#xD;
      infection protection on several clinical observation. In acute bladder infection, we could&#xD;
      expect the bioactive components in cranberry could reduce the virulence of pathogens and&#xD;
      assist to eradicate pathogens and to stable the urothelium. In literature review, only little&#xD;
      works focusing on the symptoms relief in acute cystitis patients. To clarify the clinical&#xD;
      benefit on lower urinary symptoms relieving, we attempt to conduct a randomized double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a compound cranberry extract tablet as an&#xD;
      adjunctive modality in treating acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy&#xD;
      female patients.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute bacterial cystitis is a common and bothersome disease with a rapid onset nature.&#xD;
      Uncomplicated cystitis occurs in patients without anatomical or physiological anomaly in the&#xD;
      lower urinary tract. Although the infection is not life threatening in immuno-competent&#xD;
      patients, the associated lower urinary tract symptoms cause massive impact on the&#xD;
      quality-of-life of the victims. The voiding symptoms, such as urinary frequency, urgency,&#xD;
      dysuria and suprapubic pain, were associated with the inflammatory response to microbial&#xD;
      invasion. In most clinical scenario, 3-day empirical oral antimicrobial treatment could&#xD;
      eradicate the pathogen efficiently.1,2 However, the lower urinary tract symptoms were not&#xD;
      eradicated effectively by antibiotics only. In daily clinical practice, several symptomatic&#xD;
      relieving treatments were applied while acute infection presented, including pyridine and&#xD;
      anticholinergic agents. However, several side effects were complained according to the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lower urinary tract infection, the virulence of the pathogen was the major factor&#xD;
      associated with colonization and invasion in the urinary tract mucosa. The adherence of the&#xD;
      pathogen to the urothelium is the crucial step in the urinary tract infection.3 Several&#xD;
      studies revealed good anti-adherence effect of the cranberry juice.4-7 In several clinical&#xD;
      studies, cranberry juice has been proven to be an protective effect in bacterial cystitis8&#xD;
      and the role of cranberry juice in preventing urinary tract infection was well&#xD;
      established.9,10 Cranberry is a rich source of bioactive compounds, such as phenolic acid and&#xD;
      several organic acids, which have been proven playing major anti-bacterial effect.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature reviewing, the clinical application of cranberry juice or extract tablet was&#xD;
      focusing on the preventive role on chronic or repeated urinary tract infection. The effect to&#xD;
      reduce bacteriuria and pyuria has been mentioned.12 However, the effect on lower urinary&#xD;
      tract symptom relieving effect of the food supplement cranberry was not established. In this&#xD;
      study, we try to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a commercial compound cranberry extract in&#xD;
      treating acute uncomplicated cystitis as an adjunctive role. The compound tablet contained&#xD;
      900mg per tablet, including 600% concentrated cranberry extract 150mg, vitamin C 70mg,&#xD;
      Rhizoma extract (Acrobio TS®) 150mg, Flos extract (Acrobio GL®) 60mg, lactose and mannitol&#xD;
      490mg. The compound has been on the market in Taiwan as a food supplement and was well&#xD;
      tolerable. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      adjuvant effect of compound cranberry extract on the symptomatic relieving effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We prepare to conduct a paralleled-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a compound cranberry extract tablet as an adjunctive&#xD;
      modality in treating acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy female&#xD;
      patients. The treatment arm will receive standard 3-day oral antibiotics plus 7-day compound&#xD;
      cranberry extract tablets (UmayC) and the control arm will receive standard 3-day oral&#xD;
      antibiotics plus 7-day identical placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Processes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant recruitment During study period, we will recruit 60 volunteer female&#xD;
           patients visiting the urological outpatient clinics in Min-Sheng General Hospital for&#xD;
           uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis to join our trial. The age limitation was 20 to&#xD;
           65 years old and the acute cystitis was diagnosed by the clinical symptoms, physical&#xD;
           exams and pyuria (WBC&gt;5/HPF) on urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exclusion criteria: recent (less than one month) urinary tract infection or&#xD;
           partially treated acute cystitis; anatomical or function disease of the lower urinary&#xD;
           tract; patients received radical pelvic surgery; associated bladder stone disease; upper&#xD;
           urinary tract anomaly or urolithiasis; systemic infection with body temperature higher&#xD;
           than 38°C; known allergic reaction to cranberry or vitamin C; pregnant or prepare to be&#xD;
           pregnant, or diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives and outcome measurements We try to evaluate the symptom relieving effect of&#xD;
           compound cranberry extract as an adjuvant therapeutic modality. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
           the compound cranberry extract tablet as an adjuvant treatment for uncomplicated acute&#xD;
           bacterial cystitis with 3-day empirical antibiotics will reduce the irritative bladder&#xD;
           symptoms (urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and dysuria and suprapubic pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We conducted a Frequency-Urgency-Pain (FUP) score to evaluate the irritative lower&#xD;
           urinary tract symptoms. Another 10-point Likert scales from 0 (none) to 9 (severe)&#xD;
           questionnaire will be used to evaluate every individual symptom. A modified diary method&#xD;
           was used to evaluate the symptoms change during the whole evaluation period. 3 in-face&#xD;
           questionnaire interviews will be preformed on day 1, 4, and 8 by the study assistants. A&#xD;
           brief form questionnaire will be done by telephone on day 2 and 3. The primary outcome&#xD;
           of this study is the proportion of symptoms relief (based on FUP and individual symptom&#xD;
           scale evaluation) after 3-day and 7-day treatments. The secondary outcome variables were&#xD;
           the pyuria eradication rate after 3- and 7-day therapy and the time to symptoms relief.&#xD;
           Possible adverse effect was recorded and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size and randomization In this study, we will recruit 60 participants to detect&#xD;
           the difference between the intervention and control groups with a 0.05 one-sided&#xD;
           significance level and a 80% power. These participants will be randomly assigned to each&#xD;
           group according to a pre-set random permuted blocks procedure. Efficacy analysis will be&#xD;
           conducted according to the intension-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention Intervention group will receive 3-day oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole&#xD;
           (80/400mg) 2 tablets twice a day on day 1 to 3 plus oral compound cranberry extract&#xD;
           tablets (UmayC, 900mg) 2 tablets three times a day on day 1 to 7. The control group will&#xD;
           received same oral antibiotics plus identical placebo prescribed as the same protocol of&#xD;
           intervention arm. For patients with known allergic reaction to sulfa drug, the empirical&#xD;
           antibiotics will be replaced by cephalexin (250mg) 2 capsules four times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Processes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participant enrollment with inform consent, detail medical history will be collected,&#xD;
      including basic physiological data (body weight and height), major medical disease (diabetes,&#xD;
      cerebral vascular disease, or neurological disorder), major operation history (neurological&#xD;
      and pelvic surgery), recent medication records (including recent antibiotics treatment),&#xD;
      child-baring history, sexual activity, fluid drinking history, and socio-economical and&#xD;
      education status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A voiding symptoms questionnaire, including FUP score and 10-point Likert scales symptomatic&#xD;
      questions, will be done by in-face interview by study assistants. Random urine bacterial&#xD;
      culture will be collected before medical treatment. The participants will be requested to&#xD;
      receive 2 telephone interviews on day 2 and 3 by the study assistants and to return for&#xD;
      urinalysis and 2nd in-face questionnaire on day 4 after complete antibiotics treatment. The&#xD;
      clinical follow up will be arranged on day 8 by the physicians and urinalysis will be done&#xD;
      again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event reporting and patient safety All participants will receive close follow up&#xD;
      protocol for adverse event reporting. Any discomfort associated with the medical treatment&#xD;
      will be recorded on daily interview record and be reported. Interruption of the trial and&#xD;
      intervention decoding will be performed immediately once an intolerable side effect happened.&#xD;
