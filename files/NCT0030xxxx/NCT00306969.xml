  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the safety and tolerability of photopheresis in combination with&#xD;
      increasing doses of oral bexarotene in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.Our hypotheses&#xD;
      are that the combination of bexarotene with photopheresis is safe and that bexarotene will&#xD;
      enhance immune response in the setting of extracorporeal photopheresis in the treatment of&#xD;
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), resulting in a shorter time to clinical response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photopheresis is FDA-approved as a device in the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma. Using treatment schedules of once monthly treatment, with each treatment consisting&#xD;
      of two consecutive days of photopheresis, initial response rates of 20-60% have been&#xD;
      reported. However, in publications, for those who attained a complete response, median time&#xD;
      to response was 11 months (range 5 to 14 months). Response has been shown to correlate with&#xD;
      intact immune function in patients with normal CD8+ cell prior to therapy. The mechanism of&#xD;
      activity of photopheresis in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma while not fully understood involves&#xD;
      apoptosis of malignant tumor cells. Modifications in the original scheduling of&#xD;
      photopheresis, with shorter cycles of 2 or 3 weeks, have met with success. Several centers&#xD;
      have been using an accelerated delivery schedule of treatments, treating patients every 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bexarotene was FDA approved for patients with CTCL. It is an RXR selective retinoid.&#xD;
      Retinoids can serve as physiologic rather than cytotoxic drugs to arrest or reverse the&#xD;
      process of carcinogenesis. There is a growing body of evidence that supports a role for&#xD;
      retinoids in the induction of apoptosis. In the two, completed Phase II-III studies that&#xD;
      formed the basis of approval (approved dose is 300mg/m2/day) of bexarotene capsules, 193&#xD;
      patients with previously treated CTCL were administered bexarotene capsules. Response rates&#xD;
      were in the order of 50% for the 300mg/2/day, however, 79% of patients had hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will therefore primarily examine the safety and tolerability of using increasing&#xD;
      doses of bexarotene in combination with photopheresis. As a secondary endpoint, we will&#xD;
      attempt to establish whether bexarotene can upregulate the immune response and therefore&#xD;
      potentially enhance the response rates to photopheresis in patients with CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six cohorts of patients will be treated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level cohorts enrollment will be sequential with centralized dose assignment at Boston&#xD;
      Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish safety, a 30 day pause will occur between cohorts. During the 30 day waiting&#xD;
      period, additional patients will be able to enter the open cohort, provided that there is no&#xD;
      grade 3 or 4 toxicity in the 3 patients already entered into the cohort. Once the 30 day&#xD;
      period has ended, new patients will be able to enter the next cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (3 patients): Bexarotene will be given at the dose of 75mg po per day with food for&#xD;
      7 days prior to beginning photopheresis(Day -6 to 0, day 1 being the day when photopheresis&#xD;
      begins on first day of cycle 1). Photopheresis will be performed on 2 consecutive days the&#xD;
      first 2 days of each 21 day cycle. Bexarotene will be given concurrently with photopheresis&#xD;
      for 4 cycles. The duration of the study is 3 months with premature discontinuation for&#xD;
      toxicity at the discretion of the investigator, or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (3 patients): Bexarotene will be given at the dose of 150 mg po per day with food&#xD;
      for 7 days prior to beginning photopheresis (Day -6 to 0, day 1 being the day when&#xD;
      photopheresis begins on first day of cycle 1). Photopheresis will be performed on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days the first 2 days of each 21 day cycle. Bexarotene will be given concurrently&#xD;
      with photopheresis for 4 cycles. The duration of the study is 3 months with premature&#xD;
      discontinuation for toxicity at the discretion of the investigator, or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3 (3 patients): Bexarotene will be given at the dose of 225 mg po per day with food&#xD;
      for 7 days prior to beginning photopheresis (Day -6 to 0, day 1 being the day when&#xD;
      photopheresis begins on first day of cycle 1). Photopheresis will be performed on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days the first 2 days of each 21 day cycle. Bexarotene will be given concurrently&#xD;
      with photopheresis for 4 cycles. The duration of the study is 3 months with premature&#xD;
      discontinuation for toxicity at the discretion of the investigator, or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4 (3 patients): Bexarotene will be given at the dose of 300 mg po per day with food&#xD;
      for 7 days prior to beginning photopheresis (Day -6 to 0, day 1 being the day when&#xD;
      photopheresis begins on first day of cycle 1). Photopheresis will be performed on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days the first 2 days of each 21 day cycle. Bexarotene will be given concurrently&#xD;
      with photopheresis for 4 cycles. The duration of the study is 3 months with premature&#xD;
      discontinuation for toxicity at the discretion of the investigator, or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 5 (3 patients): Bexarotene will be given at the dose of 375 mg po per day with food&#xD;
      for 7 days prior to beginning photopheresis (Day -6 to 0, day 1 being the day when&#xD;
      photopheresis begins on first day of cycle 1). Photopheresis will be performed on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days the first 2 days of each 21 day cycle. Bexarotene will be given concurrently&#xD;
      with photopheresis for 4 cycles. The duration of the study is 3 months with premature&#xD;
      discontinuation for toxicity at the discretion of the investigator, or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 6 (3 patients): Bexarotene will be given at the dose of 450 mg po per day with food&#xD;
      for 7 days prior to beginning photopheresis (Day -6 to 0, day 1 being the day when&#xD;
      photopheresis begins on first day of cycle 1). Photopheresis will be performed on 2&#xD;
      consecutive days the first 2 days of each 21 day cycle. Bexarotene will be given concurrently&#xD;
      with photopheresis for 4 cycles. The duration of the study is 3 months with premature&#xD;
      discontinuation for toxicity at the discretion of the investigator, or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria at the&#xD;
      beginning of each 21 day cycle. Assessments will be every 3 weeks and at the final follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a skin biopsy from lesional skin prior to entry to confirm active&#xD;
      disease. A portion of the biopsy will be used for immunohistochemical studies to identify&#xD;
      populations of activated lymphocytes in the skin and to identify apoptotic markers (TUNNEL&#xD;
      METHOD). A skin biopsy will be subsequently obtained after 7 days of bexarotene, and at the&#xD;
      end of the study. A portion of each skin biopsy will be used for immunohistochemical studies&#xD;
      to identify populations of activated lymphocytes in the skin (TGF-B and Fas on malignant T&#xD;
      cells) and to identify apoptotic markers (TUNNEL method)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo baseline studies of immune function, including a FACS analysis of&#xD;
      circulating lymphocyte populations to identify activation antigens on T-lymphocytes, as well&#xD;
      as in vitro assays of T-cell function such as proliferation assays and cytokine production by&#xD;
      cultured T-cells. These studies will be repeated after the second and fourth. For these&#xD;
      assays, one green top tube will be drawn on day 1 before photopheresis and on day 2 at the&#xD;
      completion of therapy. One serum tube (one red top) will be drawn on days 1 and 2 and serum&#xD;
      will be stored at -20Â° until the assays are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the following research skin biopsies and labs will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Day -6): one green top and one red top Baseline (Day -6): skin biopsy from lesional&#xD;
      skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 of cycle 1: skin biopsy from lesional skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles 2 and 4: Day 1: one green top and one red top Day 2 one green top and one red top&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of cycle 4: skin biopsy from lesional skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the following evaluations, the BASELINE visit will include a history with&#xD;
      patient demographic. At the baseline, tri-weekly, and final visits, the following information&#xD;
      will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum chemistries, including LDH, LFTS, albumin, uric acid, Ca, Phos, Mg, Cholesterol,&#xD;
           Triglycerides, Thyroid function (T4, TSH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBC differential, Sezary count if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin assessment (previously published weighted skin score) and a description of other&#xD;
           symptoms attributed to CTCL, and at the final visit, an overall assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Names and doses of all concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life assessment (Skindex-29 and FACT-G)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will also evaluate patient's response by organ system involvement, with an&#xD;
      overall assessment, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Response (CR): Resolution of all manifestations of CTCL lasting one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial Response (PR): A 50% improvement of the sum total of all disease (CTCL) lasting&#xD;
           one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No Change (NC): Failure to meet criteria for either response or progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression: a 25% or more progression of existing disease or the appearance of any new&#xD;
           disease (disease worsening).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flare: After an initial response (either CR or PR), an increase in the manifestation of&#xD;
           CTCL requiring additional treatment.&#xD;
