  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if HBOC-201 is safe and tolerable to trauma&#xD;
      subjects, when given to treat the inadequate supply of blood and nutrients to tissues and&#xD;
      organs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study will be a single-center, randomized, single-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      standard therapy-controlled, variable dose study of HBOC 201 administered to trauma subjects&#xD;
      with bleeding or potential for bleeding who require standard fluid therapy for treatment of&#xD;
      hypoperfusion. The type and incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events attributed&#xD;
      to the study drug will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables in this safety and tolerability study, will be summarized with&#xD;
      descriptive statistics and frequency tables. The purpose of this data collection is to assess&#xD;
      efficacy variables and the feasibility of utilizing these parameters in future trauma studies&#xD;
      that will assess parameters of morbidity and mortality and include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to improvement of serum (or plasma) lactate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to improvement in the Base Deficit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to maintained stability (BD&lt;5) over 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall improvement in Base Deficit over 24 Hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stability of subjects at 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to meet treatment-stopping criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume to meet treatment-stopping criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of infectious complications (e.g., incidence of ventilator-associated&#xD;
           pneumonia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of time on ventilator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhage with subsequent hypoperfusion is a major cause of both immediate and delayed death&#xD;
      in subjects who have sustained traumatic injuries. Effective therapies for hemorrhage to&#xD;
      treat hypoperfusion that can be given immediately following injury are lacking. The following&#xD;
      issues confound this problem further:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemorrhaging trauma victims often have an immediate need for therapy to ensure adequate&#xD;
           delivery of oxygen to vital tissues;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care fluids such as Lactated Ringers Solution do not provide oxygen and&#xD;
           blood can not be readily stored, transported or easily used in pre-hospital settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the absence of oxygen-carrying fluid, traditional approaches to sustain vital organ&#xD;
           perfusion, such as administration of intravenous fluid therapy, may have detrimental&#xD;
           effects if given prior to hemostasis in certain subjects, particularly those with&#xD;
           penetrating truncal injuries.&#xD;

    <description>HBOC-201 is an investigational solution of sterile, ultrapurified, glutaraldehyde polymerized, modified bovine hemoglobin (Hb) in a balanced electrolyte solution. HBOC-201 has an Hb concentration of 12-14g/dL. HBOC-201 is an isosmotic solution that is stable for at least 36 months at 2-30ºC. It requires no reconstitution and can be administered directly into a peripheral or central vein. Blood typing is not required because all other cellular components, including the RBC membranes that carry the blood group antigens, have been removed.</description>
