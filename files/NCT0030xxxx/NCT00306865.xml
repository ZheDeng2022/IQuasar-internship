    <textblock>
      This study will examine how chemical changes in the brain produce symptoms of hand dystonia.&#xD;
      Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive&#xD;
      movement or abnormal postures. In focal dystonia, just one part of the body, such as the&#xD;
      hand, neck or face, is involved. The study will use positron emission tomography (PET) to&#xD;
      find our which areas of the brain in patients with focal hand dystonia differ from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers without focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia between 18 and 65 years of age may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scanning: The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut. The subject lies on a bed that&#xD;
           can slide in and out of the scanner. A custom-molded plastic mask is placed on the face&#xD;
           and head to support the head and prevent it from moving during scanning. Two radioactive&#xD;
           substances - five doses (one per scan) of [15 O] water and one dose of [11C] flumazil&#xD;
           are injected into the body through a vein. The dose of injected radioactive substance is&#xD;
           very small, and they are not harmful to the body. The [15 O] water doses are injected&#xD;
           during the first hour and scans are taken every 10 minutes. The [11C] flumazil is&#xD;
           injected during the second hour. The radioactive substances are detected by the PET&#xD;
           scanner and provide information on the functioning of the brain chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scanning: MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body&#xD;
           tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow&#xD;
           cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur&#xD;
           during the scanning process. Scanning time for this study will be less than one hour.&#xD;
           Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if in focal hand dystonia there is disinhibition&#xD;
      involving key structures of the motor control system (basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum and&#xD;
      motor cortex) caused by dysfunction of the GABA-ergic neurons. The major inhibitory&#xD;
      neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), which acts&#xD;
      mainly through GABA A receptors, the majority of which possess the benzodiazepine binding&#xD;
      site. Pathological processes involving GABA-ergic neurons will cause alterations in the&#xD;
      density of GABA receptors, which can be visualized and measured with positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) using as a radioactive ligand [(11)C] Flumazenil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted using 20 patients with primary focal hand dystonia and 20&#xD;
      healthy volunteers that are matched by age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using positron emission tomography (PET) using radioactive ligand [(11)C] Flumazenil, we&#xD;
      will detect alterations in the density of GABA receptors in patients with primary focal hand&#xD;
      dystonia in comparison with control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be able to determine the density of GABA A receptors of the various Regions of&#xD;
      Interest as measured by PET analysis among these groups of subjects. This study should&#xD;
      provide new information concerning localization and degree of dysfunction of GABA-ergic&#xD;
      neurons in movement related structures in dystonia, which might open new possibilities for&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment of this disorder.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients will have clinically documented focal hand dystonia. This criterion will be&#xD;
        established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Human Motor Control Section&#xD;
        Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients (male or female) will range in age from 18 through 65 years of age. Female&#xD;
        patients of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test, which must be negative and&#xD;
        an interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant patients do not participate in the&#xD;
        study. Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Twenty healthy volunteers will be included; volunteers will be screened in the NINDS&#xD;
        Human Motor Control Section Outpatient Clinic, and will have neurological and physical&#xD;
        examinations. Healthy volunteers with chronic illnesses, taking any medication that affects&#xD;
        the CNS will be excluded. Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcohol for one week prior&#xD;
        to the study. Female volunteers of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test, which&#xD;
        must be negative and an interview prior to the study to ensure that pregnant subjects do&#xD;
        not participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following subjects will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Subjects younger than 18 and older than 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Subjects with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or AVMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Patients with progressive neurological disorders other than dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Subjects with past or present neuropsychiatric illness, head trauma with loss of&#xD;
        consciousness, epilepsy, cerebro-vascular disease, migraine, past and present history of&#xD;
        alcohol abuse, medical conditions that may alter cerebral structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Subjects with cancer, except for skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Subjects incapable of giving an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        H. Patients who are currently on benzodiazepines, which binds GABA-A receptors and will&#xD;
        compete directly with flumazenil for binding; baclofen which binds GABA-B receptors;&#xD;
        flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist; or triazolam, a partial allosteric&#xD;
        modulator of GABA A receptors. Patients need to be off of these medications for four weeks&#xD;
        prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        I. Patients who have had recent (within 3 months) BoTox injections. Botulinum Toxin A&#xD;
        (BoTox) injections are commonly used to relieve pain and muscle spasms of dystonic&#xD;
        patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Children&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or healthy subjects younger than 18 years of age will be excluded from the study&#xD;
        due to the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (i) Absorbed radiation dose per mCi is relatively higher, and pharmacodynamic effects are&#xD;
        greater in children compared to adults. (ii) No direct benefit for individual patients is&#xD;
        anticipated from this study. The study is of &quot;greater than minimal risk&quot;, and thus does not&#xD;
        meet the criterion of 45 CFR 46 Subpart D (the &quot;prospect of direct benefit&quot;) governing&#xD;
        participation of children in research.&#xD;
