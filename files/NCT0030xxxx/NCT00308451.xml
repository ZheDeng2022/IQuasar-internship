  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed work is to assess the effects of a dietary supplement, containing&#xD;
      chromium (600 mcg per day) provided by chromium picolinate and biotin (2 mg per day) on&#xD;
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, this study will assess whether use of the&#xD;
      supplement will lower the post-prandial rise in blood glucose experienced after ingestion of&#xD;
      a 75g carbohydrate load, relative to placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients. The study will&#xD;
      also assess the chronic effects of supplementation over a 4-week period (relative to placebo)&#xD;
      on fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lipids and lipoproteins.&#xD;

      The purpose of this work is to assess the effects of a dietary supplement, containing&#xD;
      chromium (600 mcg per day) provided by chromium picolinate and biotin (2 mg per day) on&#xD;
      glycemic control in type 2 diabetes who are currently taking an oral antidiabetic agent (OAD)&#xD;
      and failing therapy with OADs. Subjects entering the trial must have a HbA1c &gt;/= 7.0% and&#xD;
      have an OGTT &gt;/= 200 mg/dL at 2 hours post consumption of a 75 g glucose beverage. The study&#xD;
      is an acute 30 day intervention in conjunction with the subject's current OADs and standard&#xD;
      of care in comparison to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study will assess whether use of the supplement will lower the&#xD;
      post-prandial rise in blood glucose experienced after ingestion of a 75g carbohydrate load,&#xD;
      relative to placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients as measured by the area under the curve for&#xD;
      glucose (AUCg). The study will also assess the acute effects of supplementation over a 4-week&#xD;
      period (relative to placebo) on fasting plasma levels of glucose, fructosamine, insulin,&#xD;
      lipids and lipoproteins.&#xD;
