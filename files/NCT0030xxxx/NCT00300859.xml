      DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract): Injury control experts suggest that&#xD;
      consistent SBU is the most effective means for motorists to reduce1he risk of death or&#xD;
      serious injury in a crash. Sadly, the SBU prevalence among Massachusetts' residents is among&#xD;
      the lowest in the nation. In accord with Healthy People 2010, Objective 15-19, and the CDC's&#xD;
      Injury Research Agenda, the investigator will test the utility of a brief intervention to&#xD;
      increase SBU among ED patients with self-reported SBU that IS less than &quot;always&quot;. A secondary&#xD;
      aim is to determine if the brief intervention is more effective among persons being treated&#xD;
      for a motor vehicle crash (MVC)-related injury during a &quot;teachable moment&quot; than other&#xD;
      non-injured ED patients receiving the same intervention. The research staff will&#xD;
      systematically sample ED patients, screening for SBU among eligible participants during a&#xD;
      3-month period. Upon obtaining verbal consent, researchers will ask participants to complete&#xD;
      a self-administered screening form on health and safety issues, including SBU. Patients that&#xD;
      screen positive, (i.e., give an answer of less than &quot;always use&quot; safety belts) on a SBU&#xD;
      screening question will be asked to participate in an intervention to promote health and&#xD;
      safety among ED patients. Participants will be reimbursed for their time, and asked to do the&#xD;
      following: to give written informed consent via IRB-approved forms and a HIPAA release form;&#xD;
      complete an intake form, and agree to a follow-up phone interview at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-enrollment. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: an Intervention&#xD;
      Group that will receive a brief intervention designed to increase SBU, and a Control Group&#xD;
      that will receive only standard care. Research staff will contact participants for a&#xD;
      follow-up phone survey at 3 and 6 months to test the hypothesis that individuals randomized&#xD;
      to the Intervention Group will have a higher self-reported SBU than those in the Control&#xD;
      Group that received only standard care. Likewise, for the secondary (exploratory) analysis,&#xD;
      the hypothesis is that among those treated for MVC-related trauma--and randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group--will have a higher self-reported SBU than others with non MVC-related&#xD;
      trauma due to a greater receptivity to brief intervention techniques during the ED visit&#xD;
      (i.e. the &quot;teachable moment&quot;).&#xD;
