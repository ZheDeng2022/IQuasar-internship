      The objective of the international, multicenter case-control study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and use of non-phenacetin-containing&#xD;
      analgesics with particular emphasis on combined formulations.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between intake of non-phenacetin-containing analgesics and the occurrence of&#xD;
      chronic renal failure is still controversially discussed. A new epidemiologic study was&#xD;
      planned and conducted in Germany and Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the international, multicenter case-control study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and use of non-phenacetin-containing&#xD;
      analgesics with particular emphasis on combined formulations. A targeted sample of 1000 new&#xD;
      (incident) dialysis patients, aged less than 50 years, was planned to recruit between January&#xD;
      1, 2001 and December 31, 2004. The age limit was chosen to avoid contamination of the study&#xD;
      population with phenacetin-containing analgesics to the extent possible. Four control&#xD;
      subjects per ESRD case, matched by age, sex, and region were selected from the population&#xD;
      living in the region the case came from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifetime exposure to analgesics and potential renal risk factors were recorded in a single&#xD;
      face-to-face interview. A set of aids was introduced to reinforce the memory of study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized, pre-tested interview questionnaire (participants), a medical documentation&#xD;
      sheet (physicians in dialysis centres), a logbook for all activities (dialysis centres) were&#xD;
      used to collect the necessary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality management consisted of the standardized procedures, (re-) training and supervision&#xD;
      of interviewers, regular checks of all incoming data for completeness and plausibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is scientifically independent and governed by a international Scientific Advisory&#xD;
      Committee that bridged the gap between the sponsoring companies and the investigators. Also&#xD;
      other advisory groups assisted the managing committee of the study. All relevant German and&#xD;
      Austrian nephrological associations supported the study, and the study design was carefully&#xD;
      reviewed and approved by the Kidney Foundation of Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to answer the main research question by end 2005. There is however a&#xD;
      high potential for various biases that we tried to address with adequate measure. One&#xD;
      limitation however cannot be overcome: The methodologically needed age-limitation of the&#xD;
      study will make it not easy to generalize the results to age groups over 50 years. It might&#xD;
      be suggested to repeat the study for persons over 50 years in 10 years when contamination&#xD;
      with phenacetin use early in life is likely to be outgrown.&#xD;
