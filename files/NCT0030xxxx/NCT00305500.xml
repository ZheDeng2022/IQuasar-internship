      Objectives: To evaluate tolerability and efficacy of escitalopram treatment in high dose than&#xD;
      20-50 mg/d in out-patients with OCD Type of the study: Open label, prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 100 patients with OCD&#xD;

&#xD;
      One week of 10mg Four weeks of 20mg After 4 weeks of 20mg treatment- if partial/no response,&#xD;
      according to YBOCS score and clinical judgment, dose increase of up to 50mg depending on&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An institutional review board acknowledged by the Israeli Ministry of Health will approve the&#xD;
      study. After complete description of the study to the patients, written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from patients found eligible and willing to participate. The design will be&#xD;
      open-labeled. The study will last for 18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated by clinical assessment and by various questionnaires (see &quot;rating&#xD;
      scales&quot; section). Those who will be diagnosed as having OCD and will fulfill the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria requirements will start 4 weeks of initial treatment with escitalopram&#xD;
      up to 20mg/d. After 4 weeks those patients who will be evaluated as non-responders (reduction&#xD;
      of Y-BOCS total score by less than 25%) will continue treatment with higher escitalopram&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose will be adjusted according to clinical status and the clinician's judgment up to 50mg/d&#xD;
      of escitalopram. Patients will be evaluated periodically throughout the study for adverse&#xD;
      reactions and psychiatric status by various rating scales as well as a clinical evaluation by&#xD;
      the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) Symptom Checklist&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Clinical Global Impression scales (CGI) consist of two sub-scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Severity of illness (CGI-S) and the Global improvement (CGI-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A checklist of serotonergic specific adverse drug reactions + dizziness, bleeding and&#xD;
           ecchymoses checklist&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for assessment of mental well-being at every visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. SDS (Sheehan Disability Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Recent and concomitant medications at every visit&#xD;
