  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve glycemic control of inpatients admitted to the internal medicine wards, the&#xD;
      researchers generated a protocol based on intensive insulin treatment for use in all&#xD;
      inpatients with hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that intensive insulin treatment will improve the glycemic&#xD;
      control and the outcome of hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients with a history of diabetes admitted to the internal medicine ward were&#xD;
           enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At baseline, demographic and clinical information were obtained, including information&#xD;
           necessary to determine the severity of the illness. Venous capillary blood glucose&#xD;
           levels were checked 4 times a day by glucometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the pre-intervention period, patients were treated according to the common&#xD;
           practice in the hospital without any intervention. The study team collected the baseline&#xD;
           data on the glycemic control and treatment of patients admitted with hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the intervention period, the study team visited the ward daily and guided the&#xD;
           medical staff as to the use of the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the post-intervention period, the study team collected the data without active&#xD;
           intervention in the implementation of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data was collected on the mode of treatment and glycemic control of all hyperglycemic&#xD;
           patients throughout the study. The incidence of hypoglycemia, complications (myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, stroke, infections), mortality, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU),&#xD;
           length of hospitalization, and disposition at discharge were noted.&#xD;
