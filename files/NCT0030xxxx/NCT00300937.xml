  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As preeclampsia is a disease specially affecting young and primiparous women, and due to the&#xD;
      fact that we found previously in several studies a prevalence of 12%, to ensure a confidence&#xD;
      of 95% and a power of 80%, it is necessary to include a total of 190 women (95 in each arm),&#xD;
      therefore it is planned to recluse a total of 200 pregnant women currently attending to the&#xD;
      outpatients clinic at the HGOIA for pregnancy control before than week 20 of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each one of those women the clinical research team will obtain an obstetric,&#xD;
      anthropometric and clinical record following the current regulations of the Ecuadorian Public&#xD;
      Health Ministry. All women included will be under a detailed prenatal control every 4 weeks&#xD;
      from week 20 of pregnancy, this will include gestational age, weight, umbilical perimeter,&#xD;
      uterine altitude, fetal cardiac frequency and maternal blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in each schedule visit an urine test will be done (to discard proteinuria), also&#xD;
      a venous blood sample (10 ml) in heparinized tubes will be taken and immediately transported&#xD;
      to the Biomedical Center for centrifugation and plasma isolation. During week 20, all women&#xD;
      will be assigned (using a randomized numbers table) to one of the following groups: a)&#xD;
      intervention group, that will received two capsules of 100 mg of coenzyme Q10 twice daily up&#xD;
      to delivery; or b) control group, that will receive two capsules of the correspondent placebo&#xD;
      twice daily up to delivery. Both, active and placebo capsules will be manufactured by the&#xD;
      same provider (Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, CA, USA) to guarantee that weight, size, odor&#xD;
      and color are similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolutely all women participating in the study will know all contact information of the&#xD;
      clinical team and will be allowed to request medical care as frequent as they needed,&#xD;
      independently of establish obstetrical controls. Preeclampsia diagnosis will be performed&#xD;
      only by clinical researchers and based on a persistent high blood pressure higher than 140/90&#xD;
      mmHg and proteinuria higher than 300 mg/24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 will be measured using a high performance liquid chromatography equipment (HPLC)&#xD;
      and the method previously described and validated by our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that in the group receiving CoQ10 supplementation will be less cases of&#xD;
      preeclampsia compared to placebo.&#xD;

      This research will be conducted in collaboration between the Experimental Pharmacology and&#xD;
      Cellular Metabolism at the Biomedical Center in the Central University of Ecuador and the&#xD;
      Department of Obstetric Pathology in the Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital &quot;Isidro Ayora&quot;&#xD;
      (HGOIA) in Quito, Ecuador. It is proposed a descriptive, prospective, double blind,&#xD;
      randomized and placebo controlled experimental study to identify cause-effect rather than&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment in which, after approval of the Bioethics Committee (COBI) of&#xD;
      the Biomedical Center as well as the Bioethics Committee of the HGOIA, each one of the&#xD;
      possible women to be included in the study, after a careful and detailed lecture and&#xD;
      explanation about the objectives and procedures by one of the researchers will be invited to&#xD;
      take a part in it and will be asked to sing the respective inform consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As preeclampsia is a disease specially affecting young and primiparous women, and due to the&#xD;
      fact that we found previously in several studies a prevalence of 12%, to ensure a confidence&#xD;
      of 95% and a power of 80%, it is necessary to include a total of 190 women (95 in each arm),&#xD;
      therefore it is planned to recluse a total of 200 pregnant women, primigravidae, younger than&#xD;
      25 years old and with no history of diseases related to the cardiovascular, endocrine,&#xD;
      metabolic nor reproductive systems, who were currently attending to the outpatients clinic at&#xD;
      the HGOIA for pregnancy control before than week 20 of gestation. Those women with positive&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and who accepted to participate in the study will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each one of those women the clinical research team will obtain an obstetric,&#xD;
      anthropometric and clinical record following the current regulations of the Ecuadorian Public&#xD;
      Health Ministry. Women with history of hypertension, currently taken any kind of medication,&#xD;
      or that not want to participate in the study will be excluded. All women included will be&#xD;
      under a detailed prenatal control every 4 weeks from week 20 of pregnancy, this will include&#xD;
      gestational age, weight, umbilical perimeter, uterine altitude, fetal cardiac frequency and&#xD;
      maternal blood pressure. These information will be collected into the clinical record of the&#xD;
      HGOIA and in a special designated form useful for later data entry in an electronic database&#xD;
      (Epi Info V6.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in each schedule visit an urine test will be done (to discard proteinuria), also&#xD;
      a venous blood sample (10 ml) in heparinized tubes will be taken and immediately transported&#xD;
      to the Biomedical Center for centrifugation and plasma isolation. Plasma aliquots of 500 ul&#xD;
      will be frozen at -80Â°C up to the analysis. During all this process samples will be protected&#xD;
      from direct light with aluminum foil and from extreme temperatures with a refrigerated flask.&#xD;
      Samples received at the Biomedical Center will be identified only with a code; therefore&#xD;
      biochemical analysis will be also performed in a blind fashion. During week 20, all women&#xD;
      will be assigned (using a randomized numbers table) to one of the following groups: a)&#xD;
      intervention group, that will received two capsules of 100 mg of coenzyme Q10 twice daily up&#xD;
      to delivery; or b) control group, that will receive two capsules of the correspondent placebo&#xD;
      twice daily up to delivery. Both, active and placebo capsules will be manufactured by the&#xD;
      same provider (Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, CA, USA) to guarantee that weight, size, odor&#xD;
      and color are similar. The different bottles for those women will be prepared by a member of&#xD;
      the team not related to the clinical control of women, and a careful control of the number of&#xD;
      tablets in each bottle will be taken to later on analyze the accomplishment of the&#xD;
      treatments. The blind codes will be obtained before the intervention started and will be&#xD;
      responsibility of the principal investigator up to the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolutely all women participating in the study will know all contact information of the&#xD;
      clinical team and will be allowed to request medical care as frequent as they needed,&#xD;
      independently of establish obstetrical controls. In addition, as a part of the study their&#xD;
      attention in the HGOIA will be mandatory. Preeclampsia diagnosis will be performed only by&#xD;
      clinical researchers and based on a persistent high blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg&#xD;
      measured two times with the patient rested for at least 10 minutes and with a mercury&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer two times (Riester, Germany) and proteinuria higher than 300 mg/24 hours or&#xD;
      two crosses in a diskstip with 3-24 hours apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 and alpha tocopherol will be measured using a high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography equipment (HPLC) and the method previously described and validated by our&#xD;
      group. In brief, plasma samples will be processed in an HPLC equipped with a reverse phase&#xD;
      ODS-C18 column (5 um, 150x4.6 mm) with its respective guard column (5 um, 10x4.6 mm). Mobile&#xD;
      phase will be methanol/ethanol (40:60 v/v) previously filtered and with a continuous flow of&#xD;
      1ml/min. The UV detector will be set up to a wavelength of 275 nm. Samples (0.5 ml) will be&#xD;
      mixed with 0.5 ml of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at 20% and 50 ul of CoQ9 solution in&#xD;
      ethanol as internal standard. Later will be added 2 ml of a methanol/propanol solution (95:5&#xD;
      v/v) and will be vorterex vigorously by 30 seconds, after that, 5 ml of hexane will be added&#xD;
      and vorterex again by 60 seconds. Organic and aqueous solvents will be separated by&#xD;
      centrifugation at low speed (1000 g by 5 min). Four and half ml of the organic phase will be&#xD;
      transferred to another vial and dissecatted under continuous nitrogen flow and then&#xD;
      reconstituted with ethanol. Prepared samples will be immediately analyzed and kept all the&#xD;
      time under ice and protected form light. Measurements will be performed in duplicate and&#xD;
      average values will be used for the statistical analysis. Intra and inter assay variation&#xD;
      coefficients, as well as recover percentage will be calculate to ensure the uniformity of the&#xD;
      assays. Also, total cholesterol, as well as, low and high cholesterol lipoproteins will be&#xD;
      measured using a spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be the number of preeclampsia cases in each group, and the severity of&#xD;
      the disease and quality of the newborn (weight, height, cephalic perimeter and gestational&#xD;
      age at born).&#xD;
