      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are differences in the level of&#xD;
      antibody to capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae or the physiological activity of such&#xD;
      antibody after vaccinating patients who have recovered from pneumococcal pneumonia with&#xD;
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax) or conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most common cause of pneumonia leading to&#xD;
      hospitalization of adults. Resistance to infection is generally thought to be highly&#xD;
      associated with antibody to the capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Most people who develop&#xD;
      pneumococcal pneumonia lack antibody to the capsule of the infecting type. We have previously&#xD;
      shown that some persons develop this infection despite the presence of antibody to the&#xD;
      capsular polysaccharide of the infecting type. When such antibody is found, it tends to be&#xD;
      poorly functional (DM Musher et al, J Infect Dis 182:158-167, 2000) in that it opsonizes&#xD;
      pneumococci poorly for phagocytosis by human white blood cells in vitro, and protects mice&#xD;
      poorly or not at all against challenge with the infecting organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 20% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia in our previous study had been vaccinated&#xD;
      with the only vaccine currently in use for adults, namely 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine&#xD;
      (Pneumovax [Merck]). This product consists of purified capsular polysaccharides from 23&#xD;
      different serotypes of S. pneumoniae. During the past two years, with more active vaccination&#xD;
      programs at our hospital, the proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia patients who have been&#xD;
      vaccinated has increased to about 60%. Clearly, the vaccine has not provided a full degree of&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After many years of study, including one involving nearly 40,000 children in the Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanent health care system, a new form of pneumococcal vaccine was released. In this&#xD;
      vaccine, Prevnar [Wyeth-Lederle], capsular polysaccharide from 7 of the most common&#xD;
      pneumococcal types were conjugated to a protein that closely resembles diphtheria toxoid.&#xD;
      There have been suggestions that Prevnar stimulates antibody in some subjects who fail to&#xD;
      respond to Pneumovax (DM Musher et al, Clin Infect Dis 27:1487-1490, 1998) and also that the&#xD;
      resulting antibody may more effectively opsonize bacteria for phagocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to focus the present research on persons who develop pneumococcal pneumonia, a&#xD;
      group that is regarded as being at very high risk of reinfection. Persons who recover from&#xD;
      pneumococcal pneumonia will be randomized to vaccination revaccination with Pneumovax or&#xD;
      vaccination with Prevnar. These studies will clarify whether administration of protein&#xD;
      conjugate pneumococcal vaccine stimulates antibody in patients with pneumonia who failed to&#xD;
      respond to prior vaccination or stimulates better functional antibody in those who have&#xD;
      previously responded with antibody that is only poorly functional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our laboratory and others have shown that Prevnar successfully immunizes adults (Ahmed et al,&#xD;
      J Infect Dis 173:83-90, 1996). The vaccine is not officially recommended for adults because&#xD;
      antibody levels are the same after Prevnar as after Pneumovax. Such antibody may be more&#xD;
      functional; this has not yet been determined. Prevnar contains only 7 antigens whereas&#xD;
      Pneumovax contains 23 antigens; thus, it would be less desirable, in general, to administer&#xD;
      this vaccine instead of Pneumovax. However, in patients who have developed pneumonia despite&#xD;
      having received Pneumovax, the conjugate vaccine may offer an opportunity to stimulate&#xD;
      production of effective antibody. In the proposed research, all participants will eventually&#xD;
      receive both Pneumovax and Prevnar.&#xD;
