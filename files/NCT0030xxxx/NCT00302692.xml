  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in medical care have increased the proportion of elderly Americans and enabled them&#xD;
      to remain more physically active. This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the&#xD;
      number of geriatric patients admitted to trauma centers. The elderly constitute 23% of trauma&#xD;
      center admissions, but 36% of all trauma deaths. This disproportionately high mortality is&#xD;
      attributable to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, particularly, cardiac&#xD;
      disease. Multi-system injuries result in critical cardiac stress. Although beta-blockade has&#xD;
      been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for myocardial infarction&#xD;
      after elective surgery, their use in trauma patients with potential underlying cardiac&#xD;
      disease has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that routine administration of&#xD;
      beta-blockers after resuscitation will reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma&#xD;
      patients with, or at risk for, underlying cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, prospective clinical trial. One cohort will receive routine&#xD;
      trauma intensive care, and the other, the same care plus beta-blockade after completion of&#xD;
      resuscitation. The primary outcome will be mortality. Secondary outcomes include MI, length&#xD;
      of stay, organ dysfunction, cardiac, and other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in outcome may not be due to reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and heart rate.&#xD;
      Laboratory studies demonstrate that circulating inflammatory cytokines contribute to cardiac&#xD;
      risk in trauma patients, and their production is influenced by adrenergic stimulation. We&#xD;
      will measure circulating IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and measure NF-kB and p38 MAP kinase&#xD;
      activation in peripheral blood leukocytes, and determine the effect of beta-blockade on the&#xD;
      production of these inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the wide variation in patient response to beta-blockers is attributed to genetic&#xD;
      variability in the adrenergic receptor. Therefore, we will identify single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPS) within the beta-adrenergic receptor, and determine their effects on&#xD;
      mortality and response to beta-blockade. This study will provide the first randomized,&#xD;
      prospective trial designed to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients at&#xD;
      risk for cardiac disease. The laboratory and genetic component will provide additional&#xD;
      insights that may explain treatment effects, lead to new therapeutic strategies, and have the&#xD;
      potential to lead to additional areas of investigation.&#xD;

      Methods of Proposed Research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Overview: All trauma patients admitted to the ICU &gt; 55 years of age with a primary&#xD;
           diagnosis of injury will be screened on admission as study candidates. Patients will be&#xD;
           excluded if they have non-survivable injuries, are receiving comfort care only, have an&#xD;
           advanced directive limiting aggressive care, heart block, severe asthma, bradycardia (&lt;&#xD;
           60 bpm), are on beta-blocker therapy, or are having an acute or evolving myocardial&#xD;
           infarction. Informed consent will be obtained. Some patients may be unable to provide&#xD;
           consent. In such cases, consent will be obtained from legal surrogates. Consented&#xD;
           patients will be randomized into an experimental or control group. Study procedures will&#xD;
           commence when end-points of resuscitation have been met for 12 hours, defined as&#xD;
           cessation of transfusion and fluid bolus requirements, a systolic blood pressure &gt; 100&#xD;
           mm Hg, heart rate &lt; 130 bpm, adequate urine output, and a resolving base deficit. The&#xD;
           experimental group will receive beta-blockers adjusted to keep heart rate 60-80 bpm from&#xD;
           the end of resuscitation to hospital discharge. A formal algorithm has been developed&#xD;
           for this purpose, and will be inserted into the admission order sheet. Briefly, this&#xD;
           will be achieved initially by titration of intravenous esmolol hydrochloride until the&#xD;
           patient remains at goal heart rate on a stable dose for 24 hours, then with IV or PO&#xD;
           metoprolol. Therapy will be withheld in the event of hypotension (&lt; 100 mmHg), or&#xD;
           decreased cardiac index (&lt; 2.0 L/min/m2) accompanied by signs of inadequate end-organ&#xD;
           perfusion. The control group will receive the standard of care for the injured geriatric&#xD;
           patient. Such patients are not routinely provided with beta-blocker therapy. However,&#xD;
           beta-blockers will be used for treatment of excessive tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and&#xD;
           post myocardial infarction management, as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline Data Collection: Will include; age, gender, demographic information, co-morbid&#xD;
           conditions, pre-injury medications, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score,&#xD;
           Abbreviated Injury Severity Score (AIS). In our intensive care unit, pulmonary artery&#xD;
           catheters are routinely inserted in critically injured elderly trauma patients who do&#xD;
           not respond to initial resuscitation. Patients with a PAC will have a complete&#xD;
           hemodynamic profile (PAWP, CVP, MAP, PAM, CI, SV, SVRI, PVRI, LVSWI) and O2 transport&#xD;
           profile (SvO2, DO2I, VO2I) recorded. Laboratory studies will include serum lactate, base&#xD;
           deficit, CBC, electrolytes, and coagulation profile. Blood will also be obtained to&#xD;
           measure baseline levels of markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-1, TNF), cardiac injury&#xD;
           (troponin), as well as for peripheral blood leukocyte isolation for measurements of p38&#xD;
           MAP kinase and NF-kB activation, and genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Resuscitation and Daily Management: Our intensive care unit is a closed unit staffed by&#xD;
           a group of six dedicated faculty, all of whom have certification in critical care.&#xD;
           Treatments, including resuscitation end-points, management of fluid/electrolytes,&#xD;
           ventilator therapy, weaning, evaluation/treatment of fever/sepsis, pain/sedation,&#xD;
           nutrition, as well as management of specific injury types, are provided according to&#xD;
           established clinical protocols, thus reducing or eliminating treatment bias and&#xD;
           potentially confounding management variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mortality: The primary outcome will be mortality. All patients will be followed&#xD;
                from time of enrollment to study completion. Therefore, duration of follow-up will&#xD;
                vary from 1-23 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Cardiac Events: ICU records (flow charts, labs, ECG) will be screened daily for&#xD;
                evidence of dysrhythmia, ischemia/MI, and hypotension. Diagnosis of MI will be&#xD;
                based on clinical symptoms, ECG changes, cardiac biomarkers, and autopsy data, if&#xD;
                available. Studies on the detection of myocardial infarction demonstrate that&#xD;
                incidence is dependent on the type, frequency, and timing of a diagnostic test, as&#xD;
                well as the criteria being used. Our study will base the determination of MI on the&#xD;
                consensus document of the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of&#xD;
                Cardiology Committee for the redefinition of MI.47 The timing of diagnostic tests&#xD;
                will be based on the AHA guidelines for myocardial infarction surveillance for high&#xD;
                and intermediate risk patients after major surgical procedures. Accordingly, an ECG&#xD;
                will be obtained at baseline, daily for two days, after any surgical procedure, and&#xD;
                at ICU discharge. Biochemical markers will be obtained at baseline, after any&#xD;
                surgical procedure, daily for two days, and on day 4 or day of ICU discharge&#xD;
                (whichever comes first).26 Classification of cardiac events will be done by&#xD;
                individuals blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Infection/Organ Dysfunction: ICU records will be screened daily for evidence of&#xD;
                infection (fever, altered WBC, pneumonia, abdominal abscess, UTI, line sepsis).&#xD;
                Sepsis and MOD will be calculated by individuals blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Length of Stay: ICU stay, ventilator days, and hospital stay will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Laboratory Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Serum Troponins: Serum cardiac troponin I will be determined by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Inflammatory Markers: WBC's will be isolated from whole blood by centrifugation,&#xD;
                and nuclear proteins isolated to measure NF-kB nuclear translocation. Nuclear&#xD;
                protein extracts will be assayed by ELISA with the TransAM NF-kB p65 activation&#xD;
                assay to determine the degree of NF-kB activation following LPS stimulation. The&#xD;
                amount of translocated NF-kB will be standardized to total protein content, which&#xD;
                will be determined in a standard Bradford assay.48 Activation of p38 MAP kinase&#xD;
                will be conducted with the p38 MAP kinase assay kit. Briefly, a monoclonal&#xD;
                phoso-specific antibody to p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) is used to selectively&#xD;
                immunoprecipitate active p38 MAP kinase from the cell lysates. The resulting&#xD;
                immunoprecipitate is incubated with ATF-2 fusion protein in the presence of ATP and&#xD;
                kinase buffer. This allows immunoprecipitated active p38 MAP kinase to&#xD;
                phosphorylate ATF-2. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 is measured by Western&#xD;
                blotting using a phosphor-ATF-2 (Thr71) antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
                IL-6 concentrations in plasma will be determined by conventional ELISA, using&#xD;
                OptEIATM Sets. Briefly, a plate is coated with a monoclonal antibody that is&#xD;
                specific for IL-6. Standards and samples are added to the wells, and any IL-6&#xD;
                present binds to the immobilized antibody. The wells are washed and incubated at&#xD;
                room temperature with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate mixed with a&#xD;
                biotinylated anti-human IL-6 antibody. The wells are again washed and a TMB&#xD;
                substrate solution is added producing a color change. The microwell absorbances are&#xD;
                read at 450 nm. The concentration of IL-6 is directly proportional to the color&#xD;
                intensity of the test sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sequencing of Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Genotype: The Ser49Gly and Arg399Gly SNP's&#xD;
                of the adrenergic receptor will be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
                Genotypes will be assayed by pyrosequencing and DNA sequence analysis. Genomic DNA&#xD;
                will be extracted from whole blood by ammonium acetate-ethanol precipitation and&#xD;
                the yield quantified by comparison of staining intensity relative to lanes&#xD;
                containing known concentrations of standards.49 Fragments containing each of the&#xD;
                SNP's will be individually PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using a thermal profile,&#xD;
                reaction conditions, and primer sequences specific for each SNP. All genotypes will&#xD;
                be determined by pyrosequence analysis using PSQ 96 SNP Software. Each SNP will be&#xD;
                assayed with a specific primer sequence, which will enable the scoring of&#xD;
                heterozygotes and alternate homozygotes with equal reliability. Amplification&#xD;
                conditions have been established and optimized for more than two dozen loci in our&#xD;
                laboratory over the past two years. The addition of new candidate SNPs has become a&#xD;
                routine matter. We have utilized these protocols to generate genotype data for more&#xD;
                than 20 SNP's in over 600 individuals that have been published five manuscripts&#xD;
                over the past several years.&#xD;
