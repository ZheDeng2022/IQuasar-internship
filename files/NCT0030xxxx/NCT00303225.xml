  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an experimental antiviral drug called SIGA-246 for use against the&#xD;
      smallpox virus (variola). Although smallpox has been universally eradicated, it could&#xD;
      possibly be brought back as a bioweapon. In the event of a smallpox attack, it would be best&#xD;
      to have an antiviral medication in addition to the smallpox vaccine. SIGA-246 has shown to&#xD;
      have activity against other viruses from the same family (orthopoxvirus) that smallpox&#xD;
      belongs to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who are 18-50 years of age and are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive a one-time dose of SIGA-246 (either 500 mg,&#xD;
      1000 mg, or 2000 mg) or a placebo (sugar pill) taken by mouth. They report to the clinic in&#xD;
      the morning for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insertion of intravenous (IV) line in the forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests before taking the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug administration within 30 minutes of eating a light breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sampling from the IV line at 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5 and 6,&#xD;
           10 and 12 hours after taking SIGA-246 to determine how the drug is absorbed,&#xD;
           distributed, broken down and excreted. Samples are also collected by needle stick at 24&#xD;
           and 48 hours for the same tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram at 2 hours and 24 hours after taking SIGA-246.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection after taking the SIGA-246.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete diary card at home for 7 days after taking the SIGA-246.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits at about 2 weeks and about 4 weeks after taking SIGA-246.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Checks for health changes or problems at every visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, smallpox has been responsible for hundreds of millions of deaths. In 1980 the&#xD;
      World Health Organization declared the global eradication of smallpox which was achieved&#xD;
      through a surveillance and vaccination program using live virus vaccine. In spite of its&#xD;
      eradication, the deliberate use of smallpox as a bioterrorist agent remains a threat. While&#xD;
      there is an effective vaccine, there have been concerns regarding vaccine complications which&#xD;
      have prevented universal vaccination in the absence of disease exposure. In addition, in the&#xD;
      event of a smallpox outbreak vaccination may be ineffective in immunocompromised individuals&#xD;
      and in those who were exposed to the virus more than 3 days prior to vaccination. Antiviral&#xD;
      therapy may be able to supplement a vaccine, however, there are limitations of the currently&#xD;
      available drug options. SIGA-246 is an oral medication that has been shown to be highly&#xD;
      active against variola virus and has demonstrated safety in animal models. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SIGA-246 at various doses&#xD;
      with a secondary objective of evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the drug. To achieve these&#xD;
      objectives, 30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled into one of three dosing groups (500 mg,&#xD;
      1000 mg, or 2000 mg) to receive an oral, single dose of SIGA-246 or placebo. In each of the&#xD;
      three ascending dosing groups there will be 8 active drug recipients and 2 placebo&#xD;
      recipients. Safety of the study agents will be assessed by history, physical, and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations. Pharmacokinetic endpoints include C(max), T(max), t(1/2), AUC, CI and urinary&#xD;
      excretion. Urine will be collected in 3 8-hour intervals and serial blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained after study agent administration.&#xD;
