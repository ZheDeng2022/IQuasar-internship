      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin works as second-line therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin as&#xD;
           second-line chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine overall response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine time to progression, time to treatment failure, and overall survival of these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the type, frequency, severity, timing, and relatedness of all adverse events&#xD;
           during treatment and for 30 days after completion of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the expression of RRM1 and ERCC1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes followed by oxaliplatin IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each course, at the completion&#xD;
      of study treatment, and then every 6 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
