  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Oblimersen may help rituximab work better by&#xD;
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase II trial is studying how well&#xD;
      giving rituximab together with oblimersen works in treating patients with stage II, stage&#xD;
      III, or stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate (overall and complete response rate) after rituximab +&#xD;
      oblimersen sodium extended induction therapy in previously untreated cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 20 positive (CD20+) follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to progression after rituximab + oblimersen sodium extended&#xD;
      induction therapy in previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicity profile of rituximab + oblimersen sodium therapy in previously&#xD;
      untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish whether the therapeutic effects of the rituximab + oblimersen sodium&#xD;
      combination are sufficiently promising to warrant evaluation in a subsequent randomized trial&#xD;
      (in comparison to rituximab alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate Fc receptor profiling to response to rituximab + oblimersen sodium in&#xD;
      previously untreated patients with follicular NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the relationship between change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) uptake early&#xD;
      after treatment with rituximab + oblimersen sodium to response rate and time to progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction therapy (month 1): Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and&#xD;
      15-21 and rituximab IV on days 3, 10, 17, and 24 in month 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended induction therapy (months 3, 5, 7, and 9): Patients receive oblimersen IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 22-28 and rituximab IV on day 24 in months 3, 5, 7, and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment continues for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
