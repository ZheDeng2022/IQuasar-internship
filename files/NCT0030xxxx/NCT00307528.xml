  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the licensed Pneumovax 23™ vaccine is not always satisfactory in elderly subjects, the&#xD;
      safety and the immune response of the new investigational pneumococcal protein vaccine is&#xD;
      evaluated in healthy elderly population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since influenza vaccination is recommended in the age range of the study population, Fluarix™&#xD;
      (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) vaccine will be offered free of charge during the study period&#xD;
      (for 3 consecutive years starting from September 2004), to be used by Investigators according&#xD;
      to national vaccination schedule/practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep&#xD;
      2007.&#xD;
