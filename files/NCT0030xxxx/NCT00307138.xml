  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been continuing debate about whether use of hetastarch for volume replacement in&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass surgery [CABG] increases the risk of postoperative bleeding. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis of hetastarch use in on-pump CABG concluded that use of hetastarch in these&#xD;
      procedures is associated with increased risk, but the safety of hetastarch use in off-pump&#xD;
      procedures remains unresolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed a double-blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate this question. The&#xD;
      study was designed as an equivalence trial. Statistical power calculations were performed&#xD;
      taking this into consideration. Sealed assignments from a block randomization table developed&#xD;
      prior nto initiation of the trial were unsealed in the operating room. These were used to&#xD;
      assign patients scheduled for off-pump CABG to receive either 1 L of hetastarch or 1 L of&#xD;
      albumin as part of intraoperative volume replacement. Albumin was used for all subsequent&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative fluid replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of postoperative bleeding was assessed prospectively by monitoring hourly chest tube&#xD;
      drainage and number of units of blood products transfused postoperatively in the Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit. Risk was assessed by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) established for&#xD;
      this trial. The SAMC was scheduled per protocol to meet after the first 15 subjects (both&#xD;
      groups combined) had 1000cc or more of chest tube drainage in the first 12 hours&#xD;
      postoperative, and then subsequently either after 15 additional bleeds of this volume or&#xD;
      following a schedule set at the discretion of the DSMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was continued until 156 patients had been recruited. At that time, 78 participants&#xD;
      each had been assigned to the hetastarch and albumin groups. DSMC review at that time&#xD;
      determined that use of hetastarch is associated with a risk of postoperative bleeding which&#xD;
      is greater than the risk associated with use of albumin and the DSMC accordingly halted the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligibility screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. All adult Kaiser Permanente members admitted to Summit Hospital (Oakland, CA) for&#xD;
           coronary bypass graft surgery which is planned to be conducted off-pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment period: 9/1/2004 through 7/27/05&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. At recruitment, each subject who agrees to participate is assigned a study number&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The study number is assigned sequentially and is totally independent of the&#xD;
                     medical record number or other personal identifying information&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The linkage between the study number and all personal identifying information&#xD;
                     is kept in a locked file separate from other project data&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. patients scheduled to undergo on-pump procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. patients with a history of any of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. primary bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. end-stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical power analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. This study is designed as an equivalence trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Target outcome rates are based on those published in Sade RM, Stroud MR, Crawford&#xD;
                FA Jr, et al. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1985 May;89(5):713-22.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Statistical power is calculated using the confidence-interval-based technique for&#xD;
                normally distributed interval variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The confidence interval is set at 95%&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The range of equivalence is defined as +100 milliliters&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Power is set at 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The target sample size which results from this analysis is 165 patients in each arm&#xD;
                (i.e., hetastarch and albumin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analytic strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All project analyses are conducted by intention-to-treat&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bivariate comparisons between the study (i.e., hetastarch) and control (i.e.,&#xD;
                albumin) group measurements use the Fisher exact test or Student's t test for&#xD;
                independent samples as appropriate given the nature of the measurement were used to&#xD;
                conduct bivariate comparisons of study group measures with control group measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                1) Confidence intervals are calculated using the exact techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Multivariate comparisons: Analysis of variance and general linear modeling are used&#xD;
                to conduct multivariate comparisons of measures between the study and control&#xD;
                groups while controlling for covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intervention process&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. When the patient is in the operating room, the anesthesiologist opens the envelope&#xD;
                containing the study group assignment (i.e., hetastarch or albumin).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The attending anesthesiologist administers 1 liter of 6% hetastarch&#xD;
                     intraoperatively to patients from the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The attending anesthesiologist administers 1 liter of albumin intraoperatively&#xD;
                     to patients from the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. After the first liter of colloid is administered, the patients receive only albumin&#xD;
                if more colloid is needed to meet additional requirements for fluid replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All patients receive the remaining standard operative regimen of crystalloids and&#xD;
                blood products at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. All patients are transferred postoperatively to the Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The attending intensivists are blinded to the patient's randomization&#xD;
                     assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The attending intensivists use standard fluid replacement at their clinical&#xD;
                     discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. No hetastarch is administered in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
