      The purpose of this study is to determine if Alefacept is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      palmar plantar pustulosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palmar plantar pustulosis is a chronic, disabling skin condition which is difficult to treat&#xD;
      since it is often recalcitrant to current treatments and associated with high recurrence&#xD;
      rates. This condition appears to be a T lymphocyte mediated condition and is thought by some&#xD;
      to be a subtype of psoriasis. Alefacept affects T cell activation and induces apoptosis of&#xD;
      memory T cells. It has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris&#xD;
      and may be associated with prolonged remissions. There is extremely limited experience with&#xD;
      use of Alefacept in Palmar Plantar Pustulosis. This pilot trial should provide additional&#xD;
      information concerning its use for this indication.&#xD;
