  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine for preventing West Nile virus&#xD;
      infection. The virus is spread mainly by mosquito bites. Symptoms can include high fever,&#xD;
      headache, neck stiffness, stupor, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis.&#xD;
      Rarely, infection leads to permanent nerve damage and possibly death. The vaccine used in the&#xD;
      study is made from DNA that codes for West Nile virus proteins. Injected into a muscle, the&#xD;
      DNA instructs the body to make a small amount of West Nile virus protein. This study will see&#xD;
      if the body creates resistance or immunity to these proteins. Participants cannot get West&#xD;
      Nile virus from the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests for various infections and other medical problems. Women who are able to become&#xD;
      pregnant are given a pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not&#xD;
      participate. Anyone who has received a vaccination for Yellow Fever or Japanese Encephalitis&#xD;
      virus in the past may not participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive three injections of the experimental vaccine, the first on the&#xD;
      first study day (Day 0), the second on Day 28, and the third on Day 56. The injections are&#xD;
      given with a device called BiojectorÂ® (Registered Trademark) 2000 that delivers the vaccine&#xD;
      through the skin into the muscle without the use of a needle. On the day of each injection,&#xD;
      subjects are given a diary card to take home for recording their temperature and any symptoms&#xD;
      or side effects for 5 days. They return to the clinic 2 weeks after each injection, bringing&#xD;
      the completed card with them at that time. In addition to the injections, subjects have the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures during clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and, if needed, physical examination: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,&#xD;
           12, 24 and 32&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs and weight: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node exam: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (for women): Day 0 and weeks 4, 8 and 32&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood and urine tests are for health checks. Some blood samples are also used to study&#xD;
      the immune response to the vaccine and for gene testing.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open-label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-WNVDNA020-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this&#xD;
      regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit a higher titer of neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody response than a prior WNV DNA vaccine. The primary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine in healthy young adults and&#xD;
      in healthy older adults. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-WNVDNA020-00-VP is composed of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid&#xD;
      that encodes the WNV viral protein precursor transmembrane (prM) and envelope (E) with a&#xD;
      CMV/R promoter. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL&#xD;
      of vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle using the Biojector 2000&#xD;
      Needle-Free Injection Management System (Biojector).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: A total of 30 healthy adults will be enrolled in two groups: Group 1 will be&#xD;
      comprised of 15 healthy adults 18 to 50 years old and Group 2 will be comprised of 15 healthy&#xD;
      adults 51 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: All subjects will receive 3 injections on the schedule shown in the schema. The&#xD;
      protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 32 weeks of clinical follow up for each participant. A long-term follow-up&#xD;
      contact at Week 52 may include interim medical history and research blood draw; or subject&#xD;
      may opt for the long-term contact to occur by telephone, e-mail or mail for the interim&#xD;
      medical history only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of the regimen. The&#xD;
      secondary immunogenicity endpoints are WNV neutralizing antibody, WNV specific antibody as&#xD;
      measured by ELISA, WNV-specific T cell responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining&#xD;
      (ICS) assay and ELISPOT. Other immunogenicity assays through Week 32 may also be completed as&#xD;
      exploratory evaluations, as well as from the Week 52 blood samples if collected.&#xD;
