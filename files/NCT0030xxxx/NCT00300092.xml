      Study objective: Fingertip injuries are common in the pediatric population. Considerable&#xD;
      controversy exists about whether prophylactic antibiotics are necessary after repair of such&#xD;
      injuries. Our goals were to estimate the rate of bacterial infection among pediatric patients&#xD;
      with distal fingertip injuries overall and to compare the rate of bacterial infections among&#xD;
      subgroups treated with and without prophylactic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This was prospective randomized control study of pediatric patients presenting to an&#xD;
      urban children's hospital with trauma to the distal fingertip requiring repair. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized to two groups: those receiving prophylactic antibiotics (Cephalexin) and those who&#xD;
      did not receive antibiotic therapy. Repairs were performed in a standardized fashion and all&#xD;
      patients were re-evaluated in the same emergency department in 48 hours and by phone 7 days&#xD;
      later. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of infection.&#xD;

      MATERIAL and METHODS Study design, Setting and Selection of Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized control trial was conducted at an urban children's hospital&#xD;
      Emergency Department with 56,000 visits annually. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
      approved the study prior to subject enrollment. The study period was from September 2000 to&#xD;
      July 2004. All patients under 18 years of age presenting to the Emergency Department with a&#xD;
      fingertip injury distal to the distal interphalangeal joint were eligible to participate.&#xD;
      Patients were excluded from the study if the time from injury to repair was greater than&#xD;
      eight hours, if the patients had diabetes, an oncologic disorder, an immune deficiency, a&#xD;
      bleeding disorder, used steroids regularly, presented with a grossly contaminated wound, were&#xD;
      currently taking antibiotics, or had a previous allergic reaction to cephalosporins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was formulated as an equivalence trial to demonstrate non-inferiority of repair&#xD;
      without versus with prophylactic antibiotics. The rate of infection 7 days after repair was&#xD;
      the primary outcome variable. Determination of the target sample size was based on a&#xD;
      combination of practicality and maximum difference between infection rates consistent with&#xD;
      equivalence. It was judged feasible to enroll 160 subjects over the course of the study.&#xD;
      Sample sizes of 80 per group would have 80% power to conclude with 95% certainty that the&#xD;
      infection rates in the two groups were equivalent. This calculation is based on an upper&#xD;
      1-sided 95% confidence limit for the difference in infection rates, with percent infected of&#xD;
      6.25% in both groups, and the maximum allowable difference resulting in equivalence to be&#xD;
      10.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All wounds were treated following a standardized protocol.9, 10 First, the degree of injury&#xD;
      was recorded. Fingertips were classified into one of five categories: no laceration (damage&#xD;
      to nailbed), simple laceration, loss of skin or pulp, partial amputation or complete&#xD;
      amputation. Subungal hematomas were drained by cautery. Hand x-rays were obtained to detect&#xD;
      fractures, dislocations, or foreign bodies. Lacerations were irrigated with 500cc normal&#xD;
      saline after a digital block with 1% lidocaine (no epinephrine). Devitalized tissue was&#xD;
      removed. Skin lacerations and nail bed injuries were repaired with chromic gut. Xeroform&#xD;
      gauze was then applied to the repaired finger and a bulky dressing secured. A tetanus booster&#xD;
      was given if patient's immunizations were not up-to-date. At discharge study participants&#xD;
      were given a standard wound care instruction sheet and a scheduled follow-up appointment at&#xD;
      48 hours. Subjects were told to return immediately to the same Emergency Department if they&#xD;
      noticed signs or symptoms of infection, including the presence of redness, warmth,&#xD;
      tenderness, swelling, discharge or fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All wounds were repaired by residents, fellows, and/or attending physicians in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department. In-service training was provided in the Emergency Department prior to starting&#xD;
      the study and periodically during the study period to assure consistency in the repair&#xD;
      process. If the wound was repaired by a resident or fellow, the attending in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department provided direct supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After standard wound repair, eligible patients (and caregivers) were approached for&#xD;
      enrollment. Interpreters were provided if the caregiver's or patient's primary language was&#xD;
      not English. If caregivers and appropriate study subjects agreed, informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained. Participants were then randomized to one of two groups using a randomization list&#xD;
      prepared in advance with PROC PLAN within the Statistical Analysis System (SAS).11 Subjects&#xD;
      assigned to Group 1 received no antibiotics after fingertip repair. Group 2 received&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics (Cephalexin 50 mg/kg three times daily), upon discharge for 7 days.&#xD;
      Cephalexin was chosen as the antibiotic of choice because the majority of wound infections&#xD;
      are caused by gram positive organism (Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species). The full&#xD;
      7-day course of antibiotics was dispensed to study subjects prior to discharge. The cost of&#xD;
      the antibiotics was covered by the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 48-hour follow-up visit was scheduled and the subject was told that one of the primary&#xD;
      investigators would contact them by phone in 7 days. Subjects received instructions to keep&#xD;
      their hand elevated, to keep the dressing clean and dry, to leave the dressings in place and&#xD;
      to return to the Emergency Department immediately if signs or symptoms of wound infection&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up visit and with the phone call, one of the three study investigators&#xD;
      evaluated for the presence of infection, compliance with antibiotics, and wound healing.&#xD;
      Infection was determined by the presence of erythema, tenderness, warmth, purulent discharge,&#xD;
      regional lymphadenopathy, and fever. Subject compliance with the antibiotic regime was&#xD;
      recorded at 48 hours and at 7 days after repair. Compliance was determined by phone follow-up&#xD;
      asking the caregiver to measure the amount of antibiotic left in the bottle and asking for&#xD;
      the number of doses administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data were collected at the initial visit by the physician repairing the wound. Data&#xD;
      from the 48 hour and 7 day phone follow-up were collected by one of the three primary&#xD;
      investigators. All data was recorded on a standardized data collection form and then entered&#xD;
      into a computerized Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. All hospital charts were reviewed by the&#xD;
      primary investigator at the close of the study for quality assurance purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups were compared for age, gender, time of injury, place of injury, mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, finger involved, presence of fracture, complexity of injury, level of training of the&#xD;
      treating physician, laceration experience of the treating physician, and number of sutures&#xD;
      placed, using the 2-sample t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test or a Chi squared test for categorical variables. The rate of infection 7&#xD;
      days after repair was calculated for each treatment group, along with exact binomial 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. To assess the equivalence of the two treatments, the difference D =&#xD;
      infection rate in the No Antibiotic Group minus infection rate in the Antibiotic Group was&#xD;
      calculated. The upper limit of a 1-sided 95% confidence interval for D was used to estimate&#xD;
      the maximum amount by which the infection rate without antibiotics may exceed that with&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics. Additional analyses included comparison between dropouts and those&#xD;
      who completed the study on demographic variables and wound and repair characteristics, and&#xD;
      comparisons between those with and without infection to identify potential predictors of&#xD;
      infection other than group assignment. NCSS 2004 software was used for equivalence testing.12&#xD;
      Statistical tests comparing group characteristics were 2-sided and considered significant for&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05, using the SAS software, version 8.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of Study Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 146 subjects were initially enrolled in the study. The study was terminated&#xD;
      earlier than expected because of staffing issues. Eleven participants were withdrawn prior to&#xD;
      study completion. Those not completing the study included four subjects who could not be&#xD;
      reached for phone follow-up, three subjects who received antibiotics during the study period&#xD;
      for a reason other than infection of the fingertip, two subjects for whom insufficient data&#xD;
      was available for analysis, one subject who received antibiotics prior to repair and one&#xD;
      subject who requested to be withdrawn from the study prior to completion. These eleven&#xD;
      subjects were significantly older than those who completed the study (6.0 +/- 3.8 vs. 3.1 +/-&#xD;
      2.7 years, p=0.001), but were similar on all other baseline characteristics. In addition,&#xD;
      subjects were equally distributed between the 2 groups: 6/75 (8%) from Group 1(No Antibiotic)&#xD;
      and 5/71 (7%) from Group 2(Antibiotic) (p=1.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 135 subjects completed the study, 69 assigned to Group 1(No Antibiotic) and 66&#xD;
      assigned to Group 2(Antibiotic). Baseline characteristics of the two groups are shown in&#xD;
      Table 1. Values tabulated are mean + s.d. for continuous variables and number and percent for&#xD;
      categorical variables. No statistically significant differences on any baseline values were&#xD;
      found between the two treatment groups. At the 7 day interview, the percent who reported&#xD;
      consuming at least 75% of the prescribed doses was 86.2% (95% CI: 75.3%, 93.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 7 days after repair, one subject in each treatment group had an infection. The subject in&#xD;
      the No Antibiotic Group was treated with oral antibiotics and the subject in the Antibiotic&#xD;
      Group was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Both made a full recovery. The infection rate&#xD;
      (95% confidence interval) was 1.45% (0.04%, 7.81%) for the No Antibiotic Group and was 1.52%&#xD;
      (0.04%, 8.16%) for the Antibiotic Group, not statistically significant (p=1.00). The upper&#xD;
      limit of a 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in rates was 4.9% indicating&#xD;
      that there is a 5% chance that the infection rate in subjects not treated with antibiotics&#xD;
      would exceed that of subjects treated with antibiotics by more than 4.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the number of infections was too small for meaningful statistical comparisons,&#xD;
      examination of the two infected cases revealed that the number of sutures was considerably&#xD;
      larger than that among the uninfected subjects. The number of sutures for the two infected&#xD;
      subjects was 8 and 9 (mean=8.5; standard deviation=0.7) and the mean (S.D.) for the&#xD;
      uninfected subjects was 4.9 (2.0). After the completion of the study, chart review revealed&#xD;
      four infections presenting beyond the seven-day window (Days 7-14), three in the Antibiotic&#xD;
      Group and one in the No Antibiotic group. Interestingly, 41% of all wounds involved a&#xD;
      fracture and none of these became infected.&#xD;
