      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor&#xD;
      pretreatment on inflammation and coagulation activation in human endotoxemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial effect of lipid lowering in cardiovascular disease is well established. Statin&#xD;
      potently reduce elevated cholesterol levels but also exert pleiotropic other effects such as&#xD;
      improvement of inflammation-induced vascular dysfunction, upregulation of endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase, yield antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties and lower tissue factor&#xD;
      (TF) expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNC) in vivo. The mechanism of&#xD;
      action for these effects remains unclear, but is already seen after short term treatment and&#xD;
      was independent of cholesterol reduction. Following endotoxin administration to healthy&#xD;
      humans, the systemic response includes the activation of inflammation by cytokines, mainly&#xD;
      IL-1, IL-6, THF-α and INF-γ, activation of the clotting system with enhanced thrombin&#xD;
      generation, and vascular dysfunction, as demonstrable by an impaired response to&#xD;
      vasoconstrictors. Low dose endotoxemia therefore serves as an adequate model for acute&#xD;
      inflammation and the interaction of the three systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pretreatment&#xD;
      on inflammation and coagulation activation in human endotoxemia and to investigate if&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects are similar between two different statins. Further, we plan to&#xD;
      study genome-wide effects on the leukocyte transcriptome induced by (i) statin pretreatment,&#xD;
      (ii) low-dose endotoxemia, and (iii) the anti-inflammatory effects if the statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out as a randomized placebo controlled double-blind threeway&#xD;
      crossover three period study. Subjects will receive three treatment periods (Day 1 - Day 5)&#xD;
      in randomized order consisting of 5 days oral Simvastatin (80 mg/day), 5 days oral&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) and 5 days adequate placebo. On Day 5 of each study period, subjects&#xD;
      will receive LPS (2 ng/kg i.v.). Inflammatory protein expression and coagulation activation&#xD;
      will be assessed on Day 1 and Day 5 of each period. Washout-time between treatment periods&#xD;
      will be ≥6 weeks.&#xD;
