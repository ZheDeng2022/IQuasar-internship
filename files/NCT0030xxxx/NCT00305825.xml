      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Estrogen can cause the growth of&#xD;
      breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the&#xD;
      amount of estrogen the body makes. Giving bevacizumab together with letrozole may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with letrozole&#xD;
      works in treating postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of bevacizumab in combination with letrozole in&#xD;
           postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive,&#xD;
           unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate (partial response [PR] and complete response [CR]) in&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical benefit rate (PR, CR, and stabilization of disease for ≥ 24&#xD;
           weeks) in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of patients treated with this regimen who have stable disease&#xD;
           for ≥ 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the molecular profile of the patient's breast tumor and explore the&#xD;
           relationship between these molecular characteristics and response or resistance to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain serial measurements (pre- and post-treatment) of circulating endothelial cells&#xD;
           and epithelial cells and explore the relationship between these cells and serum markers&#xD;
           of angiogenesis and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral letrozole once daily on&#xD;
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
