      Aim: To investigate the therapeutic potential of IL-1Ra in type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Since the major defect leading to a decrease in b-cell mass in type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      increased apoptosis, therapeutic approaches designed to arrest apoptosis could be a&#xD;
      significant new development in its management. This approach might actually reverse the&#xD;
      disease to a degree rather than just palliate glycemia. Based on current thinking, treatment&#xD;
      with IL-1Ra appears as a promising approach. The prospected effect is blocking of the&#xD;
      IL-1b-mediated glucotoxicity and thereby to prevent the decline in b-cell mass, together with&#xD;
      a rapid restoration of b-cell function. FDA approval for IL-1Ra in the treatment of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis occurred based on a favourable tolerability profile.&#xD;

      Methodology: This will be a two-centre (University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland and Steno&#xD;
      Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Denmark) study. 72 patients will be randomised according to a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which half of the patients are treated with&#xD;
      IL-1Ra, the other half with saline. The treatment period will last 13 weeks. This time-period&#xD;
      should be sufficient for reversal of functional glucotoxicity and feasible in terms of&#xD;
      patient compliance. Whether 13 weeks of treatment will be sufficient to make significant&#xD;
      changes in b-cell mass in unpredictable. However, blocking b-cell apoptosis, while new islet&#xD;
      formation and b-cell replication are normal, may initiate enlargement of b-cell mass, which&#xD;
      may progress beyond the treatment period. Patient evaluation will be performed at start and&#xD;
      after 4, 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. Following 13 weeks, patients with a fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      levels &gt; 8 mM or with a glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) &gt; 8% will be treated with&#xD;
      insulin. Insulin treatment will not be initiated earlier to avoid interference with possible&#xD;
      effects of insulin on primary outcome in the period where the largest effect of IL-1Ra are&#xD;
      expected. To assess effects of IL-1Ra on insulin sensitivity, a subset of 40 patients (20&#xD;
      IL-1Ra- and 20 placebo-treated) will undergo an euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp as well as&#xD;
      a muscle and fat biopsy at start and after the end of treatment (13 weeks). The Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of both centres have already approved the procedure.&#xD;
