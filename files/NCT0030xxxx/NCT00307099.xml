  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 460 subjects who have new pulmonary infiltrates during their ICU stay&#xD;
      and who are at low risk of having pneumonia, as determined using the Clinical Pulmonary&#xD;
      Infection Score (CPIS). The study is designed to determine whether 3 days of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment with meropenem (with or without coverage for MRSA) for ICU subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      new pulmonary infiltrates can reduce the emergence of anti-microbial-resistant organisms and&#xD;
      the isolation of a potential pathogen compared to a standard course of antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      (minimum of 8 days of therapy with antibiotics of the primary care team's choosing). Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly placed in either the meropenem group or standard antibiotic therapy group.&#xD;
      The study will also examine whether short-course therapy reduces hospital length of stay and&#xD;
      hospital cost, without having a negative effect on subject morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care units (ICUs) are the most frequently identified source of nosocomial&#xD;
      infections within the hospital, with infection rates and antimicrobial resistance rates&#xD;
      significantly higher than in the general ward. In one study, antimicrobial use was reported&#xD;
      to be 10 times higher in the ICU compared to antimicrobial use in the general ward. Although&#xD;
      antibiotics are given for a variety of conditions, antibiotics prescribed for respiratory&#xD;
      infections, suspected or proven, account for almost one-half of all antibiotic consumption in&#xD;
      the ICU. Importantly, the use of antimicrobial agents has been identified as a critical risk&#xD;
      factor in the emergence of resistant bacterial infections. By identifying and focusing on&#xD;
      subsets of subjects who are unlikely to have infection and therefore unlikely to benefit from&#xD;
      antibiotics, antibiotic use and the subsequent emergence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms&#xD;
      could be limited. This is a Phase III, multi-center, randomized, open-label study designed to&#xD;
      determine whether 3 days of antibiotic treatment with meropenem (with or without coverage for&#xD;
      MRSA) for ICU subjects diagnosed with new pulmonary infiltrates can reduce the emergence of&#xD;
      antimicrobial-resistant organisms and the isolation of a potential pathogen compared to a&#xD;
      standard course of antibiotic therapy (minimum of 8 days of therapy with antibiotics of the&#xD;
      primary care team's choosing). The primary objective of this study is to compare risk of&#xD;
      resistant infection in the ICU by evaluating the difference in the incidence of either the&#xD;
      emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or the isolation of a potential pathogen in ICU&#xD;
      subjects who receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy to ICU subjects who receive&#xD;
      standard antibiotic therapy for the treatment of pulmonary infiltrates (with low likelihood&#xD;
      of having pneumonia). Secondary objectives are to: 1) assess the mortality of subjects&#xD;
      receiving short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compared to standard antibiotic therapy; 2)&#xD;
      assess the ICU length of stay (LOS) in subjects receiving short-course empiric antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy compared to standard antibiotic therapy; 3) assess the hospital LOS in subjects&#xD;
      receiving short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compared to standard antibiotic therapy; 4)&#xD;
      assess the costs of antibiotic therapy in subjects receiving short-course empiric antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy compared to standard antibiotic therapy. The costs will be based on ICU LOS, hospital&#xD;
      LOS, antibiotic treatment, and standard costs related to the treatment of infection-related&#xD;
      adverse experiences; 5) assess the risk of clinically significant infection in subjects&#xD;
      receiving short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compared to standard antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
      This study will enroll 460 subjects who have new pulmonary infiltrates during their ICU stay&#xD;
      and who are at low risk of having pneumonia, as determined using the Clinical Pulmonary&#xD;
      Infection Score (CPIS).&#xD;
