      This study proposes to determine the safety of the administration of E7820 plus cetuximab and&#xD;
      explore the MTD of the combination in a Phase Ib study. In addition, the efficacy of this&#xD;
      combination will be explored in patients with colorectal cancer in the Phase II proof of&#xD;
      concept phase of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by liver function test&#xD;
             abnormalities no greater than CTC grade 1 (bilirubin, alanine transaminase [ALT], and&#xD;
             aspartate transaminase [AST]) unless increased LFTs are related to liver metastases in&#xD;
             which case CTC grade 2 abnormalities acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration&#xD;
