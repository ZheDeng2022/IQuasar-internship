  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus infection has clearly been recognized as the cause of cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Indeed, the infection of the cervix by certain oncogenic types of HPV, if not cleared , can&#xD;
      lead over time to cervical cancer in women . This study will evaluate the immune response&#xD;
      induced by the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and the safety of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep&#xD;
      2007.&#xD;

      The protocol was primarily amended for the following reason:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Merck's tetravalent HPV vaccine, GardasilÂ®, has been licensed and is now becoming&#xD;
      commercially available in an increasing number of countries. Therefore, the study procedures&#xD;
      were revised to include questions at every visit to determine if subjects have received an&#xD;
      HPV vaccine outside of the study.&#xD;
