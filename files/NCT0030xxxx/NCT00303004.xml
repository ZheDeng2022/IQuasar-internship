    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if combination treatment with Bosentan and&#xD;
      Sildenafil to patients with Eisenmenger syndrome is beneficial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eisenmengers syndrome is condition with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension due to a&#xD;
      shunting of blood from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart. When the&#xD;
      pressure in the pulmonary arteries levels the systemic blood pressure, blood begins to shunt&#xD;
      from the right side of the heart to the left side of the heart leading to a condition with&#xD;
      cyanosis, impaired physical capacity and increased mortality (Eisenmengers syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials have shown that there is a beneficial effect of treating patients&#xD;
      with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension with Bosentan or Sildenafil and that a&#xD;
      combination of these may have an additive or even synergistic effect. No clinical trials with&#xD;
      Sildenafil and Bosentan has been conducted for patients with Eisenmengers syndrome.&#xD;
      Observational studies and case stories indicate however that the effect of Bosentan or&#xD;
      Sildenafil in patients with Eisenmengers syndrome may be as promising in these patients as in&#xD;
      patients with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to examine the effect of treating patients with Eisenmengers Syndrome with a&#xD;
      combination of Bosentan and Sildenafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is change in physical performance measured with six minutes walking&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points is change in saturation, NYHA class, cardiac output (cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization and innocor measurement), pulmonary vascular resistance (cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization) shunt ratio (MRI), strain of right ventricle (BNP and echocardiography),&#xD;
      quality of life and serum erythropoitin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed as a randomized, single centre, placebo controlled, double blind cross&#xD;
      over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with Eisenmengers syndrome is included. All patients will be treated in three&#xD;
      months with Bosentan. There after patients will be randomized to receive either Sildenafil&#xD;
      (50 mg tid) or placebo as add on therapy for three month. Hereafter a cross over will be made&#xD;
      and patients in combination treatment will receive only their native treatment and vice&#xD;
      versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations for primary and secondary endpoints will be made at baseline, before cross over&#xD;
      and at the end of the study. All up titrating of medication will be performed during&#xD;
      admittance. Patients will during the study period be close monitored with registration of&#xD;
      adverse advents, physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
