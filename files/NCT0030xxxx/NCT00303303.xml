    <textblock>
      Most patients bitten by copperhead snakes do not currently receive antivenom. Some snakebite&#xD;
      victims have long term problems with the function of the limb that was bitten. This study&#xD;
      will determine whether early administration of antivenom to patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      copperhead snakebites reduces long-term complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to answer three important questions about the role of ovine (sheep-derived)&#xD;
      antivenom in the treatment of people bitten by copperhead snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Although ovine antivenom has been approved by the FDA for treatment of copperhead&#xD;
           envenomation, copperhead victims were excluded from the previous clinical trials. Animal&#xD;
           experiments and retrospective human data suggest that the antivenom probably does work&#xD;
           for copperhead snakebite, at least in the short term. This study will determine whether&#xD;
           the antivenom is actually effective in reducing pain, swelling, and other immediate&#xD;
           effects of copperhead snakebite.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deaths from copperhead snakebite are extremely rare, but survivors often report long&#xD;
           term problems with pain and swelling in the envenomated limb. No study has formally&#xD;
           measured the long-term outcomes in untreated snakebite, nor whether antivenom has any&#xD;
           benefit in reducing the duration or severity of these complications. This study will&#xD;
           answer this question through formal assessments of limb function up to 12 months after&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After initial control of the signs and symptoms of snakebite is achieved with antivenom&#xD;
           therapy, some patients develop recurrent swelling or blood clotting problems. A&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial in rattlesnake victims showed that the frequency of these&#xD;
           problems is reduced by administration of 6 additional vials of antivenom over 18 hours&#xD;
           (&quot;maintenance therapy&quot;). However, blood clotting problems are uncommon in copperhead&#xD;
           snakebite even without antivenom treatment, and a retrospective trial suggested that&#xD;
           maintenance therapy may have no effect on the frequency of delayed swelling in&#xD;
           copperhead victims. In the typical copperhead victim, maintenance therapy increases the&#xD;
           cost of treatment by more than 100%. This study will determine whether maintenance&#xD;
           therapy is necessary in mild to moderate copperhead snakebite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have been bitten by a snake positively&#xD;
      identified as a copperhead within 6 hours of enrollment, if they have signs of mild or&#xD;
      moderate severity envenomation, and if contraindications are not present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After appropriate informed consent, patients are randomized to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. initial stabilizing dose of antivenom, followed by maintenance therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. initial stabilizing dose of antivenom followed by placebo in lieu of maintenance therapy,&#xD;
      or&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. placebo for both initial dose and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All laboratory testing, pain medication, hospitalization, and other therapies are standard&#xD;
      for snakebite of this severity. If at any time the envenomation becomes severe, antivenom is&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard assessments performed on all snakebite victims (swelling, pain,&#xD;
      vital signs, blood clotting, complications of therapy), patients in this study receive formal&#xD;
      assessments of the function of the envenomated limb. This assessment uses the AMA disability&#xD;
      rating system and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons' Normative Outcomes Study&#xD;
      questionnaire do determine how well the limbs function and how well the limbs perform and how&#xD;
      much any remaining problems interfere with the patients' long-term happiness and ability to&#xD;
      perform common activities of daily living.&#xD;
