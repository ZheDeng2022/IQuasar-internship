      Multicenter, prospective, study designed to demonstrate the performance and safety of the&#xD;
      Lumen Biomedical, Inc. FiberNet Embolic Protection System as an adjunctive device during&#xD;
      carotid artery percutaneous intervention. The primary endpoint is the rate of all stoke and&#xD;

      The purpose of this feasibility study is to demonstrate the performance and safety of the&#xD;
      Lumen Biomedical, Inc. FiberNet® Embolic Protection System as an adjunctive device during&#xD;
      carotid artery percutaneous intervention. The feasibility study will involve a maximum of 50&#xD;
      subjects to be enrolled using the FiberNet® during clinically indicated percutaneous&#xD;
      intervention of the carotid artery and followed through 30 days post procedure. Subject will&#xD;
      be enrolled in up to 5 European Investigational Sites. The study is a prospective&#xD;
      multi-center registry with sequential enrollment of qualified subjects who consent to&#xD;
      participate and meet all entrance criteria.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for percutaneous stenting with target lesion located within common or&#xD;
             internal carotid artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic with atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 50% or asymptomatic with atherosclerotic&#xD;
             stenosis ≥ 70% of the carotid artery by NASCET Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Targeted vessel diameter for FiberNet placement between 1.75 mm and 7.0 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator determines that all branch vessels distal to the target lesion and&#xD;
             proximal to the proposed site of device deployment will be adequately protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior stenting of ipsilateral carotid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned treatment of contralateral carotid within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experienced a myocardial infarction within the last 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone an angioplasty or PTCA/PTA procedure within the past 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone cardiac surgery within the past 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a planned invasive surgical procedure within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffered a stroke within the past 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffered a transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) or amaurosis fugax within the&#xD;
             past 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total occlusion of the target vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesions within 2 cm of the ostium of the common carotid artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A stenosis that is known to be unsuitable for stenting because of one or more of:&#xD;
             Tortuous or calcified anatomy proximal or distal to the stenosis, Presence of visual&#xD;
             thrombus, Pseudo occlusion (string sign).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serial lesions that requires more then one stent to cover entire lesion.&#xD;
