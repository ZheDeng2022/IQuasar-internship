      This study will examine how the brain coordinates movement in patients with focal hand&#xD;
      dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and&#xD;
      repetitive movement or abnormal postures. In focal dystonia, just one part of the body, such&#xD;
      as the hand, neck or face, is involved. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS, see below) to study how the brain plans movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia 18 years of age and older may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Healthy subjects may participate in one, two or three of the&#xD;
      experiments described below. Patients with dystonia may participate in experiments one and&#xD;
      three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each experiment, each subject is asked about his/her medical and neurologic history,&#xD;
      complete questionnaires and will undergo a brief physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface EMG: Small electrodes are taped to the skin over the arm to measure the&#xD;
           electrical activity of muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS: A wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
           through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the&#xD;
           stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other&#xD;
           simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg,&#xD;
           and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the&#xD;
           coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2 (Two visits.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses a magnetic field and radio&#xD;
           waves to obtain images of body tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that is&#xD;
           moved into the scanner (a metal cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and&#xD;
           thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 90&#xD;
           minutes, during which time the patient will be asked to lie still for up to 30 minutes&#xD;
           at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Surface EMG and TMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Surface EMG and TMS - During the TMS, subjects are asked to respond to shapes on a computer&#xD;
      screen by pushing a button or pressing a foot petal.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no cure for focal hand dystonia (FHD). FHD research has focused&#xD;
      predominantly on the motor execution abnormality in the primary motor cortex, while the&#xD;
      task-specific nature of FHD has received less attention. Task-specificity suggests that the&#xD;
      underlying task-to-motor output relationship is intact for many activities and dysfunctional&#xD;
      for an important minority of tasks. The premotor cortex plays a key role in this relationship&#xD;
      in health and, likely, plays an equally important role in disordered movement. The goal for&#xD;
      this research proposal is to understand the underlying physiology and contribution of the&#xD;
      premotor cortex in FHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study adult patients with FHD and healthy volunteers on an outpatient basis. In&#xD;
      a task-specific dystonia of the hand known as writer's cramp, handwriting is abnormal due to&#xD;
      posturing and muscle spasm, whereas other tasks done with the affected hand are normal. The&#xD;
      disordered relationship between task-to-motor output in FHD is potentially modifiable if the&#xD;
      correct target and therapeutic modality are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a series of three experiments, we propose to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      to examine the circuitry of the premotor to motor cortex connections in FHD, to interrupt&#xD;
      motor planning in FHD, and to define premotor cortex somatotopy. In Experiment 1, TMS will be&#xD;
      used to test the hypothesis that there is deficient inhibition from premotor to motor cortex&#xD;
      in patients with FHD at rest, during voluntary movement and while maintaining a task-specific&#xD;
      position. In Experiment 2, TMS will be used to identify whether there is a somatotopic&#xD;
      organization relevant to the inhibitory premotor-motor cortex interaction in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. In Experiment 3, to address the role of motor planning dysfunction in the&#xD;
      task-specific nature of FHD, we will use TMS to evaluate the premotor-motor cortex inhibition&#xD;
      during a reaction time task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of Experiment 1 will be change in MEP peak-to-peak amplitude&#xD;
      between patients and healthy volunteers at rest and in two motor conditions. In Experiment 2,&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure will be the location of the TMS coil for optimizing inhibition&#xD;
      from leg premotor cortex to motor cortex compared to the coil location from arm premotor&#xD;
      cortex to motor cortex. Finally, in Experiment 3, the primary outcome measure will be the&#xD;
      change in reaction time from baseline to the test condition with transient TMS-induced&#xD;
      interruption in premotor cortex function.&#xD;
