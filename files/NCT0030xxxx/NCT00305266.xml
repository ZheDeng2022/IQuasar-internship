      The aim of this study is to quantify the effect of IVIG treatment in a group of patients with&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy(CIDP), who requires continues&#xD;
      treatment of IVIG at regular intervals of 3-10 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During continues treatment of IVIG at regular intervals of 3-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During pause in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The disease activity in the patients are cyclical correlating to the treatment&#xD;
           intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pause in treatment will increase disease activity, which can be quantified with symptom&#xD;
           scores, disability scales, and clinical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary effect parameter is muscle strength quantified by isokinetic dynamometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Added to the protocol there is an immunological study of inflammatory markers in blood&#xD;
      samples of patients under treatment pause.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare&#xD;
      autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system characterized by demyelination of the&#xD;
      nerves, which causes muscle weakness and sensory loss. Treatment is immune modulating, and&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is first line therapy.Several trials have demonstrated&#xD;
      effect on motor function by the initial treatment, but the effect of consecutive IVIG&#xD;
      treatment is only sporadic described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a clinical study including present CIDP patients in treatment at the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Aarhus. The patients will be evaluated several times before and after IVIG&#xD;
      treatment, to describe the effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effect parameter is muscle strength quantified by isokinetic dynamometry at ankle&#xD;
      knee, hip, wrist, elbow and shoulder. That is a sensitive method of measuring the strength of&#xD;
      the larger muscle groups, correlating with symptoms and signs of neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of neuropathy among the patients will also be described applying nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies, quantitative sensory testing of threshold for detecting vibration and cold at upper&#xD;
      and lower limbs, the Neuropathy Disability Scale, the Neuropathy Symptom Score,the overall&#xD;
      disability sum score, 9 hole peg test, walking test, and the Short-form 36 health&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Added to the protocol there is an immunological study of inflammatory markers in blood&#xD;
      samples of patients under treatment pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study we will describe some important aspects in the immune response causing the&#xD;
      inflammatory lesions in CIDP and MMN, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment of immune cells to the affected tissue by chemoattraction. (Chemokine&#xD;
           receptors on mononuclear cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Crossing the blood-nerve barrier: interactions and adhesion between the lymphocyte and&#xD;
           endothelial cell, transendothelial diapedesis and enzymatic degeneration of the basal&#xD;
           lamina.(Adhesion molecules on mononuclear cells and soluble in plasma,&#xD;
           metalloproteinases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Synthesis of mRNA and secretion of regulatory cytokines.&#xD;
