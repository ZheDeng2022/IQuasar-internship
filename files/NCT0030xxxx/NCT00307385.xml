      This study will examine whether hand movement in stroke patients can be improved by applying&#xD;
      electrical stimulation to the side of the brain affected by the stroke. It will compare the&#xD;
      effects of similar brain stimulations in stroke patients and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed normal volunteers and stroke patients between 18 and 80 years of age&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Patients' stroke must have occurred at least 3 months before&#xD;
      entering the study and affect one side of the brain only. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, brain MRI, and evaluation of memory and attention span. Pregnant women are&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves seven 2-day sessions over the course of about 8 weeks, with each session&#xD;
      separated by at least 1 week. During each session participants practice a pattern of hand&#xD;
      movements and their accuracy in performing the movements is evaluated before and after brain&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. The movements include a complex finger sequence, a simple finger&#xD;
      sequence, a peg test (placing wooden pegs in holes on a board), a hand function test (turning&#xD;
      over cards, picking up small objects with one hand and placing them in a can, picking up&#xD;
      small objects with a spoon and placing them in a can, stacking checkers, moving light cans,&#xD;
      and moving heavy cans), and a box and block test (picking up and moving blocks from one box&#xD;
      to another).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first day of each 2-day session lasts about 5 hours and includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS measurements: A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is&#xD;
           passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the&#xD;
           stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other&#xD;
           simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg,&#xD;
           and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the&#xD;
           coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tDCS: Small, wet sponge electrodes are applied to the head - one above the eye and the&#xD;
           other on the back of the head. A small electrical current is passed between them. The&#xD;
           subject may feel an itching or tingling sensation under the electrodes or see light&#xD;
           flashes. Some sessions are done with sham tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor learning under tDCS: tDCS is repeated while the subject performs different finger&#xD;
           movements. A new pattern of finger movements is taught each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography: Electrodes are filed with a conductive gel and taped to the&#xD;
           skin over one small hand muscle to measure the electrical activity of muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral measurements: Evaluation of learned movement tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to evaluate the subject's attention, fatigue and mood before and after&#xD;
           testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second day of each session lasts about 2 hours and includes the TMS measurements and&#xD;
      behavior measurements.&#xD;

      Objectives: Recent advances in neuroscience may be helpful in designing more accurate&#xD;
      neurorehabilitative strategies to decrease post-stroke disability. First, recovery is more&#xD;
      extensive when the interhemispheric balance of activity favors the ipsilesional primary motor&#xD;
      (M1Ipsilesional) and premotor (PMIpsilesional) cortices. Second, non-invasive transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) over M1Ipsilesional may help to transiently improve motor&#xD;
      performance in stroke patients. Third, in healthy volunteers, training combined with cortical&#xD;
      stimulation of M1 (which plays a critical role in motor learning) leads to up-regulation of&#xD;
      corticomotor excitability, improved motor learning, and use-dependent plasticity. Since&#xD;
      stroke patients have to re-learn how to control their paretic hand, enhancing their learning&#xD;
      capacity by adequate tuning of M1Ipsilesional with tDCS could promote plastic reorganization&#xD;
      that supports functional improvement. Finally, another factor to be considered is that&#xD;
      functional changes elicited by cortical stimulation depend on the previous activity state&#xD;
      (metaplasticity). Therefore, we hypothesize that implementing metaplastic changes will&#xD;
      enhance motor learning gains induced by tDCS in chronic stroke patients to a larger extent&#xD;
      than a control intervention in both stroke patients and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 20 healthy subjects for safety issues and parameter optimization; 31&#xD;
      patients with a single cortical or sub-cortical stroke; and 31 matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: To test our hypothesis, we will precondition M1Ipsilesional with cathodal tDCS (which&#xD;
      transiently down-regulates activity in this site) and then apply anodal tDCS to&#xD;
      M1Ipsilesional during a motor sequence learning with the paretic hand. After a&#xD;
      familiarization session, real and sham tDCS will be applied in 6 randomized sessions in a&#xD;
      crossover design. Learning will be evaluated one day after each tDCS/sham session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the number of learned sequences correctly played on a&#xD;
      keyboard in a 30-second period. TMS will be used 1) to interfere with the activity of&#xD;
      different cortical motor areas as a marker of their respective contribution to paretic hand&#xD;
      control before and after the metaplasticity intervention and 2) to measure corticomotor&#xD;
      excitability changes associated with the interventions. This will provide descriptive&#xD;
      information on the neural substrates underlying behavioral gains, important for&#xD;
      hypothesis-generation and power analysis in future investigations.&#xD;
