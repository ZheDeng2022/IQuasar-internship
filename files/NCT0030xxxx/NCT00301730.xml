      RATIONALE: Biological therapy, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well cellular adoptive immunotherapy works in&#xD;
      treating a patient who has undergone a donor stem cell transplant for breast cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to the lung.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the antitumor response in a patient with persistent metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
           after prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) treated with&#xD;
           tumor-derived, ex vivo expanded and costimulated T-lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the immune function of tumor-derived T-lymphocytes and the biology of residual&#xD;
           tumor cells present after allogeneic hematopoietic SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient undergoes surgical resection of the accessible lesions from which T cells are&#xD;
      isolated, costimulated, and expanded ex vivo to produce the tumor-derived T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      (TDTL). Beginning at least 2 weeks after surgery, the patient receives TDTL IV every 4 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 5 doses in the presence of disease progression (DP) AND in the absence of ≥ grade 2&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease. The patient is assessed 4 weeks after every dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of stable disease, partial response, or complete response, the patient is followed&#xD;
      without intervention until DP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of DP after dose 1 or 2 of the TDTL, the patient receives dose 2 or 3 of the TDTL. In&#xD;
      case of DP after dose 3 of the TDTL, the patient receives low-dose interleukin-2&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) daily for 3 days and dose 4 of the TDTL. In case of DP after dose 4 of&#xD;
      the TDTL, the patient receives 1 course of chemoimmunotherapy for cytoreduction and&#xD;
      immunomodulation comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours once and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks (the patient may receive gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, vinorelbine ditartrate, docetaxel, or capecitabine in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab [Herceptin®] as chemoimmunotherapy at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator); interleukin-2 SC daily for 3 days; and dose 5 of the TDTL. In case of DP after&#xD;
      dose 5 of the TDTL, the patient may receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or FDA-approved&#xD;
      biologic therapy and/or immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusions from the same donor&#xD;
      used for the prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may undergo core biopsy of the left mediastinal nodule in case of tumor&#xD;
      regression of the indexing lesion at anytime OR after receiving dose 5 of the TDTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, the patient is followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: One patient will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
