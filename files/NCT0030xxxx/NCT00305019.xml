&#xD;
             Evidence of HBsAg (+) for the previous 6 months may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  documentation of HBsAg (+) for the previous 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  documentation of HBsAg (+) for the previous 3 months and IgM anti-HBc negative at&#xD;
                  screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IgM anti-HBc negative and IgG anti-HBc positive at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient who has ALT levels which are in the range of more than 2 to less than 10 times&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal (x ULN) and bilirubin levels &lt; 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patient with a negative serum (HCG) pregnancy test taken within 14 days of&#xD;
             starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient who is able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to&#xD;
             comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who continue to meet the following criteria after completion of the Week 36&#xD;
             visit will have additional follow-up visits at Week 40, 44, 48:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  have received no additional therapy since completion of 12 weeks of treatment of&#xD;
                  L-FMAU and&#xD;

             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients previously treated with lamivudine, lobucavir, adefovir or any other&#xD;
             investigational nucleoside for HBV infection.&#xD;

          3. Patients with previous treatment with interferon that have ended less than 6 months&#xD;
             prior to the screening visit.&#xD;

             tubal ligation), post-menopausal or using at least a medically acceptable barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception (i.e., intrauterine device [IUD], barrier methods with&#xD;
             spermicide or abstinence)&#xD;

             bronchopulmonary, neurological, cardiovascular, oncologic or allergic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient who has creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min as estimated by the following&#xD;
             formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (140-age in years) (body weight [kg])/ (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) [Note: multiply&#xD;
        estimates by 0.85 for women]&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients found to have tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, aspartate (YMDD) HBV DNA polymerase&#xD;
        mutation after the enrollment will be excluded from the efficacy evaluation but included in&#xD;
        the safety evaluation.&#xD;
