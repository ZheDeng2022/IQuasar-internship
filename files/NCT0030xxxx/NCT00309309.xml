      Abnormalities in glucidic and lipidic metabolism are common features in renal transplant&#xD;
      patients on chronic immunossupression with steroids and calcineurin inhibitors. In kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients with chronic rejection these abnormalities cluster with renal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and altogether may sustain premature graft loss and may increase&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thiozolidinediones are a new class of&#xD;
      oral antidiabetic agents that may increase insulin sensitivity improving the glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and dyslipidemia. Moreover, rosiglitazone -one of these drugs- has been reported to&#xD;
      decrease blood pressure and albuminuria in subjects with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.&#xD;
      Recent finding that glitazones ameliorate the glucidic and lipidic profile induced by steroid&#xD;
      treatment in healthy subjects, provided a further rationale to evaluate the metabolic and&#xD;
      renal effects of glitazones in renal transplant patients on chronic steroid therapy. Thus, we&#xD;
      designed and organized a pilot study to assess the short-term risk/benefit profile of&#xD;
      rosiglitazone in renal transplant patients with chronic rejection. Ten patients will have a&#xD;
      basal evaluation of insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance,lipid profile, renal hemodynamic&#xD;
      and albuminuria. These evaluations will be repeated at the end of the treatment (4 months of&#xD;
      therapy with rosiglitazone 8 mg/day) period and 2 months after treatment withdrawal.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Decreased insulin sensitivity, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia are&#xD;
      common features in renal transplant patients on chronic immunosuppression with steroids and&#xD;
      calcineurine inhibitors. In renal transplant patients with chronic allograft dysfunction&#xD;
      these metabolic abnormalities typically cluster with well-established renal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk-factors such as hypertension and albuminuria. Altogether these factors&#xD;
      may sustain and accelerate the progression of chronic allograft dysfunction to end stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD) and increase the risk of premature cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) are a new class of oral antidiabetic agents that may increase&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity through activation of the peroxisome prolipherator-activated receptor&#xD;
      gamma (PPARgamma). By ameliorating insulin sensitivity, these drugs may also improve glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and dyslipidemia. These properties have led to their current utility as&#xD;
      antidiabetic drugs. Moreover, finding that one of these drugs - rosiglitazone - has been&#xD;
      reported to decrease arterial blood pressure and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and nephropathy, has been taken to suggest that glitazones may also have a specific reno- and&#xD;
      cardio-protective effect. This effect could specifically apply to renal transplant patients&#xD;
      with chronic allograft dysfunction in whom glitazones, in addition to ameliorate insulin&#xD;
      resistance, glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia, might help controlling arterial hypertension&#xD;
      and reducing albuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent finding that glitazones ameliorate the insulin resistant status induced by steroid&#xD;
      treatment in healthy subjects, provides a further rationale to evaluate the metabolic and&#xD;
      renal effects of glitazones in renal transplant patients on chronic steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To evaluate the short-term risk/benefit profile of rosiglitazone treatment in renal&#xD;
      transplant patients with chronic allograft dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN After a basal evaluation of systolic/diastolic blood pressure,body weight, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity (by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), glucose tolerance (by standard glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test), lipid profile, renal hemodynamics (GFR and RPF by inulin and PAH renal&#xD;
      clearances, respectively), albuminuria (mean of three consecutive overnight urine&#xD;
      collections), albumin, IgG, Na+ and free water fractional clearances and other routine&#xD;
      laboratory analyses, patients satisfying the selection criteria will enter 4-month therapy&#xD;
      with rosiglitazone 4 mg/day, up-titrated, if well-tolerated, to 8 mg/day 4 weeks later.&#xD;
      Baseline evaluations will be repeated at the end of the treatment period and 2 months after&#xD;
      treatment withdrawal. Blood pressure, body weight and routine laboratory tests - including&#xD;
      liver function tests - will be evaluated also at 1 and 2 weeks of rosiglitazone therapy, at&#xD;
      month 1 and then every month up to study end. Albuminuria will also be evaluated at month 2&#xD;
      of rosiglitazone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No major change in diet and immunosuppressive, antihypertensive and other concomitant&#xD;
      treatments will be introduced throughout the whole study period. A low salt (2 grams of Na+&#xD;
      per day) and a controlled dietary protein intake (0.8 g/kg/body weight per day) will be&#xD;
      recommended to all patients. Should any evidence of clinically relevant water retention or of&#xD;
      liver toxicity occur throughout the treatment period, rosiglitazone will be back-titrated to&#xD;
      the initial dose or withdrawn as deemed clinically appropriate.&#xD;
