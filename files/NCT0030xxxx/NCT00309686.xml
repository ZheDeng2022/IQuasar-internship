  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety over a 6-week period of&#xD;
      paliperidone ER compared with placebo in treating subjects with Bipolar I Disorder who are&#xD;
      experiencing a manic or mixed episode while they are taking lithium or valproate. This study&#xD;
      will also evaluate the effect of paliperidone ER compared with placebo on overall&#xD;
      functioning, on how quickly a response is seen, on improvement in severity of illness, on&#xD;
      health-related functional status, on depressive symptoms, and on psychotic symptoms. The&#xD;
      relationship between blood levels and the effectiveness and safety of paliperidone ER will be&#xD;
      evaluated, including the effect of food relative to time of taking the drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several treatments are available for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes&#xD;
      associated with bipolar disorder. Some of these treatments, including lithium, divalproex&#xD;
      sodium, and carbamazepine, have been used for many years. More recently, risperidone and a&#xD;
      number of atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole) have&#xD;
      been approved for use in the treatment of acute mania. Paliperidone has similar properties to&#xD;
      risperidone and is thus expected to have at least similar efficacy to risperidone in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Paliperidone ER&#xD;
      has been shown to be effective in treating schizophrenia, and has an improved delivery system&#xD;
      (with delivery at a relatively controlled rate over 24 hours) and a reduced potential for&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions. Treatment of bipolar mania often involves more than a single&#xD;
      medication. Studies of mood stabilizers in combination with antipsychotic agents have&#xD;
      suggested greater efficacy or more rapid onset of action with these combinations than with&#xD;
      any of these agents alone. It is therefore of interest to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      paliperidone ER in combination with mood stabilizers for the treatment of acute manic and&#xD;
      mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized (patients are randomly assigned to receive paliperidone ER or placebo),&#xD;
      double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo and what&#xD;
      dosage is being taken), placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study will evaluate&#xD;
      paliperidone ER compared with placebo over a 6-week period in patients with Bipolar I&#xD;
      Disorder who are experiencing an acute manic or mixed episode and are taking lithium or&#xD;
      valproate. A flexible dosing regimen will be used in this study to afford investigators the&#xD;
      ability to adjust the dosage of each subject to achieve rapid control of acute manic&#xD;
      symptoms. After a screening/washout phase of no more than 7 days to determine if patients are&#xD;
      eligible and to discontinue all medications excluded per protocol criteria(including any&#xD;
      mood-stabilizing medications other than lithium or valproate), patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either paliperidone ER or placebo for a 6-week, double-blind treatment phase.&#xD;
      Patients will be hospitalized for at least the first 7 days, and will be discharged and&#xD;
      followed as outpatients only if they are considered to be at no significant risk of violent&#xD;
      or suicidal behavior. An end-of-study visit will be conducted at the end of the double-blind&#xD;
      treatment phase or at early withdrawal, whichever comes first. A follow-up (post-treatment)&#xD;
      visit for safety evaluations will be scheduled approximately 1 week after the&#xD;
      end-of-study/early withdrawal visit. The study, including the screening/washout phase, will&#xD;
      last up to 56 days (8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness will primarily be determined by the change from baseline in the Young Mania&#xD;
      Rating Scale (YMRS) score to the end of the 6-week double-blind treatment phase or early&#xD;
      withdrawal. The YMRS is an established 11-item scale used to evaluate manic symptoms. A&#xD;
      secondary measure of effectiveness will be the change from baseline in the Global Assessment&#xD;
      of Functioning (GAF) score to the end of the 6 weeks of treatment. Additional measures of&#xD;
      effectiveness will measure severity of bipolar illness, psychotic symptoms, quality of sleep,&#xD;
      and health-related functional status. Safety will be measured by monitoring the frequency,&#xD;
      severity, and timing of side effects; monitoring the need for additional medications;&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests (including pregnancy tests), 12-lead electrocardiograms;&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature); and physical examination&#xD;
      (including height, weight, and waist circumference). Three scales will be used to assess&#xD;
      specific neurologic side effects; the Scale for Suicidal Ideation will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      any suicidal tendencies. The primary study hypothesis is that, in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      who experience an acute manic or mixed episode while they are taking lithium or valproate for&#xD;
      the treatment of Bipolar I Disorder, paliperidone ER is superior to placebo on the change&#xD;
      from baseline in the YMRS total score at the end of 6 weeks of double-blind treatment. The&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis is that, in these same patients, paliperidone ER is superior to placebo&#xD;
      on the change from baseline in GAF score at the end of 6 weeks of double-blind treatment.&#xD;
      Flexibly dosed oral paliperidone ER (3 to 12 mg/day) or matching placebo once daily. All&#xD;
      study drug will be administered before 10:00 a.m. Initial dosage will be 6 mg/day; adjustment&#xD;
      of the dosage will be based on assessment of the patient's response to and tolerance of the&#xD;
      study drug. Dosage may be increased in 3-mg/day increments or decreased as deemed necessary;&#xD;
      dosage should only be increased every 2 days unless a patient requires a higher dosage to&#xD;
      control manic symptoms.&#xD;
