      This study will examine those who will seek and those who are most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      genetic counseling for psychiatric disorders. It will identify themes related to perceived&#xD;
      risks, benefits, and possible motivations for seeking genetic counseling among families&#xD;
      affected by bipolar disorder. It will then use those themes to generate a starting point for&#xD;
      a framework to guide further research and to improve genetics services as they are currently&#xD;
      practiced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with bipolar disorder and the adult siblings of people with bipolar disorder are&#xD;
      eligible for this study. In a 60- to 90-minute telephone interview, participants are asked&#xD;
      questions related to their thoughts about the causes of bipolar disorder, their experiences&#xD;
      with the illness, their concerns about the disorder occurring again in their families, and&#xD;
      their feelings about the value of discussing these issues with health care professionals.&#xD;
      They also are asked questions about the mental health of their close family members and their&#xD;
      own mental health.&#xD;

      This study aims to examine through the use of qualitative telephone interviews who will seek,&#xD;
      and who is most likely to benefit from, genetic counseling for psychiatric disorders. The&#xD;
      specific aims are to identify themes related to perceived risks, benefits, and possible&#xD;
      motivations for seeking genetic counseling among families affected by bipolar disorder; to&#xD;
      use those themes to generate a starting point for a conceptual framework to guide further&#xD;
      research; and to use those themes to improve clinical genetics services currently in&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the few available studies on genetics and bipolar disorder evaluate interest in&#xD;
      genetic services in the absence of genetic testing (e.g., family-history-based risk&#xD;
      assessment, education about etiology, psychological support) even though those elements will&#xD;
      continue to be relevant even if genetic testing becomes available. Only one study asked any&#xD;
      questions about psychiatric genetic counseling in the absence of testing-a study on&#xD;
      schizophrenia in which one such question was posed. In most of the available literature, the&#xD;
      focus is on highly predictive testing scenarios that are not relevant in current practice,&#xD;
      and may never be relevant. In addition, most studies test the researchers' preconceived&#xD;
      notions of risks and benefits, without allowing participant input. More research will&#xD;
      facilitate the integration of genetic counseling for psychiatric disorders into the genetics&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study using telephone interviews that will be taped and transcribed. We&#xD;
      plan to interview 15 to 25 adults affected with bipolar disorder and 15 to 25 unaffected&#xD;
      adult siblings. We will use a semi-structured interview guide that will allow the integration&#xD;
      of new elements and the modification of existing elements. We will use data reduction and&#xD;
      coding to synthesize the most important themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will result in themes that can be tested in a larger, more representative sample,&#xD;
      allowing us to test hypotheses about interest in psychiatric genetic counseling. This study&#xD;
      also will provide preliminary data about anticipating, through the use of realistic&#xD;
      scenarios, the point at which individuals are more likely to embrace psychiatric genetic&#xD;
      counseling; and beginning to understand, in a broader perspective, what may increase or&#xD;
      decrease interest in genetic counseling and risk assessment based on family history for&#xD;
      complex disorders. More immediately, this study will provide a description of the experience&#xD;
      of living with risk in the family that should be of interest to genetics professionals.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals over 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (per their&#xD;
        own report; no screening will be performed), and/or the adult siblings of affected&#xD;
        individuals. Participants do not have to be sibling pairs, i.e., an affected individual may&#xD;
        be included without the participation of their unaffected sibling, and visa versa.&#xD;
        Participants must be able to speak English fluently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those under 18 years of age will not be included. First-degree relatives other than full&#xD;
        siblings will not be included. If a participant is symptomatic to the point that the&#xD;
        interview is compromised, as determined by the PI who has considerable experience&#xD;
        counseling affected individuals, the PI will end the interview and any data collected will&#xD;
        be destroyed. If possible, the interview will be rescheduled. We will encourage symptomatic&#xD;
        individuals to seek care from their mental health provider, or we will make a referral if&#xD;
        the individual does not have a provider.&#xD;
