      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa)&#xD;
      administered by injection subcutaneously (SC, under the skin), at a dose of 80,000 U once&#xD;
      every four weeks or 40,000 U once every two in anemic patients with cancer not receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epoetin alfa is an analogue (has the identical amino acid sequence) of erythropoetin, a&#xD;
      hormone secreted by kidneys known to stimulate red blood cell production. Although epoetin&#xD;
      alfa has been known to be effective in treatment of anemia associated with cancer&#xD;
      chemotherapy, there are no specific formal guidelines on the use of epoetin alfa for the&#xD;
      treatment of anemia in cancer patients not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Several prospective clinical trials investigating the efficacy of epoetin alfa in&#xD;
      cancer-associated anemia included groups of patients not receiving chemotherapy where it was&#xD;
      demonstrated that the use of epoetin alfa in this population was safe and effective in&#xD;
      increasing hemoglobin (Hb) levels and reducing transfusion requirements. The optimal dosing&#xD;
      regimen of epoetin alfa in cancer patients not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;
      remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 17-week study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center study to assess the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of epoetin alfa in anemic patients with cancer not receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Eligible patients with hemoglobin level &lt;= 11 g/dL will&#xD;
      receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U once every 2 weeks for 15 weeks or 80,000 U once every 4 weeks&#xD;
      for 13 weeks. The study hypothesis are that there are no long-term safety concerns of epoetin&#xD;
      alfa administered at these two dosing regimens and that both dosing regimens are equally&#xD;
      effective in this patient population. Eligible patients with hemoglobin levels &lt;= 11 g/dL&#xD;
      will receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U once every 2 weeks for 15 weeks or 80,000 U once every 4&#xD;
      weeks for 13 weeks.&#xD;
