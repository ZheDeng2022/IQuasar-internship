    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and appropriate dose of the combination of&#xD;
      Temodar and Sutent as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic malignant melanoma&#xD;
      (Phase 1). Once the safety and appropriate dose is determined, additional patients will be&#xD;
      studied at that dose to determine if there is clinical benefit as determined by the primary&#xD;
      end-point of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and additional secondary endpoints&#xD;
      (Phase II).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma have a dismal prognosis. The disease responds&#xD;
      poorly to currently available chemotherapies and biological agents. The median survival in&#xD;
      this patient population is 6 - 10 months and has not improved significantly in decades. The&#xD;
      FDA approved DTIC in 1975 and high dose intravenous bolus rIL-2 in 1998 and these are the&#xD;
      only agents approved for therapy of patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Phase III trial reported in 2000, temozolomide (Temodar, Schering-Plough) demonstrated&#xD;
      equivalent overall survival to DTIC in patients with metastatic melanoma, and had the&#xD;
      advantages of providing improved progression-free survival, ease of administration (oral),&#xD;
      and crossing the blood-brain barrier. Temozolomide and DTIC are both precursors of an active&#xD;
      metabolite, monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). SU11248 (Sutent, Pfizer) is a&#xD;
      multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor which targets 3 distinct vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR-1, -2, and -3), platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR-α and -β), KIT receptor tyrosine kinases, and fms-related&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase 3/Flk2 (FLT3). Although other angiogenic factors have been identified, VEGF&#xD;
      is the most potent and specific regulator of angiogenesis and SU11248 targets not just one,&#xD;
      but all 3 VEGF signaling pathways. Dacarbazine (DTIC) causes transcriptional up-regulation of&#xD;
      VEGF in melanoma cells and this has been postulated as a possible mechanism of escape from&#xD;
      chemotherapy efficacy. Temozolomide, which acts through the same metabolite, MTIC, would be&#xD;
      expected to have the same activity. PDGFR-α and -β are important new targets in tumor cell&#xD;
      proliferation and angiogenesis. PDGF signaling pathways have been implicated in the&#xD;
      development and growth of solid tumors. Inhibition of PDGF receptors has been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit angiogenesis, tumor vascular maturation and maintenance, and tumor cell proliferation&#xD;
      - inducing tumor regression. In a murine model, the combination of chemotherapy with VEGF and&#xD;
      PDFG receptor inhibitors resulted in a remarkable survival advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open-label, single arm trial. The patient sample will be approximately 56-62&#xD;
      individuals, males and females 18 years of age or older with measurable metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
      Study participants must meet a number of laboratory criteria in order to be admitted into the&#xD;
      study. The study duration is expected to be approximately 2 years. Patients will be offered&#xD;
      treatment for up to 1 year and are expected to complete a median of 6 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of safety will be conducted after completion of treatment of 6 patients&#xD;
      in each cohort and a determination will be made as to whether or not to continue to the next&#xD;
      cohort according to the specifications in the protocol. If an acceptable dosing regimen is&#xD;
      found, the study will proceed to a Phase II portion. Progression-free survival will be&#xD;
      determined for the 6 month time point when all patients have completed the study. The study&#xD;
      has ≥90% power to detect an increase in the 6-month progression-free survival rate from ≤15%,&#xD;
      the result expected for patients receiving available first-line therapy, to ≥35% for patients&#xD;
      receiving the combination of temozolomide and SU11248, based on a one group chi-square test&#xD;
      with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.&#xD;
