  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with aggressive Non-Hodgkin-lymphoma treated at first diagnosis with chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone or combined chemo-radiotherapy can achieve high response rates. However, patients with&#xD;
      relapsed lymphoma still have a poor prognosis. High dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the treatment of choice for these patients. An&#xD;
      ASCT allows patients to receive much higher doses of chemotherapy than usual, to improve the&#xD;
      chances of curing the disease. The high-dose of chemotherapy destroys the cells in the&#xD;
      patients bone marrow and then the patients own cells from either the bone marrow or&#xD;
      peripheral blood are used to rescue the patient from intensive treatment. High-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy with autologous stem cell (either bone marrow or peripheral blood)&#xD;
      transplantation is used in the treatment of Intermediate/High grade NHL with poor risk&#xD;
      disease and in second remission at the Royal Marsden Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present analysis is to determine independent prognostic factors correlated&#xD;
      with the long-term outcome of patients with NHL who received an ASCT between January 1991 and&#xD;
      June 2005. Accrual of eligible patients currently under follow-up will be performed in clinic&#xD;
      at the time of next appointment. All patients accrued will give informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study for retrospective case note review, after discussion with a study&#xD;
      investigator and after receiving a study information sheet. The results of the analysis will&#xD;
      be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. This will include patients treated at the&#xD;
      royal Marsden Hospital only.&#xD;
