  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AuriNovo provides a patient-specific, biological construct for use in the surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction of the external ear in people born with microtia Grades II-IV. This Phase 1 /&#xD;
      2A study is being conducted to collect preliminary safety data on microtic ear reconstruction&#xD;
      using AuriNovo, fine-tune technical, logistical, surgical, and post-surgical care aspects&#xD;
      related to implantation, and to gather preliminary efficacy data including short- and&#xD;
      longer-term in vivo duration and biological status of the implant.&#xD;

    <description>AuriNovo is a patient-specific, biologically natural, supportive base for surgical reconstruction of the external ear (auricle) in people born with microtia Grades II-IV. The construct is a 3D-bioprinted collagen hydrogel scaffold encapsulating the patient's own auricular cartilage cells (chondrocytes). The construct is printed in a size and shape that matches the contralateral ear for implantation into the patient.</description>

&#xD;
          3. No previous surgical procedure for auricular reconstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have undergone an audiological assessment prior to enrollment and surgeon confirmation&#xD;
             that study participation will not preclude future hearing correction options&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal or near normal hairline position&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to adhere to the follow-up schedule and post-surgery care instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability for the subject and/or guardian to understand and give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Healthy subjects with no history of cancer, problematic wound healing, or immune&#xD;
             disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous cochlear implant surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with prior surgery in the temporal, parietal, or mastoid regions of the&#xD;
             affected side that resulted in scarring that may affect the outcome of microtia&#xD;
             reconstruction surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Sensitivity to broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotics containing any of the&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Patients requiring chronic use of any headgear (e.g., CPAP) that would interfere with&#xD;
             the ability to wear post-operative ear protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pregnant females (a negative pregnancy test is required for females with reproductive&#xD;
             potential)&#xD;
&#xD;

             initial assessments of efficacy of AuriNovo. The following syndromes or conditions are&#xD;
             additional exclusion factors:&#xD;

             greater&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Absence of vertical ramus (as diagnosed on physical exam or CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
