  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether potentiating the cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with QBW251 in patients with bronchiectasis will&#xD;
      demonstrate clinical safety and efficacy related to improved mucociliary clearance with&#xD;
      reduced bacterial colonization as potential drivers of airway obstruction, reduced airway&#xD;
      inflammation, exacerbations and mucus load, improved lung function, clinical symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life to support further development in bronchiectasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, subject- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study investigating the preliminary efficacy and safety of QBW251 administered orally for 12&#xD;
      weeks in subjects with bronchiectasis. Approximately 72 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either QBW251 or placebo in order to achieve 60 subjects who complete the&#xD;
      treatment period based on the assumption of a 16% drop-out rate. The sample size assumptions&#xD;
      will be reviewed in an interim analysis in a blinded manner when approximately 14 subjects&#xD;
      complete the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of the following periods: Screening, baseline/Day 1, treatment period, and&#xD;
      end of study assessments (EOS) visit followed by an additional post-treatment safety follow&#xD;
      up via phone call. The total duration for each patient in the study is up to approximately 18&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The Quality of Life Questionnaire for Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) is a disease-specific questionnaire developed for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. It covers 8 dimensions: physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, vitality, treatment burden, health perceptions, and respiratory symptoms. Each dimension is scored separately on a scale of 0 to 100, and higher scores represent better outcomes. Only the respiratory symptoms domain score is reported for this outcome measure.</description>
