    <textblock>
      Moroctocog-alfa (AF-CC) is indicated for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes&#xD;
      and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor&#xD;
      VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia). The current single country, multi-centric, open&#xD;
      label, non-randomized pragmatic clinical trial is a post-approval study to fulfill the&#xD;
      Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) request for supplementary information&#xD;
      relating to the use of moroctocog-alfa (AF-CC) in Indian subjects with hemophilia A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of study is to study the safety of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) when&#xD;
      administered for prophylaxis with respect to incidence of FVIII inhibitor development. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to evaluate the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs) in subjects receiving moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis, to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during a prophylaxis regimen, to evaluate the total&#xD;
      annualized consumption of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) by subjects following a prophylaxis&#xD;
      regimen, to evaluate the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) for the treatment of&#xD;
      breakthrough bleeding episodes (on-demand treatment) while following a prophylaxis regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty male subjects aged &gt;/= 12 years to ≤65 years with moderate or severe hemophilia A will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. The subjects will be selected based on protocol specified&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The overall treatment duration for each subject will be up to 8 weeks,&#xD;
      with up to a 4-week screening period and a subsequent post-treatment 28-day safety&#xD;
      observation period. Subjects are requested to continue in the study until 24 exposure days&#xD;
      (EDs) or a period of up to 8 weeks on moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) treatment had occurred&#xD;
      (whichever occurs first). Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed as specified in&#xD;

      Moroctocog-alfa (AF-CC) is indicated in India for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital&#xD;
      factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia). The current protocol outlines a post-approval&#xD;
      study to fulfill the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) written request for&#xD;
      supplementary information relating to the use of moroctocog-alfa (AF-CC) in Indian subjects&#xD;
      with hemophilia A. The additional information will include safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      moroctocog-alfa (AF-CC) in Indian subjects with a diagnosis of congenital moderate or severe&#xD;
      hemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤5%). The primary objective is to study the safety of moroctocog alfa&#xD;
      (AF-CC) when administered for prophylaxis with respect to incidence of FVIII inhibitor&#xD;
      development. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the incidence of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and serious adverse events (SAEs) in subjects receiving moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis,&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during a prophylaxis regimen, to evaluate&#xD;
      the total annualized consumption of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) by subjects following a&#xD;
      prophylaxis regimen and to evaluate the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) for the treatment&#xD;
      of breakthrough bleeding episodes (on-demand treatment) while following a prophylaxis&#xD;
      regimen. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who develop FVIII inhibitor&#xD;
      (≥0.6 BU/mL), as confirmed by central laboratory testing, during the course of the study. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints include assessment of incidence of AEs, incidence of SAEs, Annualized&#xD;
      bleeding rate (ABR) during prophylaxis, Annualized total factor consumption (TFC) in&#xD;
      international units (IU) and annualized TFC by weight (IU/kg) of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC)&#xD;
      measured during the up to 8 weeks of treatment, by reason for infusion and total units&#xD;
      consumed (across all reasons) and number of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) infusions used to treat&#xD;
      each bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-country, multicenter, open-label, interventional study which will be&#xD;
      conducted in India. At least 50 male subjects aged ≥12 years to ≤65 years with moderate or&#xD;
      severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤5%) who have had at least 50 exposure days (EDs) to&#xD;
      FVIII-containing products will be enrolled in the study. The overall treatment duration for&#xD;
      each subject will be up to 8 weeks, with up to a 4-week screening period and a subsequent&#xD;
      post-treatment 28-day safety observation period. Subjects are requested to continue in the&#xD;
      study until 24 exposure days (EDs) or a period of up to 8 weeks on moroctocog alfa (AF-CC)&#xD;
      treatment had occurred (whichever occurs first). Subjects will be treated with a dose and&#xD;
      regimen of prophylaxis in accordance with the Local Product Development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following subjects will be included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male subjects ≥12 years to ≤65 years with a diagnosis of congenital moderate or severe&#xD;
           hemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Documented history of at least 50 exposure days (EDs) to FVIII-containing products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the&#xD;
           subject (or a legally acceptable representative, parent(s)/legal guardian) has been&#xD;
           informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. For minors under the age of legal&#xD;
           consent in India, assent of the participating child needs to be documented for the age&#xD;
           range 12 to 18 in addition to the parental informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior history of inhibitor to FVIII or positive inhibitor testing (≥0.6 BU/mL) during&#xD;
           Screening. Clinical signs or symptoms of decreased response to FVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of any bleeding disorder in addition to hemophilia A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) (Phases 1-4) within 30&#xD;
           days before the current study begins and/or during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Planned surgery within 6 months from the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Unsuitable to participate in study for any other reason as assessed by the investigator;&#xD;
           including any disorder, except for conditions associated with hemophilia A, which in the&#xD;
           investigator's opinion might jeopardize subject's safety or compliance with the&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) is not able to understand study&#xD;
           documents and study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Immunocompromised subjects due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (defined&#xD;
           as viral load above or equal to 100,000 copies/mL; and for HIV+ subjects: cluster of&#xD;
           differentiation 4 positive (CD4+) lymphocyte count below or equal to 200/μL). HIV status&#xD;
           and CD4+ lymphocyte count results may be obtained at screening or from available medical&#xD;
           records; results must be not older than 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
           the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the&#xD;
           Investigator, subjects who have been previously enrolled into the study, or subjects who&#xD;
           are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Planned use of any non-study medication for treatment of hemophilia (eg, other factor&#xD;
           replacement agents, bypassing agents, or non-factor treatments [such as anti-tissue&#xD;
           factor pathway inhibitors]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will assign subject identification numbers sequentially to the subjects as&#xD;
      they are screened for the study. This identification number will be retained throughout the&#xD;
      study. Pfizer will provide the investigators with a sufficient amount of moroctocog alfa&#xD;
      (AF-CC). Once moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is dispensed to a subject it must not be re-dispensed&#xD;
      to another subject. The product should be prepared, reconstituted, and used in accordance&#xD;
      with procedures provided by their physicians. Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) will be administered by&#xD;
      the investigator or a delegate at Visits 2 and 3. For administration between study visits,&#xD;
      the product will be administered in accordance with procedures provided by their physicians.&#xD;
      Subjects or caregivers/parents of subjects will be trained on how to administer moroctocog&#xD;
      alfa (AF-CC) away from the study site, as applicable. Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) should be&#xD;
      administered prophylactically in previously treated patients at a dose of 30±5 IU/kg given 3&#xD;
      times weekly. For on-demand treatment, the amount to be administered and the frequency of&#xD;
      administration should always be tailored to the clinical effectiveness in individual&#xD;
      subjects. In the interest of simplifying dosing and minimizing potential waste, a dosing&#xD;
      variance of ±5 IU/kg is permitted throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, study coordinator, will ensure that all&#xD;
      investigational products, including any comparative agents and/or marketed products are&#xD;
      stored in a secured area with controlled access under recommended storage conditions and in&#xD;
      accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) should be stored&#xD;
      in its original container and in accordance with the storage conditions stated on the label.&#xD;
      The reconstituted solution of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) may be stored at room temperature prior&#xD;
      to infusion. The reconstituted solution of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) does not contain&#xD;
      preservative and should be infused within 3 hours after reconstitution. The investigator's&#xD;
      site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition&#xD;
      of the drug supplies. When investigational product is taken home by the subject, any unused&#xD;
      products must be returned to the investigator by the subject at Visit 4. All used and unused&#xD;
      vials of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) and unused diluent syringes will be used for investigational&#xD;
      product accountability. Administration of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) by subjects or their&#xD;
      caregivers away from the study site should be captured in the Subject Infusion Log. The&#xD;
      monitor will review drug accountability during routine monitoring visits. Drug accountability&#xD;
      will be done at all study visits after Day 1 until Visit 4. Any discrepancies must be&#xD;
      investigated and their resolution documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of permitted concomitant medication must be in accordance with the study drug label.&#xD;
      The use of concomitant treatments will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will include screening visit( Visit 1- within 28 Days prior to Day 1), Visit 2&#xD;
      (Day 1), Visit 3 (Day 24-32), Visit 4(Day 52-60) and End of Study Visit (Day 80-88 or&#xD;
      earlier) Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may&#xD;
      be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator. Any subject who uses&#xD;
      non-study medication for the treatment of hemophilia (eg, other factor replacement agents,&#xD;
      bypassing agents, or non-factor treatments [such as anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitors])&#xD;
      will be considered to have a protocol violation and will be withdrawn from the study. The&#xD;
      exception to this would be for subjects who require non-study treatment for a bleed away from&#xD;
      the study site. This would be considered a protocol deviation rather than a protocol&#xD;
      violation that would not require withdrawal from the study. Subjects will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study if their central laboratory result for inhibitor assessment at screening does not&#xD;
      confirm eligibility per the local laboratory result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety assessments throughout the study will include collection of AEs, laboratory safety&#xD;
      testing, vital signs, and physical examination at the time points specified in protocol, but&#xD;
      can be conducted at other time points at the investigator's discretion. All observed or&#xD;
      volunteered AEs regardless of suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s)&#xD;
      will be reported as described in the protocol. The efficacy assessments include Total Factor&#xD;
      VIII Consumption and bleeds including, Annualized Bleeding Rate During Prophylaxis, Number of&#xD;
      Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) Infusions Used to Treat Each Bleed, Annualized Total Factor&#xD;
      Consumption of Moroctocog Alfa (AF-CC). All data will be collected in the case report form.&#xD;
