  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the emergence of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) it is&#xD;
      crucial to improve patient's management. Therefore, assessing the place of innovative&#xD;
      strategies enabling the diagnosis of those cases (e.g. WGS and Deeplex-MycTB) in the&#xD;
      personalized care of patients with MDR-TB and the rationalization of medical biology&#xD;
      procedures is a major issue. This project participates to these goals since the investigators&#xD;
      will : (i) assess the diagnostic qualities and the performance of the different innovatives&#xD;
      strategies enabling detection of resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs, (ii) assess the&#xD;
      impact of these strategies in the implementation of personalized treatments for MDR-TB&#xD;
      patients, and (iii) assess the overall costs of these strategies.&#xD;

      Non-interventional monocentric study on the evaluation of the reliability and validity of a&#xD;
      diagnostic test based on a biological collection of M. tuberculosis MDR strains received at&#xD;
      the NRC-MyRMA. The study will apply to all strains and samples of multidrug-resistant M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis detected in France. These strains are all sent to NRC-MyRMA (National Reference&#xD;
      Center for Mycobacteria and resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs) for Drug Susceptibility&#xD;
      testing (DST) to first and second line anti-tuberculosis drugs in accordance with the&#xD;
      national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a genotypic and phenotypic diagnosis of antibiotic resistance is carried out upon&#xD;
      receipt of a strain of M. tuberculosis MDR at CNR-MyRMA, respectively by PCR-sequence&#xD;
      techniques and commercial kits and by phenotypic antibiogram by the method of reference&#xD;
      called proportions. In the case of a sample, only the genotypic diagnosis is immediately&#xD;
      feasible, the realization of the phenotypic diagnosis can only be carried out from a strain,&#xD;
      so the investigators must wait for a positive culture to be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this current strategy, two innovative strategies based on the sequencing of&#xD;
      the complete genome of the strains (WGS and Deeplex-MycTB) will be implemented. These&#xD;
      analyzes will not require an additional patient's samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivities and specificities and the area under the ROC curve of the different tests,&#xD;
      with respect to each resistance, will be calculated and their confidence interval will be&#xD;
      estimated by bootstrap. The comparison of the sensitivities, specificities and areas under&#xD;
      the curve between the different techniques will be carried out by a Gaussian test based on a&#xD;
      bootstrap. The agreement between the different tests will be measured by calculating a Cohen&#xD;
      kappa. A Kappa confidence interval will be estimated by bootstrap. The Kappa between each&#xD;
      genotypic method and the phenotypic method will be compared by a Gaussian test based on a&#xD;
      bootstrap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison of the results reporting times will be done by a comparison test of the&#xD;
      symmetry of the rows with respect to the median value (Mann Whithney Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the quantitative variables will be described by the classic position measurements&#xD;
      (mean, median, 1st and 3rd quartile, minimum and maximum) and dispersion measures (standard&#xD;
      deviation). Qualitative variables will be described in terms of absolute value and&#xD;
      percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of statistical significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance level for the tests will be set for an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Software:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyzes will be done at the URC on SAS software or R software in their latest version&#xD;
      available at the time they are performed.&#xD;
