    <textblock>
      This perspective, mono institutional study is addressed to find potential serum and urine&#xD;
      biomarkers predictive of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas patients treated with trabectedin.&#xD;

      This investigation enrolled patients with unresectable and/or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      not responsive to the first-line treatment based on anthracycline/ifosfamide. Patients&#xD;
      underwent trabectedin monotherapy that was administered intravenously at the dose of 1.3&#xD;
      mg/m2 every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single overnight fasting urine and blood samples were collected on day-1 of the first&#xD;
      trabectedin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma pharmacokinetics was performed during cycle 1. Blood samples, drawn from a site&#xD;
      separate from the drug infusion site, were obtained prior to the infusion (basal) at 2, 8, 24&#xD;
      (end of infusion) and 0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 24.0 after the end of the infusion. Plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of trabectedin were measured by liquid chromatography, tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry assay (LC-MS/MS) and the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Clearance, AUC and&#xD;
      T1/2) were calculated from the concentration-time curve using a non-compartmental model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics profiles were explored by LC-MS/MS in predose urine and serum and encompassed a&#xD;
      total of 192: a) 45 amino acid derivatives, virtually involved in a wide set of biochemical&#xD;
      pathways; b) 40 different acylcarnitines, principally involved in the cellular energy&#xD;
      metabolism; c) 15 lysophosphatidylcholine metabolites, 77 phosphatidylcholine derivatives,&#xD;
      and 15 sphingomyelins, involved in fatty acid metabolism and cellular signaling. The&#xD;
      identification of predictive metabolomics biomarkers is performed using univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate statistical analyses.&#xD;
