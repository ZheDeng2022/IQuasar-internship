  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of i-PRF in the healing of through and through&#xD;
      periapical lesion after periradicular surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detailed patient examination will be carried out and those satisfying inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained and patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to two groups. Entire surgical procedure will be carried out by single&#xD;
      operator. After complete elevation of the flap, debridement (periradicular curettage&#xD;
      -enucleation) of the bony lesion will be performed. 3 mm root-tip resection will be performed&#xD;
      and root end cavity will be prepared using an ultrasonic diamond-coated retrotip. Root end&#xD;
      filling will be done with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). In test group The i-PRF will be&#xD;
      produced and incorporated with collagen will be used to fill into the defect. In the control&#xD;
      group, no guided tissue regeneration technique will be used. Flap will be re-positioned and&#xD;
      sutured using nonabsorbable 4-0 silk sutures.Sutures will be removed 4-7 days&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
