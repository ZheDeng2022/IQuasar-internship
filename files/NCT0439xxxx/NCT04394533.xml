      Patients that have a &quot;cervical stitch&quot; (cervical cerclage) require an anaesthetic. The most&#xD;
      common choice is a spinal block. This is an injection in the back that makes the lower half&#xD;
      of the body become temporarily numb and weak. The key aims when choosing which type of&#xD;
      anaesthetic are safety for mother and baby, comfort during and after the procedure as well as&#xD;
      patient convenience and satisfaction. There are two commonly available choices for the drug&#xD;
      used in spinal anaesthesia, bupivacaine and prilocaine. Both have a long history of being&#xD;
      safe and effective. One difference observed in studies of these drugs used for spinal&#xD;
      anaesthetics in other surgeries is that prilocaine is shorter-acting and it, therefore, takes&#xD;
      less time for the return of full strength and sensation of the lower body. This means&#xD;
      patients are able to leave hospital sooner and are less likely to need a urinary catheter.&#xD;
      The investigators want to see if these benefits can apply to patients having a cervical&#xD;
      stitch too, by comparing the recovery of patients having a spinal anaesthetic with one of&#xD;
      these two local anaesthetic medications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cervical incompetence is defined as the inability to sustain a pregnancy to full term. It is&#xD;
      characterized by recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses. Cervical cerclage is a&#xD;
      procedure that is commonly carried out in order to prevent pre-term loss in at-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies. The major challenge of performing this as a day case procedure is achieving&#xD;
      adequate anaesthesia for comfortable performance of the cerclage whilst providing adequate&#xD;
      regression of motor and sensory blocks to allow ambulation and bladder control within an&#xD;
      appropriate timescale. Spinal anaesthesia, or subarachnoid block (SAB), is commonly employed&#xD;
      to facilitate a wide variety of pelvic and lower limb surgeries. In the United Kingdom, the&#xD;
      commonly administered subarachnoid agents are bupivacaine, prilocaine and, until recent&#xD;
      decades, lidocaine. The duration of action of bupivacaine makes it less well suited to day&#xD;
      surgery as it is often difficult to reach discharge criteria within a convenient time frame.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to examine the recovery profiles of two equipotent doses of hyperbaric&#xD;
      prilocaine and bupivacaine. Given the evidence, the survey of practice in other centres and&#xD;
      the commonly used doses at this institution the following regimens will be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  40 mg of hyperbaric 2% prilocaine with 15 mcg of fentanyl (intervention) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 mg of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine with 15 mcg of fentanyl (comparator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine if a difference exists between the time required for regression&#xD;
      of motor block between two commonly used and equipotent doses of subarachnoid hyperbaric&#xD;
      prilocaine and bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The hypothesis is that SAB with hyperbaric 2% prilocaine will result in a clinically&#xD;
           significant reduction in time taken for regression of motor blockade, as determined by&#xD;
           achieving a Bromage score* of I, when compared to an equipotent dose of hyperbaric&#xD;
           bupivacaine when used to facilitate cervical cerclage in pregnant women in the second&#xD;
           trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The null hypothesis is that no clinically significant difference exists while the&#xD;
           alternative hypothesis is that such a difference truly exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the intraoperative characteristics of the subarachnoid block and quality of&#xD;
           intraoperative anaesthesia in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the recovery profiles in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of complications in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the satisfaction of the participants in each group This is a prospective,&#xD;
           single centre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, controlled, superiority trial.&#xD;
           The sample size will consist of 135 patients having elective cervical cerclage, under&#xD;
           SAB, due to cervical incompetence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation The primary outcome measurement is the comparison of the difference&#xD;
      in time taken for regression of lower limb motor block with hyperbaric (heavy) 2% prilocaine&#xD;
      compared to hyperbaric (heavy) 0.5% bupivacaine. Assuming, based on pilot data, that the time&#xD;
      to regression of motor block has a standard deviation of up to 60 mins; complete data on 128&#xD;
      participants (64 to each arm) would give 80% power to detect a plausible and clinically&#xD;
      important 30-min difference between groups at the 0.05 significance level. To allow for up to&#xD;
      5% dropout, the study will recruit 135 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation to groups will be achieved using &quot;Castor&quot; randomisation software. The&#xD;
      sequence will have been previously determined, prior to recruitment, using computer software,&#xD;
      by random permuted blocks. Subsequently, the subjects who give written informed consent will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned a unique 3-digit subject number. The subject number together uniquely&#xD;
      identifies every subject eligible for the study. Randomisation will take place on the day of&#xD;
      surgery by a non-operating healthcare professional who will randomise according to the&#xD;
      &quot;Castor&quot; software. If code breaking is necessary, this will be done by pharmacy. As soon as&#xD;
      128 evaluable subjects have been included in the study, recruitment will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis After checking for normality by standard diagnostic plots, a comparison between the&#xD;
      groups will be made using multiple regression with a dummy variable for treatment arm. A&#xD;
      correction will be made for unequal variance using the robust standard errors. Adjustment&#xD;
      will be made for maternal BMI and height, as these are known to be related to anaesthetic&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No power calculation has been carried out for the secondary outcomes, and no priority is made&#xD;
      between them. Continuous measures, including the patient satisfaction score, will be analysed&#xD;
      as described above for the primary outcome. Binary measures will be expressed as percentages,&#xD;
      and compared by means of risk ratios, using binary regression with a log link, adjusted for&#xD;
      BMI and height, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses: A comparison will be made between normal weight and obese women (BMI over&#xD;
      30 kg.m-2); and between women above and below 165 cm in height, using an interaction test to&#xD;
      check for a difference in treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned.&#xD;
