  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II, single arm, open label multicenter trial designed to investigate&#xD;
      the use of haploidentical donor derived NK cells (K-NK002) for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are undergoing&#xD;
      haploidentical donor bone marrow transplantation (HaploBMT). K-NK002 is a NK cell product&#xD;
      derived from peripheral blood leukocytes collected from a related donor (HLA-haploidentical&#xD;
      matched) and enriched for NK cells with depletion of CD3+ T-lymphocytes (T-cells) followed by&#xD;
      enriched ex-vivo expansion and administered to the patient prior to and following BMT.&#xD;

      The study is a Phase II, single arm, open label, multicenter trial evaluating the cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of relapse when K-NK002 is used for relapse mitigation in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      AML and MDS receiving an allogeneic haploidentical bone marrow graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part One (Safety run-in):&#xD;
&#xD;

           cells per kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose cohort 2 will include 3 patients who will receive K-NK002 at 1 x 10E8 NK cells per&#xD;
           kg.&#xD;
