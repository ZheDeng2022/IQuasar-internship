    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized double blind controlled study to evaluate the post-operative&#xD;
      analgesic effect of adductor canal block (ACB) or peri-articular injection (PAIs) compared to&#xD;
      combined adductor canal block and infiltration of the interspace between popliteal artery and&#xD;
      the capsule of posterior knee block ( IPACK) in patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study will be carried out in Tanta University Hospitals in&#xD;
      Anesthesia Department for one year after approval from ethical committee of faculty of&#xD;
      medicine of Tanta university. After approval from institutional ethics committee, an informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken from each patient. All data of the patients will be confidential with&#xD;
      secret codes and private file for each patient, all given data will be used for the current&#xD;
      medical research only. Any unexpected risks encountered during the course of the research&#xD;
      will be cleared to the participants as well as to the Ethical Committee on time. Every&#xD;
      patient will receive an explanation to the purpose of the study and every patient will have a&#xD;
      secret code number to ensure privacy to participants and confidentiality of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with severe osteoarthritis , ASA class I, II and III and scheduled for&#xD;
      elective Total knee arthroplasty will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient who refuse the regional anesthesia technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of allergy to local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local infection at the site of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with bleeding and coagulation disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with Advanced renal, hepatic and cardiac diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preexisting lower extremity neurological abnormality, or neuropathy and difficulties in&#xD;
           comprehending (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping and Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients will be enrolled in this study in each group, Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      classified into three equal groups (20 patients each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by computer generated numbers into:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (I): 20 patients will receive adductor canal block alone. Group (II): 20 Patients will&#xD;
      receive peri-articular injection alone. Group (III): 20 patients will receive adductor canal&#xD;
      block (ACB) and infiltration of the interspace between popliteal artery and the capsule of&#xD;
      posterior knee block (IPACK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment will be done by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History talking, clinical examination, routine laboratory investigations including CBC,&#xD;
      coagulation profile, random blood sugar, liver and renal function tests. During the&#xD;
      pre-anesthetic assessment, all patients will be familiarized with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
      score. On entering the operating room, intravenous line (IV) will be inserted, routine&#xD;
      monitoring of heart rate by ECG, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximetry will be&#xD;
      done. All patients will receive spinal anesthesia with 3 ml 0.5% (15 mg) hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine plus 25 Î¼gm fentanyl at the L3/4 interspaces and the study of regional anesthetic&#xD;
      technique will be performed postoperatively according to each group. All patients will&#xD;
      receive postoperative analgesic regimen which is paracetamol 1gm intravenously every 8 hours&#xD;
      and ketorolac 30mg every12 hours. Rescue analgesia in the form of 0.05 mg/kg of morphine IV&#xD;
      will be administrated when the Numeric Rating Score (NRS) exceeding 3. The morphine dose will&#xD;
      be repeated whenever indicated considering the total dose in the first 24 hours never&#xD;
      exceeding 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data (age, gender, weight, ASA classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-operative pain will be assessed by Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 at&#xD;
           0,2,4,6 then every 6h for 24 hours and in the second and third postoperative days at&#xD;
           rest and during Physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative analgesia, which will be assessed by total analgesic consumption, and time&#xD;
           till administration of first rescue analgesia will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effect on Motor function: by recording the mean time taken to achieve 90o active knee&#xD;
           flexion each day till the third postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adverse effects: hypotension, Bradycardia, infection, hematoma and local anesthetic&#xD;
           toxicity will be observed and treated accordingly.&#xD;
