    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese&#xD;
      volunteers after oral administration of SHR1459 tablets in new and old formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety after single dose of SHR1459&#xD;
      orally in healthy Chinese subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PK parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, T1/2z, CL/F and Vz/F etc.) will be&#xD;
      calculated to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese volunteers after oral&#xD;
      administration of SHR1459 tablets in new and old formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the safety will be assessed by vital signs, physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory examination (hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation examination),&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram. The incidence and severity degree of adverse events and severe&#xD;
      adverse events will be evaluated based on CTCAE 5.0.&#xD;
