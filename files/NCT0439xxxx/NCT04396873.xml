      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5 million adults in the U.S. have Alzheimer s disease or another adult-onset&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disorder. Many studies have found that inflammation in the brain&#xD;
      contributes to these diseases. Researchers want to find a better way to measure this&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn whether COX-1 and/or COX-2 is elevated in the brains of individuals with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative brain disease compared to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 years and older in good general health who have an adult-onset&#xD;
      neurodegenerative dementia, such as AD, FTD, corticobasal syndrome, or Huntington s disease&#xD;
      and healthy adult volunteers enrolled in protocols 01-M-0254 or 17-M-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam with vital signs, and lab&#xD;
      tests. They will have a neuropsychological testing. Their heart function will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scanner is a metal&#xD;
      tube surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in&#xD;
      and out of the tube. The machine makes noise. Participants will get earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 PET scans. They will be injected with the study drugs through an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter placed in an arm vein. The PET scanner is shaped like a doughnut.&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner. A plastic mask will be&#xD;
      molded to their head to keep them from moving. A thin plastic tube will be put into an artery&#xD;
      at the wrist or elbow crease area. This will be used to draw blood during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2-3 study visits. Participation lasts 1 week to 4 months, depending on&#xD;
      scheduling.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot/exploratory study will examine whether cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2 are&#xD;
      elevated in the brains of individuals with neurodegenerative brain disease compared to&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine whether COX-1 and/or COX-2 is elevated in the brains of&#xD;
      individuals with neurodegenerative brain disease compared to healthy volunteers. Secondary&#xD;
      Objective: To determine retest variability and reliability for each radioligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Measurement of COX-1 and COX-2 density in brain after PET scans with&#xD;
      [11C]PS13 and [11C]MC1, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: To measure whole-brain distribution volume (VT) of COX-1 and COX-2 in a&#xD;
      retest setting; 2) To correlate VT with the presence of amyloid in AD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five groups will be studied: 1) Alzheimer s disease (AD), 2) frontotemporal dementia (FTD),&#xD;
      3) other dementias, 4) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and 5) healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      number of participants per group will be up to 16 for the patient groups and up to 25 for the&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Participants may be male or female. They must be &gt;=18 years old, but most&#xD;
      are expected to be 60 to 80 years old. Participants may be recruited from anywhere, but most&#xD;
      are expected to come from the Washington DC metropolitan area. Patients must be in good&#xD;
      medical health but may be unable to provide informed consent because of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      In that case, the Legally Appointed Representative (LAR) must provide consent, and the&#xD;
      patient must provide assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multisite protocol that will enroll subjects from Georgetown University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and PET imaging will be performed at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be intravenously injected with 20 mCi of one or both of the radioligands:&#xD;
      [11C]MC1 and [11C]PS13. Participants will also have a radial artery catheter(s) inserted to&#xD;
      measure the concentration of radioligand (either one insertion (if both scans are performed&#xD;
      on the same day) or two insertions (if the scans are performed on two different days).&#xD;
      Participants will also have a brain MRI to provide anatomic orientation for the PET scans.AD&#xD;
      patients will have an amyloid scan after injection of about 8 mCi of 18F-Florbetaben, without&#xD;
      arterial input function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week to four months, depending on the patient s availability and access to MRI and PET&#xD;
      cameras.&#xD;
