  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of conducting a multicomponent&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention research study within the UAB Family Medicine Clinic at Highlands and&#xD;
      to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the adaptive treatment strategies being&#xD;
      investigated to produce improvements in insulin resistance. This study is a Sequential&#xD;
      Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) with initial randomization groups of&#xD;
      individualized nutrition counseling vs. individualized exercise counseling. Note that these&#xD;
      initial nutrition or exercise interventions are NOT intended to produce significant weight&#xD;
      loss. Participants that do not sufficiently improve their insulin resistance score after 8&#xD;
      weeks will be re-randomized to 2nd stage interventions of either receiving dietary counseling&#xD;
      for weight loss or receiving a prescription for metformin. We will collect data on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention to improve insulin resistance/metabolic health in the&#xD;
      family medicine clinic as well as potential predictors or moderators of treatment success.&#xD;

A total of 16 nutrition counseling sessions lasting ~30 minutes will be scheduled with a frequency of 1 session per week for 1 month (5 sessions), 1 session every-other week for months 2-6 (11 sessions). &quot;Responding&quot; participants who have improved their insulin resistance as measured at the 8-week visit will continue receiving this level of nutrition counseling through the end of the study, meeting with the dietitian every other week. Starting at week 9, those identified as &quot;non-responding&quot; participants will be re-randomized to 2nd stage interventions, of either receiving nutrition counseling for weight loss (meeting with the dietitian every other week) or the addition of a prescription for metformin.</description>
