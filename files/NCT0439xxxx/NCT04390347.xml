  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomised controlled trial where participants will be randomised to&#xD;
      either twice daily 65ml of Lactobacillus casei Shirota for six months or a matched placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention product (Yakult) (supplied as fermented milk) and placebo will be delivered&#xD;
      in sealed pots of 65 mL with date stamped expiry. Yakult contains Lactobacillus casei Shirota&#xD;
      (a minimum of 6.5 × 10 9 live cells of Lactobacillus casei Shirota are contained in each&#xD;
      pot). The pots will be stored at 4-7 °C (domestic refrigerator) on premises at University&#xD;
      Hospital of Leicester and the University of Leicester until provided to participants. These&#xD;
      products have a shelf life of four weeks but fresh deliveries will be sent every two weeks.&#xD;
      They will be stored at approximately seven degrees Celsius (refrigerated at the University&#xD;
      and subsequently, after delivery to participants, in domestic refrigerators) in a restricted&#xD;
      area where only members of the research team will have access to them. Participants will have&#xD;
      supplies provided to them in person every two-weeks and will be required to ingest two pots&#xD;
      of Yakult, every day for six months. Participants will be instructed to ingest one 65ml pot&#xD;
      in the morning (prior to breakfast) and one bottle in the evening (prior to an evening meal).&#xD;
      They will also be instructed to avoid any other dietary supplement aimed at modulating the&#xD;
      gut microbiota during the six month intervention period. Researchers will keep a log of the&#xD;
      amount of pots supplied to participants and will visit the participants at the haemodialysis&#xD;
      unit to supply more pots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo will be indistinguishable (identical in taste and colour but will not contain&#xD;
      Lactobacillus casei Shirota) to both participants and trial investigators. It will be stored&#xD;
      and provided in exactly the same manner as the intervention product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      A record of compliance for supplement ingestion will be completed by all participants&#xD;
      (including days where they may have missed taking the supplement). Following feedback from a&#xD;
      research patient group, all participants will be offered any or all of the following steps in&#xD;
      any combination to aid adherence to the product:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone call reminders (daily or weekly)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Text or email alerts at any preferred schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular visits / reminders in person on the dialysis units&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Numbers - Feasibility and Statistical Power Patients will be recruited from within&#xD;
      the Leicester Renal Network, which includes ten dialysis units treating over 800&#xD;
      haemodialysis patients. The number of participants required is therefore readily attainable.&#xD;
      Based on a previously reported (Wang et al., 2015), post-intervention change (compared to&#xD;
      pre-intervention) in serum endotoxin following probiotic supplementation in peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis patients (-1.11 ± 1.5 EU/mL for probiotic and 0.86 ± 2.3 endotoxin units/mL for&#xD;
      placebo), it was calculated (Stata IC version 15.1, StataCorp, Texa, USA) that n=44 (n=50&#xD;
      accounting for 10% dropout for death and transplantation over 6 months) was required to&#xD;
      detect a significant difference between probiotic and placebo groups with 90% power and alpha&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropout rate A drop-out rate of 10% in line with previous studies is expected. This is also&#xD;
      entirely in-keeping with previous experience of interventional studies in the haemodialysis&#xD;
      population which show a 10-20% drop out rate due to death, transplantation and non-adherence&#xD;
      (Graham-Brown et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation The trial design will be a randomised-controlled trial (RCT). Participants will&#xD;
      be individually randomised to either the Lactobacillus casei Shirota or a well-matched&#xD;
      placebo. After recruitment, participants will be randomised to one of two groups using the&#xD;
      REDCap system by the bioinformatics team within the National Institute of Health Research&#xD;
      Biomedical Research Centre at the University of Leicester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding This trial will be conducted in a double-blind manner. Both participants and&#xD;
      researchers will be blind to the treatment allocation. Both the Lactobacillus casei Shirota&#xD;
      (Yakult) and the placebo will be supplied, and simply marked as, 'A' or 'B', by Yakult&#xD;
      Honsha. Neither the researchers nor the participants will know which is Yakult and which is&#xD;
      placebo and will therefore both be unaware which product they are taking. Yakult Honsha will&#xD;
      have no knowledge of which patients are randomised to which group. Once all patients have&#xD;
      completed the study, the database has been locked and statistical analyses performed, the&#xD;
      nature of the two product groups will be revealed by un-blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main assessments (at baseline and six months) will take place over one or more sessions&#xD;
      dependent on patient preference. Blood and saliva samples will be taken at the start of&#xD;
      dialysis, eliminating the need for additional venepuncture; relevant demographic data will be&#xD;
      extracted from medical records throughout the trial and also collected from participants&#xD;
      prior to their usual haemodialysis appointment. Participants will have the choice of&#xD;
      completing the questionnaires during their usual haemodialysis appointment (with the&#xD;
      assistance of a researcher) or taking them home to complete at their convenience and return&#xD;
      them to the researcher at their next haemodialysis appointment. The questionnaires will take&#xD;
      no longer than 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the choice of giving their faecal sample either at their normal&#xD;
      dialysis appointment or will be given a kit to collect their sample at home. All data can be&#xD;
      collected from participants around their usual haemodialysis treatment so as to reduce the&#xD;
      additional time participants need to attend over and above their out-patient appointment.&#xD;
      Although this may require them to arrive earlier (e.g. 30 minutes) than their usual&#xD;
      appointment time.&#xD;
