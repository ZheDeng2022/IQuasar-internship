  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous regional anesthesia is one of the well-known techniques of regional anesthesia&#xD;
      for short surgical operations on the upper and lower limbs. It was first introduced back in&#xD;
      1908. Later on it was popularized even more for the same purpose by using two tourniquets to&#xD;
      isolate an exsanguinated extremity then injection of local anesthesia. It was proved over&#xD;
      time to be safe and effective with minimal side effects and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) has been used over the 20th century for prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic and eclampsia seizures during pregnancy because of its superior safety profile&#xD;
      over other drugs used for the same purpose. The specific mechanisms of action of magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate still unclear but are probably multi-factorial. It may act as a vasodilator on&#xD;
      peripheral as well as cerebral vasculature, to decrease peripheral vascular resistance and/or&#xD;
      relieve vasoconstriction. Additionally, it may also protect the blood-brain barrier and limit&#xD;
      cerebral edema formation, or it may also act as a central anticonvulsant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl; was first introduced back in 1990 for palliative use as fentanyl patch. Few years&#xD;
      later, it became available in different forms of administration being highly lipophilic. Few&#xD;
      years later it became the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. It is an opioid&#xD;
      analgesic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. It is a potent Î¼-opioid receptor&#xD;
      pure agonist. Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl has a&#xD;
      relatively wide therapeutic index, which makes it a very safe surgical anesthetic drug when&#xD;
      monitored carefully.&#xD;

      Two Intravenous lines will be inserted one at a distal point on the arm to be blocked and&#xD;
      other one in the other arm for fluids infusion. The block will be executed by injecting the&#xD;
      target medicine in 10 ml increments in a blinded manner of total of 40 ml (study drugs&#xD;
      diluted in normal saline 0.9% solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group (L): will receive lidocaine 3 mg/kg total of 40 ml (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group (M): will receive lidocaine 3 mg/kg total of 40 ml plus Magnesium sulphate 30&#xD;
           mg/kg maximum 1.5 gm, mixed with the second 20 ml of block solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group (F): will receive lidocaine 3 mg/kg total of 40 ml plus fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, mixed&#xD;
           with lidocaine given after the first 20 ml of block solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment: Local anesthetic agent: lidocaine HCl (2%), Rubber tourniquet, IV catheters (20-&#xD;
      or 24-gauge), 500-mL or 1-L bag of IV solution (crystalloid), Infusion set, Pneumatic&#xD;
      tourniquet, ideally with a double cuff, One Esmarch bandage (about 150 cm in length, 10 cm in&#xD;
      width), Syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation: The patient lies in the supine position with the vein selected for block&#xD;
      placement is readily accessible. Baseline vital signs are assessed; blood pressure, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, and ECG monitoring. Intravenous access in the non-operated extremity is obtained.&#xD;
      Small doses of benzodiazepine for anxiolysis or small aliquots of opioids in case of&#xD;
      discomfort will be available if needed. For safety and securing success, pneumatic cuffs will&#xD;
      always be checked for air leaks prior to each IVRA procedure. Clinical staff performing the&#xD;
      technique should have ready access to intra-lipid in case it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secure IV cannula in the extremity opposite to the block side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A double pneumatic tourniquet is fixed on a padding layer of soft cloth or cotton with&#xD;
           the proximal cuff high on the upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An IV cannula is inserted and secured into a peripheral vein of the operative limb, as&#xD;
           far distally as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The entire limb is elevated for 1 to 2 minutes to allow for passive exsanguination.&#xD;
           Afterwards, while still keeping the limb high, a rubber (Esmarch) bandage is wrapped&#xD;
           around it spirally from distal end proximally till the distal cuff of the double&#xD;
           tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The artery is digitally occluded by inflating the proximal cuff 100 mm Hg above systolic&#xD;
           arterial blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After reaching the correct pressure, the Esmarch bandage is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A total of 40 mL of the study medicine according to the protocol is injected slowly in&#xD;
           10 ml increments via the IV catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After the injection, the arm is lowered to the level of the table. The used IV cannula&#xD;
           is removed, and in a sterile manner, pressure is quickly applied over the puncture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of anesthesia is + 5 minutes after injection. When the patient reports the&#xD;
      tourniquet pain, the distal cuff should be inflated and the proximal cuff is deflated about&#xD;
      20 to 30 minutes after the beginning of anesthesia&#xD;
