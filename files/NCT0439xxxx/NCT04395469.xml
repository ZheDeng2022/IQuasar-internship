  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single centre, investigator initiated study to investigate the use of&#xD;
      FAZA-PET in combination with MRI. FAZA is an investigational radiotracer used in PET scans.&#xD;
      FAZA PET-MRI will be used to measure hypoxia in up to 20 patients with unresectable,&#xD;
      non-metastatic, locally advanced un-resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each FAZA PET-MRI scan, patients will be followed up via telephone, 48 hours after the&#xD;
      imaging session to assure that the procedure was tolerated without side effects. Patients&#xD;
      will undergo a FAZA PET-MRI scans before and after their standard of care radiation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of hypoxia-targeted therapies has so far been limited, a fact widely attributed&#xD;
      to the absence of a reliable imaging biomarker for hypoxia that could easily be implemented&#xD;
      into a routine clinical workflow. A compelling study has found the presence of hypoxia in&#xD;
      pancreatic tumors using FAZA-PET imaging. The data derived from this alternative dual-imaging&#xD;
      approach can be used to establish a patient-specific perfusion-to-hypoxia mapping, accounting&#xD;
      for differences in tumour metabolisms. This technique was recently validated in a&#xD;
      pre-clinical FAZA-PET/CE-MRI study of mice with orthotopically-implanted pancreatic&#xD;
      patient-derived tumour xenografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look for hypoxia in tumours using a PET scan in combination&#xD;
      with MRI. The use of PET/MRI scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the&#xD;
      approaches used previously. This study will assess whether or not PET/MRI scans can provide&#xD;
      useful information about hypoxia in pancreatic cancer. Additionally, a recent study at the&#xD;
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre found varying levels of hypoxia in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      tumors, providing a rationale for incorporating hypoxia imaging and patient-specific&#xD;
      treatment adaptation into the clinical management of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants who have histologically confirmed new diagnosis of unresectable,&#xD;
             non-metastatic, LAPAC as assessed by the multidisciplinary tumor board based on pre-RT&#xD;
             imaging and clinical assessment, and are amenable to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who received prior systemic therapy for unresectable LAPAC may be consented&#xD;
             and enrolled if they still have localized unresectable LAPAC amenable to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with newly diagnosed LAPAC who received systemic therapy for borderline&#xD;
             resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and have become unresectable following&#xD;
             preoperative multidisciplinary assessment, are eligible for the study if the patient&#xD;
             meets the eligibility criteria based on staging following systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status ≤2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A negative serum pregnancy test prior to PET-MR imaging, for women of child-bearing&#xD;
             age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had prior RT to upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are receiving any other concomitant investigational agents. Participants&#xD;
             who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate as&#xD;
             long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with early stage resectable (I-II) pancreatic cancer, or known distant&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Contraindication to MRI scan as per current institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required&#xD;
             active treatment within the past 3 years. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (other than head and neck region), or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ (e.g., in situ cervical cancer or breast carcinoma) that have&#xD;
             undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality,&#xD;
             known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that might confound the results of the&#xD;
             study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the&#xD;
             study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
