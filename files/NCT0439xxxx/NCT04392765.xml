  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that a common cause for snoring and throat obstruction (obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnoea (OSA)) is excessive loss of muscle tone in the throat when the investigators go to&#xD;
      sleep. This results in the partial collapse of the throat (snoring) or complete collapse&#xD;
      (OSA) during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45% of the male population snore. Sleep apnoea affects 4 to 6% of the population and is&#xD;
      associated with increased incidence of raised blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.&#xD;
      Although there are several lifestyle practices associated with snoring such as smoking,&#xD;
      obesity and drinking, a significant proportion of people may snore despite not being&#xD;
      associated with these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A solution to this issue is to improve the muscle tone of the throat so that it doesn't&#xD;
      collapse so easily. Several studies have shown that certain types of throat exercises can&#xD;
      help reduce snoring. Further studies have also shown that using electrical stimulation to&#xD;
      exercise the tongue muscles has the same effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this, doctors in the United Kingdom (UK) have developed a new type of device, eXciteOSA,&#xD;
      that allows a more accurate and comfortable way of delivering this energy to exercise the&#xD;
      tongue muscles. The device works by stimulating the tongue muscles during the day so that the&#xD;
      tongue is less likely to collapse during sleep. It is a form of &quot;workout&quot; for the tongue and&#xD;
      like other physical exercise regimes, it needs to be repeated regularly for a few weeks to&#xD;
      take effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to see if the eXciteOSA device is as effective as the previous&#xD;
      methods and if it can reduce snoring and improve sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be achieved by participants using the eXciteOSA once daily for a six week period. A&#xD;
      two night sleep study with watchPAT along with a polysomnography will be completed before and&#xD;
      after the therapy to compare results. Questionnaires on sleep quality and quality of life&#xD;
      will also be completed pre and post therapy.&#xD;

      Study Design: Phase IV prospective, multi-centre post-market surveillance study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will follow the pre-determined study protocol, collecting endpoint relevant data&#xD;
      which will then be analysed according to the methods outlined in this statistical analysis&#xD;
      plan (SAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, participants will proceed through three phases of the trial. The pre-trial phase&#xD;
      collects data on the pre therapy state of the participant, after which they will enter the&#xD;
      therapy phase where they use the device once daily for the required period whilst continuing&#xD;
      to record the required data. The participant will stop using the device at the end of this&#xD;
      stage and have a follow up phase during which trial indices will continue to be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eXciteOSA transoral neurostimulation device is a home use device controlled by a mobile&#xD;
      app. Its primary indication is for use in snoring in primary snorers or individuals with mild&#xD;
      sleep apnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reusable device that produces muscular stimulation via electrodes integrated into a&#xD;
      mouthpiece used by the candidate. The product will be supplied be Signifier Medical&#xD;
      Technologies ltd. The eXciteOSA device comes in a black box which contains the control unit,&#xD;
      mouthpiece, universal serial bus (USB) cable and the instructions for use. Only the supplied&#xD;
      products should be used together. Use of the product should be discontinued if it appears&#xD;
      damaged in any way. The mouthpiece is connected to the control unit via a USB port and&#xD;
      Bluetooth connection is established between the control unit and the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is to be used whilst awake, once daily for 20 minutes. The app automatically times&#xD;
      the session and terminates it once completed. The therapy consists of a series of pulse&#xD;
      bursts with the basic characteristic of 6 secs burst and 4 seconds rest. During the 20 mins&#xD;
      therapy period the pulse frequency will change every 5 mins in a defined sequence. The&#xD;
      intensity of the pulses can be controlled be the participant using the app, from a scale of 1&#xD;
      to 15. Patients should select the highest level they can tolerate without any discomfort.&#xD;
