    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in total staining score at Day 90.The total staining score will be the sum of corneal and conjunctival staining score using modified NEI grading scale.&#xD;
The modified NEI/Industry Workshop guidelines will be used for grading the scale of corneal and conjunctival damage. The cornea is divided into five sectors and each of which is scored on a scale of 0-5, with a maximal total corneal staining score of 25. The conjunctiva is divided into six sectors and each of which is scored on a scale of 0-5, with a maximal total conjunctival staining score of 30.</description>
