  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Home health care is very complex. The registration of many disassembled&#xD;
      information makes it difficult to interpret and does not allow the identification of critical&#xD;
      areas for risk management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis / Research question: The availability of a risk map, with visual alerts to&#xD;
      identify the critical areas, will facilitate the implementation of safe practices and improve&#xD;
      the safety of patients included in the DOMicillary care program (ATDOM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To design and evaluate the effectiveness of the availability of a Visual Risks&#xD;
      Map (MRV) in the computerized medical histories of ATDOM patients in the improvement of their&#xD;
      safety and quality of life.(QL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Once MRV is designed, the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial by&#xD;
      conglomerates (Primary Care centers) to evaluate whether the fact of having this MRV&#xD;
      (intervention) in the medical histories of ATDOM patients reduces avoidable income, falls and&#xD;
      wounds and improves QL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan: Baseline description: socio-demographic characteristics, risk's levels in the&#xD;
      different areas and other covariates in the control and intervention groups. Chi-square test&#xD;
      to compare frequency of outcomes between control and intervention groups. Cox regression&#xD;
      model to estimate time until the outcomes appear, adjusting for the different variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The frequency of avoidable hospital admissions / emergencies' visits, falls&#xD;
      and sores / infections will be significantly lower in the group of patients who have MRV in&#xD;
      their clinical histories. Their qL wil be better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicability and Relevance: It is a feasible and easy-to-implement project. It provides a&#xD;
      practical utility for a lot of information that the investigators record and affects a key&#xD;
      aspect of quality of care.&#xD;

      Design:1st phase: Visual Risk Map Design (MRV); 2nd Phase: Randomized clinical trial by&#xD;
      conglomerates (Primary Care Centers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population (indicate inclusion and exclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the Home Care program (ATDOM) assigned to the Primary Care Centers in&#xD;
      the territory who agree to participate in the study. The only exclusion criterion will be the&#xD;
      patient's refusal to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and sampling procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 8 Centers; 4 will be randomly assigned to intervention and 4&#xD;
      to control. If approximately 80% of patients have had an admission in the previous year and&#xD;
      the investigators intend that, with our intervention, this percentage drops to 70%, for a&#xD;
      confidence of 95% (alpha error of 5%) and a statistical power of 80%, the investigators will&#xD;
      need a sample of 231 patients and, if the investigators have a 15% loss, 272 patients per&#xD;
      group (control and intervention). Each Center will be able to provide approximately 50 ATDOM&#xD;
      patients. All patients will be invited to participate. They will be given a brief explanation&#xD;
      of the study and invited to sign informed consent (in case the patient has a significant&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, their guardian will sign the consent). All patients who meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be included.The basic morbidity and mortality characteristics of the sample&#xD;
      will be compared with the MSIQ (health and quality monitoring) record of CatSalut (catalonia&#xD;
      health services).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent and independent variables (for quantitative studies):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables: Percentage of patients with: hospital admissions / avoidable hospital&#xD;
      emergency room visits (main variable) during the follow-up year sores falls. Death and final&#xD;
      institutionalization will also be considered dependent variables In addition to the&#xD;
      percentage of patients with admissions, the investigators will also consider the total number&#xD;
      of preventable admissions and visits to hospital emergencies during the follow-up period.&#xD;
      Another dependent variable will be the quality of life, which the investigators will measure&#xD;
      using the EuroQol-5D index (see appendix 1), a record currently available at the e-cap&#xD;
      clinical station.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables: The main independent variable is &quot;intervention&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention consists of the availability in the patient's medical history&#xD;
      of the visual risk map. Patients in the intervention group will have a risk map in their&#xD;
      medical history and any professional who treats them will have immediate access to this map,&#xD;
      which the investigators think will help them prioritize the implementation of the relevant&#xD;
      practices. safe (in relation to the areas that appear in red) Patients in the control group&#xD;
      will have in their clinical histories the usual records of comprehensive geriatric assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk areas: Other independent variables will be the risk areas: Patient identification,&#xD;
      Functional autonomy and quality of life, Caregiver, Management and safe use of medications,&#xD;
      Risk of falls, Risk of pressure injuries and ulcers, Control of symptoms, Risk of infection&#xD;
      associated with health care, Values and beliefs of the patient and the family, Social risk,&#xD;
      Unplanned hospital admissions / proactive follow-up, Continuity of care 7 days X 24 hours ,&#xD;
      Transfers (between levels of care), Security culture and Nursing work environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first stage of the project, the 15 variables (indicators) corresponding to the&#xD;
      aforementioned Risk Areas (RAs) will be created based on the integration of one or more&#xD;
      variables. the investigators detail all the &quot;primary&quot; variables that will be considered for&#xD;
      inclusion in the 15 indicators (&quot;secondary&quot; variables) corresponding to the 15 RAs, which&#xD;
      will generate 1 synthetic indicator of the overall risk of the patient. The selection of the&#xD;
      variables to be included was made based on the bibliographic search; their final inclusion&#xD;
      and the relative contribution of each will depend on the consensus among the members of the&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team of professionals (doctors, nurses, social workers) experts in ATDOM.&#xD;
      For the weighting (contribution of each of the variables to the final indicator) will be&#xD;
      taken into account on the one hand the magnitude / severity of the problem measured by the&#xD;
      variable and on the other the existence of feasible interventions (safe practices) that have&#xD;
      proven its effectiveness in improving it. The same team will also decide the cut points; that&#xD;
      is, from which values of the new variables / indicators (operated from the weighted &quot;primary&quot;&#xD;
      variables) is it considered moderate risk and when it goes to high risk. For this recoding&#xD;
      and fusion of primary variables will have the support of a mathematical expert and the&#xD;
      professionals of the Technologies of the Information and the Communication (TIC) will be the&#xD;
      commissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the data will be collected from the records in the e-cap (primary care clinical&#xD;
      station): socio-demographic variables, scores at different scales, diagnostic codes. Other&#xD;
      sources of information will be direct observation, interviews with patients and caregivers,&#xD;
      exchange of information with other professionals involved (social services, professionals&#xD;
      from other care devices ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the first phase of the study has been completed with the &quot;construction&quot; of the 15&#xD;
      variables corresponding to the risk areas, the investigators will make a descriptive&#xD;
      analysis: the investigators will determine the mean and standard deviation for quantitative&#xD;
      variables and frequencies (percentages) for qualitative ones. Based on the categorization of&#xD;
      risk areas, the investigators will analyze the distribution of these categories (low,&#xD;
      moderate or high risk) for each of the 15 RAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will do a baseline comparative analysis (using Chi-square test and&#xD;
      Student's t, as the investigators compare qualitative or quantitative variables) between&#xD;
      control group and intervention to check that there are no significant differences between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will compare the outcome variables (outcomes) between groups using&#xD;
      the chi-square test and the investigators will also do a multivariate analysis (Cox&#xD;
      regression) introducing in the model adjustment variables: socio-demographic, risk areas and&#xD;
      covariates mentioned above, and considering the time to the event of the outcome variables:&#xD;
      admission, fall, sore or infection, institutionalization, and success. For the variable&#xD;
      quality of life the investigators will compare the scores (averages and percentiles) of the&#xD;
      scale between control group and intervention and also at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
