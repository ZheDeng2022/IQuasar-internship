  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral cancer starts in the mucosa of the mouth and the most common site is the tongue and&#xD;
      gingiva. One of the most important issues for the prognosis is to surgically remove all the&#xD;
      cancer, at the sides as well as at the deep margin. To accomplish that, it is crucial to&#xD;
      identify the border between tumour and healthy tissue. Traditionally white light from a head&#xD;
      light or operation theatre lamp is used to illuminate the area of the tumour. Narrow Band&#xD;
      Imaging (NBI) is an optical technique where ordinary white light is filtered so only the blue&#xD;
      light in it is used. Illuminating the mucosa with this blue light through an endoscope with&#xD;
      high definition image, makes the blood vessels appear more clearly. The altered blood vessels&#xD;
      that the cancer produce can thereby be seen and mark the area where the tumour starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines if NBI is helpful in the decision of where the border between the cancer&#xD;
      and the normal mucosa is. If so, NBI might improve the possibility to remove all cancer&#xD;
      tissue compared to using the ordinary white light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also increase the knowledge about the NBI technique, which is helpful in the&#xD;
      examination of patients with suspected head and neck cancers and at the follow-up of patients&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are patients with oral cancer presenting at the otorhinolaryngology department&#xD;
      in Örebro University hospital in Sweden for surgical treatment. The surgery will be done in&#xD;
      the usual fashion but the mucosa surrounding the tumour will also be illuminated by NBI and&#xD;
      this picture of the vessels will be compared to the microscopic analysis by the pathologist,&#xD;
      the so called PAD. Thereby we seek to compare the border in white light to the border seen&#xD;
      with NBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary oral cavity cancer will be examined with Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) at&#xD;
      the time of surgery. Olympus® equipment will be used together with straight 5,9 mm&#xD;
      endoscopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First the tumour border seen in white light will be defined. Thereafter endoscopic&#xD;
      examination with white light and NBI will be performed and recorded. Then the tumour border&#xD;
      seen in white light will be marked with dots by monopolar diathermy. Finally the area is&#xD;
      examined again with NBI and if the tumour border is seen outside the border seen in white&#xD;
      light, that area is marked by a suture for the pathology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the purpose of this study is to gain knowledge of NBI in oral cavity cancer, the&#xD;
      resection margin will be marked at least 10mm from the tumour border as it is seen in white&#xD;
      light in the ordinary fashion. However there are evolving evidence that NBI better delineate&#xD;
      tumour border in larynx and some data for the oral cavity, therefore any suspected mucosa&#xD;
      according to NBI outside the ordinary resection margin will be included with a small margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no uniform definition of the NBI pattern in oral cavity cancer. The planned criteria&#xD;
      is changed IPCL type III/IV according to Takano (see ref.) and so called &quot;marked brown dots&quot;&#xD;
      as criteria for precancerous or cancerous mucosa according to NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumour border in white light and NBI will be compared and PAD is considered gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach 80% power with 5 % type 1 error, two-sided test, and 25% of the examinations&#xD;
      anticipated to show different tumour border with NBI, 49 participants will be needed.&#xD;
