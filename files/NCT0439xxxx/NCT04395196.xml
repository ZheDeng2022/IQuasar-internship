  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are well known,&#xD;
      many women continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, putting their infants at risk for&#xD;
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Animal studies have shown that choline supplementation can&#xD;
      mitigate effects of PAE on growth and development. Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as&#xD;
      a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is a constituent of the neurotransmitter&#xD;
      acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. In an R21 feasibility&#xD;
      trial, 70 heavy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 2g of choline or a&#xD;
      placebo from initiation of antenatal care to delivery in Cape Town, South Africa, where the&#xD;
      incidence of heavy drinking during pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest&#xD;
      in the world. When compared with infants in the placebo arm, infants in the choline-treated&#xD;
      arm were more likely to meet criterion for eyeblink conditioning, demonstrated markedly&#xD;
      better recognition memory on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, which is known to have&#xD;
      predictive validity for school-age IQ, and had better postnatal gains in weight and head&#xD;
      circumference. Key features of this study included the higher choline dose (4.4 times&#xD;
      adequate intake (AI), compared to 1.7-2.5 in previous human studies) and initiation of&#xD;
      treatment early in pregnancy. We are now conducting a fully-powered, double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled choline supplementation trial in heavy drinking pregnant women&#xD;
      from a rural community in South Africa (1) to assess the effectiveness of maternal choline&#xD;
      supplementation during pregnancy to mitigate effects of PAE on three primary outcomes: infant&#xD;
      recognition memory and postnatal growth restriction (weight and head circumference); (2) to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of this supplementation for mitigating alcohol effects on the following&#xD;
      secondary outcomes: infant eyeblink conditioning, postnatal length, and information&#xD;
      processing speed; (3) to use innovative methods in causal inference analysis to examine&#xD;
      protocol adherence as an important source of variation in treatment efficacy and to identify&#xD;
      sociodemographic factors associated with non-compliance in order to facilitate implementation&#xD;
      of the intervention protocol in clinical settings; and (4) in exploratory analyses, to&#xD;
      examine whether maternal choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with&#xD;
      lower dietary choline intake or poor nutritional status.&#xD;
