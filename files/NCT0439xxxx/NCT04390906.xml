    <textblock>
      Cranial radiation therapy (RT), commonly used to treat benign and malignant brain tumors, can&#xD;
      lead to cognitive impairments in domains not related to neuroanatomic structures directly&#xD;
      impacted by the tumor. The study will prospectively enroll 58 patients with benign and&#xD;
      low-grade brain tumors who will undergo partial brain RT, with either conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated or hypofractionated schedules. Subjects will receive MRI scans at baseline and 6&#xD;
      months. Given the role of the limbic system in key cognitive functions affected by RT,&#xD;
      researchers have a particular interest in characterizing MRI changes in the limbic system and&#xD;
      thalamus in relation to memory and related processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine objective neurocognitive changes over time. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           that they will see RT-induced neurocognitive impairment in up to 50% of patients after&#xD;
           cranial RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine changes in brain tissue (via MRI) induced by off-target RT in patients with&#xD;
           benign and low-grade brain tumors. The investigators specifically hypothesize that&#xD;
           comapping of RT dose and MRI changes in the thalamus and limbic system (i.e., thalamic&#xD;
           nuclei, hippocampus, fornix, hypothalamus/mammillary bodies, limbic lobe, cingulum) will&#xD;
           be most distorted by off-target RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the relationship between MRI changes for key neuroanatomic structures&#xD;
           identified in Aim 1 with objective neurocognitive testing. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           that cognitive decline will be correlated with damage revealed by MRI to limbic and&#xD;
           thalamic structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will help to define which neuroanatomic structures are most at risk from&#xD;
      RT-induced damage and will help ultimately establish new dose constraint guidelines for&#xD;
      important structures to improve cognitive outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cranial radiation therapy (RT), commonly used to treat benign and malignant brain tumors, can&#xD;
      lead to cognitive impairments in domains not related to neuroanatomic structures directly&#xD;
      impacted by the tumor. This suggests that off-target RT, even at low doses, may have a&#xD;
      negative cognitive impact by affecting neuroanatomic targets proximal or distal to the tumor.&#xD;
      While constraints to minimize brain necrosis, ototoxicity, and optic neuropathy are&#xD;
      well-established, RT dose tolerances for cognitive changes in key domains (memory, attention,&#xD;
      executive function, and processing speed) that occur in RT-treated patients are poorly&#xD;
      characterized. There is accumulating evidence that consideration of neuroanatomic targets&#xD;
      could better explain cranial RT-mediated cognitive change. Additionally, a recent cooperative&#xD;
      group phase III trial has shown that conformal avoidance of the hippocampus with whole brain&#xD;
      RT can reduce cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, 60% of patients still had cognitive&#xD;
      impairment at 6 months even with hippocampal avoidance, implying that other structures and&#xD;
      networks are involved in cognitive deficits from RT and efforts to identify those structures&#xD;
      are warranted. A major obstacle in the field has been difficulty identifying sites of&#xD;
      off-target tissue damage that could impact cognition after RT. Given the role of the limbic&#xD;
      system in key cognitive functions affected by RT, the investigators have a particular&#xD;
      interest in characterizing changes in limbic system and thalamus in relation to memory and&#xD;
      related processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to examine RT effects on neuroanatomic structures in the limbic system&#xD;
      and thalamus as well as candidate structures identified systematically using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI). The investigators propose to prospectively enroll 58 patients with&#xD;
      benign and low-grade brain tumors who will undergo partial brain RT, either conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated or hypofractionated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive testing will be obtained at baseline, 3, and 6 months after RT using a battery&#xD;
      of tests to assess visual and verbal memory, attention, executive function, and processing&#xD;
      speed. Brain MRI, including high resolution T1 images, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and&#xD;
      resting functional MRI (fMRI) sequences, will be evaluated at baseline and 6 months after RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will provide preliminary data to identify key areas impacted by RT that can&#xD;
      be followed up in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine objective neurocognitive changes over time. Based on prior data, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that they will see RT-induced neurocognitive impairment in up to&#xD;
      50% of patients after cranial RT. The investigators will evaluate neurocognitive testing&#xD;
      changes using a composite global deficit z-score (primary endpoint) as well as z-score&#xD;
      changes in cognitive domains of verbal and visual memory, attention, executive function and&#xD;
      processing speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine changes in brain tissue (via MRI) induced by off-target RT in patients with&#xD;
      benign and low-grade brain tumors. The investigators hypothesize that a detailed brain tissue&#xD;
      injury mapping of off-target RT doses from pre to post-RT and reconstructed structural and&#xD;
      functional connectivity (DTI and fMRI) will provide data on the relationship between RT dose&#xD;
      and MRI changes in specific structures. The investigators specifically hypothesize that&#xD;
      co-mapping of RT dose and MRI changes in the thalamus and limbic system (i.e., thalamic&#xD;
      nuclei, hippocampus, fornix, hypothalamus/mammillary bodies, limbic lobe, cingulum) will be&#xD;
      most distorted by off-target RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the relationship between MRI changes for key neuroanatomic structures with&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing. The investigators hypothesize that RT will impact several neuronal&#xD;
      networks sub-serving multiple cognitive domains and cognitive decline (Aim 2) will be&#xD;
      correlated with damage revealed by MRI to limbic and thalamic structures (Aim 1). This&#xD;
      approach will allow identification of brain structures most associated with domain-specific&#xD;
      cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is critical need for well-designed longitudinal studies that examine the impact of RT&#xD;
      on neuroanatomic structures. Many of the studies that evaluate cognition with RT do not take&#xD;
      into account neuroanatomic dose distributions. Even within the literature that evaluates&#xD;
      neuroanatomic targets, there has not been a systematic approach to evaluation of&#xD;
      neuroanatomic targets by RT. This research will help to define which neuroanatomic structures&#xD;
      are most at risk from RT-induced damage and will help ultimately establish new dose&#xD;
      constraint guidelines for important structures to improve cognitive outcomes.&#xD;
