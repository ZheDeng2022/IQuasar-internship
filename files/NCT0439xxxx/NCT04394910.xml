  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction are at increased risk for brain injury&#xD;
      in the neonatal period, and eventually increased risk for adverse long-term&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes. This kind of growth restriction is often caused by long-term&#xD;
      placental insufficiency leading to chronic lack of oxygen in the brain during development.&#xD;
      Pomegranate juice is one of the highest polyphenol-containing dietary supplements&#xD;
      commercially available. Previous studies have shown that pomegranate-derived polyphenols are&#xD;
      potent neuroprotective antioxidants with no proven side effects. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that maternal dietary supplementation with pomegranate juice during the last&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy will reduce the effects of exogenous stimuli contributing to placental&#xD;
      insufficiency, and will enhance brain growth and development in the IUGR population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to investigate the impact of maternal dietary supplementation with&#xD;
      pomegranate juice on placental morphology and on subsequent newborn brain development and&#xD;
      function. A total of 99 consenting women carrying fetuses with a diagnosis of intrauterine&#xD;
      growth restriction (IUGR) in the third trimester were randomized to one of two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group: Expecting mothers in this group will be randomized to consume 8oz of&#xD;
      pomegranate juice daily. Participants will keep a daily diary documenting compliance with the&#xD;
      regimen. Participants will continue daily intake until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group: Expecting mothers will be randomized to consume an 8oz of pomegranate free&#xD;
      juice placebo that matches taste, calories, and appearance to regular pomegranate juice but&#xD;
      lacks polyphenols. Participants will keep a diary of daily intake to help ensure compliance&#xD;
      similar to the treatment group. Participants will continue to placebo until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups: Maternal blood and urine samples will be collected prior to starting the juice&#xD;
      regimen in order to establish baseline metabolite status. For the first 84 mothers enrolled,&#xD;
      a fetal MRI was scheduled prior to beginning the juice regimen. Phase I participants will&#xD;
      undergo two fetal echocardiograms: one before starting the juice regimen, and a second two&#xD;
      weeks into the juice regimen to establish the safety of high polyphenol intake on fetal heart&#xD;
      development. All women will be contacted on a weekly basis to assess compliance. At the time&#xD;
      of delivery, maternal blood and urine, and cord blood will be collected and sent for analysis&#xD;
      to test for the presence of dimethylellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG) and urolithin A&#xD;
      glucuronide (UAG), polyphenic components of pomegranate juice. Placental material will be&#xD;
      sent for formal pathological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clinically stable, MRI will be undertaken without sedation at term equivalent (38-41 weeks&#xD;
      CGA). Infants will undergo testing of cognitive, gross and fine motor, and speech skills at&#xD;
      around 2 years of age.&#xD;
