    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of an investigational drug, PF-05221304&#xD;
      (PF'1304) on the way the liver handles fat. The planned study will identify why the fat in&#xD;
      the blood increases at the same time this drug reduces fat in the liver. The study will have&#xD;
      two treatment periods of 6 weeks each, separated by a 3 week rest period with no treatment.&#xD;
      The subjects will receive the active drug in one of the 6 week treatment periods and a&#xD;
      placebo in the other 6 week period. The investigators will know when the subjects are&#xD;
      receiving active treatment or placebo, but the subject will not know.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which fat builds up in the liver.&#xD;
      As its name suggests, it is not associated to heavy alcohol use. Non-Alcoholic&#xD;
      Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition of liver inflammation and damage that is caused by the&#xD;
      buildup of fat in the liver. It is usually associated with prediabetes, diabetes (high blood&#xD;
      sugar in the blood), a high concentration of fat (triglycerides) in the blood, and obesity&#xD;
      (increase in fat all over the body). The signs and symptoms of NASH are often not seen until&#xD;
      the liver is damaged beyond repair, making NASH very difficult to diagnose (be picked up by&#xD;
      your doctor) in its early stages where treatments might be able to reverse the damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no treatments currently approved for people with NASH but several new medications&#xD;
      are under study in people with NAFLD or NASH. This study uses a treatment being developed for&#xD;
      treating NASH. The investigators will conduct a study to assess the effects of PF-05221304&#xD;
      (PF'1304) on the way the liver handles fat. In early studies, this new drug has shown promise&#xD;
      for lowering the level of fat in the liver. However, it also, unexpectedly, increases the&#xD;
      level of fat in the blood, which could increase the risk of heart disease and inflammation of&#xD;
      the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study will identify why the fat in the blood increases. Subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      screening period where we will obtain medical history and physical exam. Additionally, we&#xD;
      will obtain the results of liver imaging or liver biopsy previously performed by the&#xD;
      subject's doctor that confirm the presence of an abnormal amount of liver fat and liver&#xD;
      stiffness. The enrolled subjects will receive placebo (an inactive pill) during the first 6&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a 3 week washout period and then 6 weeks of active treatment. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected during outpatient visits to check for study safety and measurements&#xD;
      of fat in the blood and particles that carry that fat. There will also be 2 long outpatient&#xD;
      studies that last approximately 15 hours each, where we will test why there is increase in&#xD;
      fat blood levels during treatment with PF'1304. All visits will occur at the CUIMC Irving&#xD;
      Institute for Clinical and Translational Research. Subject risk will be minimized through&#xD;
      strict eligibility criteria to avoid enrollment of unstable or high-risk subjects and by&#xD;
      close monitoring of adverse events (AE's), laboratory parameters, and vital signs during the&#xD;
      study. In addition, blood fat levels will be measured on an ongoing basis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other disease, condition, or laboratory value that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             principal investigator or clinical study team would place the subject at an&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of organ transplantation (other than corneal).&#xD;

             cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus,&#xD;
             tacrolimus, and terfenadine will be reason for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        a = the major clearance mechanism of PF-05221304 is active uptake into liver (mainly via&#xD;
        hepatic transporters OATP1B1/1B3) followed by hepatic carbonyl reductase 1,&#xD;
        11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and CYP 3A4/5-mediated metabolism. It is anticipated that&#xD;
        potent OATP inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of PF-05221304. As such, subjects&#xD;
        treated with clinically relevant OATP inhibitors will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
