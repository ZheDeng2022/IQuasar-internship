  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study looks at the effect of long-term diet modification with or without&#xD;
      full-fat dairy products or restrictive eating on body weight, body composition and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic markers in healthy overweight/obese men and women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 93 males and females will participate in the study at the University of Toronto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and after 12 weeks, body weight, composition will be measured through Bodpod&#xD;
      scans. Resting metabolic rate and thermogenesis will be measured by indirect calorimetry.&#xD;
      Also, fecal samples will be collected for gut microbiome profiling along with blood for&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, hormones, triacylglycerol, HbA1c, short-chain fatty acid, red blood cells&#xD;
      and FGF21. Urine samples will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A followup session at 16 weeks will reassess previous measures.&#xD;
