    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm PMCF study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the ENTACT (Next Generation) resorbable staple system for septoplasty in 40&#xD;
      subjects. The study purpose is to provide evidence to satisfy the PMCF requirements of CE&#xD;
      Marking to market this device in Europe (data may be used to support registrations on other&#xD;
      countries as well).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate clinical success of the ENTACT (Next&#xD;
      Generation) resorbable septal staple system by examining the patient's nasal cavity at the 21&#xD;
      day follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to generate performance and health economics data to support the&#xD;
      use of ENTACT (Next Generation) resorbable septal staple.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Success of the ENTACT Septal Staple System by examining the patient's nasal cavity at the 21 day follow-up visit</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>At the 21-day follow-up visit, the clinician will examine the patient's nasal cavity and will confirm YES or NO:&#xD;
Septum wall straight appearance (yes/no);&#xD;
Complete coaptation of perichondrial flaps on septum wall (yes/no);&#xD;
Absence of significant local tissue reaction at the staple site (yes/no);&#xD;
Absence of hematoma swelling at the staple site (yes/no);&#xD;
No need for re-intervention at the surgery site (yes/no);&#xD;
If all the answers to the questions above are &quot;YES&quot; then clinical success will be inferred (if any answer is &quot;NO&quot; then repair failure will be inferred).</description>

    <measure>Nasal Obstructions Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score collected at pre-op and all post-operative visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Day: 0, 5, 21 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale is a patient reported outcome (PRO). The NOSE Scale allows subjects to quantify their symptoms based on the severity of obstruction. Subjects will be asked to rate their perceptions on the Likert scale with respect to the following characteristics: Nasal congestion or stuffiness, Nasal blockage or obstruction, Trouble breathing through my nose, Trouble sleeping, Unable to get enough air through my nose during exercise or exertion.&#xD;
Participants will rate their responses using a Likert scale with response options 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, as follows:&#xD;
(0) Not a Problem&#xD;
Very Mild Problem&#xD;
Moderate Problem&#xD;
Fairly Bad Problem&#xD;
Severe Problem</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain collected at pre-op and all post-operative visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Day: 0, 5, 21 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain is a continuous scale completed by the subject who is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the subject's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100-mm scale]).</description>
