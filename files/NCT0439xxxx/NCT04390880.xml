  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this phase II trial study is to determine whether a positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan using 18F-DCFPyL affects the clinical&#xD;
      management plan in Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the management plan prior to and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT will be recorded by&#xD;
      specific questionnaires and corresponding changes in management will be analyzed. The scan&#xD;
      will be used to see how the disease has spread. Both the treatment strategies and probable&#xD;
      disease outcomes as relevant to clinical endpoints will be assessed. This study is open to&#xD;
      Veterans only.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT on initial and subsequent treatment strategies of patients with prostate cancer. This study uses questionnaires completed by the referring physician. A pre-scan questionnaire , a post-scan questionnaire and a follow-up questionnaire will be used to determine whether 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT affected intended treatment strategies and whether these intended treatment strategies were finally implemented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who fulfill criteria for initial staging or restaging as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Initial treatment strategy decisions (initial staging)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  All participants with histologically proven prostate cancer or strong suspicion&#xD;
                  of prostate adenocarcinoma based on very high PSA levels (&gt;50 ng/mL) who require&#xD;
                  an initial treatment/management decision who may be candidate for any of the&#xD;
                  following strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  A) Surgery B) External radiation therapy (RT) C) Other focal therapies D)&#xD;
                  Systemic medical treatment E) Watchful waiting&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Assessment for Subsequent treatment strategy (restaging), any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) Participants with biochemical recurrence who are potential candidates for any salvage&#xD;
        treatment. Biochemical recurrence is defined by rising PSA after definitive therapy with&#xD;
        prostatectomy or radiation therapy, as any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Post radical prostatectomy (RP): PSA equals to or greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more&#xD;
             than 6 weeks after RP&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Post-radiation therapy : Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA B)&#xD;
             Participants with known prostate cancer who undergo restaging because of new symptoms&#xD;
             C) Participants with known metastatic prostate cancer who undergo restaging because of&#xD;
             rising PSA with negative or inconclusive conventional imaging D) Participants with&#xD;
             known prostate cancer who are treated medically or with RLT in whom response to&#xD;
             treatment is assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Capability to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Able to remain still for duration of each imaging procedure (about 30 minutes) *&#xD;
                  Participants may be reenrolled in the study, if 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT is performed&#xD;
                  for subsequent management decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 18 years-old at the time of radiotracer administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging&#xD;
             examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating&#xD;
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere&#xD;
             with study compliance.&#xD;
