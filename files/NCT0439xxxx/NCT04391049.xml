      This phase I trial studies the side effects of OBP-301 when given together with carboplatin,&#xD;
      paclitaxel, and radiation therapy in treating patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal&#xD;
      cancer that invades local or regional structures. OBP-301 is a virus that has been designed&#xD;
      to infect and destroy tumor cells (although there is a small risk that it can also infect&#xD;
      normal cells). Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving OBP-301 with chemotherapy and radiation therapy&#xD;
      may work better than standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the addition of OBP-301 to chemoradiation with carboplatin/paclitaxel is&#xD;
      safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess toxicities associated with the addition of OBP-301 to chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the number of clinical complete responses (cCR). III. To assess the number of&#xD;
      patients alive/without progression (progression-free survival [PFS]) and the number of&#xD;
      patients alive (overall survival [OS]) at 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To report correlate outcomes - cCR, PFS and OS - with immune and virus-based correlative&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate an initial dose of OBP-301 and a de-escalated dose, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive OBP-301 by intratumoral injection via endoscopy on days -3, 12, and 26.&#xD;
      Patients also receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over&#xD;
      60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, and undergo radiation therapy on Monday through&#xD;
      Friday beginning day 1 for 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks. All treatment continues in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 6-8 weeks, then every&#xD;
      3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
