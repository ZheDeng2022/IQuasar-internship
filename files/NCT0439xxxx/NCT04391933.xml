      The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether magnetic ressonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      can be used in treatment planning with assessment of diagnostic accuracy. With the inclusion&#xD;
      of 150 patients the study will investigate whether MRI is useful and better than CT scanning&#xD;
      in patients with colon tumors. And also if MRI is useful after neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is a frequent disease in Denmark with over 3200 new cases and about 1350 deaths&#xD;
      per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scanning is currently the national standard method for determining the stage of disease&#xD;
      planning for treatment. CT scan can sufficiently distinct between minor and advanced colon&#xD;
      tumors. Prevalence of advanced tumors was well over 40% in the CT study from Vejle Hospital&#xD;
      in 2013. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of advanced colon tumors in the CT study&#xD;
      was approx. 70% and 80%, respectively. A small MRI pilot study showed higher sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of 89% and 96%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan is currently performed in most patients with rectal cancer, which has resulted in&#xD;
      better treatment planning and increased survival. MRI scan of the rectum is documented with&#xD;
      higher accuracy than CT scan. There has been reluctance to introduce MRI scan in patients&#xD;
      with colon cancer, as the colon has more peristalsis than the rectum, and movement of the&#xD;
      bowel can result in image quality reduction in MRI. However, in recent years MRI has become&#xD;
      faster and thereby less sensitive to movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning may in the future help to select the patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, with MRI it is possible to perform MRI diffusion measurements of the&#xD;
      tumor, which gives an estimate of the tumor's cell density. It will also be possible to&#xD;
      investigate whether this changes the MRI diffusion restriction during the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is prospective and uses state of the art equipment with a 3 tesla MRI unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to investigate whether MRI can be used in treatment planning&#xD;
      with assessment of diagnostic accuracy. With the inclusion of 150 patients the study&#xD;
      investigates whether MRI is useful and better than CT in patients with colon tumors. And also&#xD;
      if MRI is useful after neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
