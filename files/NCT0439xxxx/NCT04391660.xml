  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral venous catheter is the most commonly used medical device in the hospital&#xD;
      setting. Infectious complications are infrequent, bacterial or fungal, and local or systemic&#xD;
      (catheter-related bacteremia). The latter prolong the length of hospitalization and increase&#xD;
      the cost of care and mortality. For peripheral venous catheters, the risk of catheter-related&#xD;
      bacteremia is lower (0.2-0.7 episodes per 1000 catheter days) than for other intravascular&#xD;
      devices. However, the much higher number of peripheral venous catheters used explains a total&#xD;
      number of infections close to that of other catheters. Colonization is usually the&#xD;
      preliminary step to catheter infection. It is far more common than infection. Skin&#xD;
      disinfection prior to catheter insertion is therefore essential to prevent this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Chlorhexidine or Povidone Iodine in alcoholic solution is recommended before&#xD;
      insertion of a peripheral venous catheter. Although rare, allergies may contraindicate these&#xD;
      antiseptics. The widespread use of antiseptics in recent years for hand disinfection,&#xD;
      mouthwashes or body baths could increase the risk of the development of strains that have&#xD;
      become less sensitive, or even resistant, to currently available antiseptics. Allergies and&#xD;
      reduced sensitivity require the search for alternatives to currently available solutions.&#xD;
      Sodium hypochlorite is used to disinfect mucous membranes or healthy skin before an invasive&#xD;
      procedure in children under 30 months of age. Very few studies have evaluated its efficacy in&#xD;
      adults for this same indication, despite the fact that it was the first antiseptic used to&#xD;
      prevent infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to estimate the colonization rate of peripheral venous catheters&#xD;
      after skin disinfection with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (Dakin®) alone or preceded by an&#xD;
      application of 70% ethanol.&#xD;
