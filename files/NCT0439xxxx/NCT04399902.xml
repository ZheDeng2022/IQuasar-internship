    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of using thermal blankets to actively warm massively&#xD;
      bleeding trauma patients at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. It is hypothesized that either&#xD;
      full thermal blankets or half thermal blankets will be a feasible intervention to implement&#xD;
      for the care of massively bleeding trauma patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia (core body temperature of &lt;36˚C), is a strong risk factor for mortality and poor&#xD;
      outcomes in trauma patients due to its negative hemostatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and&#xD;
      renal effects. Current evidence has reported that massively bleeding hypothermic trauma&#xD;
      patients have higher odds of mortality in the first 24 hours of hospital admission, increased&#xD;
      length of stay, and increased need for transfusion. Standard hospital blankets are used to&#xD;
      passively warm patients through resuscitation and treatment until arrival to the ICU.&#xD;
      Interventions such as active heating through thermal blankets should be considered to prevent&#xD;
      and treat hypothermia upon arrival of patients than standard warmed hospital blankets to&#xD;
      prevent deleterious outcomes in this population.&#xD;

At all times, clinicians should ensure that the study blanket does not touch the patient's bare skin.The blanket will remain on the patient through their path of care, and removed from the patient at arrival to the ICU/final phase of care, or if the patient temperature exceeds 38˚C at any point.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any trauma patient requiring activation of the massive hemorrhage protocol (life-&#xD;
             threatening bleeding situation requiring mobilization of blood bank, laboratory and&#xD;
             clinical resources, and anticipated need for at least 4 units of red blood cells&#xD;
             immediately and component therapy) during the hours when research staff are available.&#xD;
             Normothermic (core body temperature between 36˚C or greater) will also be included, as&#xD;
             core body temperature drops once resuscitation is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypothermic patients (temperature ≤ 35˚C) to whom MHP is NOT activated, when Dr. Luis&#xD;
             da Luz/trauma fellow is on call as Trauma Team Leader will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who die in the trauma bay&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients excluded at the discretion of the TTL based on use of the blanket not&#xD;
             appearing feasible given the sustained injuries, multiple procedures being conducted&#xD;
             in the trauma, or patients who seem to have unsurvivable injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients admitted during study off-hours.&#xD;
