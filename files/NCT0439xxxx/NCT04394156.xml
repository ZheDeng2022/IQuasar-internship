  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the use of a simple cognitive task for&#xD;
      decreasing the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events experienced by refugees and&#xD;
      asylum seekers with a diagnosis of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) currently living in&#xD;
      the UK. The intervention includes a memory reminder cue, a 10-minute time gap and then around&#xD;
      20 minutes playing the mobile phone game Tetris, using mental rotation instructions. The&#xD;
      study will have a multiple baseline case-series design (AB), with a randomised duration of&#xD;
      baseline length up to three weeks. Thus, participants will complete a no-intervention phase&#xD;
      of up to three weeks, followed by an intervention phase. Please see the intervention section&#xD;
      for more details about the intervention sessions. Follow ups are conducted after each week to&#xD;
      monitor the frequency of intrusive memories of trauma in a pen-and-paper diary. It is&#xD;
      predicted that participants will report fewer intrusive memories after receiving the&#xD;
      intervention than in the preceding baseline phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted at a specialist National Health Service (NHS) mental health&#xD;
      service for refugees, asylum seekers and forced migrants suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD). We aim to recruit up to 13 participants from this service to take part in&#xD;
      the study, which is an extension of a pilot study previously conducted. Due to the Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic, guidance from the trust R&amp;D and NHS service manager states that face-to-face&#xD;
      appointments should not currently take place at the NHS clinical recruitment site. Therefore,&#xD;
      until this guidance changes, the research will take place remotely via video calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a multiple baseline case-series design (AB), with a randomised duration&#xD;
      of baseline length up to three weeks. At the start of the baseline phase, participants will&#xD;
      create, with the help of the researcher, a list of their most frequent and distressing&#xD;
      intrusive memories of trauma. Each intrusive memory will be given a label (for example; a&#xD;
      letter, colour or symbol) so that the frequency of each intrusive memory can be monitored in&#xD;
      a pen and paper diary. The frequency of specific intrusive memories the person experiences&#xD;
      after they have received the intervention will be compared with the frequency of specific&#xD;
      intrusive memories they had during the baseline phase. For each specific intrusion the period&#xD;
      prior to that intrusion being targeted in an intervention session will be the baseline phase&#xD;
      (A); therefore, the baseline phase will include the minimum baseline duration (lasting up to&#xD;
      three weeks) plus the additional weeks in which the specific intrusion remained untargeted by&#xD;
      the intervention. The post intervention phase (B) will be the time after the specific&#xD;
      intrusion was targeted. Some intrusive memories on the list may not be targeted by the&#xD;
      intervention but will be monitored (through the intrusion diary) throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the study for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a follow-up to a study conducted in Sweden with refugees. ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      Identifier: NCT03760601&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is extending previous research to refugees and asylum seekers with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      PTSD, accessing a secondary care mental health service and living in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2-weeks post-intervention and 2-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A brief bespoke measure of concentration adapted from that used previously with refugees (Holmes et al., 2017). It has three questions about disruption to concentration from intrusive memories. A higher score on each question means a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Within the baseline phase, measurements of the primary outcome measure (frequency of intrusive memories of trauma) will be collected in a pen-and-paper diary for up to three weeks (dependent on baseline length). Individual baseline phases will be used as control periods.&#xD;
In the intervention phase the participant will be offered around five intervention sessions with a researcher. Each session the participant will choose which intrusive memory they would like to focus on and the cognitive task will be completed. The intervention includes a memory reminder cue, a 10-minute time gap and then around 20 minutes playing the mobile phone game Tetris, using mental rotation instructions. Participants will be given instructions to continue to use the technique self-guided in the subsequent week. Measurements of the primary outcome measure (frequency of intrusive memories of trauma) will be collected in a pen-and-paper diary.</description>
