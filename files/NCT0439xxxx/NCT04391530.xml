      Introduction Public Speaking Anxiety (PSA), also referred to as public speaking anxiety, is a&#xD;
      costly (Lépine, 2002) and disabling fear (Blöte et al., 2009), with prevalence rates ranging&#xD;
      from 21 (Pollard and Henderson, 1988) to 33% (Stein et al., 1996; D'El Rey and Pacini, 2005)&#xD;
      in community samples. FoPS has been reported as the single most commonly feared situation in&#xD;
      both university and community samples (Pollard and Henderson, 1988; Holt et al., 1992; Stein&#xD;
      et al., 1996; Tillfors and Furmark, 2007).EFT is an energy psychotherapy derivative&#xD;
      application consisting of cognitive and somatic components used to improve personal negative&#xD;
      emotions and related emotional and physical ailments.It is reported that the most recognized&#xD;
      and used EFT among Energy Therapies is an effective method especially on anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      burnout, stress management, and fears (Feinstein 2008; Irmak Vural &amp; Aslan, 2018; Sezgin,&#xD;
      2017; Sezgin &amp; Özcan, 2009).Breatihin therapy is another one. Purpose of the study The&#xD;
      current study aims to determine the effect of the Breath Therapy and Emotional Freedom&#xD;
      Technique on public speaking anxiety in Turkish Nursing Students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate two research hypotheses as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Emotional freedom technique is effective in reducing public speaking anxiety H2: Breath&#xD;
      Therapy is effective in reducing public speaking anxiety A randomized controlled experimental&#xD;
      research design will be used. The study complied with the guidelines of the Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. The data will be collected with&#xD;
      demographic information form, Subjective Discomfort Unit Scale, The State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory, and Speech Anxiety Scale.demographic information form: This form contains 5&#xD;
      questions including the age, gender, economic status, place of residence of students in the&#xD;
      form developed by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale SUDS. It was developed by Wolpe (1970). This scale,&#xD;
      which is used in energy therapies and evaluates the individual's own discomfort, is scored&#xD;
      between 0 and 10. 0 no discomfort 10 is considered to be unbearable discomfort (Wolpe, 1973).&#xD;
      The individual should evaluate the discomfort he feels at that moment and give a score. This&#xD;
      score serves as a concrete and basic starting point for the patient's condition at the time&#xD;
      of application and reflects the change at the end of the application. According to the&#xD;
      Church; EFT; Individuals' discomfort assessments are made using the Subjective Units of&#xD;
      Disturbance (SUD) scale used by Wolpe (Church, 2013a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      he State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Tx-1 and Tx-2) It was developed by Spilberg et al to&#xD;
      detect the state and trait anxiety levels of individuals. Its validity and reliability in&#xD;
      Turkish was done by Öner and Lecompte. The scale consists of a total of 40 questions, 20&#xD;
      questions of state anxiety and 20 questions of constant anxiety. State anxiety scale; to&#xD;
      state how the person feels at any time and under any circumstances; It is asked to answer&#xD;
      taking into account the feeling related to the situation. On the scale of trait anxiety; one&#xD;
      is often expected to interpret how he feels. There are positive and negative expressions on&#xD;
      the scale. These statements; are expressed as plain and inverted expressions. Straight&#xD;
      expressions, negative emotions; reversed statements reflect positive emotions. There are 8&#xD;
      reversed statements on the state anxiety scale and 7 on the trait anxiety scale. Items on the&#xD;
      state anxiety scale 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19, 20, and on the trait anxiety scale&#xD;
      1,6,7,10,13,16,19. items are reversed statements. The emotions, thoughts and behaviors stated&#xD;
      in the state anxiety scale are answered as 1: none, 4: completely according to the violence&#xD;
      level of the experiences. Feelings, thoughts and behaviors stated in the trait anxiety scale&#xD;
      are also marked as 1-almost never, 4-almost always according to the frequency level. For both&#xD;
      scales; 0-19 points (none), 20-39 points (mild), 40-59 points (moderate), 60- 79 points&#xD;
      (severe), 80 points and above are considered as very severe anxiety. Cronbach alpha value of&#xD;
      the state anxiety scale was 0.93; The Cronbach alpha value of the trait anxiety scale is 0.94&#xD;
      (Öner, 1998). In the present study, Cronbach's alpha value was found to be 0.81 for the STAI&#xD;
      Tx-1 and 0.76 for the STAI Tx-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech Anxiety Scale (CUR): It was developed by Yaman and Sofu (2013) to evaluate students'&#xD;
      speech anxiety levels. The scale consisting of 25 items is scored as 5-point Likert type and&#xD;
      1: strongly disagree, 4: strongly agree. In the scale, items 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 and 14 are&#xD;
      reversed. A high score indicates that the person's anxiety to speak is high. Cronbach alpha&#xD;
      value of the scale was found to be 0.79. In this study, Cronbach alpha value is 0.78.&#xD;

      The criteria for inclusion in the research are a) being 18 years of age and over b) not&#xD;
      having any psychiatric diagnosis c) not having taken a course or lesson about coping with&#xD;
      anxiety and stress d) not speaking before the community e) volunteering to participate in the&#xD;
      study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The study will be carried out before the presentations on the prevention of chronic&#xD;
      diseases within the scope of the Chronic Diseases course. 3 separate halls will be set up for&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups to make their presentations. Students will start working&#xD;
      after being taken to the halls set up for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information form, Subjective Discomfort Unit Scale (SUD), STAI-I and STAI-II and&#xD;
      Speech Anxiety scales will be applied to the students in the EFT intervention group. Later,&#xD;
      information about the EFT method to be used within the scope of the research will be given.&#xD;
      One EFT session (25 minutes) was held once. After applying SUD, STAI-I and STAI-II and Speech&#xD;
      Anxiety scales as a final test, students in the EFT group will make their speeches in front&#xD;
      of the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information form, Subjective Discomfort Unit Scale (SUD), STAI-I and STAI-II and&#xD;
      Speech Anxiety scales will be applied to the students in the breathing exercise intervention&#xD;
      group. Later, information will be given about the breathing exercise method to be used in the&#xD;
      research. Students will be given one breathing exercise session (25 minutes). After applying&#xD;
      SUD, STAI-I and STAI-II and Speech Anxiety scales as the final test, students in the&#xD;
      breathing exercise group will have their speeches in front of the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information form, Subjective Discomfort Unit Scale (SUD), STAI-I and STAI-II and&#xD;
      Speech Anxiety scales were applied to the students in the control group. No intervention was&#xD;
      made to the students in the control group. 25 minutes after the pretest application, SUD,&#xD;
      STAI-I and STAI-II and Speech Anxiety scales were applied as posttest. Then the students in&#xD;
      the control group made their speeches in front of the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFT tapping: the basic recipe The EFT application will be implemented by the researcher who&#xD;
      has been trained in this subject, in the most quiet and calm environment possible, in a&#xD;
      position where the individuals are comfortable. There are basic steps to be followed in EFT&#xD;
      application. Thought Field Therapy (TFT), developed by Callahan, based on Craig, uses&#xD;
      different click points for specific psychological conditions, while EFT has 12 energy click&#xD;
      points in the same specified order to treat every emotional problem, It is called 'Basic&#xD;
      Recipe' (Craig, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While applying the Basic Recipe, the following steps are followed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determination of SUD level (Student makes the scoring of the problem he feels on the&#xD;
           scale between zero and ten points.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Installation (The general structure is &quot;I accept myself deeply and completely despite&#xD;
           this ……….&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clicking the meridian points in order (The points given in Figure 2 are clicked.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nine Gamut procedures (Some eye movements, murmurs and counts are made while clicking on&#xD;
           the Gamut point in hand.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clicking the meridian points in order again&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Control of differentiation at the level of discomfort with SUD again (Craig, 2004;&#xD;
           Church, 2004; Craig, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing the batting series: With the index finger and middle finger, EFT points (Figure&#xD;
      2) are struck without hurt but with precise strokes. EFT points are the end points of the&#xD;
      energy meridians. These endpoints are close to the surface of the body and are therefore more&#xD;
      easily accessible than other buried points. Strikes at EFT points compensate for any possible&#xD;
      disorders. At each point, the problem statement is repeated aloud (if possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing therapy: the basic recipe After applying pre-test forms to students, the hall will&#xD;
      be quiet and dim. In this study, breathing exercise application will be performed in three&#xD;
      stages as (1) relax, (2) deep breath and (3) feel yourself. Relaxing music including bird&#xD;
      sounds and water sounds will be used to ensure the concentration and focus of the&#xD;
      participants. It will be said to breathe deeply and feel it&#xD;
