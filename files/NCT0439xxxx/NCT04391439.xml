  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High doses of intravenous (iv.) glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used as a treatment for&#xD;
      many autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. According to the European Group on Graves'&#xD;
      Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) guidelines, intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) is an accepted&#xD;
      first-line agent for active, moderate-to-severe and very severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO).&#xD;
      This treatment is proven to be more efficient and safer than oral GCs. However, some patients&#xD;
      may experience adverse cardiovascular effects during the administration of iv. GCs, which in&#xD;
      rare cases may even be fatal. There are limited data, mostly obtained from case reports,&#xD;
      reporting the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction or heart&#xD;
      failure. Increased heart rhythm (HR) has drawn attention of researchers as a possible adverse&#xD;
      effect correlated with IVMP. During this study, investigators performed 72-hours of Holter&#xD;
      ECG and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to evaluate the impact of IVMP on&#xD;
      patients with moderate-to-severe GO, concerning HR and blood pressure (BP) changes. In order&#xD;
      to elucidate possible mechanism of observed changes, researchers investigated the level of&#xD;
      potassium in serum and urine and catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) in serum. All&#xD;
      patients were treated routinely according to EUGOGO recommendations with standard doses of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone with standard recommended schedule. Inclusion criterion for the therapy&#xD;
      was according to EUGOGO guidelines active, moderate-to-severe and active GO (12 pulses of&#xD;
      IVMP 6x0.5g followed by 6x0.25g every week).&#xD;

      The clinical status of patients was evaluated before each pulse, including blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring, glucose level monitoring and symptoms of infection. HR and BP was measured&#xD;
      continuously for 3 consecutive days (the day before, the day of IVMP and the day after IVMP)&#xD;
      during 1st, 6th and 12th IVMP pulse, using 24-hour Holter ECG and ABMP. Serum laboratory&#xD;
      tests for potassium, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured 3 times the day before and&#xD;
      the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the second and sixth day after 1st IVMP. Additionally,&#xD;
      urine samples for potassium were collected 5 times the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the&#xD;
      second and sixth day after 1st IVMP.&#xD;
