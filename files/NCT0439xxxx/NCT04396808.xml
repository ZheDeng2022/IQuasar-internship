    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the clinical impact of Gene Expression Classifier (GEC) testing&#xD;
      in prostate cancer care while also developing a pragmatic approach for improved GEC clinical&#xD;
      use and future study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in this study have received or will receive a score from the Michigan Urological&#xD;
      Surgery Improvement Collaborative's Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (askMUSIC) scoring&#xD;
      system, at the time of enrollment. AskMUSIC is a risk calculator based on standard clinical&#xD;
      and pathologic variables and is generally included as part of routine clinical care. The&#xD;
      variables used in the risk calculator are prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score,&#xD;
      number of positive core biopsies, number of negative core biopsies, and clinical stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either an intervention arm or a control arm. In the control&#xD;
      arm, the treating provider will review the askMUSIC score with the patient. In the&#xD;
      intervention arm, the treating provider will review the askMUSIC and the GEC score with the&#xD;
      patient. Biopsies obtained during the course of standard clinical care will be analyzed using&#xD;
      one of the following GECs: Decipher, Prolaris or Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score. No&#xD;
      additional biopsies will be obtained as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the results, patients and their treating physicians will decide on a&#xD;
      management strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up will be tracked through the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement&#xD;
      Collaborative (MUSIC) registry.&#xD;
