  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical significance of low pressure&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum during robotically assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic and robotic surgery has revolutionized post-operative outcomes across surgical&#xD;
      specialties. However, the use of pneumoperitoneum comes with known risks given the change in&#xD;
      physiological parameters that accompany its utilization. The effects of increased&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure on cardiopulmonary function has been well documented. Increased&#xD;
      pressure on the large vessels may lead to decreased cardiac output and thereby decreased&#xD;
      blood flow to various organ systems and cause irreversible damage. Some studies have&#xD;
      advocated lower pressures to further optimize cardiopulmonary parameters. McDougall, et. al,&#xD;
      for instance, demonstrated a significant reduction in oliguria when pressures of 10mm Hg were&#xD;
      used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of using lower pressure&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum in the abdominal cavity during RARP. The investigators hypothesize that low&#xD;
      pressure pneumoperitoneum has a multitude of clinical benefits due to improved physiologic&#xD;
      parameters including a reduction in the occurrence of post-operative ileus, reduced need for&#xD;
      narcotics post operatively, and a decrease in cardiopulmonary complications. A previously&#xD;
      completed study concluded a reduction in post-operative ileus at a pneumoperitoneum pressure&#xD;
      of 8 mm Hg vs 12 mm Hg. This new study will evaluate the standard pneumoperitoneum pressure&#xD;
      of 15 mm Hg vs 12 mm Hg in order to validate the previous study vs the standard&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective randomized blinded cohort study. Patients who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be randomly assigned to undergo RARP at a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 15mm Hg&#xD;
      or 12mm Hg. This will be done by computer generated randomization protocol. Surgeon and&#xD;
      patients will be blinded to the pneumoperitoneum pressure used. A cover will be placed over&#xD;
      the insufflation system so that the surgeon(s) are not able to visualize the pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      used during the procedure. The remainder of the procedure will be carried out based on&#xD;
      current standard of care. All patients will be admitted post operatively and the same&#xD;
      standardized orderset in EPIC EHR will be used for all patients in order to control for other&#xD;
      factors, such as opioid use, to control for confounders.&#xD;
