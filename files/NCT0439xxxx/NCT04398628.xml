  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In parallel with the growth of American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network's (ATHN) clinical&#xD;
      studies, the number of new therapies for all congenital and acquired hematologic conditions,&#xD;
      not just those for bleeding and clotting disorders, is increasing significantly. Some of the&#xD;
      recently FDA-approved therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic conditions have yet&#xD;
      to demonstrate long-term safety and effectiveness. In addition, results from well-controlled,&#xD;
      pivotal studies often cannot be replicated once a therapy has been approved for general&#xD;
      use.(1,2,3,4) In 2019 alone, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued&#xD;
      approvals for twenty-four new therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic&#xD;
      conditions.(5) In addition, almost 10,000 new studies for hematologic diseases are currently&#xD;
      registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov.(6) With this explosion of potential new therapies on&#xD;
      the horizon, it is imperative that clinicians and clinical researchers in the field of&#xD;
      non-neoplastic hematology have a uniform, secure, unbiased, and enduring method to collect&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy data. As emphasized in a recently published review, accurate,&#xD;
      uniform and quality national data collection is critical in clinical research, particularly&#xD;
      for longitudinal cohort studies covering a lifetime of biologic risk.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this longitudinal, observational study is to characterize the&#xD;
      safety, effectiveness and practice of treatments for all people with congenital and acquired&#xD;
      hematologic disorders in the US.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, natural history observational cohort study being conducted at&#xD;
      approximately 150 ATHN-affiliated sites. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 15&#xD;
      years. Harmonized data elements will be collected at time of enrollment, quarterly, ad hoc,&#xD;
      and annually. Base data to be collected for all participants. Specific data will be collected&#xD;
      for participants enrolled in cohort-specific Arms and Modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned in a single cohort: Hemophilia, Von Willebrand Disease,&#xD;
      Congenital Platelet Disorder, Rare Bleeding Disorders, Bleeding not otherwise specified&#xD;
      (NOS), Thrombosis/Thrombophilia, or Non-Neoplastic Hematologic Conditions. The cohort for&#xD;
      which a participant qualifies will be determined by the site Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms and study Modules may be developed to provision disease and/or disease specific&#xD;
      insights related to stakeholders, including but not limited to pharmaceutical companies,&#xD;
      ATHN, and Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Arms may branch off into product-specific data&#xD;
      collection via Modules to be collected during the study, in conjunction with planned study&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  At Study Exit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional as per any modules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing will be optional and provided by central labs, as funding allows, across all&#xD;
