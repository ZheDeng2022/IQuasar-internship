    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well brachytherapy with durvalumab or&#xD;
      tremelimumab work for the treatment of gynecological malignancies that is resistant to&#xD;
      platinum therapy (platinum-resistant), does not respond to treatment (refractory), has come&#xD;
      back (recurrent), or has spread to other places in body (metastatic). Brachytherapy, also&#xD;
      known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a&#xD;
      tumor to kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial is being done to see whether&#xD;
      brachytherapy with durvalumab or tremelimumab works better in treating patients with&#xD;
      gynecological malignancies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of the treatment combination consisting of brachytherapy and&#xD;
      tremelimumab. (Safety lead-in) II. To determine the median progression-free survival with&#xD;
      brachytherapy and checkpoint inhibition with either durvalumab or tremelimumab. (Dose&#xD;
      expansion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy of brachytherapy and durvalumab or brachytherapy and tremelimumab&#xD;
      in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Local control of the irradiated tumor. Ib. Overall response rate. Ic. Response at&#xD;
      non-irradiated lesions in subjects with multiple sites of disease subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. Duration of response. Ie. Disease specific survival. If. Overall survival. II. To further&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of brachytherapy with durvalumab and brachytherapy with&#xD;
      tremelimumab (expansion cohorts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the immunologic changes associated with the combination of brachytherapy with&#xD;
      durvalumab and brachytherapy with tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      then undergo brachytherapy on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 fractions in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive tremelimumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      brachytherapy on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 fractions in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>PFS will be estimated in each study arm by Kaplan-Meier estimate, where PFS is a composite endpoint based on radiologic progression, clinical deterioration or death. Furthermore, log rank test will be used to test if there is significant difference in PFS between two arms. In addition, PFS will be also estimated for localized subjects and metastatic subjects separately within each arm and stratified log rank test will be used as well.</description>

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be as determined by RECIST v 1.1. The ORR will be defined as the number (%) of subjects with at least 1 visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR. Subjects who go off treatment without progression receive a subsequent therapy, and then responds will not be included as responders in the ORR. The overall response rate will also be compared between treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Duration of response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as the time from the date of the first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death. The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.1 PFS endpoint. The time of initial response will be defined as the latest of dates contributing towards the first visit response of CR or PR. If a subject does not progress following a response, then their DoR will be censored at the PFS censoring time. DoR will not be defined for those subjects who do not have a documented response.</description>

             start of treatment. Brain metastases will not be recorded as RECIST target lesions at&#xD;
             baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;= 470 ms&#xD;
             calculated from 3 electrocardiogram (ECG)s (within 15 minutes at 5 minutes apart)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For durvalumab monotherapy and durvalumab + tremelimumab combination studies this&#xD;
                  criterion can be removed. For durvalumab +/- tremelimumab in combination with an&#xD;
                  agent with pro-arrhythmic potential or where effect of the combination on QT is&#xD;
                  not known if this criterion should be retained. Subject safety and the cardiac&#xD;
                  SKG should be consulted as needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB) testing&#xD;
             in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV]&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined&#xD;
             as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are&#xD;
             eligible. Subjects positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra&#xD;
                  articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:&#xD;
             Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;
             30 days after the last dose of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female subjects of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from&#xD;
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or180 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior randomization or treatment in a previous durvalumab and/or tremelimumab clinical&#xD;
             study regardless of treatment arm assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determined by the investigator that the subject is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the subject is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IP or any excipient&#xD;
