  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy-drinking smokers, including those with alcohol use disorder (AUD), are at increased&#xD;
      risk for numerous negative health outcomes relative to those who use alcohol or cigarettes&#xD;
      only. Although heavy-drinking smokers are recognized as an important subgroup for clinical&#xD;
      and public health interventions, there are presently no approved medications for the joint&#xD;
      indication of alcohol reduction and smoking cessation. Based on evidence that the serotonin&#xD;
      system plays a role in alcohol and nicotine consumption and relapse, this study aims to&#xD;
      examine whether a serotonin medication alters alcohol and nicotine responses in smokers with&#xD;
      AUD, informing its potential utility as a candidate therapy for this clinical subgroup.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacotherapy development remains a critical objective for reducing health and societal&#xD;
      burdens associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Developing targeted treatments for&#xD;
      specific AUD subgroups is a key objective. Among those with AUD, cigarette smokers comprise a&#xD;
      sizable and critical subgroup with disproportionally high long-term health risks, making it a&#xD;
      key priority to advance therapies for concurrent AUD and cigarette smoking. The serotonin&#xD;
      (5-hydroxtytryptamine; 5-HT) system is broadly implicated in addictive behaviors, in part&#xD;
      reflecting the role of 5-HT in modulating dopamine function. Preclinical studies of 5-HT&#xD;
      receptor drugs have shown that targeted modulation of the 5-HT2C receptor (implicated in&#xD;
      5-HT-related inhibition of DA function) alters the consumption and reinstatement of addictive&#xD;
      drugs, including alcohol and nicotine. Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists, lorcaserin&#xD;
      has superior near-term potential for repurposing as an AUD therapy, having been approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration for weight management. Human laboratory medication trials&#xD;
      offer a time- and cost-effective option for validating preclinical findings prior to larger&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, and for testing candidate treatment mechanisms. This Phase II&#xD;
      human laboratory screening trial will evaluate lorcaserin as a novel candidate therapy for&#xD;
      smokers with AUD. Effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo will be evaluated in a double-blind,&#xD;
      within-subjects, crossover study with human laboratory endpoints. This study will provide&#xD;
      early human data on the effects of a 5-HT2C receptor agonist in relation to alcohol-related&#xD;
      outcomes, informing its potential for further evaluation as a candidate treatment for AUD.&#xD;
