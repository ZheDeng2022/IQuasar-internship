      Tenofovir is a nucleotide analog drug that works against both Human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) and HBV. TDF and TAF are prodrug of Tenofovir. TAF has a higher plasma stability than&#xD;
      TDF, which makes TDF require a higher dose to get the concentration of drugs in the liver&#xD;
      equal to the amount of TAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown the effects of TAF once daily and TDF once daily on kidney&#xD;
      function and bone mass. The efficacy of TAF in virus suppression is comparable to TDF, but&#xD;
      the effect on the kidneys and bone mass from TAF has less side effects than TDF. In addition,&#xD;
      changing the medication from TDF to TAF shows that kidney function tends to improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis B patients taking TDF have adjusted their dosage due to impair renal function, for&#xD;
      example, from 1 time per day to every 48 hours or every 72 hours. This group of patients does&#xD;
      not have a clear evidence-based recommendation for choosing a reduced dose of TDF or change&#xD;
      to TAF. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to study patients with hepatitis B who&#xD;
      have taken TDF and have renal function impairment that have been adjusted. Taking the same&#xD;
      medicine with dose adjustment or changing the drug to TAF which treatment will more improve&#xD;
      the kidney function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus is a global public health problem. More than 250 million people are&#xD;
      infected worldwide. These infections lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer.&#xD;
      According to past statistics, infection with hepatitis B virus is an important factor of&#xD;
      death in 880,000 patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receiving natural immunity or receiving antiretroviral therapy that loss of&#xD;
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg loss) reduce the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC). HBsAg loss is now considered the target of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nucleot(s)ide is an antiviral drug that can reduce the number of viruses, reduce the risk of&#xD;
      HCC and death from Hepatitis B viral infection. The most widely used drugs are Lamivudine&#xD;
      (LMV), Entecavir (ETV), Tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).&#xD;
      However, Nucleotide is unable to eliminate the Hepatitis B virus from the liver cells of the&#xD;
      infected person due to covalently closed. circular DNA (cccDNA), which is a template for&#xD;
      viral replication. Therefore, long-term Nucleotide therapy is necessary. As a result,&#xD;
      patients may have side effects from the treatment when taking medication for a long time,&#xD;
      such as viral resistance in Lamivudine, deterioration of kidney function and osteoporosis in&#xD;
      Tenofovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir is a nucleotide analog drug that works against both Human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) and HBV. TDF and TAF are prodrug of Tenofovir. TAF has a higher plasma stability than&#xD;
      TDF, which makes TDF require a higher dose to get the concentration of drugs in the liver&#xD;
      equal to the amount of TAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The side effects of Tenofovir treatment found on the kidneys and bones which are problems for&#xD;
      long-term treatment. It is recommended to reduce the dose of TDF in patients with renal&#xD;
      function reduced to less than 50 ml / min as shown in Table but do not have to adjust the&#xD;
      dose of TAF except when the GFR value is less than 15 ml / min. it is recommended to stop&#xD;
      taking TAF if severe renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown the effects of TAF once daily and TDF once daily on kidney&#xD;
      function and bone mass. The efficacy of TAF in virus suppression is comparable to TDF, but&#xD;
      the effect on the kidneys and bone mass from TAF has less side effects than TDF. In addition,&#xD;
      changing the medication from TDF to TAF shows that kidney function tends to improve.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a recommendation in the practice guideline to change from TDF to TAF or&#xD;
      ETV in patients who use TDF and there is a risk of kidney problems or thin bone mass based on&#xD;
      history for LMV resistance (if LMV resistance, ETV should not be used because HBV is more&#xD;
      resistant to ETV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis B patients taking TDF have adjusted their dosage due to impair renal function, for&#xD;
      example, from 1 time per day to every 48 hours or every 72 hours. This group of patients does&#xD;
      not have a clear evidence-based recommendation for choosing a reduced dose of TDF or change&#xD;
      to TAF. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to study patients with hepatitis B who&#xD;
      have taken TDF and have renal function impairment that have been adjusted. Taking the same&#xD;
      medicine with dose adjustment or changing the drug to TAF which treatment will more improve&#xD;
      the kidney function.&#xD;
