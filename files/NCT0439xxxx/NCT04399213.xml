    <textblock>
      To determine the effective dose and the time course, the dermal blood flow response to&#xD;
      histamine will be evaluated at different doses (5 µg, 15 µg and 50 µg). Histamine will be&#xD;
      administered by a skin prick on the volar surface of subjects' forearm, alongside a negative&#xD;
      control. Changes in dermal blood flow will be measured with laser Doppler imaging at&#xD;
      different time points following the skin prick.&#xD;
