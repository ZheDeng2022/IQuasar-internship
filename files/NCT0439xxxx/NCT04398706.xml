      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of each SP0202 formulation and Prevnar 13 in toddlers and&#xD;
           infants (after each and any injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific IgG concentration) of the SP0202&#xD;
           formulations and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of one dose in toddlers&#xD;
           (Groups 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific IgG concentration) of the SP0202&#xD;
           formulations and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of 3 doses in infants&#xD;
           (Groups 5-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific IgG concentration) of the SP0202&#xD;
           formulations and Prevnar 13 1 month after administration of a 4-dose schedule in infants&#xD;
           (Groups 5-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific OPA titer) of the SP0202 formulations&#xD;
           and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of one dose in toddlers (Groups 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific OPA titer) of the SP0202 formulations&#xD;
           and Prevnar 13 1 month after the administration of 3 doses in a subset of infants&#xD;
           (Groups 5-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune response (serotype specific OPA titer) of the SP0202 formulations&#xD;
           and Prevnar 13 1 month after administration of a 4-dose schedule in a subset of infants&#xD;
           (Groups 5-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In toddlers: to describe the Ab responses against Pentacel antigens before and 1 month&#xD;
           following injection of Pentacel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In infants: to describe the Ab responses against antigens of the routine pediatric&#xD;
           vaccines (Pentacel, RotaTeq, ENGERIX-B, M-M-RII, and VARIVAX) when administered&#xD;
           concomitantly with either SP0202 or Prevnar 13 (at pre-Dose 1 (as applicable) for&#xD;
           RotaTeq, Diphteria, Tetanus and Pertussis antigens; at PD3 for ENGERIX-B, RotaTeq, and&#xD;
           Pentacel; at PD4 for M-M-RII and VARIVAX])&#xD;

      For toddlers, the duration of each participant's participation in the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 6 months for subjects enrolled in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For infants, the duration of each participant's participation in the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 16 to 19 months for subjects enrolled in Groups 5, 6, 7, and 8.&#xD;

Investigators and study staff who conduct the safety assessment and the participant will not know which vaccine is administered&#xD;
Only the study staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety evaluation will know which vaccine is administered This study will be observer-blinded between any SP0202 formulation and Prevnar 13 and double-blind across the 3 SP0202 formulations</masking_description>
