    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial. Implement instrumental&#xD;
      daily activities of daily living (A-IADL) in home rehabilitation. To explore the effect of&#xD;
      A-IADL on stroke patients' movement, cognition, social participation, daily life function and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

      Subjects were randomized to intervention group and control group. The experiment was designed&#xD;
      as randomized cross-over control trial. The primary outcome included 11 measures, Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment, Balance computerized adaptive testing, Mini Mental State Examination,&#xD;
      Participation Measure-3 Domains ,4 Dimensions, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure,&#xD;
      Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, Frenchay Activities Index, Lawnton Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living, stroke impact scale, Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and&#xD;
      Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale is an index to assess the sensorimotor impairment in individuals who have had stroke. The score ranges is 0 to 226. A higher score indicates better body function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance computerized adaptive testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Balance computerized adaptive testing is a test about stroke patients, includes movement, balance, activities of daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination general cognitive function. The score ranges is 0 to 30. A higher score indicates better general cognitive function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participation Measure-3 Domains ,4 Dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Participation Measure-3 Domains, 4 Dimensions assesses social participation. A higher score indicates better social participation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM protocol is divided into three areas: self-care, productivity, and leisure. Patients define important activities and classify them with a score of one to 10. A higher score indicates better occupational performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index (BI) -based Supplementary Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales assesses basic activities of daily living using three scales:actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty. The score ranges the three scales (i.e., actual performance, ability, and self-perceived difficulty)is 0-20, 0-18, and 0-20, respectively. A higher score indicates better basic activities of daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frenchay Activities Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Frenchay Activities Index is a measure of instrumental activities of daily living for use with patients recovering from stroke. The score ranges is 0 to 45. A higher score indicates better instrumental activities of daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lawnton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Lawnton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living assesses instrumental activities of daily living.The score ranges is 0 to 8. A higher score indicates better instrumental activities of daily living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale assesses other dimensions of health-related quality of life: emotion, communication, memory and thinking, and social role function.The score ranges is 59 to 295. A lower score indicates the quality of life less affected by stroke.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire is a self-report scale measuring self-efficacy judgments in specific domains of functioning post stroke. The score ranges is 0 to 130. A higher score indicates better self-efficacy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kingston Caregiver Stress Scale is a self-report scale measuring caregiver stress. The score ranges is 10 to 50. A higher score indicates greater stress.</description>
