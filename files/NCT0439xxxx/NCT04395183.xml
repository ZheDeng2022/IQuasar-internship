  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-armed clinical trial examining the effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan and creatine&#xD;
      monohydrate as augmenting agents for the treatment of depression. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      between 5-HTP + placebo, creatine + placebo, and 5-HTP + creatine, for 8 weeks. The ability&#xD;
      of the interventions to affect biomarkers associated with depression will be assessed using&#xD;
      brain phosophorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional connectivity imaging, and&#xD;
      plasma serotonin levels.&#xD;

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a lifetime prevalence of over 16%1 and is associated with&#xD;
      reduced work productivity,2 disability,3 increased mortality,4 and increased rates of suicide&#xD;
      attempts5 and completed suicides.6 Unfortunately, ~34% fail to respond to standard ADs&#xD;
      (ADs).7 Environmental and patient-level factors that increase the risk of MDD could pinpoint&#xD;
      novel mechanisms underlying the disorder. One such factor may be relative hypoxia. Persons&#xD;
      with hypoxic medical conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      are at higher risk of depression and suicide compared to those with other chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions.8-12 Smoking also promotes hypoxia13 and is linked to increased risks of suicide&#xD;
      and depression.14-16 Of special relevance to this study, living at high altitude produces&#xD;
      relative hypoxia even after months,17 and is linked to increased risks of suicide18-22 and&#xD;
      depression.23,24 Hypoxia could contribute to MDD in at least two ways. First, brain&#xD;
      bioenergetics are altered in both hypoxia and MDD. Hypoxia reduces several neurochemical&#xD;
      markers of brain activity, including phosphocreatine (PCr) and n-acetylaspartate (NAA),25 and&#xD;
      alters mitochondrial dynamics in the hippocampus.26,27 Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (1H-MRS) shows that high-altitude residents have altered whole brain pH and reduced inorganic&#xD;
      phosphate to total phosphate (tP) ratios compared to persons dwelling at sea-level.28 In&#xD;
      depressed patients, phosphorus MRS (31P-MRS) shows reduced nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)&#xD;
      concentrations and decreased PCr concentrations; AD response is associated with increases in&#xD;
      PCr and NTP.29 Hypoxia could also promote MDD by altering serotonin (5-HT) production.&#xD;
      Chronic hypoxia reduces 5-HT in the forebrain and brainstem in rodents.30 The conversion of&#xD;
      tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by tryptophan hydroxylase is oxygen-dependent and&#xD;
      slowed by hypoxia.31,32 Animal studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SSRIs) are not as effective at altitude,33 possibly because of inadequate 5-HT&#xD;
      production. Reductions in 5-HT synthesis and inefficiencies in bioenergetics could both&#xD;
      contribute to altered brain functional connectivity. MDD may disrupt cortical emotion&#xD;
      regulation,34 and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) studies suggest that&#xD;
      depression involves reduced connectivity between frontal cortical regions and the amygdala,35&#xD;
      while AD response correlates with normalization of those connections.36 Alterations in&#xD;
      connectivity associated with AD response are correlated with changes in brain metabolites,37&#xD;
      suggesting a link to brain bioenergetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This suggests two natural supplements as interventions for depression. Oral creatine&#xD;
      monohydrate (Cr) could improve bioenergetics in MDD, as Cr alters brain tCr, PCr, and NTP&#xD;
      levels.38 Moreover, Cr produces improvements in mood39 correlated with normalization of PCr&#xD;
      levels40 and structural connectivity.41 Alterations in 5-HT synthesis due to hypoxia could be&#xD;
      rectified by 5-HTP, as its conversion to 5-HT is not oxygen-dependent. 5-HTP elevates brain&#xD;
      5-HT levels and has AD efficacy in clinical trials.42 The proposed study is a two-phase,&#xD;
      three-armed trial to evaluate whether SSRI/SNRI augmentation with the supplements Cr, 5-HTP,&#xD;
      or their combination (5-HTP+Cr) can enhance AD response in treatment-resistant MDD. In the&#xD;
      R61 phase, the study will assess the ability of the interventions to alter biological&#xD;
      signatures associated with depression, as measured by 31P-MRS, fcMRI, and changes in whole&#xD;
      blood 5-HT. In the R33 phase, the study will attempt to replicate the above findings and&#xD;
      evaluate their correlation with clinical outcomes. The study will have the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1 (R61+R33): To identify 31P-MRS correlates of AD response in subjects with MDD&#xD;
           receiving Cr, 5-HTP, or 5-HTP+Cr. It is hypothesized that subjects' frontal cortical&#xD;
           metabolism will normalize compared to controls over 8 weeks in those receiving Cr or&#xD;
           5-HTP+Cr but not those receiving only 5-HTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2 (R61+R33): To identify resting state fcMRI correlates of AD response in subjects&#xD;
           with MDD receiving Cr, 5-HTP, or 5-HTP+Cr. It is hypothesized that resting functional&#xD;
           connectivity in prefrontal regions will normalize (with improvement in hypoconnectivity&#xD;
           between subgenual cingulate cortex and the remaining brain) over 8 weeks in all&#xD;
           treatment groups compared to controls, with the greatest changes in the 5-HTP+Cr group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3 (R61+R33: To characterize changes in whole blood 5-HT levels in study&#xD;
           participants. It is hypothesized that whole blood 5-HT will increase over 8 weeks in&#xD;
           subjects receiving 5-HTP or 5-HTP+Cr, but not those receiving only Cr.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 4 (R33): To describe changes in HAM-D scores in study participants randomized&#xD;
           between SSRI/SNRI augmentation with 5-HTP, Cr, or 5-HTP+Cr. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
           HAM-D scores will improve over 8 weeks in all treatment groups, with the greatest&#xD;
           changes in the 5-HTP+Cr group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results will help elucidate the potential efficacy of a novel combination of&#xD;
      nutritional supplements in persons with MDD, given strong epidemiologic and physiologic&#xD;
      evidence suggesting that relative hypoxia can contribute to depression through alterations in&#xD;
      brain bioenergetics and 5-HT synthesis. Target engagement will be indicated by improvements&#xD;
      in functional connectivity and frontal cortical energy metabolism.&#xD;
