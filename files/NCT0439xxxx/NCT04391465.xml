      The investigators will seek to determine the relationship between heart rate and middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery (MCA) cerebral blood flow (CBF), as well as better understand the hemodynamic&#xD;
      determinants of MCA CBF velocity. In order to manipulate heart rate, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit patients already scheduled for clinically indicated elective electrophysiological&#xD;
      studies, where temporary pacing catheters placed in the right atrium can be used to&#xD;
      artificially pace the heart at controlled rates. MCA CBF will be measured by transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is maintained at a relatively constant level by&#xD;
      multiple overlapping auto-regulatory systems over a wide range of blood pressures. This&#xD;
      ensures adequate oxygen delivery to the brain and is critical to ongoing brain function and&#xD;
      consciousness. Patients with reduced CBF experience symptoms of presyncope (e.g.&#xD;
      lightheadedness, dizziness, trouble concentrating) and may faint. In patients with postural&#xD;
      tachycardia syndrome (POTS), these orthostatic symptoms are a chronic issue, but the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood - there is both evidence for and against&#xD;
      impaired cerebral auto-regulation in POTS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that increased cardiac output improves CBF independent of&#xD;
      mean blood pressure. This is of particular interest in POTS patients, who display reduced&#xD;
      cardiac output both during rest and orthostasis. This is due in part smaller heart size and&#xD;
      reduced blood volume, which necessitate high heart rates to maintain cardiac output. The&#xD;
      relationship between cardiac output and CBF has not been studied in POTS patients. Given the&#xD;
      characteristic orthostatic tachycardia seen in these patients, the effects of heart rate on&#xD;
      CBF are also of interest. The relationship between heart rate and CBF, to our knowledge, has&#xD;
      not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronic orthostatic symptoms in POTS patients are largely unexplained, but contributed&#xD;
      centrally to significantly reduced quality of life. These symptoms are thought to be caused&#xD;
      in part by alterations in CBF. While POTS does not have a &quot;cure&quot;, alleviation of orthostatic&#xD;
      symptoms would likely improve patients' ability to engage with activities of daily living and&#xD;
      may reduce overall disease burden. Gaining an improved understanding of the hemodynamic&#xD;
      determinants of CBF is essential to achieving this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the relationship between heart rate and middle cerebral artery (MCA)&#xD;
      CBF. Additionally, to better understand the hemodynamic determinants of MCA CBF velocity by&#xD;
      examining the relationships between heart rate, stroke volume, pulse pressure, and MCA CBF&#xD;
      velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be an open-label, single group study in otherwise healthy patients&#xD;
      scheduled for elective electrophysiology studies prior to planned ablations for&#xD;
      supraventricular tachycardia. The study will take place with the participant supine on the&#xD;
      electrophysiology laboratory procedure table, with a temporary pacing catheter already placed&#xD;
      in the high right atrium. Prior to beginning the study protocol, the participant will be&#xD;
      instrumented with non-invasive (a) skin electrodes to continuously monitor heart rate and&#xD;
      record an electrocardiogram; (b) a volume-clamp finger cuff to monitor beat-to-beat blood&#xD;
      pressure, calibrated with intermittent brachial cuff measurements; and (c) a transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler System to record CBF velocity. Estimates of stroke volume, cardiac output, and&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance will be obtained using Modelflow-based waveform analysis of the&#xD;
      continuous blood pressure waveform. A clinically standard sinus node recovery time (SNRT)&#xD;
      protocol will be performed whilst collecting CBF and hemodynamic responses. Pacing will occur&#xD;
      at 600 ms (100 bpm), 500 ms (120 bpm), 400 ms (150 bpm), and 350 ms (171 bpm) cycles for 60&#xD;
      seconds each, with a rest period of at least 60 seconds between pacing runs. After these&#xD;
      pacing runs, the study data collection will be complete and the extra blood pressure cuffs&#xD;
      and transcranial doppler probes will be removed from the participant so that the clinical&#xD;
      electrophysiology study may continue as planned. The investigators estimate that this study&#xD;
      will add no more than 10-15 minutes to the overall procedure time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this exploratory &quot;proof of concept&quot; study, the investigators plan to enrol 20&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
