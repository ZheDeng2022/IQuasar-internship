  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To help prevent deaths in populations that cannot or will not access physical safer&#xD;
      consumption services in Alberta, which may disproportionately include women and those who are&#xD;
      not able to self-inject (Potier et al., 2014) the investigators propose to provide virtual&#xD;
      (phone-based) supervised consumption services, staffed by people with lived experience.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Designed as a small open label clinical study to demonstrate proof of concept which will&#xD;
      follow CONSORT guidelines, the investigators aim to recruit approximately 15 people who are&#xD;
      currently using illicit substances and who currently use opioids (illicit or prescription -&#xD;
      non-medically). The sample size of 15 balances pragmatic issues (difficulty in recruiting&#xD;
      people who are actively using illicit substances) and the need to have a good sample of the&#xD;
      population. These participants will be interviewed by the research coordinator in person&#xD;
      prior to intervention initiation to determine baseline use; history of overdose; and current&#xD;
      harm reduction activities (see appendix). They will then be asked to call the intervention&#xD;
      number if they are going to be using alone (see appendix for call flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time a participant dials the number, the operator will gather (as part of the&#xD;
      intervention) the address the participant is at, their name/pseudonym and a phone number that&#xD;
      can be used as a call back number in case the call is disconnected. The phone line operator&#xD;
      will then ask a) what they planned on using, b) the method of use, c) if the participant is&#xD;
      using safe sterile supplies (and provide information on where they can get new supplies in&#xD;
      their community), and d) if they have a naloxone kit (overdose reversal kit) available. They&#xD;
      will then inform the participant that they will be checking in on them every 5 - 10 minutes&#xD;
      and if they do not respond, they will call emergency medical services for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant responds to each verbal prompt (calling their name) over a minimum of 30&#xD;
      minutes, the operator will let them know that they are disconnecting the call. The operator&#xD;
      will offer to connect the participant to other health services, such as the location of new&#xD;
      supplies, social services, addiction treatment and opioid agonist therapy. If the participant&#xD;
      fails to respond to a prompt (or the call is disconnected and is not able to be reconnected),&#xD;
      the operator will contact the dispatch supervisor and the process for emergency services&#xD;
      dispatch will be initiated.&#xD;
