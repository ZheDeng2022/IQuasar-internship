      Care Partner Assisted Intervention to Improve Oral Health for Individuals with Mild Dementia&#xD;
      is a randomized control trial (RCT) based in New York City and North Carolina. The&#xD;
      intervention includes both a tailored oral care plan and a behavioral component using the&#xD;
      Adaptive Leadership Framework for Chronic Illness that the team introduced to manage symptoms&#xD;
      associated with chronic conditions, such as dementia. Objective 1 is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of an intervention to improve oral hygiene clinical outcomes (i.e. plaque index and gingival&#xD;
      index) by improving oral hygiene behavior (i.e., frequency and duration of toothbrushing) and&#xD;
      oral health skills among individuals with mild dementia. Objective 2A is to determine whether&#xD;
      effects of the intervention on oral hygiene behavioral outcomes, are mediated by the&#xD;
      following variables from the care partners' perspective: 1) oral care self-efficacy; 2) care&#xD;
      partner self-efficacy; 3) use of cueing methods; 4) and FOCUSED Communication. Objective 2B&#xD;
      is to determine whether effects of the intervention on oral hygiene clinical outcomes, are&#xD;
      mediated by the following variables from the care partner's perspective: 1) oral care&#xD;
      self-efficacy; 2) care partner's self-efficacy; 3) use of cueing methods; 4) and FOCUSED&#xD;
      Communication. Objective 3A is to determine whether effects of the intervention on oral&#xD;
      hygiene clinical outcomes are mediated by oral hygiene behavioral outcomes. Objective 3B is&#xD;
      to determine whether effects of the intervention on oral hygiene clinical outcomes are&#xD;
      mediated by the care partner's factors, which then mediate the oral hygiene behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes on oral hygiene clinical outcomes. This innovative care partner-assisted oral care&#xD;
      behavior intervention will assist participants and care partners in implementing a&#xD;
      cooperative oral hygiene care plan to prevent deterioration of oral health, which in turn,&#xD;
      will help the targeted population maintain independence in completing daily activities and&#xD;
      quality of life for an extended period of time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dyads that each consist of an individual with mild dementia and his/her care partner will be&#xD;
      enrolled at two sites, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and New York University in&#xD;
      New York, New York. This is an unblinded, randomized trial to assess the acceptability and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the oral health intervention among individuals with mild dementia (MD). The&#xD;
      study will utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to learn about the oral health&#xD;
      outcomes in individuals with mild dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts 6 months. The first three months is the active intervention phase in which&#xD;
      coaching and educational modules are delivered. The second three months is the maintenance&#xD;
      period in which no coaching or educational modules are presented to participants. As a team,&#xD;
      the study coordinator, the oral health evaluator (a dental hygienist), and the&#xD;
      interventionist will conduct three visits with the participants and their care partners;&#xD;
      baseline, 3-month (end of the active intervention phase), and 6-month (end of three-month&#xD;
      maintenance phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention protocol will include three groups; two treatment groups and one control&#xD;
      group. All participants will receive oral health education material at the baseline visit.&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1 and Treatment Group 2 will be given a smart electronic toothbrush. Only&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2 will receive the in-home and telephone coaching throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the study and will be instructed to record daily brushing habits. The coaching sessions&#xD;
      include individualized instruction on oral hygiene technique, cueing strategy development, or&#xD;
      oral hygiene monitoring and coaching. Treatment Group 1 and the Control Group will not&#xD;
      receive the coaching sessions.&#xD;
