  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of surgery is a controlled trauma to the body. Trauma induces changes in&#xD;
      metabolic function that have evolved to help the body survive injury. The normal balance&#xD;
      among use of sugar, fat, and protein for energy production is thought to change during trauma&#xD;
      and surgery. This altered metabolic function may contribute to adverse outcomes from surgical&#xD;
      procedures especially in the setting of patients with obesity or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
      However, very little is known about the specific changes in metabolism that occur during&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to describe the metabolic changes that occur during a&#xD;
      typical surgical procedure in detail. In order to measure the alterations in the balanced use&#xD;
      of sugar, fat, and protein during surgery we will collect blood samples from patients before,&#xD;
      during, and after spinal surgical procedures. Subjects will be enrolled in the pre-operative&#xD;
      hold area, give informed consent, and have a dedicated peripheral IV catheter placed. We will&#xD;
      recruit patients who are normal weight without diabetes, obese without diabetes, and obese&#xD;
      with diabetes. The first specific aim is to characterize the metabolic changes in sugar, fat,&#xD;
      and protein balance during surgery in metabolically normal subjects. The second specific aim&#xD;
      to examine if there are differences in these changes in subjects who are obese or have&#xD;
      diabetes. The final specific aim is to measure the changes in metabolism at high resolution&#xD;
      using a method called metabolomics, which is analogous to genome profiling. This method&#xD;
      measures hundreds of compounds produced in different amounts as metabolic balance changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major impacts that may be derived from these data range from a more thorough&#xD;
      understanding of metabolism under trauma to identification of new markers for risk&#xD;
      stratification and intervention to improve clinical outcomes. These data will help build the&#xD;
      foundation for new approaches to understanding the physiological and metabolic responses to&#xD;
      stress and trauma.&#xD;

      We will conduct a cross-sectional study in a cohort of patients undergoing spinal surgery for&#xD;
      discectomy, laminectomy, or vertebral fixation. We will recruit a cohort of subjects in&#xD;
      groups with metabolic phenotypes defined by body mass index (BMI) and glycemic control. We&#xD;
      are choosing to use spinal surgeries as they utilize inhaled anesthetics, run hours in&#xD;
      length, do not involve ischemic tourniquet time, and use basic elements of the anesthetic&#xD;
      pharmacopeia including anti-emetics, opioid analgesics, and paralytics. Further the increased&#xD;
      surgical stress of entering the thorax or peritoneum are avoided. These features provide a&#xD;
      long steady-state of surgical intervention with minimal additional maneuvers allowing for a&#xD;
      controlled examination of surgical metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The categorical criteria for the groups will be body type: lean (BMI&lt;25), overweight (BMI&#xD;
      &gt;25, &lt;30), and obese (BMI &gt;30 but &lt;40), and glycemia: normoglycemic (fasting blood glucose;&#xD;
      FBG &lt;100 mg/dL or HbA1c &lt;5.5%), impaired fasting glucose (FBG &gt;100 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL, or&#xD;
      HbA1c &gt;5.5% and &lt;6.5%), Type 2 Diabetes (FBG &gt;126 mg/dL or HbA1c &gt;6.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened, enrolled, give informed consent, and have a dedicated peripheral&#xD;
      IV line placed in pre-operative hold. A baseline blood sample will be collected in&#xD;
      pre-operative hold, after transfer to the table in the operating room, and immediately prior&#xD;
      to induction of anesthesia. Following induction blood samples will be collected at 15'&#xD;
      intervals for the initial 2 hours of each case, then at 30' intervals for the remainder of&#xD;
      the case and for 2 hours in the post-anesthesia care unit. Samples will be processed and&#xD;
      stored at -80C until analyzed. Intra-operative data from the anesthesia record will be&#xD;
      collected and included in the study database.&#xD;
