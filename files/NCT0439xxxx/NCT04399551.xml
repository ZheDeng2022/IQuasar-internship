  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the CAB LA + RPV LA clinical development program is to develop a&#xD;
      highly effective, well-tolerated, two-drug, LA injectable regimen which has the potential to&#xD;
      offer improved treatment convenience, compliance and improved quality of life for people&#xD;
      living with HIV compared to current standard of care. This interventional study will examine&#xD;
      different implementation strategies in different clinic settings across European countries to&#xD;
      identify strategies which best meet the needs in each local context and involve both&#xD;
      participants receiving study treatment CAB LA + RPV LA (patient study participants [PSP]) as&#xD;
      well as the healthcare providers at the investigator site level (staff study participants&#xD;
      [SSP]). SSPs consists of 2 groups: standard and enhanced arm.&#xD;
