  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate Oral Health related quality of life of children and&#xD;
      adolescents with down syndrome and Parental Perception, knowledge and Attitude on oral health&#xD;
      conditions of children and adolescents with down syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral disease and conditions can undermine self-image and self-esteem , dis-courage normal&#xD;
      social interaction, and cause other health problems and lead to chronic stress and depression&#xD;
      , They may also interfere with vital-functions such as breathing , food selection eating,&#xD;
      swallowing and speaking, and with activities of daily living such as work, school, and family&#xD;
      interactions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Health Related Quality of Life captures the aim of new prospective and defined as a&#xD;
      multidimensional construct that reflects people's comfort when eating, sleeping and engaging&#xD;
      in social inter-action, their self-esteem and their satisfaction with respect to their oral&#xD;
      health .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Down syndrome (DS) is the most common neuro-developmental disorder of known genetic origin,&#xD;
      arising from an extra copy of chromosome 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents with down syndrome present particular characteristics that may have&#xD;
      a negative impact on their oral health and function. Protruding large tongue and facial&#xD;
      muscle hypotonicity impairing speaking and chewing abilities. Bruxism, respiratory problems&#xD;
      and mouth breathing are common among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal disease is the most significant oral health problem in people with Down syndrome&#xD;
      due immunological deficiency, poor masticatory function and poor oral hygiene .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another common oral manifestation associated with the syndrome is malocclusion. In this&#xD;
      regard, mandibular protrusion, anterior open bite, and posterior crossbite have been reported&#xD;
      as prevalent outcomes among DS individuals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that the impact of oral disease on Oral Health Related Quality Of Life of&#xD;
      children with disabilities can be used in health service planning and priority setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have recommended that people with a negative oral condition should receive treatment&#xD;
      first , Hence this vulnerable group of children needs to be prioritized in the planning of&#xD;
      health services and oral health care programs&#xD;
