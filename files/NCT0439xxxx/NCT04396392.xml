  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common anxiety with onset in adolescence and early&#xD;
      adulthood. With the advent of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) technology, VR-delivered exposure&#xD;
      therapy has previously been shown to be efficacious with adults. Virtual reality has existed&#xD;
      for several decades, but it is only in the recent years it has become readily available. The&#xD;
      new generation of off-the-shelf, consumer VR hardware, can revolutionize the design,&#xD;
      availability and dissemination of VR therapist tools for exposure therapies. Importantly,&#xD;
      there has been relatively little research on VR delivered exposure of anxiety in social&#xD;
      situations compared to other anxiety disorders, presumably due to the complexity of the&#xD;
      virtual stimuli required. There has been no study on VR delivered exposure specifically for&#xD;
      adolescents until recently. A feasibility and pilot trial laying the foundation of the&#xD;
      current study showed great potential in using VR for adolescents with PSA. The current study&#xD;
      aims to investigate the efficacy of a self-guided VR intervention compared to a self-guided&#xD;
      internet-delivered text-based intervention using a two-phased randomized design. Adolescents&#xD;
      aged 13-16 will be invited to participate in the study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-phased intervention study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with PSA will be randomized into three self-guided intervention groups and one&#xD;
      delayed waiting list group as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: receiving VR intervention (3 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: receiving VR intervention (3 weeks) + text-based exposure program (T-B-Exp) (3&#xD;
      weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: receiving text-based psychoeducation and exposure program (T-B PE + T-B Exp) (6&#xD;
      weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Waitlist (3 weeks) + receiving text-based psychoeducation (T-B PE) (3 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The VR intervention is a self-guided and home-based VR intervention that lasts for three&#xD;
           weeks and focuses on exposure training. The VR group will receive the VR headset&#xD;
           personally, in addition to instructional text about how the VR intervention works, how&#xD;
           to use the VR application and how often to train. They will be instructed at least 5&#xD;
           tasks weekly during the intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The text-based Psychoeducation intervention is a three weeks program with three modules.&#xD;
           One module will be assigned weekly, together with the weekly assessments, which will be&#xD;
           same for all participants. The participants will receive a notification on text message&#xD;
           when a module has been assigned to them. Module 1 will include information about the&#xD;
           intervention program, psychoeducation about public speaking anxiety, cognitive therapy&#xD;
           and case formulation. Module 2 will focus on catastrophic beliefs; how to recognize, how&#xD;
           they develop, how they contribute to maintaining the anxiety and how they can be tested.&#xD;
           Module 3 focuses on safety strategies; what they are, how they contribute in maintaining&#xD;
           anxiety, and how to identify them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Text-based exposure intervention is a three weeks program with 3 modules. One module&#xD;
           will be assigned weekly, together with weekly assessments. The modules will focus on how&#xD;
           to practice exposure in real life (in vivo) and relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The waitlist group will be in waitlist mode for three weeks while the intervention&#xD;
           groups are in phase 1. They will still receive weekly assessments during phase 1.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Public Speaking Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>A new, modern, reliable and valid self-rating scale (Bartholomay &amp; Houlihan, 2016). The PSAS features 17 items (5 of which are reverse-coded) covering cognitive, behavioral and physiological aspects of PSA. Since the PSAS features a full Likert item response format, it should be more sensitive to change than older rating scales such as the Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker (Phillips, Jones, Rieger, &amp; Snell, 1997). Normative score data is however as of yet missing. This scale is translated into Norwegian according to scientific standards (back-translation.). Although intended for adults, the wording did not present any problem for adolescents in our feasibility study. lower score means lower symptom-leves</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Interaction Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of social interaction distinguishes performance-only from generalized SAD. As such, degree of social interaction anxiety is a likely moderator of treatment response in the current study. A combination of Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) 6 and the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) 6 has proven to be a validated measure to measure the more generalized form of social anxiety and gives us a short screening tool which is easy to assess (Peters, Sunderland, Andrews, Rapee, &amp; Mattick, 2012). This scale is translated into Norwegian according to scientific standards (back-translation.).&#xD;
By collecting data on the 12-item short version of SIAS at both pre and post and FU the aim is to investigate whether VRET for PSA has a treatment effect on generalized social anxiety lower score means lower symptom-levels. scale from 0-80.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Catastrophic belief expectancy</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Expectancy ratings of aversive consequences are a valid, simple way of assessing the strength of conditioning (Boddez et al., 2013) and a hypothesis is that a decrease in catastrophic beliefs expectancies will also cause a reduction in PSA symptoms . One-item scale for CBE will be assessed weekly together with the primary outcome measure PSAS. They will be asked to answer, &quot;How sure are you that the most aversive consequence when giving a speech is likely to happen?&quot; on as scale from 0-100.&#xD;
Alternative: &quot;How sure are that you will sweat, shake, and/or r√∏dme visibly? How sure are you that you will speak in a weird way? (snakke rart). How sure are you that you will have difficulties speaking? How sure are you that others will think negatively of you?</description>
