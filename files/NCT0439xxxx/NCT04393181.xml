    <textblock>
      Severe heart failure is a diagnosis with a very poor prognosis. Heart transplantation is the&#xD;
      best treatment for terminal heart failure but this type of treatment is limited by the number&#xD;
      of available organs. About 20-25% of possible donor hearts are not considered for&#xD;
      transplantation because they have some form of functional impairment. The functional&#xD;
      impairment affecting organ donors is, however, usually reversible. A number of retrospective&#xD;
      studies show that cardiac function recovers and recipients of hearts with dysfunction do not&#xD;
      have worse outcomes compared to recipients of hearts with perfect cardiac function. However,&#xD;
      there are no prospective studies on whether the functional impairment of the donor heart is&#xD;
      of significance for the recipient. With a systematic and simple investigation of the heart,&#xD;
      it should be possible to identify the hearts that are safe to transplant. This will thus&#xD;
      increase the number of available donors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe heart failure is a diagnosis with a very poor prognosis where the 2-year mortality&#xD;
      rate for serious heart failure is over 50%, which exceeds many cancer diagnoses. Despite&#xD;
      advances in pharmacological treatment and mechanical pumps, heart transplantation is&#xD;
      considered to be the best treatment for terminal heart failure. However, heart&#xD;
      transplantation as a treatment for terminal heart failure is limited by the number of&#xD;
      available organs. If the investigators could take care of more organs, more patients could be&#xD;
      transplanted. It is therefore of the utmost importance that every heart that can be&#xD;
      transplanted successfully is considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current recommendations, a heart should be in near perfect condition to be&#xD;
      considered for transplantation. For a donor heart to be transplanted, it should not exhibit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than mild-to-moderate cardiac impairment (EF &lt; 40%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regional discrete wall motion abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for excessive inotropic support (dobutamine &gt;20µg/kg/minute)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intractable ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac dysfunction in organ donors, however, is usually secondary to the disease that led to&#xD;
      brain death and is reversible; there is nothing wrong with the heart itself but it has ended&#xD;
      up in an unfavorable environment that temporarily affects its function. A common cause of&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction in organ donors is stress-induced cardiomyopathy/Takotsubo&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy is a relatively newly described acute cardiac&#xD;
      syndrome in which the heart develops regional wall motion abnormalities caused by severe&#xD;
      catecholamine stimulation of the myocardium. In the organ donor, a strong catecholamine storm&#xD;
      is observed in combination with compression and the development of brain death, which can&#xD;
      trigger stress-induced cardiomyopathy. This type of change is seen in 20-25% of potential&#xD;
      organ donors. One of the most important characteristics of stress-induced cardiomyopathy is&#xD;
      its rapid recovery, however, and cardiac function is usually normalized within a few hours or&#xD;
      Days 8-10. This is not only seen as a functional recovery, but also a structural and&#xD;
      biochemical recovery of the heart. In addition to organ donors with intracranial events,&#xD;
      stress-induced cardiomyopathy is also seen in patients with hypoxic/anoxic brain injuries as&#xD;
      a result of hypoxic cardiac arrest, and even in these cases, cardiac events are temporary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are potentially differential diagnoses for stress-induced cardiomyopathy in potential&#xD;
      donors. The most important is ischemic heart disease which can quickly and relatively easily&#xD;
      be diagnosed with coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is performed today on&#xD;
      approximately one-third of potential donors and then primarily on donors with a risk profile&#xD;
      for coronary artery disease. Another different diagnosis is myocarditis, which does not have&#xD;
      the same reversibility as stress-induced cardiomyopathy and usually gives a different&#xD;
      echocardiographic image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendation not to utilize hearts with regional wall motion abnormalities has&#xD;
      inadequate scientific support. The recommendation is based on a retrospective study that is&#xD;
      over 30 years old and did not have cardiac dysfunction as the primary outcome measure. Upon&#xD;
      review of this article, the data does not support the idea that regional wall motion&#xD;
      abnormalities would be associated with worse outcomes. Despite this, this recommendation has&#xD;
      been the basis for deciding whether to transplant the heart or not. There is a wariness,&#xD;
      especially with American thoracic surgeons, to take into account such hearts. There is a&#xD;
      number of retrospective studies that show that the outcome is not worse for patients who have&#xD;
      been transplanted with hears that have/have had dysfunction. The main studies are presented&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study based on material from the USA (UNOS database) in which patients who received a&#xD;
           heart with ejection fraction &lt;50% (n=740) were identified and compared with recipients&#xD;
           of hearts with normal function (n=30253). No difference in mortality at one year after&#xD;
           transplantation was observed between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study based on the same material showed that long-term survival was not inferior for&#xD;
           recipients of hearts with ejection fraction&lt;50%. Cardiac function was also the same for&#xD;
           recipients of hearts with normal function and impaired function one year after&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a study based on the same database (UNOS database) 472 recipients who received a&#xD;
           heart with improved function, defined as EF≤40% at one examination and EF≥50% at a&#xD;
           follow-up examination, were identified. The control group were recipients of hearts with&#xD;
           normal function EF≥55%. There was no difference in mortality, primary graft failure,&#xD;
           allograft vasculopathy between the groups, even when propensity score matching was&#xD;
           applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study based on other material from the USA (California Transplant Donor Network)&#xD;
           reported figures where low ejection fraction (EF&lt;50%, number of patients not reported)&#xD;
           or regional hypokinesia (n=197) did not affect outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An older study based on material from the USA showed that regional hypokinesia has no&#xD;
           bearing on recipients' mortality. The number of patients with regional hypokinesia was&#xD;
           not reported but 1719 patients were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study from Transplantation Centre, Sahlgrenska, analyzed donors and recipients during&#xD;
           a 10-year period. In total, 641 donors were included in the analyses and 155 (24%) of&#xD;
           the donors had cardiac dysfunction. Recipients of hearts with dysfunction (n=42) did not&#xD;
           have worse outcomes (death, retransplantation) compared to recipients of hearts with&#xD;
           normal function. Short-term outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) care time, advanced&#xD;
           hemodynamic support, postoperative dialysis, rejection) also did not differ between the&#xD;
           groups. Cardiac function was rapidly recovered in the recipients and both groups had the&#xD;
           same ejection fraction already a few days after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These retrospective studies form a relatively good foundation and cover almost 1400 patients.&#xD;
      However, prospective studies on transplantation of hearts with functional impairment are&#xD;
      missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Transplantation Centre, Sahlgrenska, there are many years of experience of handling hearts&#xD;
      with impaired function. This clinical experience suggests that it is not associated with&#xD;
      complications. The studies referenced above confirm this experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, there is room to increase the number of heart donors, and thus the number of heart&#xD;
      transplantations, if the heart donors with reversible dysfunction are utilized. This study&#xD;
      aims to prospectively investigate the cardiac function of donors and evaluate if it is of&#xD;
      significance to the outcome of the recipient. The study sets guidelines for investigative&#xD;
      procedures as well as which hearts should be transplanted, based on previous retrospective&#xD;
      studies. The investigators expect that the recipients' outcome will not be affected by the&#xD;
      cardiac function of the donor, provided the study's recommendations are followed. Our data&#xD;
      shows that approximately every fourth potential heart donor suffers from functional&#xD;
      impairment. This is in line with other studies that observed that about 20% of hearts are&#xD;
      refused due to affected function. The investigators estimate that a systematic consideration&#xD;
      of these hearts can increase the number of transplantations by 20-30%.&#xD;

      The hearts of organ donors that are not transplanted will be used for tissue analysis when&#xD;
      logistically feasible and permission is granted, in accordance with current regulations. The&#xD;
      hearts will be examined for coronary heart disease and heart attack. Tissue samples will be&#xD;
      taken from several areas with affected (in such donors) or normal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples from donors will be taken when logistically feasible and permission is granted,&#xD;
      in accordance with current regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the donors, 20 ml blood is planned to be taken on up to three occasions, i.e. a total of&#xD;
      60 ml blood. Blood samples for analysis of troponin T and NTproBNP will be taken as part of&#xD;
      normal healthcare routines and destroyed immediately after analysis .&#xD;
