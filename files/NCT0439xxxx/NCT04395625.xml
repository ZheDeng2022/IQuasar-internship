  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate bracket positioning is one of the keys for effective orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
      Traditionally, orthodontic brackets are positioned one-by-one on the teeth of the patient,&#xD;
      with the so-called direct bonding method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, the term indirect bonding defined a technique where the brackets were positioned&#xD;
      on a plaster model in order to increase placement precision. A transfer tray was then built&#xD;
      on the plaster, incorporating all the brackets mounted. Finally, this transfer tray was&#xD;
      positioned in the mouth of the patient, so that all the brackets could be bonded to the teeth&#xD;
      at once in the pre-determined position. Several studies have investigated this indirect&#xD;
      technique based on plaster models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With computer-aided technology, a new form of digital indirect bonding is now possible. The&#xD;
      dentist digitally places the brackets on a virtual 3D model of the teeth. A tray with the&#xD;
      brackets' positioning information is then generated with CAD-CAM (computer aided design and&#xD;
      manufacturing) technology and the brackets are subsequently indirectly transferred to the&#xD;
      teeth. This new approach could possibly save chair time and increase precision. Our&#xD;
      profession is today moving towards the virtual reality, and application of such a&#xD;
      computer-aided technology method into the clinical work-flow seems definitely promising for&#xD;
      our future daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the evidence about this new computer-assisted indirect bracket bonding method is very&#xD;
      limited, the purpose of this study is to evaluate precision, chair time, and bracket survival&#xD;
      by comparing this digital indirect bonding method to the traditional direct bonding method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess and compare the accuracy of a conventional direct bonding method with an&#xD;
           indirect computer-aided bonding method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate chair time and bracket survival related to both bonding methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. There is no difference in accuracy of bracket placement between the direct and indirect&#xD;
      bonding methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. There is no difference in chair time between the two bonding methods. III. Bracket bond&#xD;
      failure is similar for both bonding methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Bracket placement is more precise/accurate with the indirect bonding method compared to&#xD;
      the traditional direct bonding method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Indirect bonding reduces chair time.&#xD;

      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-arm parallel randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, eligibility criteria and settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients seeking orthodontic treatment at the Section of Orthodontics, School of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Aarhus University, previously selected to be suitable for full fixed appliance&#xD;
      with metallic brackets in the Postgraduate clinic, according to treatment needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following inclusion criteria will be applied: minimum 4 permanent teeth (except molars)&#xD;
      to be bonded in each of the 4 quadrants (thus extraction or non-extraction cases) and with&#xD;
      all teeth fully erupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: presence of active caries, fluorosis or hypoplasia of enamel,&#xD;
      restorations or fractures of the surfaces to be bonded, abnormalities in crown morphology of&#xD;
      teeth to be bonded. Subject with major rotations impeding proper bracket positioning will&#xD;
      also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be informed about the study orally and in a written form. Consent from&#xD;
      patients or parents (if the patient is adolescent) will be obtained before the bonding&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the literature, failure of brackets is varying from 3 to 30% [9, 10].&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size for determination of equivalence of 2 proportions (expected&#xD;
      proportion of failures in control group: 25% - expected proportion of failures in test group:&#xD;
      25% - maximum permitted difference: 10%) resulted in a sample size of 232 brackets per group,&#xD;
      for a p=0.05 and a power of 80%. This corresponds to 29 patients (232/8). A sample size of 40&#xD;
      patients will be used in order to account for potential drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly allocated into one of two groups with a different split mouth&#xD;
      set-up (Table). Randomization with a 1:1 allocation using random block size of 4 will be&#xD;
      applied, following a sequence generated online (randomization.com). Allocation to groups will&#xD;
      take place before laboratory ordering. Allocation concealment will be ensured by using sealed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention-Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be performed by postgraduate students (hereinafter referred to as &quot;dentist&quot;)&#xD;
      in the Postgraduate clinic at the Section of Orthodontics (School of Dentistry, Aarhus&#xD;
      University). All patients will have metallic brackets bonded from 2nd premolar to 2nd&#xD;
      premolar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Impression and laboratory procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Alginate impression;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Laboratory work : impression will be poured and plaster model will be scanned&#xD;
                creating digital models of the malocclusion of the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The digital model will be imported in the software . Here the dentist will&#xD;
                digitally place the brackets on the teeth of the two quadrants selected for&#xD;
                indirect bonding according to randomization (Group 1 or Group 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Laboratory work : two individual bonding trays (one per quadrant) made of a&#xD;
                rigid-elastic plastic material will be produced by CAD-CAM, following the brackets&#xD;
                positioning information as predefined by the dentist. The actualbrackets will thus&#xD;
                be engaged in the bonding trays. The trays hosting the brackets will be delivered&#xD;
                to the clinic, ready to be used by the dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bonding procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A cheek retractor will be placed. The buccal surface of all teeth from premolar to&#xD;
           premolar will be pumiced, then acid-etched with 37% phosphoric acid (30s), rinsed and&#xD;
           dried. The two quadrants allocated to indirect bonding will be bonded first. Bonding of&#xD;
           the two remaining quadrant using the direct bonding method will be done in second&#xD;
           instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Indirect bonding method:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The trays will be tried in the mouth. If they can be inserted at once, this will be&#xD;
                preferred. If insertion in one piece is not possible, the tray will be fractioned&#xD;
                in 2 or more pieces. The etched enamel surface of the teeth in the two quadrants&#xD;
                selected for indirect bonding will be prepared with adhesive . The base of all&#xD;
                brackets engaged in the first tray will be covered with a thin layer of light cure&#xD;
                composite for bonding. This tray with the brackets will subsequently be placed on&#xD;
                the teeth. The dentist will remove the excess of composite and then light cure for&#xD;
                10 seconds per bracket with a polymerization light . After light-curing, the tray&#xD;
                will be cut with a carbide bur and will be removed from the mouth of patient. This&#xD;
                operation will be repeated for the second tray.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Direct bonding method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The etched enamel surface of the teeth in the two quadrants selected for direct bonding&#xD;
           will be prepared with adhesive and brackets will be positioned one-by-one by the&#xD;
           dentist, using bracket tweezers and height gauges, after coating the bracket base with&#xD;
           light cure composite. The dentist will remove the excess of composite and then&#xD;
           light-cure for 10 seconds per bracket with a polymerization light.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time for bonding with each method will be recorded (in seconds) with a timer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After bonding all quadrants, in case of presence of premature contacts on the brackets,&#xD;
           the bite will be raised with bite blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Wires will be engaged and potential immediate debondings will be recorded. If&#xD;
           extractions are part of the treatment plan, these extractions will be postponed after&#xD;
           bonding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be informed about hygiene and diet recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up during orthodontic treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Bracket bonding failure (type of tooth and type of failure - i.e. at the&#xD;
                bracket-composite or at the composite-enamel interface -) will be recorded at every&#xD;
                orthodontic visit (every 4 to 6 weeks), until debonding at the end of treatment&#xD;
                (approximately 18-36 months later);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Six to twelve months after bonding as well as at the end of treatment, bracket&#xD;
                position accuracy will be evaluated on digital models produced by intraoral&#xD;
                scanning;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. In accordance with the standard orthodontic treatment protocol in the Postgraduate&#xD;
                clinic at the Section of Orthodontics, a panoramic radiograph will be taken 6 to 12&#xD;
                months after bonding as well as at the end of treatment in order to assess the&#xD;
                influence of brackets placement on the position of the teeth and roots;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Finally, the number of brackets rebonded as well as the number of finishing bends,&#xD;
                which are needed because of unsatisfactory bracket positioning, will be recorded at&#xD;
                every orthodontic visit (every 4 to 6 weeks), until end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recalled 2 and 5 years after the end of treatment. Treatment stability will&#xD;
      be assessed on digital models produced by intraoral scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data will be anonymized and analyzed in a blinded way. All analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted using SPPS statistic software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding sex, age and malocclusion (e.g. Angle classification) will be analyzed&#xD;
      with descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-tests will be used to compare bonding time between the two methods, after checking&#xD;
      for normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The log-rank test will be used to compare the Kaplan Meier survival curves of the two&#xD;
      methods. A test of proportion will be applied to compare the failures at different time&#xD;
      points between bonding methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy will be evaluated by scoring bracket positioning both on digital models and&#xD;
      panoramic radiographs for every tooth, at all time-points. Kappa statistics will be used to&#xD;
      compare the scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe long term stability.&#xD;
