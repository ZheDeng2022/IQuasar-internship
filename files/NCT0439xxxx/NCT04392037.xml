      Evaluation of the effect iberdomide combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel drugs such as lenalidomide (an immunomodulatory drug; IMiD) have markedly improved the&#xD;
      prognosis of multiple myeloma patients. Over the recent years, lenalidomide is increasingly&#xD;
      used as part of first line therapy, typically until the development of progressive disease.&#xD;
      These lenalidomide-refractory patients can be treated with several regimens. However, these&#xD;
      regimens frequently contain proteasome inhibitors which are associated with neuropathy&#xD;
      (bortezomib) or cardiovascular complications (carfilzomib). These proteasome inhibitors also&#xD;
      need to be administered subcutaneously or intravenously in the hospital, once or twice per&#xD;
      week. Also these regimens have limited efficacy in lenalidomide-refractory patients. This&#xD;
      indicates that there is still an unmet medical need for new treatment options for patients&#xD;
      who develop lenalidomide-refractory disease. These new treatment regimens should be active&#xD;
      and safe without induction of neuropathy or cardiovascular side effects Moreover, an all oral&#xD;
      regimen is frequently preferred by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iberdomide plus low-dose cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available data indicates that the Cereblon E3 ligase modifying drug (CELMoD) iberdomide&#xD;
      (CC220) is pharmacologically distinct from lenalidomide and pomalidomide with a higher&#xD;
      potency against Cereblon, leading to differentiated antitumor and immunostimulating effects.&#xD;
      Since iberdomide plus dexamethasone is active and well-tolerated in heavily pretreated&#xD;
      patients including those with lenalidomide/pomalidomide-refractory disease, this two-drug&#xD;
      regimen forms a new platform to which other agents can be added. The combinations of&#xD;
      bortezomib, carfilzomib, or daratumumab plus iberdomide and dexamethasone are currently being&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have shown that low-dose cyclophosphamide can be effectively combined with the&#xD;
      IMiDs lenalidomide and pomalidomide. These combinations are effective and are well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the unmet medical need for new treatment options for lenalidomide-refractory MM&#xD;
      patients, the investigators aim at further improving the efficacy of IMiD/CELMoD plus&#xD;
      dexamethasone combination therapy in terms of response and progression-free survival, by&#xD;
      adding low-dose cyclophosphamide to the iberdomide-dexamethasone backbone (IberCd). This&#xD;
      all-oral regimen will be tested in a lenalidomide-refractory patient population with 2-4&#xD;
      prior lines of therapy. The goal of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the IberCd combination in multiple myeloma patients who have refractory disease or a relapse&#xD;
      after prior treatment with lenalidomide. Besides, various correlative studies will be&#xD;
      performed during this trial including immune monitoring.&#xD;
