      Feasibility study of a therapeutic education program for the patient and his carers, intended&#xD;
      for children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia or having received an allograft of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells in the pediatric hematology department of Robert Debré hospital (&#xD;
      Paris, APHP). In addition to feasibility, the intermediate effectiveness of the program will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study, of the quasi-experimental before-after, non-randomized,&#xD;
      mono-centric type. Feasibility is assessed on process criteria (adoption, reach&#xD;
      implementation, satisfaction). Intermediate effectiveness is assessed on the skill level of&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers, before, after and at a distance from education. Patients'&#xD;
      anxiety levels will also be assessed before, after and at a distance from the program. The&#xD;
      level of health literacy will be assessed at the start of the study.&#xD;
