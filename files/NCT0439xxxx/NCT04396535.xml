    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well docetaxel works with or without bintrafusp alfa in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced). Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Immunotherapy with bintrafusp alfa, may induce changes in body's immune&#xD;
      system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving docetaxel&#xD;
      and bintrafusp alfa in combination may work better in treating non small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      compared to docetaxel alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of bintrafusp alfa in combination with&#xD;
      docetaxel versus (vs) docetaxel alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall survival of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs docetaxel&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate overall response rates of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs&#xD;
      docetaxel alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate duration of response of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs&#xD;
      docetaxel alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the safety of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs docetaxel&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate PD-L1, TGF-beta, and TMB as potential predictive markers of clinical response&#xD;
      in tumor biopsies and in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate biomarkers associated with inhibition of TGF-beta and PD-L1. III. To evaluate&#xD;
      the changes in immune system using mass cytometry in response to TGF-beta and PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and bintrafusp alfa IV over&#xD;
      60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bintrafusp alfa IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience disease&#xD;
      progression may crossover to Arm I and receive bintrafusp alfa alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 5 years.&#xD;
