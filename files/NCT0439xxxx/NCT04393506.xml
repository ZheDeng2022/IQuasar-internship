  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), due to the large tumor&#xD;
      burden and neck lymph node metastasis, comprehensive treatment is recommended, including&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and others. Pre-operative inductive therapy can reduce&#xD;
      tumor volume, increase organ retention rate, and reduce distant metastasis rate. Vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is&#xD;
      over-expressed and associated with disease invasion and poor prognosis. The use of targeted&#xD;
      therapy against VEGF can not only inhibit tumor neovascularization, but also make the&#xD;
      effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. VEGF and VEGFR are closely related to immune&#xD;
      escape. Tumor growth requires new blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen, and VEGF can&#xD;
      stimulate neovascularization. However, tumor neovascularization is often abnormal and&#xD;
      distorted, which prevents immune active substances from reaching the tumor site. After tumor&#xD;
      hypoxia, high expression of VEGF will induce tumor cells to express programmed cell death&#xD;
      protein-1 (PD-1), which further leads to immune escape. Targeted drugs against angiogenesis&#xD;
      can relieve immunosuppression to a certain extent, and theoretically have a synergistic&#xD;
      effect with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The innovation of this study is the combination of&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor, Camrelizumab, and targeted drug against VEGFR, Apatinib, as an&#xD;
      inductive therapy to treat the patients with locally advanced OSCC, followed with radical&#xD;
      surgery and post-operative radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, the major pathologic response and&#xD;
      safety will be evaluated as the primary surrogate endpoints, the 2-year survival rate and&#xD;
      local recurrence rate will be the second endpoints.&#xD;
