    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, single-center study in 20&#xD;
      ESRD patients on hemodialysis. The study will compare performance of the Clearum HS dialyzer&#xD;
      to typical values obtained with other commercially available high flux dialyzers. In&#xD;
      addition, the Clearum HS dialyzer will be compared to a Fresenius FX80 dialyzer for a&#xD;
      baseline (control) comparison. This will be a post-market study. The duration of the trial is&#xD;
      2 weeks for the FX80 control dialyzer + 6 weeks with the Clearum HS dialyzer used for 3x&#xD;
      weekly high flux hemodialysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will compare performance to typical values obtained with commercially available&#xD;
      dialyzers used for high flux hemodialysis and comparing the Clearum HS dialyzer to the&#xD;
      baseline values of a control FX80 Dialyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial is 2 weeks for the FX80 control dialyzer + 6 weeks with the Clearum&#xD;
      HS dialyzer used for 3x weekly high flux hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling, reported in Table 1 below, will be done at mid-week sessions (pre and post&#xD;
      session sampling) and consists of a blood draw for baseline dialysis with the FX80 weeks 1&#xD;
      and 2, or Clearum HS dialyzer at weeks 3, 5 and 8 for uremic toxins: urea, creatinine,&#xD;
      phosphate, B2-microglobulin, albumin, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, platelets and&#xD;
      leucocytes, and platelets. In addition, a presession sample will be taken for coagulation&#xD;
      parameter TAT, hematocrit and inflammatory markers IL6 and C reactive protein at baseline for&#xD;
      FX80 at mid-week sessions during weeks 1 and 2 and during weeks 3, 5 and 8 for the Clearum HS&#xD;
      dialyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instantaneous B2M clearance sampling will be done at week 7 during the Clearum HS dialyzer&#xD;
      phase and consists of a blood sample prior to the dialyzer and immediately after the dialyzer&#xD;
      at two time points, 15-30 min and at 120-150 min, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood rest will be done by comparing the dialyzer to a set of 5 illustrations and giving a&#xD;
      score of 1 (worst) to 5 (best) that best correlates the dialyzer with the illustration, at&#xD;
      the end of the dialysis session after blood has been returned to the patients (both FX80 and&#xD;
      Clearum HS) on the sampling days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated for 2 weeks with a standard dialyzer (FX80) and an additional 6&#xD;
      weeks with the Clearum HS dialyzer (experimental period). Both hemodialyzers will be used for&#xD;
      3 times a week. Expected duration for the study including enrolment will be 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be approximately 3-4 months. Each patient will receive 6 hemodialysis&#xD;
      sessions with FX80 and 18 sessions with Clearum HS hemodialyzer, and the treatment time will&#xD;
      be between 3.5 and 4.5 hours&#xD;
