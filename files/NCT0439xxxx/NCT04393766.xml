  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rates of cesarean section are increasing worldwide despite ten to fifteen percent of&#xD;
      World Health Organization recommendation and from which 80-90% of cesarean sections are&#xD;
      performed with spinal anesthesia. Post Dural Puncture Headache is the commonest complications&#xD;
      associated with spinal anesthesia with prevalence as high as forty percent in Ethiopia. Body&#xD;
      of evidence revealed that Conservative managements failed to show significant benefit and&#xD;
      epidural needle and catheter techniques didn't provide conclusive evidences. On the other&#xD;
      hand, intrathecal injection of normal saline is very safe, simple technique and cost&#xD;
      effective in resource limited set up but it is not well examined on its efficacy and safety&#xD;
      profiles. The main objective of the study is to assess of efficacy and safety of prophylactic&#xD;
      Intrathecal Normal Saline for prevention of Post Dural Puncture Headache in women undergoing&#xD;
      cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. After Obtaining Ethical clearance from IRB, a&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial study will be conducted in Dilla University Referral Hospital&#xD;
      from december2019 to December, 2020. 152 mothers scheduled caesarean section under spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be allocated into two groups randomly with&#xD;
      random sequence generated list obtained from R package (Random Allocation Rule function)&#xD;
      software version 3.6.&#xD;

&#xD;
      After Obtaining Ethical clearance from IRB, a Randomized Controlled Trial study will be&#xD;
      conducted in Dilla University Referral Hospital from October 2019 to May, 2020. 152 mothers&#xD;
      scheduled caesarean section under spinal anesthesia fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      allocated into two groups randomly with random sequence generated list obtained from R&#xD;
      package (Random Allocation Rule function) software version 3.6. Data will be entered, cleaned&#xD;
      by Epi-info version 7 and imported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22 for&#xD;
      analysis. Descriptive statistics will be run to see the overall distribution of the study&#xD;
      subjects with regard to the variables under study. Unpaired student's T-test for continuous&#xD;
      symmetric data and Mann Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data will be used to see&#xD;
      the mean difference between the groups. Categorical data will be analyzed with Chi square and&#xD;
      fisher's exact test where appropriate. Survival analysis will be done to estimate the&#xD;
      probability having PDPH within five days postoperatively.&#xD;
