  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is understanding the underlying mechanisms of how PNE&#xD;
      impacts disability in chronic low back pain patients (CLBP). The investigator will explore&#xD;
      whether the PNE effect on patient disability is mediated by changes in pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      pain self-efficacy and patient beliefs about pain. Also, the investigator will explore&#xD;
      whether the effect of PNE on disability is moderated by patient expectation.The observational&#xD;
      multisite pre-post cohort study will be conducted in PT clinics in the Kingdom of Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia (KSA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most disabling conditions and has major socio-economic&#xD;
      consequences. The prevalence of LBP among the population worldwide ranges between 15 and 45%.&#xD;
      In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the prevalence of LBP reported being around 18.8% among&#xD;
      the population. Patient beliefs about back pain, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing and&#xD;
      expectation all seem to play a role in recovery. In fact, clinical guidelines recommended the&#xD;
      treatment of non-specific chronic LBP should be considered within a multi-factorial&#xD;
      biopsychosocial (BPS) framework. Exactly how this treatment should be delivered is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is a cognitive-based education that helps to educate&#xD;
      patients about pain by focusing on neurobiology, neurophysiology and the processing and&#xD;
      representation of pain. Even though PNE as intervention helps to improve pain, disability and&#xD;
      other patient outcome, mixed results on its efficacy have seen in many studies. Since any&#xD;
      complicated interventions are usually assessed by their effects on outcomes such as&#xD;
      disability and pain, most do not target these outcomes directly; instead, they target&#xD;
      mediating factors that are assumed to cause changes in these outcomes. In particular&#xD;
      self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing and a patient's beliefs about back pain are thought to&#xD;
      mediate the PNE-disability relationship since most of these cognitive factors are either&#xD;
      highly correlated with disability or predictors for disability. The justifications for&#xD;
      choosing these potential mediating factors: (1) self-efficacy has been shown to mediate the&#xD;
      development of disability and is the most commonly identified mediator for psychological and&#xD;
      behavior change interventions; (2) a study has shown that higher levels of pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing are strongly correlated with higher levels of pain intensity and disability;&#xD;
      and (3) a study has shown that beliefs about the consequences of LBP can influence patients'&#xD;
      perceived pain and disability. However, the mechanisms underlying PNE effects, or the effect&#xD;
      of PNE on mediating factors and its subsequent effect on disability as an outcome, has not&#xD;
      been yet investigated. That leads to a knowledge gap in the evidence for understanding how&#xD;
      PNE exerts its effect on disability. Also, identifying potential moderating factors that&#xD;
      influence the PNE-disability relationship needs further investigation. In particular,&#xD;
      expectation is thought to moderate the PNE-disability relationship because there are studies&#xD;
      identified a link between expectation and clinical outcomes in patients with LBP. No study&#xD;
      has explored the relationship between expectancy and clinical outcomes in the context of PNE.&#xD;
      So, the influence of patient expectation on the magnitude of PNE effect on disability needs&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this 18-months project is understanding the underlying mechanisms of how PNE&#xD;
      impacts disability. This project is significant because it will help us understand how PNE&#xD;
      works by studying the underlying mechanisms and for whom and under what circumstances will&#xD;
      PNE produces the greatest clinical benefits on the disability for patients with chronic LBP.&#xD;
      Knowing how certain factors work will help PTs to enhance the elements of PNE that hopefully&#xD;
      will target patient-specific factors and subsequently will reduce disability.&#xD;
