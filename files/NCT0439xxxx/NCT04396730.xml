  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how Cannabidiol (CBD) impacts the effectiveness of&#xD;
      oral contraceptive (birth control) pills and if CBD changes the possible side effects of&#xD;
      birth control pills when CBD and birth control pills are taken at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the potential interaction between CBD and birth control pills by&#xD;
      assessing serum levels of the contraceptive steroid hormones ethinyl estradiol and&#xD;
      levonorgestrel in birth control pill users when they also use CBD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to either the CBD or placebo for cycle one, followed by a&#xD;
      washout cycle. For cycle three, participants will take the opposite of what they received in&#xD;
      Cycle one. For example if they received CBD during cycle one they will take placebo for cycle&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
