  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the needs of the many patients who cannot access the standard nurse call systems&#xD;
      Iowa Adaptive Technologies has developed the Noddle, a smart switch that can take the&#xD;
      smallest intentional gesture a patient can make (e.g. tongue click, wink) and allow the&#xD;
      patient to access the nurse call system and control a speech-generating device. This study&#xD;
      will assess how patients and their nurses as well as family members perceive the impact of&#xD;
      having a device that would allow them to summon the nurse and to be able to effectively&#xD;
      communicate. Patients will be provided a Noddle and will be free to use it as much or a&#xD;
      little as they like during their hospitalization. Patients will either use the Noddle just to&#xD;
      access the nurse call system or they will use it to access the nurse call system and a&#xD;
      speech-generating device. Patients, nurses and family members will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      exit questionnaire prior to discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the responses of patients, nurses and family members to the use of&#xD;
      the Noddle switch to enable the patients to access the nurse call system and a speech&#xD;
      generating device. Patients who cannot access the standard nurse call and who may not be able&#xD;
      to speak due to mechanical ventilation will be recruited to the study and provided the&#xD;
      opportunity to use the Noddle switch as long as they want while they are hospitalized at&#xD;
      UIHC. Prior to their discharge or when they no longer need or want to use the Noddle switch,&#xD;
      they along with their nurses and family members (if present) will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      survey to assess their ability to effectively communicate. The data from the study&#xD;
      participants will be compared to data from two groups of patients from a previous study who&#xD;
      were either able to or unable to access the nurse call system and communicate with&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
