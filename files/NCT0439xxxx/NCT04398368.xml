  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well gemcitabine works in preventing urothelial cancer from&#xD;
      coming back within the bladder (intravesical recurrence) in patients with upper urinary tract&#xD;
      urothelial cancer undergoing radical nephroureterectomy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Instilling&#xD;
      gemcitabine into the bladder during surgery, may reduce the chance of recurrence of upper&#xD;
      urinary tract urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of a single intraoperative intravesical instillation of&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) at time of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for&#xD;
      clinically localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) in preventing intravesical&#xD;
      recurrence of urothelial cancer (UC) at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess time to recurrence for entire duration of follow-up. II. To assess the&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To stratify intravesical UC recurrence free survival by tumor grade, neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, tumor stage, ureteral tumor location, and history of bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess incidence and time to development of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravesically for at least 1 hour at the time of&#xD;
      RNU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
