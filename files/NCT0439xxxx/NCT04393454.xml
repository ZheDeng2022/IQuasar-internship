      To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus by estimating the overall response rate (ORR) as&#xD;
      assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic dMMR solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease&#xD;
      progression or to inability to tolerate treatment).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, treatment alternatives for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors remain scarce.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical data suggests that dMMR tumors are susceptible to rapamycin (sirolimus), a mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitor. In these tumors, characterized by higher levels of oxidative stress, sirolimus can&#xD;
      exert a cytotoxic effect, led by the failure to repair DNA damage by inhibition of&#xD;
      antioxidant enzymes such as FOXO3a triggered by Akt hyperactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal presents a phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      sirolimus in patients with dMMR solid tumors after immunotherapy. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that sirolimus will increase the overall response rate (ORR) by 20%.&#xD;

    <description>Sirolimus (oral) will be started at 2 mg daily. Sirolimus dosing will be titrated to meet serum trough levels of &gt;8 ng/ml, assayed at 7 days after starting a new dose, by chromatography/nmass spectrometry. Once adequate serum levels are met (≥8 ng/ml), the same dosing will be continued until progression of disease as evidenced by imaging, or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
