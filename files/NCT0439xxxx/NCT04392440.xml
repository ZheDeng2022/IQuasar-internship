  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older patients ≥65 years with chronic kidney disease (CKD) face challenges in decision making&#xD;
      about dialysis. These patients report little effort by physicians to elicit treatment&#xD;
      preferences, discuss prognoses, or explain the burdens/benefits of dialysis options including&#xD;
      conservative management. Older patients with CKD often prefer maintaining the quality of life&#xD;
      over prolonging life, and many regret their decision to start dialysis: nearly one quarter&#xD;
      withdraw from dialysis each year. Shared dialysis decision-making requires active engagement&#xD;
      between nephrologists and patients to align patient, caregiver, and physician communication&#xD;
      around common goals. The proposed study is a pilot randomized cluster trial of a dialysis&#xD;
      shared decision-making (DIAL-SDM) intervention for nephrologists (n=20) and their patients&#xD;
      ≥65 years old (n=60) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≤ 20 ml/min/&#xD;
      /1.73 m2. Nephrologists in the Intervention Group will receive 3 communication training&#xD;
      sessions, delivered by a standardized patient instructor (SPI) who enact clinical scenarios&#xD;
      and offer feedback. In parallel, patients (and caregivers, if available) will receive 2&#xD;
      coaching sessions provided by health coaches, who will explore each patient's relevant&#xD;
      contextual information (values, preferences, and goals), and help them identify and practice&#xD;
      important questions for their nephrologist. Nephrologists in the Control Group will provide&#xD;
      their patients with usual care. The study outcomes will be assessed during two nephrology&#xD;
      office visits and at 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>This outcome will be measure in 30 patients in the Intervention Group by the following measure.&#xD;
Feasibility of the Intervention Measure is a 4-item scale that measures the extent to which a new treatment, or an innovation, can be successfully used or carried out within a given agency or setting. Higher scores indicate greater feasibility. The score ranges from 0-20.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be measure in 30 patients in the Intervention Group by the following measures respectively.&#xD;
Acceptability of the Intervention Measure is a 4-item scale that measures the perception among implementation stakeholders that a given treatment, service, practice, or innovation is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory. Higher scores indicate greater acceptability. The score ranges from 0-20.</description>

    <measure>fidelity of DIAL-SDM intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by looking at the fidelity in which the interventionists complete the intervention checklist after each visit for 30 patients in the Intervention Group.&#xD;
It will be reported as the number of checklists that are at least 90% complete.</description>
