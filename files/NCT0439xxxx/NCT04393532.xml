      DEVICE NAME AND INTENDED USE Device Name Su2ura™ Approximation Device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Use The Su2ura™ Approximation Device (&quot;Su2ura approximation device&quot;) is indicated&#xD;
      for tissue approximation in endoscopic surgery for the placement of interrupted or running&#xD;
      stitches in soft tissue such as hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEVICE DESCRIPTION Su2ura™ Approximation Device is a manual tissue approximation device&#xD;
      comprised of an ergonomic Handle and Anchors threaded with suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Operation When using the Su2ura Approximation Device for suturing and approximation in&#xD;
      MIS, the device is inserted through a 5mm port into the abdominal cavity and placed against&#xD;
      the tissue. The surgeon presses the trigger to deploy threaded anchors into the tissue. Each&#xD;
      anchor with a suture is placed with one single action. The surgeon may repeat the deployment&#xD;
      operation several times at different target sites, as needed to form a short/long interrupted&#xD;
      or running stitch. The device User Manual includes a recommendation to perform 4 continuous&#xD;
      anchors each time whereas this process can be repeated again and again until the area is&#xD;
      fully sutured. For approximation of the tissue after the anchors are positioned, the surgeon&#xD;
      retracts the device from the port and ties an extracorporeal unidirectional surgical knot.&#xD;
      The surgeon then changes the toggle into tightening mode and mounts the Cap on the shaft. The&#xD;
      surgeon re-inserts the shaft through the port and slides the knot towards the approximation&#xD;
      site using the tightening knob to collect thread and approximating the incision edges. The&#xD;
      surgeon uses laparoscopic scissors to cut the thread and may repeat the suturing process&#xD;
      again several times as needed until the incision is fully closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS and BENEFITS The su2ura approximation device is designed according to international&#xD;
      standards for medical devices. Compliance with these standards ensures that the device can be&#xD;
      used safely in human beings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biocompatible materials are used for the device components. The use of biocompatible&#xD;
      materials should protect the subject from hazardous adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following general risks/complications may be related to the use of Su2ura Approximation&#xD;
      Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain due to tissue penetration or approximation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vessel/nerve injury during insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Su2ura approximation device migration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adhesions The Su2ura Approximation Device was subjected to a series of pre-clinical&#xD;
           tests in order to verify its safety and usability. In addition, the device is restricted&#xD;
           for use by a trained physician, and all relevant warnings and precautions are clearly&#xD;
           indicated in the Instructions for Use document (Version 1.0) of the device. The full&#xD;
           Risk Analysis is described in &quot;Risk Management&quot; of Su2ura Approximation Device Version&#xD;
           1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Mitigation Risk analysis is performed according to the standard ISO 14971 Medical Device&#xD;
      Risk Analysis. Potential electrical, mechanical and biological hazards are identified, risks&#xD;
      are evaluated, risk mitigation is implemented and verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits Laparoscopic hernia repair, due to its clinical benefits of quick recovery, fewer&#xD;
      complications and low recurrence rate, has become a favorable and standard technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In open hernia surgery, the standard procedure includes reapproximation of the fascia in the&#xD;
      midline and restoration of the abdominal wall, followed by application of surgical mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This reapproximation of fascia in the midline is more complex in laparoscopic hernia repair;&#xD;
      therefore, this has not become standard practice4. Laparoscopic repair typically concludes&#xD;
      with mesh placement bridging over open defects, with no sutured defect closure5. The bridging&#xD;
      technique without defect closure results in higher rate of recurrence. When the defect is&#xD;
      sutured at laparoscopy, clinical studies show a significant reduction in recurrence rates4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the above mentioned, it is important to note that whether or not primary&#xD;
      closure of the defect is performed in both open and laparoscopic hernia surgery, the use of&#xD;
      surgical mesh is essential and has become standard, with a lower incidence of recurrence6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For laparoscopic fixation of the mesh, several techniques are available, where the most&#xD;
      frequent involve intra-abdominal fixation with sutures or tackers (staples) or transabdominal&#xD;
      suture fixation. Complications related to the use of transabdominal suturing or stapling&#xD;
      include mesh migration or folding, infection, post-operative pain and recurrence4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need for novel devices to: a) enable primary intra-abdominal defect&#xD;
      closure during laparoscopic surgery; b) provide a simple and safe alternative to transfascial&#xD;
      suture fixation of surgical mesh; and, c) standardize a technique for defect closure and for&#xD;
      surgical mesh fixation in laparoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE The objectives are to assess the safety and efficacy of the Su2ura&#xD;
      approximation device for the laparoscopic repair of primary umbilical hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study Study duration includes a minimum hospitalization period of 1 to 2 days,&#xD;
      followed by patient visits at 14 days, 3 months, 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Screening visit (day -7) Subjects will be asked to sign a consent form and will be screened&#xD;
      for study eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The hernia will be&#xD;
      thoroughly assessed. Subject demographic and medical information acquired from the subject or&#xD;
      the subject's medical chart, including age, gender, previous medical history, concomitant&#xD;
      medications, risk factors etc. will be also recorded on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will undergo a physical examination, vital sign measurements and blood&#xD;
      tests. Quality of life questionnaire: patient-reported satisfaction and function will be&#xD;
      assessed through the validated, hernia-specific European Hernia Society Quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire (EuraHS-QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will confirm their eligibility and their physical and mental suitability to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit, Surgery (day 0) The baseline visit is the stage at which surgery is&#xD;
      performed. Patients will already have been assessed 2 or 3 weeks earlier in the preassessment&#xD;
      clinic where fitness for surgery is verified and clinical investigation or treatment for&#xD;
      optimization for surgery organized. Thereafter, patients will be admitted to the Department&#xD;
      of Surgery at Ziv Medical Center either on the morning of surgery or the day prior to surgery&#xD;
      for final preoperative preparation. Surgery in all cases will be laparoscopic umbilical&#xD;
      hernia repair. No other elective surgical procedure will be performed during the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed under general anesthesia. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis will be&#xD;
      administered at induction of anesthesia. A single surgeon, the PI, will perform the&#xD;
      procedure. A surgical assistant will be selected by the PI from the surgical staff of the&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed in the supine position. Standard skin preparation with povidone&#xD;
      iodine solution will be performed. A 12 to 14 mm Hg carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum will be&#xD;
      achieved using a Verres needle and maintained throughout surgery. Three laparoscopic ports&#xD;
      will be inserted: the first, a 5mm port in the left anterior axillary line 2 cm below the&#xD;
      costal margin; the second, a 10 mm port at the level of the umbilicus or in the transcrestal&#xD;
      plane; the third, a 5mm port 2 cm below the line of the second port. A 5 or 10 mmm 30 degree&#xD;
      camera will be connected to an Olympus or Storz Medical Systems video laparoscopic stack. The&#xD;
      video of the surgical procedure will be recorded and stored with the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The umbilical hernia will be visualized (any adhesions at or close to the area of repair will&#xD;
      be divided). At the time of surgery the hernia sac is most likely sac will be dissected free&#xD;
      already; if not, the sac will be dissected free of the defect at the umbilicus - the sac and&#xD;
      hernia then drops into the abdominal cavity. The abdominal contents will be inspected. The&#xD;
      hernia defect will be inspected and the Su2ura approximation device will then be used to&#xD;
      close the defect, placing stainless steel implantable anchors threaded on a Polyethylene&#xD;
      braided surgical suture no less than 5mm and no more than 15 mm apart. After the&#xD;
      approximation, the sutures will be locked with extracorporeal knot. Mesh will be placed&#xD;
      according to the guidelines and the clinical status. After one last check of hemostasis and&#xD;
      the integrity of the repair, the laparoscopic ports and instruments will be withdrawn under&#xD;
      vision, and the pneumoperitoneum released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, the patient will be transferred to the recovery area and then the surgical&#xD;
      ward, where the patient will be monitored by the medical and nursing staff of the Department&#xD;
      of Surgery. It is expected that the patients will spend one postoperative night in the&#xD;
      department and be discharged the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain medication prescribed will be at the discretion of the anesthesiologist during and&#xD;
      immediately after surgery. In the Department of Surgery, patients will be prescribed standard&#xD;
      oral pain medication (usually metamizole - Optalgin - unless a contraindication exists) to&#xD;
      continue after discharge, and receive standard advice on physiotherapy, mobility, and the&#xD;
      resumption of physical activity and work.Follow up visits (day 14 (± 2days), 3 months (± 1&#xD;
      week), 6 months (± 1 week) During the follow up visits, subjects will undergo physical&#xD;
      examination, vital sign measurements and blood tests. Information on adverse events and&#xD;
      concomitant medications will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study follow up procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality of life questionnaire: patient-reported satisfaction and function will be&#xD;
           assessed using the validated, hernia-specific European Hernia Society quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaire (EuraHS-QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination to determine the presence of hernia recurrence and clinical bulge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SAE's SADE's Seroma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medication All medication taken by the subject is termed 'concomitant'&#xD;
      medication. All concomitant medication taken during the study must be documented in the case&#xD;
      report form (name of drug, date drug started, dosage, number of times drug taken daily, route&#xD;
      of medication, and indication for prescription).&#xD;
