  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A third of cancers are diagnosed in patients over 75 years of age. There are fears of the&#xD;
      elderly talking about new symptoms. The doctor may find himself trapped by general symptoms,&#xD;
      which can be confused with &quot;normal aging&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some older, younger people have lived in a world where cancer was little talked about, where&#xD;
      there was little treatment possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an idea that doctors are not very quick to start curative treatment because they&#xD;
      think that the elderly cannot bear it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to differentiate screening and early diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed treatment causes a decrease in survival and quality of life. Cancer can be discovered&#xD;
      suddenly: for example, occlusion with peritonitis in case of a stenosing colonic tumor,&#xD;
      leading to urgent management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elderly are often excluded from clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the geriatric population is heterogeneous, leading to very diverse and&#xD;
      individual care, with prioritization of issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncogeriatrics, which combines two services (oncology and geriatrics), is a specialized&#xD;
      discipline, promoting comprehensive care for the elderly patient with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general practitioner is at the center of care. It detects early signs and starts&#xD;
      examinations if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer care can be divided up with the different stages of care with various teams, including&#xD;
      organ specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general practitioner is the privileged interlocutor for the patient and their family&#xD;
      (medico-psycho-social plan), who knows their history and their experience.&#xD;
