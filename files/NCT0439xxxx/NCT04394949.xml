      There is a myth that if a person is applying for SSI/SSDI he cannot seek employment. This&#xD;
      goal of this research is to learn if a new model of service can lead to employment, increase&#xD;
      in gross wages, and a decrease in social isolation for persons with disabilities who work&#xD;
      with Centers for Independent Living on applying for SSI/SSDI benefits. The researchers want&#xD;
      to compare the services these centers typically offer these consumers to a new model - a team&#xD;
      trained in (1) the SOAR model for SSI/SSDI application assistance, (2) certified benefits&#xD;
      planning training, (3) customized employment training, and (4) individual employment&#xD;
      placement services.&#xD;

      Hypotheses and Specific Aims: The goal of the SEEKS research project is to increase&#xD;
      employment for adult persons (ages 18-60 years of age) with disabilities who get services&#xD;
      from a Center for Independent Living (CIL), increase gross income, and/or reduce social&#xD;
      isolation. Our broad grant objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Connect persons with disabilities applying for Supplemental security Income&#xD;
      (SSI)/Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) with competitive employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1a: Train CIL staff to utilize SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery (SOAR)&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1b: Train CIL staff in Customized Employment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Provide benefits counseling to persons with disabilities applying for SSI/SSDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2a: Provide Community Work Incentives Coordinators (CWIC) Training to CIL staff so&#xD;
      they can provide benefit counseling to persons with disabilities applying for SSI/SSDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Increase connections for persons with disabilities who are seeking independent&#xD;
      living services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet these objectives, the investigators are conducting a randomized control trial where&#xD;
      CIL consumers who agree to be in the study will be randomized to work with a group of CIL&#xD;
      employees who received training in SOAR, Customized Employment, Supported Employments, and&#xD;
      Benefits Planning (CWIC) (Treatment Group) to consumers working with CIL employees who will&#xD;
      offer business as usual (Control Group). The hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Significantly more participants in the Experimental Services Group will be employed&#xD;
      (competitive employment) than participants in the Usual Care Group at the end of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1a: Significantly more participants in the Experimental Services Group will be in employment&#xD;
      greater than substantial gainful activity (SGA) at the end of the program than participants&#xD;
      in the Usual Care Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Participants in the Experimental Services Group will report a significantly higher gross&#xD;
      income (wages and/or benefits) at the end of the program than participants in the Usual Care&#xD;
      Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2a - Significantly more participants in the Experimental Services Group will report a higher&#xD;
      level of satisfaction with their income at the end of the program than participants in the&#xD;
      Usual Care Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Participants in the Experimental Services Group will report a significantly greater&#xD;
      change in social connection scores from when they entered the program to the end of the&#xD;
      program than participants in the Usual Care Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3a: Participants in the Experimental Services Group will significantly show a greater change&#xD;
      in highest education obtained from when they entered the program to the end of the program&#xD;
      than participants in the Usual Care Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Intervention Being Tested. This project is comparing two service delivery models&#xD;
      to determine which results in increased competitive integrative employment, increase gross&#xD;
      income, and increased social inclusion for persons with disabilities aged 18-60 years who are&#xD;
      interested in applying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)/Social Security Disability&#xD;
      Insurance (SSDI) benefits. Both groups will include consumers who work with one of the&#xD;
      participating Centers for Independent Living (CILs) in Colorado. CIL staff working with the&#xD;
      intervention group will be trained in using the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOAR strategies,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  competitive employment (CE) strategies and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comprehensive benefits counseling (CWIC). CIL staff working with the control group will&#xD;
           deliver their usual CIL services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While SOAR strategies, Employment Services using the IPS model and CE strategies, and&#xD;
      comprehensive benefits counseling have all been shown to be impactful on employment&#xD;
      individually, there has not been a test of an intervention that uses and integrates all three&#xD;
      strategies for adults with disabilities who are working with CILs and range in age from 18 to&#xD;
      60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CILs work to support community living and independence for persons with disabilities. CILs&#xD;
      believe work experience, post-secondary education, and reduced social isolation are all&#xD;
      important. As a result, this program will look at how training CIL staff in SOAR strategies,&#xD;
      the IPS model, CE strategies, and comprehensive benefits counseling will impact not just&#xD;
      employment but also pursuing post-secondary education and increased connection to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of previously published data and pilot studies on need of the target population.&#xD;
      Nationally, data on employment rates from 2017 illustrate a large discrepancy, 40%, between&#xD;
      the employment rates of people with disabilities compared to those without disabilities. More&#xD;
      specifically, the employment rate for those 18-64 without disabilities is 77.2% versus the&#xD;
      same age group of individuals with disabilities at 37%. Even though the gap is not quite as&#xD;
      large in Colorado, 2019 data shows that the employment for those without disabilities is&#xD;
      66.3% compared to those with disabilities at 19.3%. This data reveals a rather large 35.1%&#xD;
      lower employment rate for individuals with disabilities in Colorado.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In examining other documented characteristics comparing Coloradans with disabilities to those&#xD;
      without, there are alarming differences. For example, poverty data in Colorado reveals that&#xD;
      there are 70,811 individuals with disabilities who live in poverty. This is 22.8% of the&#xD;
      disability population 18-64 years old. This is high compared to the same age group without&#xD;
      disabilities, 285,268 or 9.1% of persons who do not have a disability live in poverty. Once&#xD;
      again there is a higher rate of poverty for individuals with disabilities by 13.7%. Although&#xD;
      the gap is not quite as wide for veterans, the poverty rate for veterans with disabilities is&#xD;
      6% higher than those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reason the poverty level may be higher for persons with disabilities is that there are&#xD;
      45,852 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in Colorado ages 18-64. In 2016, the&#xD;
      national approval rate for SSI/SSDI applications (medical decisions- all ages) was 29.8%.&#xD;
      This means that for every 10 SSI applications submitted to SSA (Social Security&#xD;
      Administration) only about 3 SSI applications are approved. When taking into account another&#xD;
      114,954 Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries identified in the 2018&#xD;
      Annual Disability Statistics Compendium as of December 2017, 20% of the disability population&#xD;
      in Colorado is receiving SSA disability benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anand and Ben-Shalom conducted a study where they examined SSA administrative data to&#xD;
      identify the most common paths followed by new SSDI and SSI recipients over a 10 year period&#xD;
      after first award. These authors reported that 80% of SSDI first beneficiaries and 53% of SSI&#xD;
      recipients either achieved no additional employment milestones after achieving benefits or&#xD;
      the milestone reached was death or full retirement age. In other words, once these recipients&#xD;
      received SSI or SSDI, movement toward employment either stopped or was considerably delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not working can be extremely problematic. Not only does it mean the SSI and SSDI recipients&#xD;
      will live in poverty, it also increases health risks. Unemployment can lead to increased&#xD;
      mental distress, social disconnection, increased substance use and physical illness. Some of&#xD;
      the modifiable risks included social isolation, unemployment and poverty. These are areas&#xD;
      that need to be addressed and can be addressed in Colorado through collaboration and&#xD;
      realignment of Colorado systems providing services to individuals with disabilities such as&#xD;
      the Center for Independent Living system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEEKS intervention will utilize a number of documented promising practices and&#xD;
      evidence-based practices to achieve the outcomes that the investigators are testing in our&#xD;
      hypotheses. Over the years, the federal government has funded research and demonstration&#xD;
      projects to test strategies to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities.&#xD;
      Typically, these demonstration strategies focused on either redirecting individuals from&#xD;
      applying for Social Security Administration disability benefits as adults or assisting those&#xD;
      already receiving SSA disability benefits to find employment. Specifically, two such notable&#xD;
      projects are SSA's Youth Transition Demonstration and the Promoting Readiness of Minors in&#xD;
      SSI Demonstration aimed to improve employment outcomes and decrease the benefit receipt rate&#xD;
      for youth that are receiving or at risk of receiving SSI payments. Although both models have&#xD;
      notable successes, there are elements of these models that do not address some of the&#xD;
      fundamental needs of people with disabilities such as economic stability and community&#xD;
      participation. Ergo, SEEKS targets people applying for SSA disability benefits while&#xD;
      concurrently receiving services from an employment specialist to obtain employment and a&#xD;
      comprehensive benefits planner. This model combines the expectation that people with&#xD;
      disabilities can contribute to the business bottom line in the competitive, integrated&#xD;
      workforce, but also seeks to address limited economic resources experienced by people with&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;
