      The ELEVATE study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial of the Pipeline™ Shield&#xD;
      Device for the treatment of adults with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the ELEVATE study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of treatment with&#xD;
      the Pipeline™ Shield Device of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms that are not amenable&#xD;
      for clipping and coiling.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has a previously untreated, wide neck, side-wall, intradural aneurysm that is&#xD;
             deemed unfavorable for both surgical clipping and endovascular coiling, as confirmed&#xD;
             on DSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a ruptured intracranial aneurysm with vessel diameter suitable for&#xD;
             treatment with the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is ≥ 22 and ≤ 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has an acutely ruptured aneurysm with Hunt and Hess Scale 1, 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject or subject's Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) has provided written&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject's vessel characteristics preclude safe endovascular access to the aneurysm to&#xD;
             treat with the Pipeline™ Shield Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has aneurysm vessel characteristics that would preclude the device from fully&#xD;
             conforming to the parent vessel to reduce any risk of embolic complications,&#xD;
             retreatment, or device movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has true bifurcation or aneurysms with vessels that cannot be separated from&#xD;
             the fundus with placement of the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is unable to undergo nasogastric/orogastric tube placement prior to device&#xD;
             placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a pre-morbid mRS &gt;2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject requires treatment of another aneurysm (with another treatment modality)&#xD;
             within the affected territory of the target aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a target ruptured aneurysm that is thought to be mycotic, including those&#xD;
             caused by left atrial myxoma, or subject has an active systemic bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject with a requirement for continuous anti-coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has a malignant brain tumor or vascular malformation (e.g. arteriovenous&#xD;
             malformation).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject's target ruptured aneurysm has not been determined by the treating physician&#xD;
             to be the source of SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject with known allergy to platinum or cobalt chromium alloy (including the major&#xD;
             elements platinum, cobalt, chromium, nickel or molybdenum).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has a contraindication to ticagrelor or aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject is unable to undergo DSA or DSA is determined unsuitable by the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;

             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject is at high risk of noncompliance per treating physician due to reasons&#xD;
             including but not limited to a history of substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject is unable to complete scheduled follow-up assessments due to comorbidities,&#xD;
             geographical limitations, or a life expectancy of less than 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject is pregnant, or breastfeeding at the time of admission or plans to become&#xD;
             pregnant during their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject is participating in another clinical study at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Presumed septic embolus, or suspicion of microbial superinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject with active COVID-19 viral infection, confirmed by testing.&#xD;
