      TITLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Incidence of parastomal hernia: Randomized clinical trial comparing the longitudinal fascial&#xD;
      incision (&quot; Hepworth hitch &quot;) vs. cruciate incision in the exteriorization of a end colostomy&#xD;
      &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, open and parallel clinical trial so patients will be assigned to the cruciate&#xD;
      incision group or longitudinal incision with a 1: 1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery a definitive end colostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the parastomal hernia rate diagnosed by imaging at 2 years&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinically relevant parastomal hernia rate by physical examination 2 years after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of postoperative complications related to the stoma (dehiscence, retraction,&#xD;
           stenosis, necrosis, surgical revision, prolapse and special needs of care of the stoma&#xD;
           in the immediate or late postoperative period); 3) Incidence of postoperative&#xD;
           complications assessed according to the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parastomal hernia is one of the major complications after definitive terminal colostomy in&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer, which is clinically relevant in up to 50% of the cases but&#xD;
      can reach 78% of cases when radiologically identified. Although the majority of cases are&#xD;
      asymptomatic, 26-30% of patients will require surgical intervention of the parastomal hernia&#xD;
      for their symptoms, obstruction, incarceration, prolapse, leaks or aesthetic reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the colostomy is made with a circular skin incision, dissection of the&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat to the fascia and an incision of approximately 3 cm longitudinal and&#xD;
      approximately 2 cm transversely. The anterior rectus muscle is loosened in the direction of&#xD;
      the fibers and another cross incision is made in the posterior fascia to subsequently&#xD;
      externalize the colon. The colostomy is fixed to the skin using mucocutaneous stitches of&#xD;
      absorbable suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the longitudinal incision technique supplemented with Prolene stitches&#xD;
      at the upper and lower ends of the incision acts as a &quot;barrier&quot; for the expansion of the&#xD;
      hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed a clinical trial to study the prevention of parastomal hernia with a simple&#xD;
      modification such as making a vertical incision associated with four prolene stitches at the&#xD;
      ends of incision, with minimal morbidity and an easy technique. The objective of the study is&#xD;
      to analyze the postoperative parastomal hernia rate compared to the conventional technique&#xD;
      (crossed incision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal incision with prolene stitches at the ends of the incision is an easy and&#xD;
      reproducible technique, with minimal morbidity. This technique is based on the theory that&#xD;
      the hernia is a dilation of the hole that the surgeon has created. A vertical incision with&#xD;
      two non-absorbable stitches at the ends would prevent the hole from dilating, since these act&#xD;
      as a &quot;barrier&quot;. This technique is related to a lower rate of parastomal hernias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to analyze if there are differences in the rate of parastomal&#xD;
      hernias, clinically and radiologically measured without increasing postoperative morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both techniques, the vertical incision and the crossed incision are approved techniques that&#xD;
      are performed in a standardized way in most centers. There are no potential risks associated&#xD;
      with the study intervention, beyond the intrinsic risks of the surgical intervention itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main objective is to compare the rate of parastomal hernia diagnosed by image 2&#xD;
           years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinically relevant parastomal hernia rate by physical examination 2 years after&#xD;
                surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of postoperative complications related to the stoma (dehiscence,&#xD;
                retraction, stenosis, necrosis, surgical revision, prolapse and special needs for&#xD;
                stoma care in the immediate or late postoperative period);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of postoperative complications assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
                scale 10 and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ease / difficulty for the handling of stoma therapy devices by patients using the&#xD;
                Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo Scale: The therapy used to correct a specific complication is the basis of&#xD;
           this classification in order to rank a complication in an objective and reproducible&#xD;
           manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade I: any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade II: requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for&#xD;
           grade I complications. Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade III: requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention. Grade IV:&#xD;
           life-threatening complication requiring ICU management. Grade V: death of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comprehensive complication index (CCI): is based on the complication grading by&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo Classification and implements every occurred complication after an&#xD;
           intervention. The overall morbidity is reflected on a scale from 0 (no complication) to&#xD;
           100 (death).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visual analogue scales (VAS) is psychometric measuring instrument designed to document&#xD;
           the characteristics of disease-related symptom severity in individual patients and use&#xD;
           this to achieve a rapid (statistically measurable and reproducible) classification of&#xD;
           symptom severity and disease control, measuring from 0 (unhappy) 10 (very happy).&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following variables will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Demographic: sex, date of birth, weight, height, BMI, abdominal circumference, medical&#xD;
           history (COPD, DM, respiratory failure, etc.), surgical history, date of tumor&#xD;
           diagnosis, neoadjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preoperative evaluation: incisional hernia or previous hernias, previous abdominal&#xD;
                surgeries, previous stoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical treatment: date of surgical intervention, antibiotic prophylaxis, type of&#xD;
                surgical approach, surgical team, mechanical bowel preparation, type of surgery&#xD;
                (Hartmann intervention or abdominoperineal resection), descent of the splenic&#xD;
                angle, stoma measurements, need for transfusion, duration of the intervention,&#xD;
                bleeding, intraoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postoperative evolution: postoperative complications, date of diagnosis,&#xD;
                reoperation, colostomy stenosis, colostomy prolapse, transfusion, hospital stay,&#xD;
                postoperative mortality, and readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evolution and follow-up: radiological or clinical parastomal hernia at one month, 12&#xD;
           months and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Randomized clinical trial, with a ratio of 1: 1, controlled, single-blind (the&#xD;
           patient) of patients undergoing colorectal cancer who undergo a terminal colostomy&#xD;
           without mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ The study population is patients hospitalized in participating centers with colorectal&#xD;
           cancer, who underwent Hartmann's intervention, Miles' abdominoperineal amputation or&#xD;
           Intersphincteric amputation, with definitive terminal colostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Multicenter trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ The expected recruitment period is 12 months. The follow-up time of the patients in&#xD;
           the study is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ The approximate duration of the study is 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to published clinical trials and systematic reviews, up to 50% of patients&#xD;
           with a terminal colostomy will develop a parastomal hernia. The estimated risk based on&#xD;
           the publication by Manook et al, with the longitudinal incision of the fascia and&#xD;
           Hepworth stitches is 10%. With the confidence level to 95% and a statistical power of&#xD;
           80% and having an expected loss ratio of 10% in each group, the sample size should be 21&#xD;
           in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization process:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be randomized using random&#xD;
           number generating functions with the SPSS v.25 program in the longitudinal incision&#xD;
           group or the crossed incision group. The randomization will be 1: 1 and will be&#xD;
           stratified by the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The allocation will be concealed by means of sealed opaque envelopes. The envelope will&#xD;
           be opened in the operating room at the beginning of the surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Masking process:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients do not know the intervention group to which they have been assigned. The&#xD;
           surgeons and researchers know the group to which the patient has been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General considerations in all patients included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lithotomy position when doing the colostomy, regardless of whether it is&#xD;
                subsequently modified in the prone position. Surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy,&#xD;
                performing Hartmann's Intervention or Abdominoperineal Amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Balanced general anesthesia, with or without epidural catheter. Avoid volume&#xD;
                overload and promote normothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Usual positioning of the trocars (modifiable according to the surgeon's&#xD;
                preferences). The extraction of the piece will be performed by a Minipfannenstiel,&#xD;
                laparotomy or perineum, not through the colostomy incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The descent of the splenic angle must be total / partial / nule at the surgeon's&#xD;
                discretion, but it must be stated in the notebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients participating in the study should undergo a colostomy in an area&#xD;
                previously marked by a stomatherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The colostomy is preferably externalized through the rectus abdominis muscle, but&#xD;
                the externalization of the colostomy through the external oblique muscle is not an&#xD;
                exclusion criterion, it must be stated in the notebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the longitudinal incision group, the incision will be made on the aponeurosis of&#xD;
                the anterior rectum of about 3 cm in length, without making any transverse&#xD;
                incision. Depending on the diameter of the colon, two simple stitches of a 2/0&#xD;
                Prolene suture will be made at each end of the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the group of the cross incision, a longitudinal incision will be made on the&#xD;
                aponeurosis of the anterior rectus or external oblique, about 3 cm long and another&#xD;
                transverse incision, about 2 cm long, 1 cm on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The length of the incision of the fascia must be recorded in the notebook.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The colostomy will be fixed to the skin with absorbable stitches, at the surgeon's&#xD;
                discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The fast track principles approved by different participating centers will be&#xD;
                applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY CALENDAR (SCHEDULE)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Colorectal cancer patients will be visited at outpatients. If the patient meets&#xD;
           inclusion criteria, informed consent will be obtained in Outpatient Consultations,&#xD;
           during colostomy marking or during admission prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;

             -  RECRUITMENT PHASE (12 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit -1 Colorectal cancer patients who are going to have a terminal colostomy are&#xD;
           visited in the outpatient clinic. If the patient meets inclusion criteria, the clinical&#xD;
           trial will be explained and the informed consent will be signed. The stomatherapist&#xD;
           marks the stoma site prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 0 It will be confirmed that the patient has signed the informed consent. It will&#xD;
           be verified that the patient meets the inclusion criteria. Baseline data and confounding&#xD;
           factors described in the variables will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the operating room, the randomization envelope will be opened and the surgical&#xD;
           technique will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit +1 Postoperative variables will be collected: stoma status, postoperative&#xD;
           complications, reoperations, transfusions, hospital stay, postoperative mortality, and&#xD;
           readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ FOLLOW-UP PHASE (24 months): Obtaining the data and variables will be obtained on&#xD;
           visits to the first month, 12th and 24th month. A clinical and radiological examination&#xD;
           will be performed at each consultation. The patient must complete the corresponding&#xD;
           questionnaires. BMI and abdominal circumference will be measured in control visits.&#xD;
