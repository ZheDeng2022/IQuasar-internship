  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is common after major surgery, and is associated with adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown&#xD;
      that perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine may decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium in patients after either cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. However,&#xD;
      neurosurgical patients are often excluded in clinical trials of postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      with two parallel arms, ICU admitted adult patients after intracranial operation for brain&#xD;
      tumor will be enrolled. Low-dose dexmedetomidine will be applied during the early&#xD;
      postoperative phase. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for prevention of postoperative delirium in this patient population. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that, compared to the placebo group, the prophylactic use of low-dose&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine can decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium without significant&#xD;
      adverse events in patients after intracranial operation for brain tumor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is common after major surgery, and is associated with adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. However, patients with neurological illness are usually excluded from previous&#xD;
      researches. Recently, limited studies have shown that the incidence of postoperative delirium&#xD;
      in neurosurgical patients is approximately 20%, which is comparable to the results in other&#xD;
      major surgery. Potential associations between postoperative delirium and adverse outcomes&#xD;
      have also been found in neurosurgical patients. These results indicate that early prevention&#xD;
      of postoperative delirium should be employed in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a highly selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine has been investigated&#xD;
      as a preventive agent for postoperative delirium. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials have shown that perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      may decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients after either cardiac or&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. However, neurosurgical patients are often excluded in clinical trials of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      with two parallel arms, ICU admitted adult patients after intracranial operation for brain&#xD;
      tumor will be enrolled. Low-dose dexmedetomidine will be applied during the early&#xD;
      postoperative phase. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for prevention of postoperative delirium in this patient population. The&#xD;
