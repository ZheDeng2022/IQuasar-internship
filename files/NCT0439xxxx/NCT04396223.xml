  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN) are characterized by the persistence of elevated&#xD;
      hCG titers after complete uterine evacuation of a partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) or a&#xD;
      complete hydatidiform mole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-risk GTN patients (FIGO score ≤ 6) are commonly treated with single agent treatment&#xD;
      (methotrexate or actinomycin-D) The cure rate, assessed by hCG normalization, is obtained in&#xD;
      65 to 75% of patients with these agents GTN patients with resistance to these treatments are&#xD;
      treated with another single agent drug or polychemotherapy regimens, such as EMA-CO or BEP&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy standard regimens are old and toxic for these young lady patients, with&#xD;
      potential long term effects detrimental for further maternity and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong rational for investigating the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody avelumab in&#xD;
      chemoresistant GTN patients. Several elements suggest that the normal pregnancy immune&#xD;
      tolerance is &quot;hijacked&quot; by GTN cell for proliferating :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spontaneous regressions of metastastic GTN are regularly observed, thereby the role of&#xD;
           immune system for rejecting GTN cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strong and constant overexpression of PDL1 and NK cells has been found in all subtypes&#xD;
           and settings of GTN tumors from French reference gestational trophoblastic center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete and durable responses to pembrolizumab were reported in 3 patients with&#xD;
           multi-chemoresistant GTN in United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three cases of hCG normalization with avelumab in 6 patients with chemo-resistant GTN&#xD;
           enrolled in TROPHIMMUN cohort A (resistant to a mono-chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytotoxicity of avelumab is mediated through antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)&#xD;
           by NK cells.&#xD;

Patients will continue on treatment until the weekly hCG assays reach the institutional normal threshold, and then for 3 additional cycles, or otherwise will be stopped in the case of resistance, defined as a rise (a &gt; 20% rise between two assays, observed twice on three consecutive weekly assays) or a plateau (a &lt; 10% decrease between two assays observed three times on four consecutive weekly assays) in the hCG level, or unacceptable toxicity and/or death.</description>
