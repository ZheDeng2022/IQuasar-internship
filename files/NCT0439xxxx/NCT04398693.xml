  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal tract begins its colonization shortly after birth. During the first two&#xD;
      years of life, gut microbiota is unstable and less diverse than in adulthood. Its complexity&#xD;
      and diversity are modified by external factors that shall influence the composition of gut&#xD;
      microbiota, especially the diet, the personal hygiene and the food cleansing, as well as the&#xD;
      chronic use of antibiotics. Some recent evidence suggests that the microbiome may affect the&#xD;
      likelihood of various diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Among&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, hypertension (HT) accompanied with increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive individuals may present controlled blood pressure (use&#xD;
      of up to 03 antihypertensive drugs) or resistant without blood pressure control, even in the&#xD;
      use of 03 or more antihypertensive drugs. Objectives: Evaluating gut microbiota of resistant&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals, we shall compare it with those of normotensive and controlled&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals. The resistant hypertensive ones will also receive a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention with prebiotics to determine if the changes in microbiota and in the production&#xD;
      of microbiota metabolites can lower blood pressure. Methods: The study will be composed of&#xD;
      two phases, one observational and one interventional. The observational phase will be&#xD;
      composed of adults of both genders, aged between 40 and 70 years old, divided into three&#xD;
      groups: normotensive, controlled hypertensive and resistant hypertensive individuals.&#xD;
      Nutritional assessment, biochemistry and stool analysis will be performed to study the&#xD;
      microbiota in all groups, in addition to the evaluation of peripheral and central hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters. The intervention phase will consist of a, randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study using a prebiotic formula during 04 weeks in the resistant&#xD;
      hypertensive group. After a washout period of 4 weeks, the protocol will be repeated in the&#xD;
      other arm. Participants will visit the clinic in 4 occasions, which shall include biochemical&#xD;
      tests [for small chain fatty acids (SCFAs), noradrenaline, gut dysbiosis, immunomodulation]&#xD;
      and fecal sample collection (for SCFAs and gut microbiome determination), besides the&#xD;
      evaluation of flow-mediated dilation and peripheral and central hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal tract begins its colonization shortly after the birth. During the first&#xD;
      two years of life, microbiota is unstable and less diverse than in adulthood, when its&#xD;
      complexity and diversity are modified. There are more than 100 trillion microorganisms hosted&#xD;
      in the gut, mostly as phylae, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. These microorganisms help in&#xD;
      various functions, and their balance is of great importance to control diseases and metabolic&#xD;
      disorders. The lack of homeostasis of gut microbiota, results in gut dysbiosis, known by the&#xD;
      imbalance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes concentration, but also with the presence of other&#xD;
      phylae. Hypertension (HT) is characterized by blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 mmHg HT can&#xD;
      manifest itself with chronic or acute elevation of BP. Among the situations of BP chronic&#xD;
      elevation, there is resistant hypertension (RH), defined by BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg, even with the&#xD;
      use of three or more antihypertensive drugs in appropriate doses, preferably including a&#xD;
      diuretic. Certain gut microbial strains may play either a pathogenic or protective role in&#xD;
      the development hypertension. Changes in gut microbiota were observed in the hypertension&#xD;
      with significant decrease in microbial richness, diversity and uniformity, in addition to an&#xD;
      increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, characterizing intestinal dysbiosis. These changes&#xD;
      have been accompanied by decreases in acetate and butyrate producing bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, one of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may interfere with control of the BP&#xD;
      is related to the production of metabolites produced by fermentation of fibers like resistant&#xD;
      starch, known as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These metabolites have vasodilating&#xD;
      property (acetate, butyrate and propionate), which may influence vascular tone. Acetate and&#xD;
      the propionate are able to reduce the levels of BP in animal models, and that independent&#xD;
      models of hypertension (SHR rats and Ang II), have less SCFAs producing bacteria than the&#xD;
      normotensive controls. The SCFA butyrate, bacterial metabolic product, is produced from&#xD;
      dietary fibers by bacteria found in lumen and hosts multiple beneficial properties for the&#xD;
      host. Studies in animal models show that diet high in fiber and acetate supplementation&#xD;
      correct gut dysbiosis, increase the abundance of acetate/butyrate producing bacteria and are&#xD;
      associated with lower BP in hypertension animal model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spontaneously hypertensive rats prone to stroke (stroke-prone SHR) show gut dysbiosis and&#xD;
      fecal microbiota transplant of these rats to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats increases the BP&#xD;
      in normotensive rats. On the other hand, the intimate association between inflammation and&#xD;
      chronic hypertension is well known. The control of inflammation by the sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system plays a central role in hypertension. Therefore, the gut receives significant&#xD;
      sympathetic innervation, it is densely populated with a diverse microbial ecosystem, and&#xD;
      contains immune cells that cause great impact overall inflammatory homeostasis. This&#xD;
      influence can be demonstrated in germ-free mice subjected to the model of hypertension with&#xD;
      infusion of Ang II. They showed mitigated inflammatory signs (smaller vascular leukocyte&#xD;
      adhesion, smaller neutrophils and monocytes infiltration in the arterial wall), as well as&#xD;
      smaller endothelial dysfunction and increased attenuation of the BP as a response to Ang II&#xD;
      compared to conventionally raised mice, indicating systemic protection of inflammatory&#xD;
      cardiovascular stress. Thus, the gut microbiota plays a key role in the immune system and can&#xD;
      also influence the inflammatory response, by changing the endothelial function and,&#xD;
      consequently, BP. Hypertension causes a vascular endothelium injury, triggering an&#xD;
      inflammatory response that is accompanied with an increase in C-reactive protein, which can&#xD;
      induce the PAI-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Prebiotics to treat hypertension Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary&#xD;
      components, such as fiber, may reduce the development of HT. A high fiber diet consumption&#xD;
      increases gut microbiota populations which generate SCFAs such as acetate and butyrate.&#xD;
      Recently, Marques et al. have shown that a high-fiber diet or supplementation with the&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acid acetate modulated gut microbiota and prevented BP elevation and the&#xD;
      development of cardio-renal complications in DOCA-salt hypertension rats. The authors&#xD;
      validated these findings in hypertensive model induced by angiotensin II infusion (Ang II),&#xD;
      showing that other SCFA, butyrate, also reduced the BP and accompanied with lower levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines in the large bowel (data not published). Hypertensive subjects also&#xD;
      show an abnormal gut microbiota and lower production of acetate and butyrate. Prebiotics&#xD;
      modified diets based on high-amylose corn starches, which release large amounts of SCFAs&#xD;
      (acetate and butyrate) into the gut and into peripheral tissues, have the ability to&#xD;
      successfully reduce the predisposition to develop diabetes type 1 in mice and improve type II&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus control in humans. Dietary supplements, which produce high acetate and&#xD;
      butyrate levels, have the ability to positively intervene in gut microbiota and in&#xD;
      chronic-metabolic diseases such as HT and diabetes, being able to be used as a new strategy&#xD;
      to reduce the BP. Therefore, we need further investigation to assess the behavior of&#xD;
      microbiota in controlled hypertensive and resistant hypertensive individuals and show that&#xD;
      modulate gut microbiota can bring health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION With the high prevalence of hypertension in the globalized world and the&#xD;
      consumption increase of industrialized foods, fast-food, ultra-processed foods and physical&#xD;
      inactivity, there is a strong trend to the exponential growth of cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications. Over 60 years ago, Dr. Irvine Page proposed the Mosaic Theory of Hypertension,&#xD;
      which states that multiple factors interdigitate to blood pressure elevation. This fostered&#xD;
      establishment of cellular, molecular, and physiological mechanisms altered in HT. However,&#xD;
      However, how these diverse factors integrate to impair BP control remains a challenge.&#xD;
      Furthermore, why some factors are prohypertensive in one individual and not in another, and&#xD;
      where prohypertensive signals originate, remains an enigma. In this viewpoint, the gut&#xD;
      microbiota can be one missing link and provide a potential unifying concept, occupying a&#xD;
      prominent place in the mosaic theory. The latest evidence shows the involvement of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota in BP control and its interference in HT in animal and in humans' models. Thus,&#xD;
      addressing knowledge gaps in order to determine whether the gut microbiota is related to HT&#xD;
      and if the change of the microbiota might help in HT treatment constitutes in an opportunity&#xD;
      to develop new evidence to advance in this field, mainly in cases of resistant hypertension.&#xD;
      It would be important to establish metabolites signatures and the microbiota that could be&#xD;
      used to predict the development of HT or biomarkers for resistant hypertension. Despite great&#xD;
      advances in drug therapy, HT continues to be the main modifiable risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality development, due to lack of BP proper control in&#xD;
      resistant hypertension, which corresponds to about 10 to 20% of hypertensive subjects, this&#xD;
      group is exposed to higher cardiovascular risk. Thus, this study will assess whether the gut&#xD;
      microbiota is associated with BP levels of resistant hypertensive individuals compared to&#xD;
      hypertensive controlled and whether the microbiota alteration with Prebiotics may help BP&#xD;
      control and, consequently, decrease the prevalence of CVD in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study compares the microbiota of two different global regions, Brazil and&#xD;
      Australia, in relation to BP. Our hypothesis is that the gut microbiota and its metabolites&#xD;
      acetate and butyrate play a role in the hypertension prevention and that medical diets&#xD;
      (&quot;Nutrigenomics&quot;) can be used to reduce the BP. Initially, the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      microbiota of 3 different groups: normotensive, hypertensive controlled and resistant&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals. In a second phase of this project, we propose the establishment of&#xD;
      a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study using a prebiotic (dietary&#xD;
      modified supplement). The use of Prebiotic is justified because it is a cheap, safe and&#xD;
      simple therapy, constituting a new therapeutic approach that can increase BP control in&#xD;
      resistant hypertensive patients who cannot control it with traditional drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES General objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      resistant hypertensive patients, compared to normotensive and hypertensive ones, and also to&#xD;
      evaluate the gut microbiota response to medical intervention (Prebiotics) in resistant&#xD;
      hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze which bacteria, colonize the resistant hypertensive intestine, comparing them&#xD;
           to the microbiota bacteria of normotensive and hypertensive controlled patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the patients' nutritional status studied and correlate it with their&#xD;
           microbiota;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate metabolic-biochemistry profile (including inflammatory markers) and&#xD;
           peripheral and central hemodynamic parameters of the patients who will be studied with&#xD;
           the results of their microbiota evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To carry out the intervention with the Prebiotics formula and reassess the gut&#xD;
           microbiota after the treatment of the hypertensive controlled and the resistant&#xD;
           hypertensive group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the microbiota of normotensive, hypertensive controlled and resistant&#xD;
           hypertensive of Brazilian population studied with Australians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS The study shall be divided into two phases. The first phase will be a&#xD;
      descriptive, observational cross-sectional study. The collection of material shall be carried&#xD;
      out at the Hypertension Clinic of State Medical School at São José do Rio Preto (FAMERP),&#xD;
      with the aim of evaluating the gut microbiota of normotensive, hypertensive controlled and&#xD;
      resistant hypertensive patients. The second study will be a randomized, blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study, using prebiotics in resistant hypertensive patients&#xD;
      during two periods of 4 weeks with a wash-out interval of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of the participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are being monitored will be assessed at the Hypertension Clinic. The study will&#xD;
      consist of 3 groups of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 40 normotensive patients with systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) &lt; 90&#xD;
           mmHg at the office, without the use of antihypertensive drugs and evaluated through&#xD;
           ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to confirm normotension (BP &lt; 130/80 mmHg)&#xD;
           and the exclusion of possible masked hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 40 controlled hypertensive patients using up to three antihypertensive drugs with SBP &lt;&#xD;
           130 mmHg and DBP &lt; 80 mmHg evaluated through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
           (ABPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 40 resistant hypertensive patients defined by an uncontrolled BP in doctor's office (≥&#xD;
           140/90 mmHg), despite the use of three or more antihypertensive drugs in appropriate&#xD;
           doses, including preferably a diuretic, or the use of four or more drugs with blood&#xD;
           pressure control. Patients will also be evaluated by the ABPM, which should present in&#xD;
           SBP ≥130 mmHg and DBP ≥ 80 mmHg to be considered resistant hypertensive, otherwise they&#xD;
           will be classified as controlled hypertensive. Resistant hypertension will be defined&#xD;
           after the exclusion of causes of pseudo-resistance, i.e., inaccurate blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement, white coat effect, non-therapeutic adherence, the use of drugs that can&#xD;
           increase BP and secondary causes of arterial hypertension.&#xD;
