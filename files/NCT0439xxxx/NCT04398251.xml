    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of uric acid control on stone recurrence&#xD;
      and renal function in patients with calculi of hyperuricemia through a prospective controlled&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      2020.1 -2020.12 patients with urolithiasis and hyperuricemia were enrolled in the urology&#xD;
      department of our hospital (100 cases). The patients were informed of this study before&#xD;
      operation and randomly divided into uric acid drug control group (n = 50) and non-drug&#xD;
      control group (n = 50). The patients were followed up for 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and&#xD;
      18 months after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informations as age, sex, height, weight, calculation BMI, past medical history, history of&#xD;
      gout, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, calcium supplements will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, high density cholesterol, thyroid hormone&#xD;
      detection, androgen, estrogen detection, serum sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium,&#xD;
      magnesium, phosphorus, serum uric acid will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renogram test to evaluate the change of single renal function. The stones burden will be&#xD;
      followed-up with ultrasound or kub or CT plain scan.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>2020.1 -2020.12 patients with urolithiasis and hyperuricemia were enrolled in the urology department of our hospital (100 cases). The patients were informed of this study before operation and randomly divided into uric acid drug control group (n = 50) and non-drug control group (n = 50).&#xD;
For non-drug control group: Patients are advised to live regularly after operation, drink plenty of water, drink more than 2000ml every day, reduce the intake of high purine food and fructose-rich beverages, increase the intake of fresh vegetables, control weight and exercise regularly.&#xD;
Uric acid drug control group:or the uric acid control group, except that lifestyle changes were the same as those in the uric acid non-drug control group, non-drug uric acid control group was given febuxostat to reduce uric acid synthesis. Febuxostat is taken at a dose of 20 mg three times a week</intervention_model_description>
