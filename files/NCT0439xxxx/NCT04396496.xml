  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates the use of Daratumumab (DARA), an antibody directed at the human&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) molecule, for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, m Protein Component, Skin Changes (POEMS)&#xD;
      syndrome. This trial will enroll ten subjects, who will complete 12 four-week cycles of DARA,&#xD;
      in combination with the immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) lenalidomide. Objectives of this study&#xD;
      include improvement in neuropathy and performance status, as well as improvement in&#xD;
      laboratory values and survival.&#xD;

      improvement in laboratory values and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive DARA in the outpatient setting, with infusions being administered in&#xD;
      Infusion 4. Safety and response assessments will occur prior to Cycles 1 through 6, and at&#xD;
      the end of DARA treatment. Once DARA is completed, response assessments are completed every 6&#xD;
      months for the first year, then annually until disease progression. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      followed for overall survival.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have POEMS syndrome and meet the diagnostic criteria for POEMS syndrome&#xD;
             as described in Appendix I.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have preserved renal function as defined by a serum creatinine level&#xD;
             of &lt; 3 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have an ejection fraction by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated&#xD;
             acquisition (MUGA) scan ≥ 40 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≥ 1,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) ≥ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have signed an institutional review board (IRB)-approved informed&#xD;
             consent indicating their understanding of the proposed treatment and understanding&#xD;
             that the protocol has been approved by the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented allergy to lenalidomide, DARA, mannitol, other monoclonal antibodies or&#xD;
             human proteins and mammalian-derived products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with DARA or other CD38 monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) Multiple Myeloma (MM) involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other serious medical illness or&#xD;

             according to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor performance status will not be an exclusion criterion since POEMS patients can be&#xD;
             expected to have significant limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the&#xD;
             patient has not received treatment for one year prior to enrollment. Other cancers&#xD;
             will only be accepted if the patient's life expectancy exceeds five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and Female subjects and their partners of reproductive potential may not&#xD;
             participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive while on study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with POEMS syndrome, who do not have disseminated bone marrow (BM)&#xD;
             involvement and have an isolated plasmacytoma; these patients should be considered for&#xD;
             irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects has had major surgery within 2 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease, including myocardial infarction within the&#xD;
             past 6 months or unstable or uncontrolled conditions (e.g., unstable angina or&#xD;
             congestive heart failure) or other cardiac disease which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in the study. Some cardiac&#xD;
             dysfunction is expected in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [defined as a&#xD;
             forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted normal, forced vital&#xD;
             capacity (FVC), etc.] and diffusion capacity (DLCO) &lt; 40% of predicted.), known&#xD;
             moderate or severe persistent asthma within the last 2 years or currently has&#xD;
             uncontrolled asthma of any classification (controlled intermittent asthma or&#xD;
             controlled mild persistent asthma is allowed). Exception may be granted if the&#xD;
             principal investigator documents that the patient is a candidate for therapy since&#xD;
             alternative therapies will at least have similar or not more toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with known or suspected COPD must have an FEV1 test during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are seropositive for hepatitis B [defined by a positive test for&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)]. Subjects with resolved infection [i.e., subjects&#xD;
             who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen&#xD;
             (anti-HBc)] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) must be&#xD;
             screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B&#xD;
             virus (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION:&#xD;
             Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as&#xD;
             the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need&#xD;
             to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are seropositive for hepatitis C except in the setting of a sustained&#xD;
             virologic response (SVR), defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
