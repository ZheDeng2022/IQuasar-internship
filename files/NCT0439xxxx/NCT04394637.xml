      This research is being done to determine how well cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanning&#xD;
      measures of fat within the heart can predict abnormal heart rhythms and how well cardiac CT&#xD;
      can measure scar within the heart versus cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

      The investigators aim to investigate the role of intramyocardial fat on ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmogenesis. Intramyocardial fat deposition has been frequently observed in patients&#xD;
      with ischemic heart disease and is readily detectable by multi-detector computed tomography&#xD;
      (MDCT) with high sensitivity and specificity, unlike other modalities. Like intramyocardial&#xD;
      fat, reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) tends to occur late after the onset of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and the investigators hypothesize that lipomatous metaplasia within the infarct&#xD;
      may precipitate later onset ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Prior studies have shown that&#xD;
      intramyocardial fat correlates with slow myocardial conduction velocity and with critical&#xD;
      circuits for VA but the investigators do not know the causal relationship between&#xD;
      intramyocardial fat and future risk of VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramyocardial fat deposition or lipomatous metaplasia has been frequently observed in&#xD;
      patients with ischemic heart disease and is readily detectable by multi-detector computed&#xD;
      tomography (MDCT) with high sensitivity and specificity. Like intramyocardial fat, reentrant&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia (VT) tends to occur late after the onset of myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that there may be a causal relationship. Prior studies have&#xD;
      shown that intramyocardial fat correlates with slow myocardial conduction velocity and with&#xD;
      critical circuits for VT in patients referred for VT ablation who already manifest VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the correlation of intramyocardial fat on CT with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)&#xD;
      on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in a general population of patients with ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy with no prior history of VA has not been reported. Specifically, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether the presence, distribution and/or volume of fat is an independent predictor of VA.&#xD;
      Further CMR is less widely available in medical centers, and is more expensive with longer&#xD;
      scanning times compared to CT. CT provides higher spatial resolution, is widely available and&#xD;
      is not as susceptible to magnetic interference from internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
      generators and thus makes it an attractive imaging modality for risk stratification,&#xD;
      particularly longitudinally over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators' objective is to define the prevalence and distribution of&#xD;
      intramyocardial fat in patients with ischemic heart disease scheduled for or with in-situ&#xD;
      implantable defibrillators. Further, the investigators aim to assess the independent&#xD;
      association of intramyocardial fat with VA and determine whether it adds any utility above&#xD;
      LGE measured by CMR. Finally, the investigators will assess how well delayed enhanced CT&#xD;
      correlates with LGE on MRI and test its association with ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: The significance of the investigators' research is that the investigators will:&#xD;
      1) test whether intramyocardial fat on CT can be used as a non-invasive tool for sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death risk stratification in patients who have or are scheduled to undergo ICDs, and&#xD;
      2) define whether delayed enhancement CT is comparable to the current non-invasive gold&#xD;
      standard of CMR for identifying myocardial scar.&#xD;
