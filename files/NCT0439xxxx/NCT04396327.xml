  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      combination drug product (SM-1) containing diphenhydramine, zolpidem and lorazepam, in adult&#xD;
      participants who sometimes have difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep, but who do&#xD;
      not have chronic insomnia. Participants will receive SM-1 or a combination of diphenhydramine&#xD;
      and lorazepam during 2 one-night stays at a sleep center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a combination drug product containing&#xD;
      50 mg diphenhydramine, 5 mg zolpidem and 0.5 mg lorazepam on total sleep time, and to&#xD;
      determine the contribution of zolpidem to the combination, using a 3-hour Phase Advance model&#xD;
      of sleep challenge with 8 hours of polysomnographic (PSG) recording. This is a 2-arm,&#xD;
      2-period crossover trial including the 3-drug investigational product and a 2-drug&#xD;
      comparator. The 2 arms are: investigational combination product, and a 2-drug comparator&#xD;
      containing diphenhydramine and lorazepam but not zolpidem. Participants will be adults who&#xD;
      sometimes have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, but who are generally healthy and&#xD;
      do not have chronic insomnia or sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 14 subjects are planned to enroll in the study. Subjects who qualify for&#xD;
      participation will be asked to keep a sleep diary to document their sleep times leading up to&#xD;
      their first overnight stay in the sleep center and during the study. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to spend at least 7.5 hours in bed at a regular bedtime during the study. Qualifying&#xD;
      participants also will not anticipate traveling across 3 time zones, be involved in night&#xD;
      shift work, or significant disruptions in their sleep schedules during the study. The study&#xD;
      requires 2 one-night stays in a sleep center in New York City, for administration of the&#xD;
      study treatments and PSG &amp; EEG measurements. Qualifying subjects will anticipate being able&#xD;
      to return to the sleep center, located in Manhattan, for a total of 3 visits, including&#xD;
      initial screening and 2 treatment times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a follow up phone call from study staff 3 days after final dose of&#xD;
      study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each sleep center visit, subjects will arrive to the sleep center approximately 5&#xD;
      hours prior to their average usual bedtime and will be given their study treatment. Their&#xD;
      sleep will be monitored for 8 hours. Each subject will receive both treatments, although the&#xD;
      sequence of the 2 treatments will be randomized. Both subjects and study personnel monitoring&#xD;
      the subjects will be blinded to the identity of the treatment administered at each visit.&#xD;
