  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open label study of AB-106 in the Chinese&#xD;
      patients of NSCLC harboring with ROS1 fusion gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 parts. The Part 1 portion will evaluate the safety and PK profile&#xD;
      of AB-106 by using two doses of 400mg QD and 600mg QD in order to confirm 600mg QD as the&#xD;
      most optimal dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Part 2 portion will evaluate the efficacy and safety of AB-106 by using the most optimal&#xD;
      dose of 600mg QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to enroll 6 patients in Part 1 and 100 patients in Part 2. The study period of&#xD;
      each patient will be comprised of screening, treatment, safety follow-up and survival&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Part 1 portion, 3 patients will receive AB-106 400mg QD and 3 patients will receive&#xD;
      AB-106 600mg QD in 21-cycles to evaluate the safety and PK profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Part 2 portion, 100 patients will be enrolled and divided into 2 cohorts. 60&#xD;
      crizotinib-naïve patients will be enrolled in Cohort A and 40 crizotinib-pretreated patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AB-106 will be administered 600mg once daily in 21-day cycles. Patients will continue with&#xD;
      the study treatment until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor response evaluation will be conducted in every two cycles in the first 8 cycles,&#xD;
      and then every four cycles until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
      The long-term survival follow up will be conducted every 12 weeks.&#xD;
