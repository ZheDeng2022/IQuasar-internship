    <textblock>
      It is a quazai one arm study shows the impact of the role of the clinical pharmacists through&#xD;
      medication reconciliation to patients admitted to the emergency department .The main aim is&#xD;
      to show if the pharmacists intervention is associated with establishing a complete drug&#xD;
      history list than the list already presented in the patient file and taken by the physician&#xD;
      .Then a description of the medication errors detected will be done .&#xD;

      It is a quazai one arm study in which the pre phase is the detection of the complete and&#xD;
      accurate drug history list already presented in the patient file and taken by the physician&#xD;
      and the post phase is the detection of the complete and accurate drug history list taken by&#xD;
      the clinical pharmacists after medication reconciliation for the same patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      medication reconciliation will be done as a full diseases and preadmission medications&#xD;
      history will be taken from the patients or the family through interviews, revising previous&#xD;
      prescriptions and hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preadmission medication history will include medications trade names, doses, frequency&#xD;
           and route of administration and treatment duration and also will include the consumption&#xD;
           of vitamins or herbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medication errors will be detected ,calculated and classified according to&#xD;
           medication at transitions and clinical handoffs (MATCH) toolkit for medication&#xD;
           reconciliation.&#xD;
