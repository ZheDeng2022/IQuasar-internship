    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 600&#xD;
      mg oral TPOXX (3 × 200-mg capsules) administered twice daily (BID) for 7 days in adult&#xD;
      subjects weighing more than 120 kg to determine if a change in dosing regimen would be needed&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 600 mg&#xD;
      oral TPOXX administered BID for 7 days in healthy adult subjects weighing more than 120 kg.&#xD;
