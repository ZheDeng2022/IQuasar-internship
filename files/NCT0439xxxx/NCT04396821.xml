    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase 1, First in Human trial of TST001, a recombinant humanized&#xD;
      anti-Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) IgG1 monoclonal antibody. It is being tested against advanced&#xD;
      and/or metastatic solid tumors including gastric, gastroesophageal junction, pancreatic,&#xD;
      colon and lung cancers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the trial will consist of two cohorts, one dosed every 2 weeks and one dosed every&#xD;
      3 weeks in a standard 3+3 design. Part A is the dose finding portion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      27 to 54 participants will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B consists of 3 cohorts of approximately 20 participants each. For Part B, participants&#xD;
      must have CLDN18.2 expressing tumors to qualify for participation. Cohort 1 is for&#xD;
      participants with gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers and dosed every 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Cohort 2 is for participants with solid tumors except gastric and gastroesophageal cancers,&#xD;
      dosed every 2 weeks. Cohort 3 is for all solid tumors dosed every 3 weeks. Up to 60&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will last approximately 2 years, with assessments including safety labs, ECGs, MUGA&#xD;
      scans, PKs and PDs and CT/MRI tumor assessments, based on the Q2W and Q3W dosing schedules.&#xD;
