  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, but not well understood&#xD;
      complication to treatment with chemotherapy. In this study the investigators will investigate&#xD;
      a novel method for early detection of CIPN and compare it to other methods in patients&#xD;
      treated for haematological cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haematological malignancies can be treated with chemotherapy if the patient tolerates the&#xD;
      treatment. However, many patients develop complications during treatment including&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and/or impaired memory. Even though it is a&#xD;
      well-known complication, no gold standard for CIPN assessment is known. Besides chemotherapy&#xD;
      reduction or cessation, there is so far no sufficient prevention or treatment, therefore&#xD;
      early detection and intervention is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to find a reliable test for chemotherapy-induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (CIPN) in order to predict early signs of CIPN. All included patients has to be&#xD;
      scheduled for treatment with vincristine, bortezomib or lenalidomide regardless of&#xD;
      haematological malignancy. Neuropathy and cognitive impairment will be tested at baseline&#xD;
      (prior to treatment with chemotherapy), before each treatment course, 1 month after treatment&#xD;
      and finally 1 year after onset of chemotherapy. CIPN will be examined by different methods:&#xD;
      Clinician-based assessment, objective neurophysiological parameters and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome. A novel test using Perception Threshold Tracking (PTT), developed at Aalborg&#xD;
      University, is included in the study. The test investigates the nerve excitability in both&#xD;
      large and small fiber nerve fibers using two different electrodes. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected, stored, and analyzed for deficiencies correlated to neuropathy.&#xD;
