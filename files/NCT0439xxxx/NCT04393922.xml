    <textblock>
      Very often, people who have a SCI have difficulty doing things with their arms or hands as a&#xD;
      result of muscle stiffness , or spasticity. Spastacity can cause problems performing even the&#xD;
      simplest of everyday tasks. This research will help us understand how the body recovers and&#xD;
      changes neurologically after SCI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After spinal cord injury (SCI), damage to descending motor pathways has been associated with&#xD;
      the development of spasticity (Frigon and Rossignol, 2006; Trompetto et al., 2014).&#xD;
      Self-reported questionnaires and clinical exams indicate that individuals with incomplete&#xD;
      SCI, who showed residual descending connectivity, have a high prevalence of spasticity&#xD;
      compared to individuals with complete SCI (Little et al., 1989; Holtz et al., 2017). In&#xD;
      agreement, our recent electrophysiological and spinal cord imaging data in humans with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of a clinically motor complete SCI showed the presence of descending motor pathway&#xD;
      connectivity in individuals with spasticity compared to those without spasticity (Sangari et&#xD;
      al., 2019). However, which descending motor pathways influence spasticity following SCI, and&#xD;
      to what extent, remains poorly understood. This proposal has two main goals: 1) to examine&#xD;
      the contribution of cortico- and reticulo-spinal pathways to spasticity in upper and lower&#xD;
      limb muscles, and 2) to develop strategies to promote functional recovery of upper and lower&#xD;
      limb spastic muscles in humans with chronic incomplete SCI. The aims below will test two main&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, we will use transcranial magnetic stimulation and startle acoustic stimuli to&#xD;
      examine the contribution of the cortico- and reticulo-spinal pathway to upper and/or lower&#xD;
      limb muscles electromyographic activity. Spinal cord atrophy and morphological&#xD;
      characterization of cortico- and reticulo-spinal pathways will be assessed with&#xD;
      high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Physiological and neuroimaging outcomes will be&#xD;
      associated with clinical assessment of spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2, we propose to enhance cortico- and reticulo-spinal contribution to upper and/or&#xD;
      lower limb function in spastic muscles by using a novel intervention combining startle&#xD;
      acoustic stimuli with motor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide new knowledge about the contribution of descending motor pathways&#xD;
      to the control of spasticity in upper and lower limb muscles following incomplete cervical&#xD;
      SCI (Aim1) and might lead to the development of a novel rehabilitation intervention to&#xD;
      improve upper and lower limb motor function recovery by enhancing residual descending control&#xD;
      over spinal networks (Aim 2).&#xD;

When the LED will illuminate, individuals will be asked to move their arm or leg. In some trials, the LED will be presented with either a quiet acoustic stimulus (80 dB, 500 Hz, 50 ms) or a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS, 120 dB, 500 Hz, 50 ms) delivered through a headphone.</description>
