  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Single-arm, Phase I clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced&#xD;
      HER2+ breast cancer who have received standard anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic&#xD;
      setting (mandatory including trastuzumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is PK parameters of margetuximab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16~20 Chinese subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects are HER2 positive,&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer who has received standard anti-HER2 directed therapy in the&#xD;
      metastatic setting in Chinese patients. Subjects should have received treatment with at least&#xD;
      one, and no more than four lines of therapy overall in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive margetuximab plus chemotherapy. The dosage and administering&#xD;
      of margetuximab is 15 mg/kg IV Q3W. Investigators selected one of three backbone chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens given at standard doses: capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine. Subject will&#xD;
      receive the treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, initiation of subsequent anti-tumor treatment therapy, or death (whichever occurs&#xD;
      first).&#xD;
