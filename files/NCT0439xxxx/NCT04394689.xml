  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, single-centre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,&#xD;
      active-controlled, age de-escalation trial. Age de-escalation will be based on a review of&#xD;
      the safety data from the preceding cohort (adults for toddlers and toddlers for infants) up&#xD;
      to day 14 post study product administration by a data monitoring committee (DMC). All&#xD;
      participants will receive either the MRV-MNP and a placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) SC&#xD;
      injection (PLA-SC) or a placebo-MNP (PLA-MNP) and MRV by the SC route (MRV-SC). Only those&#xD;
      study staff randomizing participants and preparing the study products for administration will&#xD;
      be aware of the products administered. Those administering the study products, all other&#xD;
      trial staff and the participants and parents will be blinded to treatment group. 45 adults&#xD;
      (18 to 40-years-of-age) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio. Thus, 30 adults will receive&#xD;
      MRV-MNP and PLA-SC while 15 adults will receive MRV-SC and PLA-MNP. 120 toddlers (15 to 18&#xD;
      months-of-age) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Thus, 60 toddlers will receive MRV-MNP and&#xD;
      PLA-SC while the same number of toddlers will receive MRV-SC and PLA-MNP. 120 infants (9 to&#xD;
      10 months) will also be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Thus, 60 infants will receive MRV-MNP and&#xD;
      PLA-SC while the same number of infants will receive MRV-SC and PLA-MNP. Solicited local and&#xD;
      systemic AE will be collected daily from all participants from the day of study product&#xD;
      administration to day 13 post study product administration. Unsolicited AE and SAE will be&#xD;
      collected from the day of study product administration to day 180 post study product&#xD;
      administration. All participants will have laboratory investigations (hepatitis B, hepatitis&#xD;
      C, hematology and biochemistry) conducted as part of screening. Adults will have safety&#xD;
      laboratory investigations repeated on day seven and day 14 post study product administration.&#xD;
      Toddlers and infants will have safety laboratory investigations repeated on day seven post&#xD;
      study product administration. All participants will have measles- and rubella-specific SNA&#xD;
      titers and measles- and rubella-specific IgG concentrations measured at baseline and day 42&#xD;
      and 180 post study product administration. Other Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)&#xD;
      vaccines due in toddler (oral poliovirus vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and in&#xD;
      infants (oral poliovirus vaccine, yellow fever vaccine and MenAfriVac® [due at 12 months])&#xD;
      will be given by the investigator team at the day 42 study visit (V4).&#xD;
