  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a concept elicitation study to identify important aspects of pain assessment,&#xD;
      treatment, and response to treatment in children under than 3 years of age from a caregiver's&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to identify important endpoints and outcomes for use in&#xD;
      pediatric trials for acute pain therapeutics in infants and young children from a caregiver's&#xD;
      perception. Study team members will conduct phone-based qualitative interviews, using a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview guide, with 42 primary caregivers of pediatric patients under 3&#xD;
      years of age who are experiencing or have experienced acute pain. Once participants give&#xD;
      verbal consent, they will fill out a demographics form. Interviews will last about one hour&#xD;
      and will address the participant's experience recognizing and managing their child's acute&#xD;
      pain. The investigators will use these concept elicitation interviews to identify important&#xD;
      aspects of acute pain assessment, treatment, and response to treatment in children who are&#xD;
      under 3 years old. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed with participant&#xD;
      permission. Transcripts or interviewer notes will be reviewed by two analysts and will be&#xD;
      double coded until inter-rater reliability is reached by agreement of at least 80%. The study&#xD;
      team will conduct a thematic analysis of the coded transcripts. This is a minimal risk study.&#xD;
      All information will be kept confidential and information will be stored on a secure network&#xD;
      which is only accessible to the study team.&#xD;
