  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to develop protocols using FV urine that investigate in&#xD;
      vitro whether infectious virions can be neutralized by HPV vaccination.&#xD;

      In total 50 women will be included in this trial whereof 25 fully vaccinated with a&#xD;
      prophylactic HPV vaccine and 25 not vaccinated with a prophylactic HPV vaccine. These women&#xD;
      will be asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device (Novosanis).&#xD;
      Hereafter, a blood sample of 5-10 cc will be collected. HPV DNA positive women who gave their&#xD;
      consent to be contacted with the results, will later be contacted again and asked to provide&#xD;
      additional FV urine samples every day during 2 weeks. For this, urine collection devices&#xD;
      (Colli-PeeTM, Novosanis) will be provided by postal mail. The collected urine samples (and&#xD;
      blood sample as control for HPV antibodies) will be used for the development of protocols&#xD;
      within this project.&#xD;

        In total 50 women will be included in this trial. During their study visit, participants&#xD;
        are asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device. Hereafter, a&#xD;
        blood sample of 5-10 cc is collected. Following sample collection, women are asked to fill&#xD;
        in a questionnaire. HPV positive women who gave their consent to be contacted with the&#xD;
        results will later be again contacted and asked to provide additional FV urine samples&#xD;
        every day during 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since this is a unique pilot study, no specific data exist for sample size calculation.&#xD;
        However, the sample size is estimated based on HPV prevalence results from a surveillance&#xD;
        study in Belgium. From the 50 participating women (age 18-25), we expect 20% to be HPV DNA&#xD;
        positive.Taking possible dropouts into account, this will lead to approximately 5 HPV&#xD;
        infected women to provide samples during 14 days. Ultimately, we will obtain 120 samples to&#xD;
        be used to develop the intended protocols.&#xD;
