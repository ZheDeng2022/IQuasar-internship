  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well the combination of binimetinib and&#xD;
      encorafenib work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer with a somatic BRAF V600E&#xD;
      mutation. Binimetinib and encorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving binimetinib and encorafenib may work better&#xD;
      compared to the usual treatment in treating patients with pancreatic cancer and a somatic&#xD;
      BRAF V600E mutation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib as &gt;= 2nd line&#xD;
      of treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRAF V600E mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine in patients treated with the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib as &gt;=&#xD;
      2nd line of treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRAF V600E&#xD;
      mutation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. The median progression-free survival. Ib. The median overall survival. Ic. Duration of&#xD;
      response. Id. Time to response. Ie. The safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on days 1-25. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
