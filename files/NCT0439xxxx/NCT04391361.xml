  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients were recruited from the neurology&#xD;
      department of Ruijin Hospital, the pain department and the encephalopathy center of Luwan&#xD;
      Branch of Ruijin Hospital. After the informed consent was signed, they were divided into a&#xD;
      trial group and a control group. Each group contains 15 cases. The patients in the control&#xD;
      group was treated with edaravone dissolved in saline during hospitalization, while the&#xD;
      patients in the trial group was treated with edaravone, scopolamine, atropine and&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine. Both groups of subjects were treated for 7 days within 3 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      a buffer period of 3 weeks for observation, which was one treatment course. The total&#xD;
      treatment protocol contains 3 treatment courses (or 18 weeks). Patients with amyotrophic&#xD;
      lateral sclerosis were evaluated before treatment and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment. The observations include whether the functional scores of patients with&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Norris amyotrophic lateral sclerosis score, amyotrophic&#xD;
      lateral sclerosis self-score, forced expiratory volume in one second, partial pressure of&#xD;
      oxygen and maximum displacement of the hyoid were superior to those before treatment, and&#xD;
      whether the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was inferior to those before treatment. Study&#xD;
      hypothesis: Cholinergic receptor blocking therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe&#xD;
      and effective in improving motor function and delaying disease progression in patients with&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&#xD;
