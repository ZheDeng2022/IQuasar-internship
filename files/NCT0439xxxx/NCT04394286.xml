  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and dose escalation of SHP648 an&#xD;
      adeno-associated viral vector for gene transfer in hemophilia B participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consists of 3 dose cohorts with 2-7 participants in each of the three&#xD;
      ascending dose cohorts. Initially 2 participants will be dosed in Cohort 1, followed by&#xD;
      dosing of up to 5 additional participants if the cohort is expanded. Participants in cohort 2&#xD;
      and 3 will receive 2-fold or 3-fold dose escalation to their respective preceding cohort&#xD;
      doses if required.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Takeda has decided to not further develop the SHP648 (TAK-748) program. No subjects have been&#xD;
    dosed with SHP648. The decision to terminate study SHP648-101 is not due to any safety&#xD;
    concerns.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this investigational product (IP) or medicinal product. A Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death; Life-threatening event; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs include both serious and Non-serious adverse events. Number of participants with incidence and severity of AEs will be assessed.</description>
