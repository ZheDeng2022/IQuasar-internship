      Objective: To determine the effect that focusing attention on the plant, Maryam's Flower, has&#xD;
      on pregnant women's perception of pain, level of comfort and labor satisfaction during the&#xD;
      first phase of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted with an intervention&#xD;
      group (n=61) and control group (n=63) involving primipara pregnant women who were at 1 cm&#xD;
      cervical dilatation. The pregnant women in the intervention group were asked to focus their&#xD;
      attention on Maryam's flower opening its leaf buds and imagine the labor's progress during&#xD;
      the course of their labor. The control group only received standard midwifery care. Each&#xD;
      group was administered the VAS at specific times (at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm cervical&#xD;
      dilatation) to determine their level of labor pain. The Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CCQ) was also administered when the women were at 4-5 cm and 8-9 cm cervical dilatation to&#xD;
      determine their level of birth comfort. The duration of labor was monitored using a&#xD;
      partograph form. Finally, the Birth Satisfaction Scale was applied to determine the women's&#xD;
      satisfaction with the labor in the 2nd hour of the postpartum period.&#xD;

      Design and Settings This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted in the&#xD;
      delivery room of the Atatürk City Hospital in Balıkesir, Turkey between the dates of May 2019&#xD;
      and January 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The sample size was determined using G * Power 3 power calculations, taking into&#xD;
      consideration previous studies on the effect of positive mental imagination during labor.&#xD;
      Impact predictions were obtained from the findings derived from Yavari et al., which&#xD;
      specified the pain intensity during 6-7 cm cervical dilatation to be 6.73 ± 1.34 in the&#xD;
      positive mental imagination group, and 7.63 ± 1.64 in the control group (18). This study&#xD;
      expected to detect differences similar to those reported by Yavari et al. The sample size was&#xD;
      determined to be 61 for each group. Maryam's flower group included 61 pregnant women, while&#xD;
      the control group included 63 pregnant women. In the Maryam's flower group, 6 pregnant women&#xD;
      and in the control group, 2 pregnant women underwent cesarean sections, therefore, the study&#xD;
      was completed with 55 pregnant women from the Maryam's flower group and 61 pregnant women&#xD;
      from the control group (The pregnant women underwent cesarean sections after 6-7 cm cervical&#xD;
      dilatation). The power analysis indicated that the sample size of the study had a power of&#xD;
      94% with α = 0.05. The decrease observed in labor pain for the Maryam's flower group at 6-7&#xD;
      cm cervical dilatation had an effect size of 0.59 when compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study inclusion criteria included pregnant women who expected vaginal delivery and a single&#xD;
      healthy fetus, who were primipara and in the first phase of the labor, and who were at 1 cm&#xD;
      cervical dilatation. Pregnant women who were multipara, had a risky pregnancy, a child with&#xD;
      complications, multiple pregnancies, or a premature delivery and those who delivered after 1&#xD;
      cm cervical dilatation were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-blind block randomization was performed with closed opaque envelopes, where 61 of the&#xD;
      124 envelopes include pieces of paper on which were written &quot;intervention&quot; and 63 on which&#xD;
      were written &quot;control&quot;. The randomization sequence was determined by a statistician through a&#xD;
      computerized research randomizer. The intervention group focused on Maryam's flower&#xD;
      throughout the delivery, while the control group was provided standard midwifery care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The participating pregnant women who were in the first phase of labor and at&#xD;
      1 cm cervical dilatation were administered an introductory information form. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, Maryam's flower was placed in a bowl of water once the women were at 1 cm&#xD;
      cervical dilatation, and the pregnant women were asked to focus on the plant. Each group,&#xD;
      that is, the intervention group and the control group, were administered the Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS-1) when they were at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation and the Childbirth Comfort&#xD;
      Questionnaire, to detect their levels of birth comfort, and the VAS-2 when they were at 6-7&#xD;
      cm cervical dilatation. Once the women reached 8-10 cm cervical dilation, they were asked to&#xD;
      respond to the VAS-3 and Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire. The Birth Satisfaction Scale was&#xD;
      used to determine the level of postnatal satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures The study data were collected through the Pregnant Information Form, the VAS, the&#xD;
      Partograph form, the Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire, and the Birth Satisfaction Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pregnant Information Form (PIF): This form included questions on the sociodemographic,&#xD;
      gynecological, and obstetric characteristics of the pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS): This scale was used to determine the level of labor pain. The&#xD;
      scale features a 10-cm long vertical line, with 0 at the bottom end and 10 at the top end.&#xD;
      The VAS was administered when the women were at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-10 cm cervical&#xD;
      dilatation, and the women completed the scale themselves Partograph Form: This form was used&#xD;
      to determine the duration of the first phase of the labor process (active phase and&#xD;
      transition phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire (CCQ): This questionnaire was developed by Kerri Durnell&#xD;
      Schuling and Carolyn Sampselle in 2003 (7). The Turkish reliability and validity study of the&#xD;
      questionnaire was conducted by Potur et al. (2015) (11), who reported that the CCQ included&#xD;
      physical, environmental, and psychospiritual subscales and relief and transcendence levels.&#xD;
      The questionnaire features 9 items, each of which are evaluated based on a 5-point&#xD;
      Likert-type scale, where 1 represented strongly disagree and 5 represented strongly agree.&#xD;
      The minimum and maximum scores possible on the scale are 9 and 45, respectively, with higher&#xD;
      scores representing higher levels of comfort and lower scores representing lower levels.&#xD;
      Potur et al. found Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient to be 0.75. The CCQ was&#xD;
      administered twice in this study, once at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation and once at 8-9 cm&#xD;
      cervical dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Birth Satisfaction Scale (BSS): The Turkish reliability and validity study of this scale&#xD;
      developed by Hollins Martin and Fleming was conducted by Çoşar et al. (2015). The scale is a&#xD;
      Likert-type scale comprised of 30 questions. The minimum and maximum scores possible on the&#xD;
      scale are 30 and 150, respectively. Higher scores indicate higher birth satisfaction. An&#xD;
      analysis conducted to determine the internal consistency of the BSS found the Cronbach's&#xD;
      alpha value to be 0.62. The BSS was administered at the 2nd hour of the postnatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Maryam's flower was placed in a bowl of water and left in the room of the&#xD;
      pregnant women who were at 1 cm cervical dilatation and in the first phase of the labor. It&#xD;
      was explained to the pregnant women that the leaves of the plant would open up in the water,&#xD;
      and they were asked to imagine that the birth canal would simultaneously open up. In effect,&#xD;
      they were told to focus on the opening of these leaves during the course of the labor&#xD;
      (Pictures 1 and 2). All the pregnant women, those in the control group and in intervention&#xD;
      group, were provided with standard midwifery care. As part of the standard midwifery care&#xD;
      given to the pregnant women, follow-up of cervical dilatation and effacement, contraction,&#xD;
      fetal heart rate, and vital signs were monitored. The pregnant women were given information&#xD;
      on breathing and pushing techniques. Moreover, induction was performed on all the pregnant&#xD;
      women. in labor.&#xD;
