  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, first-in-human phase I dose escalation study. HH2853 will&#xD;
      be administered orally on a continuous BID schedule on a continuous 28-day treatment cycle.&#xD;
      The accelerated titration (ATD) incorporated with Bayesian Optimal Interval design (BOIN)&#xD;
      will be used to assess the DLT, safety, tolerability, MTD and furthermore, to establish the&#xD;
      RP2D.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study of HH2853 will be conducted in patients with non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphomas or patients with advanced solid tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to&#xD;
      prior therapies and have a high degree of unmet medical need in terms of available treatment&#xD;
      options. The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) and preliminary efficacy of HH2853 administered orally on a continuous twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) schedule in adult patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas or&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

    <description>HH2853 is supplied as tables with dosage strength of 25mg and 200mg. HH2853 is administered orally on a continuous BID schedule in 28-day treatment cycles. Patients in accelerated titration part (ATD) should be administered a single dose on the first day in order to evaluate the PK of a single dose administration. Dosing is twice daily from the second day thereafter.</description>
