      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of three novel digital health&#xD;
      technologies versus usual care in the management of congestive heart failure, as assessed by&#xD;
      a primary outcome of improvement in quality of life, and a variety of secondary outcomes that&#xD;
      include metrics measuring patient and provider satisfaction, clinical efficiency, and patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and in&#xD;
      Western Europe. However, patient etiology and prognosis varies considerably, and guidance&#xD;
      about how to best treat patients has relied on large clinical trials that only include&#xD;
      snapshots of the syndrome (at the time the patient interaction with the healthcare system).&#xD;
      It remains to be seen whether behavioral interventions can improve patient engagement,&#xD;
      increase self-management of the conditions, and thus improve overall clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital health technologies have a great potential to streamline and optimize the clinical&#xD;
      management of heart failure. Such technologies can take the form of mobile applications or&#xD;
      wearable devices that may provide both patients and providers with valuable real-time&#xD;
      information about patient status and cardiovascular health, provide automated&#xD;
      patient-tailored coaching and motivational tools, or a mix of both. Integration of these&#xD;
      technologies into healthcare systems may allow for genuine engagement of the patient in their&#xD;
      own care and management of their disease and/or enhance clinical decision making. To date, no&#xD;
      prior study has comprehensively examined the ability of digital heath technologies to improve&#xD;
      self-management of heart failure or subsequent clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an unblinded, 4-arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial to measure the&#xD;
      efficacy of four digital health technologies in improving the management of care and quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients actively managed by one of&#xD;
      Yale New Haven Hospital's heart failure-based clinics will be eligible for this study and&#xD;
      approached for consent. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of four groups: a control&#xD;
      (usual care) arm, or to one of three intervention arms, each of which assesses one of three&#xD;
      digital health technologies. These technologies are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BodyPort: A data-driven smart scale that provides enhanced cardiac monitoring and risk&#xD;
           assessment data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Noom: A live, data-driven coaching application providing personalized diet and weight&#xD;
           management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversa: An automated conversational platform providing patient motivation and&#xD;
           educational tools for CHF management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in the study for 6 months. The first three months will typically&#xD;
      involve active clinic management and will be the point of our primary outcome assessment,&#xD;
      while the final three months will assess stability of effect on patient care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the rate of improvement in quality of life after 90 days&#xD;
      post-enrollment, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). A&#xD;
      variety of prespecified secondary outcomes will be measured to determine effects on patient&#xD;
      outcomes, quality of care, clinical efficiency, and provider and patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      the product.&#xD;
