    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will follow the neurodevelopmental outcome of children with&#xD;
      in utero ZIKV exposure who do not have microcephaly or severe abnormalities consistent with&#xD;
      Congenital Zika Syndrome. The ZIKV-exposed children will be compared to non-ZIKV exposed&#xD;
      controls. Children will be assessed at age 3 and 4 years using standardized&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental assessments. Children will also have neurodevelopmental assessment at age&#xD;
      5 and 7 years along with a brain MRI at age 7 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zika-virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy can result in severe brain damage in 4-12% of cases.&#xD;
      Children exposed to ZIKV in utero during the years of 2015-2017 are now in early childhood.&#xD;
      Children with severe neurologic injury (Congenital Zika Syndrome; CZS) have a poor&#xD;
      developmental outcome, however the developmental outcome of apparently normal infants&#xD;
      following in utero ZIKV-exposure is not well known. The incidence of abnormal&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome in apparently normal children with in utero ZIKV-exposure is not&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine if neurodevelopmental assessment scores in children exposed&#xD;
      to ZIKV in utero who are normal appearing differ from norms. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that ZIKV-exposed normal appearing children will have lower multi-domain developmental&#xD;
      assessment scores compared to normative samples. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      presence of mild postnatal non-specific cranial US findings is associated with persistent&#xD;
      lower developmental assessment scores compared to ZIKV-exposed children who had normal&#xD;
      cranial US and quantitative imaging will find structural and functional brain differences&#xD;
      between ZIKV-exposed children and controls..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a prospective developmental outcome study at 2 sites: 1)&#xD;
      Department of Atlántico, Colombia through collaboration with BIOMELAB, the research center of&#xD;
      Dr. Carlos Cure, and 2) Children's National, Washington, DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine whether children who were exposed to ZIKV in utero&#xD;
      and who do not have CZS have abnormalities in neurodevelopment during early childhood and at&#xD;
      school age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome at early childhood will be neurodevelopmental assessment scores at age 3&#xD;
      and 4 years. Scores will be compared between Zika-exposed children and controls. The primary&#xD;
      outcome at school age will be neurodevelopmental assessment scores at age 5 and 7 years and&#xD;
      quantitative brain MRI at 7 years.&#xD;

    <description>Seventy children in Colombia were previously enrolled as part of a fetal-neonatal neuroimaging study in 2016-2017 and were from Department of Atlantico, Colombia on the Caribbean coast. Eligible children had prior normal fetal MRI and fetal US, normal birth head circumference, normal clinical exam, no more than mild non-specific postnatal imaging findings, and are thus without findings of CZS.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Colombia Non-ZIKV exposed control</arm_group_label>
    <description>The investigators will enroll 70 non-ZIKV exposed children, age 4 to 5 years, in Department of Atlántico, Colombia with birth dates prior to March 31, 2016. Based on the arrival of ZIKV to Colombia in November 2015, this date would ensure a control cohort without congenital ZIKV exposure in the first half of gestation and unlikely during any of the pregnancy.</description>
