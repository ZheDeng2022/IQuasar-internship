  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy on adherence of a community-informed intervention for&#xD;
      tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) engagement among&#xD;
      street-based female sex workers (FSW) in Baltimore, Maryland.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective two-group trial comparing the efficacy of a comprehensive PrEP&#xD;
      adherence program compared to PrEP standard of care among FSW. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      through self-reported PrEP adherence as well as biological adherence indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention includes three main components: 1) group PrEP engagement sessions, which&#xD;
      include four educational sessions that situate PrEP in a broader framework of access and&#xD;
      barriers to care, provider/patient communication, sexual health, HIV/sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infection (STI) education, harm reduction around drug use, stigma, risk compensation and safe&#xD;
      sex, and health/science literacy; 2) peer navigation, which aims to help women navigate&#xD;
      healthcare engagement with the SPARC nurse practitioner and other providers; and 3) an&#xD;
      mHealth component, consisting of a two-way text messaging system through which women will&#xD;
      receive automated daily messages and weekly messages requesting adherence reports.&#xD;
