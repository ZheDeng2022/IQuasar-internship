  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China is a country with a large incidence of esophageal cancer. The prevalence and mortality&#xD;
      rate of esophageal cancer in China ranks fifth in the world. However, due to China's huge&#xD;
      population base, new patients with esophageal cancer and deaths account for about 55% of the&#xD;
      world. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab Combined With&#xD;
      Concurrent Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for Treatment of Patients With Local Recurrence of&#xD;
      Esophageal Cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined&#xD;
      with Concurrent Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective to study patients with local recurrence of esophageal cancer after radical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take progression free survival (PFS) as the main efficacy index, and plan to&#xD;
      enroll about 62 patients with local recurrence of esophageal cancer after radical treatment.&#xD;
      After fully informed and signed the informed consent, the subjects will enter the&#xD;
      experimental stage after screening.&#xD;
