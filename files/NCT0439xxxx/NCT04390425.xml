  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently a standard tourniquet pressure is used for orthopedic surgeries. High tourniquet&#xD;
      pressure had been associated with adverse side effects such as ischemia, muscle weakness, and&#xD;
      post operative pain. Limb Occlusion Pressure, LOP, is based off the patient's systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure plus a safety margin and is typically much lower than standard tourniquet pressure.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if using LOP during orthopedic surgeries decreases&#xD;
      post-operative pain and opioid consumption and improves patient's outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start for each subject in the clinic setting during a standard pre-operative&#xD;
      office visit. Consent for the study will be obtained after explaining all aspects of the&#xD;
      study. The subjects will be randomly separated into two groups. Half of the subjects will&#xD;
      have their procedure performed under standard tourniquet pressure, and the other half of the&#xD;
      subjects will have their procedure performed with a distal photoplenthysmography probe that&#xD;
      will calculate Limb Occlusion Pressure and inflate the tourniquet to the calculated Limb&#xD;
      Occlusion Pressure. The subject will undergo their scheduled procedure in the operating room.&#xD;
      The subject will also keep a daily pain and opioid consumption diary at home for two weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery. The subject will complete patient outcome questionnaires before the&#xD;
      surgery, two weeks after the operation, and 8 weeks after the operation to assess patient&#xD;
      outcomes. The subject can complete the questionnaires at home, but if they do not, they will&#xD;
      have the option to fill the out during their clinic visits. The patient's pre and post OP&#xD;
      questionaries' will be the indicators for patient outcomes. All of the standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires give calculated scores based off the patients' responses. As the subject&#xD;
      improves their score will increase.The research team can compare change in score between the&#xD;
      two groups and change with in groups to access patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the double blind nature of the study, the tourniquet will be placed, inflated,&#xD;
      and draped over before the surgeon enters the operating room. Someone else on the research&#xD;
      team, one of the coordinators or one of the residents will record the patients' systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure and cuff pressure of the tourniquet before the attending enters the OR. This&#xD;
      way the surgeon is still blind to the cuff pressure technique used, LOP or STP, when they&#xD;
      rate the quality of the bloodless field after the surgery using a VAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these documents are attached on the summary page under additional documents on the&#xD;
      Psycho-Physiological Testing page under number 1. List all the measures/instruments that will&#xD;
      be used for this study. The VAS pain and opioid consumption diary is titled LOP pain diary&#xD;
      cover page and LOP pain diary. The questionnaires that will be used are DASH, IKDC Subject&#xD;
      Knee Evaluation Form, KOOS Junior, KOOS Lysholm, Marx, Michigan Hand Outcomes, Patient Rated&#xD;
      Wrist Evaluation, Promis Bank v 1.2 Physical Function, PROMIS SF v 1.1 Global Health, and&#xD;
      Tegner Activity Level Scale.&#xD;
