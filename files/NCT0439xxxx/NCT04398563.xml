  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Heart failure above 70 years of age is 10% and 5 year mortality rate above&#xD;
      60%, higher than for cancer. The readmission rate first after hospitalisation is 44% despite&#xD;
      the availability of life prolonging and life quality enhancing treatment. There is a lack of&#xD;
      resources for adequate diagnostic workup necessary for implementing evidence-based treatment.&#xD;
      This projects aims at assessing the impact of guidelines based diagnostic workup and&#xD;
      guidelines based treatment of heart failure on mortality and readmission rates. As the&#xD;
      symptoms defining the degree of heart failure and the discharge medication only is available&#xD;
      in the electronic patient files, artificial intelligence is used to retrieve this information&#xD;
      to assess if treatment is according to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is using first a rule based text processing approach using IBM Watson, then&#xD;
      advancing to a machine learning approach using readmission and mortality as endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has access to digitally stored echocardiographic measurements as well as digital&#xD;
      ECG's and lab data on 15 000 patients admitted with a diagnosis of Heart failure. If the&#xD;
      retrieval of symptoms and function by artificial intelligence is successful, the next step is&#xD;
      to assess if those benefitting the most from echocardiography can be identified using&#xD;
      information from the ECG's, lab data or symptoms and functional capacity as described in the&#xD;
      Electronic Health Records.&#xD;

        All patients admitted to a University Hospital serving a population of approx. 600 000&#xD;
        inhabitants with heart failure diagnosis in the period 2007 to 2019. In total 14998&#xD;
        patients. Mortality according to The Norwegian Death Registry for all up until 31st of&#xD;
