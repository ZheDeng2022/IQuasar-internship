  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is proposed to be prevalent in community-dwelling older adults, with&#xD;
      prevalence substantially higher among older adults in residential care facilities.&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal health is compromised in older vitamin D deficient individuals and alongside&#xD;
      frailty, sarcopenia and osteoporosis associated with ageing, affected individuals are at&#xD;
      increased risk of falls and fractures. Vitamin D supplementation is an effective intervention&#xD;
      for fall prevention and, along with calcium supplementation, in fracture risk reduction in&#xD;
      institutionalised older adults. Thus, monitoring vitamin D status and treating deficiency&#xD;
      among older adults in residential care facilities may limit the substantial economic burden&#xD;
      associated with falls/fractures in this population. The vitamin D status of older adults in&#xD;
      residential care facilities in Northern Ireland (NI) is currently unknown, therefore, the aim&#xD;
      of this pilot study is to determine the vitamin D status of this cohort of the population,&#xD;
      and to define factors which may influence vitamin D status, including body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      mobility out-of-doors, medication use, dementia and diet. Vitamin D status will be determined&#xD;
      via the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D using liquid chromatography-tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In addition, biomarkers associated with vitamin D metabolism will be&#xD;
      measured including calcium, albumin, creatinine, urea, bone turnover markers and parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone. Factors that may affect vitamin D status will be assessed using a health and&#xD;
      lifestyle questionnaire and dietary vitamin D intake will be estimated via analysis of the&#xD;
      menus in the residential care facilities. Vitamin D supplementation practices in these&#xD;
      facilities will also be assessed via analysis of drug prescription records, focusing on&#xD;
      differences between residents who have/have not suffered a fracture. Physical measures such&#xD;
      grip strength, timed up and go test and T-score measurement via Achilles ultrasound machine&#xD;
      will be taken. This study will provide data on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in&#xD;
      older adults in residential care facilities within NI and identify factors that predispose&#xD;
      residents to increased risk of deficiency. Dissemination of these findings, along with&#xD;
      analysis of current supplementation practices, will help practitioners to develop a strategy&#xD;
      to identify those residents with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and thus requiring&#xD;
      supplementation ultimately improving health and well-being. This study will also inform the&#xD;
      design of a larger study to investigate vitamin D status, supplementation and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      health in older adults in residential care facilities within Northern Ireland, providing&#xD;
      important information that will ultimately contribute towards reducing falls and fractures&#xD;
      within this population.&#xD;
