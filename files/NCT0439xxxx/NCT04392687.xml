  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnoses processes of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) focus on the following four&#xD;
      main types of diagnoses methods consisting of inspection, listening and smelling, inquiry,&#xD;
      and palpation. The most important one is palpation also called pulse diagnosis which is to&#xD;
      measure wrist artery pulse by TCM doctor's fingers to detect patient's health state. The&#xD;
      pulse diagnosis has three parts, namely 'Cun', 'Guan' and 'Chi', with the location. Wrist&#xD;
      measurements correspond to different parts of the body's organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the pulse information is analyzed by TCM doctor's pulse diagnoses process, which is&#xD;
      picked only a single waveform from a long-term pulse measured process and often discarded the&#xD;
      other waveforms contained in the same information, e.g. Slippery Pulse waveform. The research&#xD;
      object of this project is to divide the TCM diagnosis patients into two groups, one is the&#xD;
      Slippery Pulse group and the other is a Normal Pulse group, in which 30 cases are collected&#xD;
      in each group. The purpose of this project will integrate the TCM doctor's experiences and&#xD;
      standardize them in order to construct an effective Slippery Pulse diagnosis system. It could&#xD;
      refine Slippery Pulse diagnoses processes and reduce their diagnoses loading by using the&#xD;
      proposed approach during this project. Therefore, we could carry out the research on feature&#xD;
      extraction method of Slippery Pulse based on the image processing technology. We could&#xD;
      extract the pulse characteristics of Slippery Pulse automatically from the many measurement&#xD;
      signals and improve the automatic judging ability of the current pulse instrument to the&#xD;
      Slippery pulse waveform. Provide important pulse information to the TCM doctors as an&#xD;
      important reference for clinical diagnoses.&#xD;
