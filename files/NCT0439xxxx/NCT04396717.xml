  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pritumumab is a human IgG1 kappa antibody that binds to a malignant tumor associated antigen,&#xD;
      ecto domain-vimentin (EDV) which is expressed in a variety of tumor cells. Pritumumab was&#xD;
      shown to have relatively high reactivity with brain cancer cell lines, while no reactivity&#xD;
      was demonstrated with normal neurons, astrocytes or fetal cerebral cells. Pritumumab has&#xD;
      notable antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), brain tumor penetration and&#xD;
      antitumor activity in nude mouse human xenograft models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and/or tolerability and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      escalating, intravenously (IV) administered Pritumumab doses in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      gliomas or with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Pritumumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify preliminary signals of anti-tumor response to Pritumumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore disease-related, patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, outpatient, dose escalation study of Pritumumab in patients&#xD;
      with brain cancer who have failed prior therapy and have no other available options. In the&#xD;
      first part of the study, escalating doses of Pritumumab of 1.6, 4.8, 8.0, 12.0, and 16.2&#xD;
      mg/kg will be administered in a sequential, safety-driven manner to eligible patients&#xD;
      according to standard 3+3 scheme, as an 1-hour IV infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each&#xD;
      28-day treatment cycle. The dose levels may be modified upon obtained results. Once the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an expansion cohort including 6-12 patients in&#xD;
      selected tumor type at a dose equal or below to MTD is planned to determine the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D). A total of 42 patients may be administered with Pritumumab in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with Pritumumab for a maximum of 6 cycles or until cancer&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed after treatment completion&#xD;
      every four months or until death or lost to follow-up. Standard clinical, laboratory and&#xD;
      functional assessments will be employed to monitor for safety, tolerability and tumor&#xD;
      response, including blood sampling for clinical biochemistries, pharmacokinetics, CSF and&#xD;
      tissue samples, at frequency specified by the protocol. Patient-reported outcomes will also&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
