  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of multilevel factors on the quality of&#xD;
      screening colonoscopy, reflected mainly by adenoma detection rate (ADR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will include patients who need to screening colonoscopies by 21 endoscopists&#xD;
      between January 2019 and December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled in this unit. Multilevel&#xD;
      factors, including patient-, proceduralist-, and procedure-level characteristics were&#xD;
      analyzed for the relationship with ADR.&#xD;
