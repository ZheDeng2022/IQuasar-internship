  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood circulation within bone is thought to have a key role in bone growth, in fracture&#xD;
      healing and in the development of bone diseases like osteoporosis. Current medical imaging&#xD;
      techniques such as conventional ultrasonography fail to detect blood circulation within bone.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to develop a new type of ultrasonography called intraosseous&#xD;
      functional ultrasonography that will enable the detection and the characterization of blood&#xD;
      circulation in solid bone tissue, marrow and soft tissues surrounding bone (muscle for&#xD;
      instance). Because most soft tissues are essentially made of water, the speed of sound in&#xD;
      soft tissues is close to that in water and it varies only a little between different types of&#xD;
      soft tissues. For this reason, clinical ultrasound scanners used for ultrasonography assume&#xD;
      that the speed of sound in the human body is the same for all types of soft tissues. This&#xD;
      assumption is reasonable in soft tissues, but it does not hold in bone because solid bone&#xD;
      tissue is much stiffer than soft tissues. Seismologists have extensive experience in&#xD;
      producing images of the structure of the Earth based on the analysis of elastic waves which&#xD;
      follow the same laws of Physics as ultrasound waves. The subsurface of the Earth contains&#xD;
      layers of solid materials and liquids, consequently it is very similar to a region of the&#xD;
      human body containing bone and soft tissues. Therefore the investigators will first work on&#xD;
      the adaption of time-tested seismic imaging methods to make ultrasonography of bone possible.&#xD;
      Once a correct image of bone is obtained, the investigators will use an ultrasound scanner&#xD;
      dedicated to research to repeat this image hundreds of times per second, very much like a&#xD;
      slow motion video. Because blood is moving while bone is still, the intensity in the image is&#xD;
      being slightly changed where blood is moving. Thus the analysis of these changes makes it&#xD;
      possible to detect and characterize blood flow within bone. In this way the investigators&#xD;
      expect to be able to detect blood flowing with a speed as low as a few millimeters per&#xD;
      second. Finally the sensitivity of the technique to detect and characterize blood circulation&#xD;
      in bone will be evaluated in patients at the hospital and in healthy volunteers. The success&#xD;
      of this work will help gaining knowledge on the role of blood circulation within bone. In the&#xD;
      long term, it may help in the diagnosis of bone diseases.&#xD;
