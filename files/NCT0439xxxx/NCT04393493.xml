  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a patient with type 1 cardiorenal syndrome, we tried to compare two Furosemide strategies:&#xD;
      both with a morning bolus, and randomized in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Furosemide 80 mg every 24 hrs (morning) intravenously every 24 hrs for 4 consecutive&#xD;
      days, additionally:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2 Furosemide 200mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 Furosemide 300mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 4 Furosemide 400mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Furosemide 80 mg every 24 hrs (morning) intravenously every 24 hrs for 4 consecutive&#xD;
      days, additionally:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone&#xD;
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 50mg VO every 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone&#xD;
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 50mg VO every 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone&#xD;
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 50mg VO every 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 4 furosemide 100mg / day infused with 100cc of Hartmann solution + Chlortalidone&#xD;
           50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 50mg VO every 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ution + Chlortalidone 50mg VO every 24 hours + Spironolactone 25mg VO every 24 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the primary objective of improving renal function measured by serum creatinine, as&#xD;
      secondary objectives the efficacy in vascular decongestion and electrolyte alterations.&#xD;
