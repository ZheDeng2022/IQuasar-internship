    <textblock>
      Activation of anti-tumor immune response using programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)blockade&#xD;
      showed benefit only in a fraction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Specific&#xD;
      blockade of vascular endothelial receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) using a murine antibody significantly&#xD;
      delayed primary tumor growth but failed to prolong survival. Combining PD-1 blockade with&#xD;
      antiangiogenesis has shown promise in substantially increasing the fraction of HCC patients&#xD;
      who respond to treatment in vitro. Based on these clinical data, we are aimed to&#xD;
      investigation the safety and efficacy of combination therapy for HCC patients.&#xD;
