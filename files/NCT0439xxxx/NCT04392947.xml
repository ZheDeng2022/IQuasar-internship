  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled multicenter clinical trial. The aim is to&#xD;
      provide evidence for efficacy of TBS in the treatment of patients with major depression.&#xD;
      There will be a direct comparison between combined cTBS/iTBS with sham TBS. Overall, 236&#xD;
      patients with major depression will be randomized either to active TBS or sham TBS in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. The planned stimulation paradigms will be applied as add-on therapy to standard&#xD;
      therapy (antidepressive medication and / or psychotherapy). Patients will receive 30&#xD;
      stimulation sessions in a 6-week treatment period (one session daily from Monday to Friday).&#xD;
      Follow up assessments are scheduled 1 and 3 months after end of treatment period.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The usage of a special active/placebo (A/P) coil in combination with an electrical co-stimulation will guarantee masking.&#xD;
A hard cover surrounds the A/P coil and for this reason it is not possible to see which side is the active side of the coil. By entering a randomized code into the stimulator, the operator receive information whether the coil is in the correct position or has to be flipped around. The code does not allow third parties to identify to which study arm a patient has been assigned. The concealment of the assignment remains until the statistical analysis is finished.</masking_description>

    <description>Combined theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the left (intermittent TBS, iTBS) and right (continuous TBS, cTBS) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; F3 and F4 according to EEG10/20 system). Each stimulation session will comprise 2 trains of 600 stimuli each applied in bursts of three pulses at 50 Hz given every 200 ms. iTBS will be applied 20 times for 2 s every 10 s. In the same session, stimulation with cTBS will be applied continuously for 40 s. Intensity of iTBS/cTBS will be standardized at 80 % of the resting motor threshold (rMT).&#xD;
Additionally, patients receive an electrical co-stimulation of the forehead. One electrode is fixed to FZ and the 2nd one is either fixed to the left forehead (iTBS) or the right forehead (cTBS), rectangular aligned to the upper edge of the FZ-electrode with a distance of 0.5 cm. Intensity of the co-stimulation is applied with 50% of TBS-intensity.</description>
