    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percent Body Surface Area (BSA) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12 (from the data retrieved and observed in approximately 2.8 months of this study)</time_frame>
    <description>Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in affected area of a body region was counted. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint equal to (=) 10 percent (%) for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%. Higher % BSA = greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12 (from the data retrieved and observed in approximately 2.8 months of this study)</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12 (from the data retrieved and observed in approximately 2.8 months of this study)</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximum disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4 and Month 12 (from the data retrieved and observed in approximately 2.8 months of this study)</time_frame>
    <description>Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in affected area of body region was counted. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck,20 for upper limbs,30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint = 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. % BSA for body region=total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%. Higher % BSA=greater severity of psoriasis. This outcome measure evaluated comparison in % BSA between participants adherent and not adherent to treatment at Baseline, Month 4 and 12.</description>

BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in affected area of a body region was counted. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint equal to (=) 10 percent (%) for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%. Higher % BSA = greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Month 12</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximum disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in affected area of body region was counted. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck,20 for upper limbs,30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint = 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. % BSA for body region=total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%. Higher % BSA=greater severity of psoriasis.

        <title>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Baseline, Month 4 and Month 12 in Participants Adherent and Not Adherent to Treatment</title>
        <description>DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants. This outcome measure evaluated comparison in DLQI score between participants adherent and not adherent to treatment at Baseline, Month 4 and 12.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4 and Month 12 (from the data retrieved and observed in approximately 2.8 months of this study)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on all participants whose data were included in this study for retrospective observation. Here, &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable at specific time points.</population>

        <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Baseline, Month 4 and Month 12 in Participants Adherent and Not Adherent to Treatment</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximum disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. This outcome measure evaluated comparison in PASI score between participants adherent and not adherent to treatment at Baseline, Month 4 and 12.</description>

        <description>Four body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's full palmer hand) fitting in affected area of a body region was counted. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint = 10 % for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%. Higher % BSA = greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score at Month 4</title>
        <description>The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both, &quot;lesion severity&quot; and the &quot;percent of BSA&quot; affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks]), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 (no disease) to 72.0 (maximum disease), with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis.</description>
