  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current planning for studies involving patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastasized&#xD;
      cervical cancer must take into consideration that up to 75% of all patients are assumed to&#xD;
      have already been treated with cisplatin in conjunction with radiation therapy. It seems&#xD;
      questionable to continue to treat patients with cisplatin when cancer has recurred. Thus, it&#xD;
      is important to seek alternative active combinations. The studies GOG 169 and 179&#xD;
      demonstrated that a combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin was superior to a cisplatin&#xD;
      monotherapy with respect to therapeutic response and progression-free survival, as was a&#xD;
      combination of topotecan and cisplatin with respect to therapeutic response, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, and total survival. To achieve further improvement in total survival and to answer&#xD;
      questions regarding the value of using a platinum-free combination, we propose that a study&#xD;
      should be conducted to compare the efficacy of a platinum-free combination of paclitaxel and&#xD;
      topotecan to a combination of cisplatin and topotecan.&#xD;

      Design: This will be a prospective, randomized, multicenter, non-blinded phase III A study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosages: Arm A Paclitaxel 70 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1, 8, and 15 in combination with Topotecan&#xD;
      1.75 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1, 8, and 15, q 28 d Arm B Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1- 3&#xD;
      in combination with Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v. on Day 1, q 21 d Duration of Therapy: Each&#xD;
      patient will participate in the study until a maximum of six cycles have been completed, or&#xD;
      until there is evidence of disease progression, or until toxicity prevents further therapy.&#xD;
      Patients with continued response or stable disease may continue to participate in the study&#xD;
      for an additional 3 cycles beyond the original 6 cycles with consent of the Study Director,&#xD;
      but this must be documented in the CRF.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed recurrent, persistent, or metastasized&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, for&#xD;
             which a curative treatment by operation and/or radiation therapy is not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been previously treated with cisplatin in the context of&#xD;
             radiochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must present with measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as a&#xD;
             minimum of one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
             (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm when measured by&#xD;
             conventional techniques, including palpation, x-ray, CT, and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when&#xD;
             measured by spiral CT. Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; that can be&#xD;
             used to evaluate response according to RECIST criteria during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  When a biopsy is performed, it should be performed on this lesion. A lesion outside of&#xD;
             the irradiated area should ideally be selected as the &quot;target lesion&quot; on patients who&#xD;
             have tumors both inside and outside a previously irradiated area. A previously&#xD;
             irradiated lesion may only be considered as a &quot;target lesion&quot; if, after the radiation&#xD;
             therapy had been completed, this lesion objectively led to a diagnosis of recurrence,&#xD;
             or progress specific to this lesion was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must display the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sufficient hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  500/μl; granulocytes &gt; 3,000/μl; thrombocytes ≥ 100,000/μl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sufficient renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl. In patients with a serum&#xD;
                  A prospective, randomized phase III study to compare the effects of Paclitaxel&#xD;
                  and Topotecan to those of Cisplatin and Topotecan for treatment of patients with&#xD;
                  recurrent or persistent cervical cancer Page 24 Study Protocol Version 1.1 dated&#xD;
                  09/25/2006 creatinine of &gt; 1.2 mg/dl, the results of a 24-hour creatinine&#xD;
                  clearance must yield a level &gt; 50 cm3/min for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sufficient liver function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal, GOT, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must display an ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Karnofsky &gt; 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have recovered from the aftereffects of any surgery, radiation&#xD;
                  therapy, or chemotherapy. A minimum of six weeks must have passed since the last&#xD;
                  administration of chemotherapy, and at least three weeks must have passed since&#xD;
                  the last treatment with radiation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have signed an official consent document which also authorizes the&#xD;
                  release of personal health information. Patients unable to give their consent&#xD;
                  independently may not participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must fulfill all the requirements defined in Section 8.1, including&#xD;
                  completion of a baseline quality of life questionnaire, prior to their inclusion&#xD;
                  in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must be free of clinically significant infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bilateral hydronephrosis which cannot be alleviated by ureteral stents&#xD;
             or percutaneous drainage. Patients with a serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl but &lt; 1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
             and a 24-hour creatinine clearance result of &lt; 50 cm3/min. Patients with a serum&#xD;
             creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl. A prospective, randomized phase III study to compare the&#xD;
             effects of Paclitaxel and Topotecan to those of Cisplatin and Topotecan for treatment&#xD;
             of patients with recurrent or persistent cervical cancer Study Protocol Version 1.1&#xD;
             dated 09/25/2006 Page 25&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, unless the chemotherapy was&#xD;
                  administered with concomitant radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with craniospinal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a concomitant malignant disease, with the exception of nonmelanoma&#xD;
                  skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a previous invasive malignant disease (other than nonmelanoma skin&#xD;
                  cancer) showing evidence of this disease within the last 5 years, or for whom the&#xD;
                  therapy to be administered during this study is contraindicated due to previous&#xD;
                  treatment received for this malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are participating in another clinical study at the same time or who&#xD;
                  will have done so up to 30 days before the planned end of this study.&#xD;
