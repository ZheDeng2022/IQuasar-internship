  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, The University of Alabama at Birmingham established a NIDDK-funded,&#xD;
      interdisciplinary center of excellence in PKD-related research, with specific emphasis on&#xD;
      recessive PKD. In the previous Core Center award period, we developed a Core Resource to&#xD;
      capture clinical and mutational data for ARPKD patients (&quot;Core A: ARPKD Clinical and Genetic&#xD;
      Resource&quot;, NCT00575705). However, studies in the last several years have demonstrated that&#xD;
      ARPKD and other single gene disorders characterized by renal cystic disease and extra-renal&#xD;
      phenotypes share numerous pathogenic features. In the current competitively- renewed Center,&#xD;
      we have expanded this Core resource to include other hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals for the Core A: The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Clinical Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Expand our comprehensive Clinical Database to include information from all patients&#xD;
           who meet the inclusion criteria for hepato/renal fibrocystic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Mutational Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test children with ARPKD and other hepato/renal fibrocystic disease to identify&#xD;
                genetic mutations, establish a DNA bank for patients with hepato/renal fibrocystic&#xD;
                diseases and develop a Mutational Database. This Database will be capable of&#xD;
                linking clinical and mutational information via a unique identifier in a searchable&#xD;
                format to facilitate genetic research (e.g. genotype-phenotype correlations, new&#xD;
                disease gene studies, and modifier gene studies), translational studies, and&#xD;
                clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3- Tissue Resource:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Much of the research that is performed on diseases of the kidney, including&#xD;
                recessive genetic diseases, requires human tissue from both affected as well as&#xD;
                non-affected (controls) individuals. In this Core Resource, we are establishing an&#xD;
                independent tissue resource which would supply investigators throughout North&#xD;
                America with samples of hepato/renal fibrocystic disease affected tissues for&#xD;
                studies of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4- Educational Resource:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expand our multi-media, web-based resource to provide a reliable up-to-date, and&#xD;
                comprehensive informational resource for ARPKD and Hepato/Renal Diseases families,&#xD;
                their physicians, and genetic counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the information regarding participation in &quot;Core A: The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases&#xD;
      Translational Resource&quot; is available at: http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The entry portal for Core A is designed so that physicians who contact the CLIA-certified UAB&#xD;
      Medical Genomics Laboratory (MGL) requesting information about PKHD1 testing and any&#xD;
      patient/parent/legally authorized representative looking for information online about any of&#xD;
      the hepato-renal diseases included in this study will be directed to the UAB Hepato/Renal&#xD;
      Fibrocystic Disease Translational Resource website http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Informed Consent for the Clinical Database and Information for the participant will be&#xD;
      posted on the website (http://www.arpkdstudies.uab.edu/) for review by potential participants&#xD;
      and follow-up discussions with the PI and/or Research Nurse Coordinator. In addition,&#xD;
      materials in paper format can be sent to interested potential participants upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key elements will be required for patient enrollment: 1) certification that informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained, and 2) participant and physician contact information form&#xD;
      completed by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UAB release of information form, information for the physician and instructions on how to&#xD;
      enter data will be posted in the website available to the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not provide free genetic testing. Clinical genetic testing is available as a&#xD;
      fee-for-service.The following genetic testing may be offered to participants: exome&#xD;
      sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, whole-genome mapping (e.g. Bionano technology). We will&#xD;
      look for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small deletions and insertions (INDELs) as well&#xD;
      as large Structural Variants (SVs, deletions, insertions, translocations, inversions). In&#xD;
      special cases (eg. presenting at an older age, mainly with liver or pancreatic disease)&#xD;
      contact Dr. Guay-Woodford at lgw@uab.edu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-molecular weight DNA extraction will be performed at CNMC, according to published&#xD;
      protocols allowing to perform Sanger sequencing, massively parallel/next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing (exome or whole genome sequencing) and/or whole-genome mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once receipt of the requisite items is confirmed, the following actions will proceed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each participant will be assigned a unique code identifier in the database and a&#xD;
           clinician-specific web field will be opened for the participant identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant/parents will confirm the name of their clinician to the database and&#xD;
           notify their physician and/or genetic counselor (clinicians) of their intent to&#xD;
           participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The clinician will access the Physician Link on the website and follow the instructions&#xD;
           about how to post data to the website. Once this is done, the name of the patient will&#xD;
           be deleted from the online database and only the unique identifier will be used. Each&#xD;
           clinician permitted to access this website will be tracked with a login procedure that&#xD;
           includes a process to verify who is entering the system. Clinical data will be provided&#xD;
           by the participant's physician through the web-based entry system, coded with a unique&#xD;
           identifier, and entered into the secure Clinical Database as an initial visit data (F01&#xD;
           or primary data form) and annual follow up (F11 or follow up form). Data entry will last&#xD;
           the duration of this study. No names or initials will be collected on these data forms,&#xD;
           but gender and date of birth (which will be converted to age and only the month and year&#xD;
           will be kept on file) will be requested. The physician will not receive a monetary&#xD;
           incentive for entering data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood samples for diagnostic testing (with signed clinical genetic testing consent) will&#xD;
           be sent to the UAB MGL. The UAB MGL will perform standardized fee for service testing&#xD;
           for PKHD1 mutations. The clinical result will be reported to the patient's&#xD;
           physician/genetic counselor. As needed, genetic counseling services can be made&#xD;
           available through the UAB Department of Genetics (fee for service).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Blood samples for research purposes will come directly to the research lab from&#xD;
           patients/families signing the study consent and agreeing to have DNA extraction/EBV&#xD;
           transformation/or both. Adult and children participants need two tsp of blood and&#xD;
           infants need one tsp of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. This study does not provide free genetic testing. Clinical genetic testing is available&#xD;
           as a fee-for-service. The result of the genetic testing will be entered into the&#xD;
           Mutational Database if the participant or their representative provides consent to&#xD;
           participate in the Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Our center can be notified directly by a local physician authorized by the patient or&#xD;
           the patient can contact our center directly to donate hepato/renal fibrocystic disease&#xD;
           tissue. The research coordinator will contact the possible participant/parent/legally&#xD;
           authorized representative to discuss the study and their willingness to participate in&#xD;
           this research. If the study consents are signed, the research coordinator will call the&#xD;
           center/pathologist, sending the sample and provide them with instructions on how to&#xD;
           prepare and ship sample. On arrival to Dr. Guay-Woodford's lab, the sample will be&#xD;
           de-identified and coded with the participant's unique identifier and transported to the&#xD;
           UAB Tissue Collection and Banking Facility.&#xD;
