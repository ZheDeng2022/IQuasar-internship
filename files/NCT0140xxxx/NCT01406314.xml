  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide safety information on the ligand, GSK2315698A. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the ligand will be determined together with the&#xD;
      differences in routes of dose administration, namely the tolerability between intravenous&#xD;
      versus subcutaneous dose administration. The study will be carried out in patients with&#xD;
      systemic amyloidosis and the ability of GSK2315698A in depleting levels of serum amyloid&#xD;
      protein (SAP) will be measured.&#xD;

      This study is an open label, dose characteristic study assessing safety and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic considerations of GSK2315698A. GSK2315698A is a ligand known to bind to&#xD;
      serum amyloid protein (SAP), a key component of an anti-SAP approach to the treatment of&#xD;
      systemic amyloidosis. Safety assessments will include adverse events, vital signs, ECGs and&#xD;
      other relevant clinical laboratory tests. Dose administration routes will also be determined&#xD;
      focusing on the tolerability of intravenous dose administration versus subcutaneous. The&#xD;
      study aims to recruit up to 30 patients with a medical diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to attend 2 dosing sessions, each session will involve an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of GSK2315698A over 48 hours followed by a single subcutaneous dose in session 1 and&#xD;
      up to 3 subcutaneous doses in session 2 to be administered over a 24 hour period.&#xD;
