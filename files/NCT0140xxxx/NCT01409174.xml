      The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of the drug Yervoy (ipilimumab) that can be given with the drugs Temodar (temozolomide),&#xD;
      Intron-A (interferon alfa-2b), Proleukin (aldesleukin, IL-2), and Platinol (cisplatin) to&#xD;
      patients with metastatic melanoma. The safety of this combination will also be studied in&#xD;
      Phase I. The goal of Phase II is to learn if this combination can help to control metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma. Note: The study was closed following Phase I enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab, interferon alfa-2b, and aldesleukin are designed to block the activity of cells&#xD;
      that decrease the immune system's ability to fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of&#xD;
      cells). This may stop the cancer cells from dividing into new cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin is designed to poison the cancer cells, which may cause them to die.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 6 groups of 3 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 46 participants will be enrolled in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Study was halted early due to slow accrual in the Phase I portion without opening Phase&#xD;
      II. ***&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of ipilimumab you receive will depend on&#xD;
      when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level of ipilimumab. Each new group will receive a higher dose of ipilimumab than the group&#xD;
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of ipilimumab is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive ipilimumab at the highest dose&#xD;
      that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of cisplatin, temozolomide, interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b and IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you develop intolerable side effects while on study, your dose of IL-2 may be lowered 1-2&#xD;
      times until the side effects get better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a central venous&#xD;
      catheter (CVC) inserted, if you do not already have one. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube&#xD;
      that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will&#xD;
      explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs will be given in 3 stages: induction, consolidation, and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction will last 12 weeks. You will receive the study drugs in up to four 3-week cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take temozolomide by mouth 1 time a day on Days 2-5 of each cycle. You should&#xD;
           take temozolomide on an empty stomach at least 2 hours before or after a meal. Do not&#xD;
           open the capsule, mix it with food, or chew it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive cisplatin by vein over 1 hour on Days 2-4 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive aldesleukin by vein as a continuous infusion on Days 2-5 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b as an injection under your skin on Days 2-6 of each&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation will last 12 weeks. You will receive the study drugs in three 4-week cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive interferon alfa-2b as an injection under your skin on Days 1-5 of each&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive aldesleukin by vein as a continuous infusion on Days 2-5 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance will last about 1Â½ years. You will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on&#xD;
      Day 1 of up to six 12-week cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given other drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. The study staff will&#xD;
      tell you about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each cycle (+/- 3 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have&#xD;
           had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Before each cycle, some&#xD;
      of this blood will be used to check your liver and kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each cycle, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your&#xD;
      weight. Any tumor that can be felt with the hands will be measured during the physical exam&#xD;
      to see if it has changed size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 cycles (+/- 7 days), you will have a chest x-ray and CT or MRI scans to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anytime the doctor thinks it is needed, photos of the skin lesions will be taken. Your&#xD;
      private areas will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of your face will not be&#xD;
      taken unless there are lesions on your face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 2 years. You will no longer be able to take&#xD;
      the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days after you stop the study therapy, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have&#xD;
           had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 months for up to 3 years, you will be contacted by phone or during a clinic visit to&#xD;
      see how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide, cisplatin, ipilimumab, interferon alfa-2b,&#xD;
      and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available to treat metastatic cancer.&#xD;
      However, it is investigational to give temozolomide to patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 64 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
