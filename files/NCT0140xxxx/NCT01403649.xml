  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beginning with the 2009-2010 season, influenza vaccine is universally recommended for&#xD;
      children age 6 months to 18 years old, placing extra burden on health care providers across&#xD;
      the U.S. The focus of this study is to develop new strategies and implement existing&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies to enhance influenza immunization in these children. The&#xD;
      intervention will involve collaboration from different types of primary care providers, the&#xD;
      Colorado Immunization Information System (CIIS), public health departments and visiting&#xD;
      nursing services (VNA). It will be designed and implemented by those involved with delivery&#xD;
      with a focus on sustainability after the completion of the study. Parental input will be&#xD;
      gathered during the planning year through focus groups to assist in developing the&#xD;
      intervention. Qualitative assessments and examination of processes during the first year of&#xD;
      implementation will guide modifications during the second implementation year in order to&#xD;
      assure sustainability. Primary outcome measures in the intervention and control groups: 1)&#xD;
      increase in the rate of receipt of ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention year&#xD;
      compared to the pre-intervention year among children 6 mo.-18 yr. and 2) increase in the rate&#xD;
      of children 6 mo.-18 yr. who were fully immunized (received all required influenza&#xD;
      injections) during the season. 3) measure outcomes by age group (6 mo.-5 yr., 6-8 yr., 9-12&#xD;
      yr., 13-18 yr.) and types of clinical sites (urban Peds, urban FM, rural FM)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Within each of three types of clinical sites (urban pediatric, urban family&#xD;
      medicine, and rural family medicine) recruit a group of similar practices (Year 1) 1a.&#xD;
      Randomize practices within each type of clinical site to either the intervention or the&#xD;
      control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. Establish private-public collaborations for influenza vaccination delivery between county&#xD;
      public health departments, visiting nursing associations and each of the intervention&#xD;
      practices within the three clinical site types&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Conduct focus groups among parents of children seen at intervention&#xD;
      practices, to assess attitudes and perceived barriers to possible practice-based and&#xD;
      collaborative strategies to promote influenza vaccination (Year 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Develop (Year 1) and implement (Years 2 and 3) a plan for comprehensive and&#xD;
      collaborative delivery of influenza vaccine at intervention practices 3a. Develop&#xD;
      practice-based intervention strategies focusing primarily on immunization of high-risk&#xD;
      patients 3b. Develop private-public collaborative interventions between the intervention&#xD;
      practices, their county public health department and visiting nursing associations focusing&#xD;
      primarily on immunization of school-aged children 3c. Implement (Years 2 and 3) both&#xD;
      practice-based and private-public collaborative strategies in the intervention practices&#xD;
      while monitoring only in the control practices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: Conduct a group-randomized trial to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the comprehensive delivery model in improving influenza vaccination coverage for children 6&#xD;
      months to 18 years in three different types of clinical sites (urban pediatric, urban family&#xD;
      medicine, and rural family medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4a. Evaluate effectiveness of the comprehensive delivery model at each of the three types of&#xD;
      clinical sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the following primary outcome measures in the intervention and control groups:&#xD;
           1) increase in the rate of receipt of ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention&#xD;
           year compared to the pre-intervention year among children 6 months to 18 years and 2)&#xD;
           increase in the rate of children 6 months to 18 years who were fully immunized (received&#xD;
           all required influenza injections) during the season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the following secondary outcome measures: 1) increase in the rate of receipt of&#xD;
           ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention year compared to the pre-intervention&#xD;
           year among high-risk children and 2) increase in the rate of high-risk children who were&#xD;
           fully immunized during the season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate sustainability of the comprehensive delivery model on the above outcome&#xD;
           measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      4b. Compare the effectiveness of the comprehensive delivery model in three different types of&#xD;
      clinical sites (urban pediatric private practice, urban family medicine private practice, and&#xD;
      rural family medicine private practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: Evaluate the process of implementation of the comprehensive delivery model&#xD;
      for influenza delivery in each of the three types of sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5a. Assess process measures relevant to implementation of practice-based interventions and&#xD;
      compare by type of clinical site 5b. Assess process measures relevant to implementation of&#xD;
      private-public collaborative interventions and compare by type of clinical site 5c. Using key&#xD;
      informant interviews, assess perceptions regarding facilitators and barriers to&#xD;
      private-public collaborative delivery, alternative methods and means of improving the process&#xD;
      among practice providers, administrators and among participating public health and visiting&#xD;
      nurse personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 6: In two urban pediatric intervention practices and one rural family medicine&#xD;
      practice, conduct surveys examining parental attitudes about methods of influenza delivery&#xD;
      and their experience with their practice's participation in a comprehensive and collaborative&#xD;
      private-public model for influenza delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4. Hypothesis 1. Effectiveness on receipt of ≥1 influenza vaccine: The increase in the&#xD;
      likelihood of receiving ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention year compared to&#xD;
      the pre-intervention year among children 6 months to 18 years will be greater for children in&#xD;
      intervention practices than in control practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4. Hypothesis 2 Effectiveness - fully immunized: The increase in the likelihood of&#xD;
      receiving all necessary influenza vaccines during the post-intervention year compared to the&#xD;
      pre-intervention year among children 6 months to 18 years will be greater for children in&#xD;
      intervention practices than in control practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4. Hypothesis 3. Effectiveness by age strata: The increase in the likelihood of receiving&#xD;
      ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention year compared to the pre-intervention year&#xD;
      among children in each of the following age strata will be greater in intervention than in&#xD;
      control practices: 1) 6 months through 5 years; 2) 6 through 8 years; 3) 9 through 12 years;&#xD;
      4) 13 through 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4. Hypothesis 4. Effectiveness in high-risk children: The increase in the likelihood of&#xD;
      receiving of ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention year compared to the&#xD;
      pre-intervention year among high-risk children 6 months to 18 years will be greater for&#xD;
      high-risk children in intervention practices than in control practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4. Hypothesis 5. Sustainability: The increase in the likelihood of receiving ≥1 influenza&#xD;
      vaccine during the second post-intervention year compared to the pre-intervention year among&#xD;
      children 6 months to 18 years will be greater for children in intervention practices than in&#xD;
      control practices. (Sustainability will also be evaluated for other outcomes above.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4. Hypothesis 6. Differential effectiveness by clinical site type: The increase in the&#xD;
      likelihood of receiving of ≥1 influenza vaccine during the post-intervention year compared to&#xD;
      the pre-intervention year among children 6 months to 18 years for intervention vs. controls&#xD;
      will differ by clinical site type&#xD;
