      This phase II trial studies bioimpedance spectroscopy in detecting lower-extremity lymphedema&#xD;
      in patients with stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV vulvar cancer undergoing surgery&#xD;
      and lymphadenectomy. Diagnostic procedures, such as bioimpedance spectroscopy, may help&#xD;
      doctors to predict the onset of lower-extremity lymphedema in patients with vulvar cancer&#xD;
      undergoing surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of bioimpedance technology as&#xD;
      compared to clinically derived measurements to include circumferential volumetric&#xD;
      measurements to detect lower-extremity lymphedema in patients who are undergoing an inguinal&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy during the concurrent surgical management of a vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo preoperative and postoperative lower-extremity lymphedema assessment&#xD;
      comprising serial circumferential measurements, bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements, and&#xD;
      clinical evaluation using the Stemmer sign. Patients undergo radical vulvectomy or radical&#xD;
      local excision as prescribed by GOG-0244, and unilateral or bilateral inguinal or&#xD;
      inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
