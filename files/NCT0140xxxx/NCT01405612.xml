      An open-label, single centre, randomised, cross-over study to examine the effect of&#xD;
      ulimorelin on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam after repeat dose administration of&#xD;
      ulimorelin in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulimorelin is a first-in-class new chemical entity. It is a ghrelin agonist with&#xD;
      gastroprokinetic activity being developed as an intravenous therapy to be used in the&#xD;
      treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) hypomotility disorders such as post-operative ileus (POI)&#xD;
      and gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POI is a transient disruption of co-ordinated bowel motility that contributes to patient&#xD;
      morbidity, discomfort and prolonged recovery times. POI most commonly occurs after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery and annually, POI is the main determinant of length of hospital stay after major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery and a factor in patient hospital re-admissions, increased healthcare&#xD;
      resource use and cost, and decreased patient satisfaction. Current strategies to attenuate&#xD;
      POI are aimed at enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) or &quot;fast track&quot;. These are multimodal&#xD;
      care protocols designed to reduce the impact of external and internal factors on POI&#xD;
      duration. Recently, fewer complications and a quicker return to work and normal activities&#xD;
      for patients who have had ERAS programmes implemented have been reported. In spite of these&#xD;
      strategies only up to 20% of subjects undergoing partial bowel resection recover GI function&#xD;
      within 72 hours after surgery.&#xD;
