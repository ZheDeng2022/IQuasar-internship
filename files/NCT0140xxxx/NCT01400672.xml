  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot/feasibility study. The study design represents a modification of current&#xD;
      standard of care for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) (5580 cGY involved field&#xD;
      radiation), with the final two doses of radiation given at intervals during the vaccination&#xD;
      phase of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between the ages of 3 years and 25 years diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine&#xD;
      Glioma (DIPG) will be allowed to participate in the trial. Study enrollment will occur after&#xD;
      the completion of conformal radiation therapy to a dose of 5580 cGy and the post radiation&#xD;
      therapy (RT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows no disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients with glioblastoma multiforme, aged 16 years and older, will be entered first&#xD;
      to confirm vaccine safety before enrolling DIPG patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccine will be produced by the University Of Minnesota Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics&#xD;
      Facility using the established brain tumor initiating cell (BTIC) cell line GBM-6 as the&#xD;
      antigen source. Vaccine administration will begin at four weeks (week 10) following&#xD;
      completion of radiation therapy and will be given every two weeks for four doses. At the time&#xD;
      of the 1st and 3rd vaccinations, additional 180 cGy fractions will be delivered in single&#xD;
      doses in a novel effort to induce NKG2D ligand upregulation (thereby &quot;sensitizing&quot; residual&#xD;
      tumor to lymphocyte attack). The total radiation dose for each patient will be 5940 cGy.&#xD;
      Subsequent vaccinations will be given every four weeks and will continue to a maximum of one&#xD;
      year from study enrollment, by which time median survival will have passed based on&#xD;
      historical data. Imaging will be obtained at study entry (post radiation therapy) and every&#xD;
      eight weeks thereafter to eighteen months, after which time the interval between imaging&#xD;
      follow-up episodes will be determined by the patient's clinical status. Imaging will include&#xD;
      MRI of the brain using our current institutional brain tumor imaging protocol. Imaging will&#xD;
      also include SPECT/MRI and perfusion MRI. FDG-PET imaging may be used in certain cases to&#xD;
      differentiate tumor necrosis from progression.&#xD;

Partial responses (PR) are those in which there is a â‰¥ 50% reduction in the size of the enhancing tumor or tumor mass on consecutive MRI scans. In addition, the patient must be neurologically stable.</description>
