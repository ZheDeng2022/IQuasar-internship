  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that the effectiveness of an exercise can be controlled not only by&#xD;
      the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better target the&#xD;
      desired muscle. The purpose of this study is to obtain objective information regarding&#xD;
      selected lower extremity muscle activity during specific exercise and the influence of&#xD;
      fatigue and speed on muscular activation.&#xD;

      It is generally accepted that the effectiveness of an exercise can be controlled not only by&#xD;
      the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better target the&#xD;
      desired muscle. Information regarding selected lower extremity muscle activity during&#xD;
      specific exercise and the influence of fatigue and speed on muscular activation may enhance&#xD;
      exercise prescription for all parties involved. Specifically, selection of specific training&#xD;
      or rehabilitation exercises may be guided by increased awareness of specific muscle&#xD;
      activation patterns during common exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Measures: Healthy subjects between 18 - 35 years old will be recruited from the&#xD;
      community by a sample of convenience and word of mouth. Potential participants will report to&#xD;
      the Institute for Human Performance. The potential participants will be asked to complete all&#xD;
      documentation including informed consent, and health screening questionnaire. The qualified&#xD;
      participants will be familiarized with the set up and specific exercises. If eligible,&#xD;
      surface EMG recordings will be collected from the back extensors, gluteal muscles (buttocks),&#xD;
      hamstrings (posterior thigh), quadriceps (anterior thigh), and gastrocnemius (calf) during&#xD;
      squat and lunges exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For data analysis, a within subject measures analysis will be conducted using general linear&#xD;
      models. Specifically, we will use paired t-tests and an analysis of variance (ANOVA). When&#xD;
      applicable, post-hoc tests will be used to uncover differences among the groups of subjects&#xD;
      on descriptor variables such as age, height, weight, rate of perceived exertion, and maximal&#xD;
      and sub-maximal voluntary muscle performance variables (i.e. EMG amplitude, frequency). The&#xD;
      statistical significance level will be set at alpha = 0.05 for all analyses performed.&#xD;

        We will recruit healthy, young (18-35 y.o.) subjects. Following signing the inform consent,&#xD;
        potential participants will be given a health risk questionnaires to identify possible&#xD;
        cardiovascular and/or orthopedic risks to strength training exercise. Answering YES to any&#xD;
        of the questions on the PAR Q will be considered an exclusion criterion. In addition we&#xD;
        will use a MEDICAL HISTORY QUESTIONNAIRE (included at the end of this form). Specifically,&#xD;
        subjects who are at risk due to recent (within the last year) neuro-musculo-skeletal injury&#xD;
        to lower extremities will be excluded from the study. Also, we will exclude subjects who&#xD;
        reported any significant respiratory-cardiovascular disease, which is not yet under&#xD;
        control..&#xD;
