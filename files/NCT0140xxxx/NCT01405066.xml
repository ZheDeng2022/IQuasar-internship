    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify variation in radiation dose levels across CT&#xD;
      technologists, and determine the effectiveness of combining radiation dose audit reports and&#xD;
      an educational seminar as a means to reduce the variation and level of patient exposure to&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect the radiation dose audit reports and educational seminar will lead&#xD;
      to reduced radiation exposure to patients by making technologists more aware of the risks of&#xD;
      radiation exposure from CT exams and identifying technologists with higher radiation exams&#xD;
      compared with their peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect the degree to which a technologist is concerned and aware about&#xD;
      radiation exposure and cancer risk will be associated with adherence to radiation reduction&#xD;
      protocols and the subsequent level of radiation their patients are exposed to when receiving&#xD;
      a CT examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of advanced diagnostic imaging has increased dramatically over the past decade, not&#xD;
      only contributing to rising medical costs but also exposure to ionizing radiation, of which&#xD;
      CT imaging plays a prominent role because it requires a relatively high dose of radiation to&#xD;
      produce an image when compared to conventional X-rays. The growth in the use of CT imaging&#xD;
      along with all other advanced medical imaging has been well documented, and taken as a whole&#xD;
      the use of these services has grown quicker than all other services provided by physicians.&#xD;
      Research has also shown great variability in the amount of radiation exposure to individual&#xD;
      patients, even when patient and other characteristics are controlled for. Given the increase&#xD;
      in the use of CT imaging and the variability in radiation exposure between similar imaging&#xD;
      exams, it is important to study ways of standardizing and reducing radiation levels from CT&#xD;
      imaging. Little is understood about the role of CT technologists' attitudes and how they may&#xD;
      influence patient radiation exposure, therefore, this project also give us the opportunity to&#xD;
      survey the technologists and determine if there is a relationship between technologist&#xD;
      attitudes and awareness and the radiation exposure of patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Radiation dose levels (measured by dose linear product (DLP) and effective dose (ED)) from CT exams as a measure of the effectiveness of radiation dose audit reporting and educational intervention for lowering patient exposure to radiation from CT exams.</measure>

    <description>We will report dose data at two time points, April 2011 (data for these reports collect from November 2010 to March 2011), and September 2011 (data collected from April 2011 to August 2011), and compare the data from the two time points to see if there was a change in dose levels (DLP and ED) for the time period (April to August) after the presentation of the first audit reports and delivery of the educational interventions to the CT technologists.</description>

    <description>Audit reports by CT technologist, with graphs of radiation dose levels of 20 exams from each of the 4 most common CT exams. Reports show the distribution of radiation dose levels by each exam type, and compares the technologist's dose levels to the overall levels from the clinic where they work and to the United Kingdom's 2003 Reference Dose. Prior to the graphs, the reports include an introductory page explaining the organization of the report and defining the dosimetry metrics. The final page of the report lists exams meriting individual review because their doses are higher than that of the clinic averages.</description>
