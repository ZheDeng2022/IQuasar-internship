      Patent ductus arterioses (PDA) is a major morbidity in preterm infants, especially in&#xD;
      extremely premature infants less than 28 weeks. The clinical signs and symptoms of PDA in&#xD;
      preterm infants are non specific and insensitive for making an early diagnosis of significant&#xD;
      ductal shunting. Functional echocardiography is emerging as a new valuable bedside tool for&#xD;
      early diagnosis of hemodynamically significant ductus, even though there are no universally&#xD;
      accepted criteria for grading the hemodynamic significance. Echocardiography has also been&#xD;
      used for early targeted treatment of ductus arterioses, though the long term benefits of such&#xD;
      strategy are debatable. The biomarkers like BNP and N- terminal pro-BNP are currently under&#xD;
      research as diagnostic marker of PDA. The primary mode of treatment for PDA is&#xD;
      pharmacological closure using cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors with closure rate of 70-80%. Oral&#xD;
      ibuprofen is emerging as a better alternative especially in Indian scenario where parenteral&#xD;
      preparations of indomethacin are unavailable and side effects are comparatively lesser.&#xD;
      Though pharmacological closure of PDA is an established treatment modality, there is still&#xD;
      lack of evidence for long term benefits of such therapy as well as there is some evidence for&#xD;
      the possible adverse effects like increased ROP and BPD rates, especially if treated&#xD;
      prophylactically.The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of oral ibuprofen&#xD;
      prophylaxis administrated on the first 24 hours of life and the following two days on&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant patent ductus arterioses and its long term effects such as ROP&#xD;
      and BPD.&#xD;

      Patent ductus arterioses (PDA) is a major morbidity encountered in preterm neonates,&#xD;
      especially in babies less than 28 weeks gestation or 1000g.Natural ductal closure is&#xD;
      inversely related to gestational age and birth weight. The incidence ranges from 15% to 37%&#xD;
      in newborn babies less than 1750 grams.The presence of PDA has significant effects on&#xD;
      myocardial functions as well as systemic and pulmonary blood flow. Preterm newborns adapt, by&#xD;
      increasing the left ventricular contractility, and thereby maintaining the effective systemic&#xD;
      blood flow even when the left to right shunts equals 50% of the left ventricular output. This&#xD;
      is mainly accomplished by an increase in stroke volume (SV)rather than heart rate.This&#xD;
      increase in stroke volume is primarily due to reduction in afterload and simultaneous&#xD;
      increase in left ventricular preload. An increasing number of biological substances like&#xD;
      hormones, enzymes which are markers of cardiac stress, dysfunction or myocardial&#xD;
      injury-collectively called biomarkers-are emerging as diagnostic and prognostic markers&#xD;
      especially in the setting of heart failure or ischemic injury. The pharmacological basis for&#xD;
      medical therapy is the use of non selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, which inhibits&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthesis and causes ductal constriction. The two most widely studied and used&#xD;
      non selective COX inhibitors are indomethacin and ibuprofen. The future of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment of PDA could be with the use of nitric oxide inhibitors and prostaglandin receptor&#xD;
      antagonists. Ibuprofen is an effective choice for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants as&#xD;
      it has been demonstrated in previous several studies.Since there is a meta-analysis that&#xD;
      claims there is no need for further studies about ibuprofen prophylaxis to treat PDA in low&#xD;
      birth weight infants we aimed to evaluate the effect of ibuprofen prophylaxis in very&#xD;
      extremely low birth weight infants. One such marker emerging in the diagnosis of hs-PDA is&#xD;
      brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Natriuretic peptides are hormones, produced either by atria&#xD;
      (atrial natriuretic peptide-ANP) or by ventricles (BNP) in response to myocardial stress,&#xD;
      secondary to dilatation, hypertrophy or increased wall tension.One of the aims of this study&#xD;
      is to investigate the effect of oral prophylactic ibuprofen administration on BNP levels and&#xD;
      renal functions.&#xD;
