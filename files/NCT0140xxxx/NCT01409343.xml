  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TrasGEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with HER-2 positive&#xD;
      cancers. The effect of TrasGEX™ on the development of anti-drug antibodies and on tumour&#xD;
      response was also evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with advanced and/or metastatic HER2-positive cancer who were resistant to or&#xD;
      for whom there was no standard anti-tumor therapy available at the time of enrollment and who&#xD;
      had an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months were eligible for participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were to receive the study drug until disease progression (clinical or radiologic),&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or any other reason leading to termination of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-escalation was performed in 3 to 6-patient cohorts.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this first-in-man study is to determine the optimal dose and regimen of TrasGEX™ in patients with locally advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive cancer. The recommended phase II dose needs to have an acceptable safety profile and provides evidence for efficacy based on clinical observations or the pharmacokinetic profile.</description>

    <measure>To determine preliminary evidence of activity</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CT or MRI imaging will be performed. Assessment of tumor response (SD, PR, CR. PD) will be performed following a modified version of the revised RECIST guidelines, version 1.1. Basically, patients will receive treatment with TrasGEX™ until progression of disease and/or unacceptable toxicities are observed.</description>
