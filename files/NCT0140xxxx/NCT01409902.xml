      The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the sheathed speculum in&#xD;
      providing adequate visualization and access to the cervix in patients with excessive vaginal&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to rate the patient's comfort evaluation during the sheathed&#xD;
      speculum examination.&#xD;

      This is a descriptive clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of a sheathed speculum&#xD;
      in providing adequate visualization and access to the cervix in women with excessive vaginal&#xD;
      tissue. Eligible, consented subjects who fail their initial speculum examination (because&#xD;
      their cervix is not visualized due to the collapse of loose lateral vaginal walls) will have&#xD;
      a sheathed speculum examination instead of the standard-of-care exam whereby the clinician&#xD;
      fabricates a solution at the bedside (condom with tip cut placed on speculum, concomitantly&#xD;
      using an additional instrument like a lateral-wall retractor, glove with tip of thumb placed&#xD;
      over the speculum, using the largest speculum available)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 64 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI greater than 30 (or see next line)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Collapsing vaginal tissue preventing the visualization of the cervix (meeting this&#xD;
             criterion in the absence of a BMI &gt;30 would also qualify the patient for the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unwilling to participate in the study or provide consent Presence of&#xD;
             significant acute pelvic pain syndromes (ie exacerbation of dyspareunia, chronic&#xD;
             pelvic pain or pelvic floor dysfunction, atrophic vaginitis, interstitial cystitis,&#xD;
             endometriosis) which, in the opinion of the examining clinician, could potentially&#xD;
             confound the patient's responses to the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active genital herpes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of significant condyloma acuminata (may be an investigator decision)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other patient deemed inappropriate for the study by the consenting or examining&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
