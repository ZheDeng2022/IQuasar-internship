  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a syndrome that occurs in approximately 3% to 8% of pregnancies and is&#xD;
      associated with considerable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Except for&#xD;
      termination of the pregnancy, effective treatments/preventative measures for preeclampsia are&#xD;
      lacking. Although prolongation of pregnancy benefits the fetus, it is detrimental to the&#xD;
      mother, and is associated with hypertension, proteinuria, and symptoms that suggest kidney,&#xD;
      brain, liver and cardiovascular system involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placental soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) is elevated in women with preeclampsia,&#xD;
      with levels that fall after delivery. sFlt-1 is a variant of the vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) receptor Flt-1, and in the circulation, acts as a potent VEGF and placental&#xD;
      growth factor (PlGF) antagonist. Given that sFlt-1 levels are elevated in preeclampsia, we&#xD;
      are investigating if removal of sFlt-1 from the plasma of women with preeclampsia can improve&#xD;
      maternal and fetal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term extracorporeal apheresis with the LIPOSORBER LA-15 System will be the primary&#xD;
      intervention using methods that have been previously applied in pregnant women with familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether short-term apheresis using a&#xD;
      dextran sulfate adsorption (DSA) column (Liposorber LA-15 System; the Device) leads to a&#xD;
      reduction in circulating sFLT-1 in the blood of women with pre-term preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary objectives are aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      Device as well as the impact of removing circulating sFlt-1 on maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether short-term apheresis using the Device in women with pre-term&#xD;
           preeclampsia leads to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a prolongation of pregnancy (ie, gestational age)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a reduction in blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an increase in fetal birth weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety of reducing maternal sFlt-1 levels using the Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 16 patients will be enrolled. Initially, 4 patients will undergo apheresis UP TO 2&#xD;
      times in the first week and undergo all protocol-related assessments including PK of sFlt-1&#xD;
      levels. Based on an assessment of clinical response by the Investigator, these first 4&#xD;
      patients will be offered the option to continue apheresis treatments (without pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      [PK] assessments) up to twice weekly until delivery or until 34 weeks gestation, whichever&#xD;
      comes first. Following complete review of all parameters and outcomes by an independent Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), up to 12 additional patients will be enrolled (total of up to&#xD;
      16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE: The DSMB reviewed data after the first 4 patients and again after 10&#xD;
      patients/delivered infants had been treated. In the next 6 patients, DSMB review will occur&#xD;
      after every 3 patients/delivered infants. These remaining 6 patients may undergo apheresis up&#xD;
      to 3 times per week.&#xD;

    <description>The study period for each patient will be from initiation of the device until 30 days (± 7 days) after delivery. Additional assessments will be performed at 90 and 365 days (± 7 days, respectively) using maternal and neonatal medical records and/or by telephone contact with the mother.</description>

    <description>Maternal: Blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulation parameters, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, maternal complications Fetal: Early fetal assessments delivery (birth) will include gestational age, birth weight, length, fetal APGAR scores (1'/5'/10'), amniotic fluid volume by ultrasonography, and head circumference, NICU details, pulmonary parameters and any neonatal complications (eg, ventilatory support, respiratory distress syndrome, CRIB-Score, cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic colitis, and retinopathy of prematurity [ROP]) and compared to historical milestones. Fetal cord blood (with maternal consent) is to be sampled from umbilical artery at delivery to determine sFlt-1 levels, to measure pH and stored for later biochemical analyses. Fetal assessments will also occur ~30, 60, 90 and 365 days after delivery.</description>

    <description>The Liposorber LA-15 Device is a dextran sulfate cellulose column, one of several currently approved in Europe and United States for pheresis of lipoproteins in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia. Such devices have been in use for over 30 years. Published experience in pregnant women with familial hypercholesterolemia suggests that lipoprotein pheresis can be safely used in pregnancy after appropriate individual benefit/risk assessment for both mother and fetus is considered. The Liposorber LA-15 system selected for this trial has been evaluated for its ability to efficiently and selectively remove sFlt-1 in vitro.</description>
