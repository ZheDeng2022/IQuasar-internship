      This study investigated the efficacy of an exercise and counseling intervention for depressed&#xD;
      smokers (depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-D score ≥ 8)&#xD;
      in term of likelihood of smoking abstinence. Participants were randomized to 8 weeks of&#xD;
      intervention: individually delivered exercise and counseling (for smoking cessation and&#xD;
      physical activity) or control: health education contact control condition.&#xD;

      This study investigated the efficacy of an exercise and counseling intervention for depressed&#xD;
      smokers (depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-D score ≥ 8)&#xD;
      in term of likelihood of smoking abstinence. Participants were randomized to 8 weeks of group&#xD;
      delivered exercise and counseling (for smoking cessation and physical activity) or a health&#xD;
      education contact control condition. The investigators assess this intervention in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of 96 depressed adults smokers recruited by advertisements in&#xD;
      local print allocated into one of the two groups (intervention group vs. control group)&#xD;
      during a 8-week period and 3 follow-up visits (12, 24, 52 weeks after baseline). All subjects&#xD;
      (intervention and control groups) participate in a smoking cessation program composed of a&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment (including nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline) and&#xD;
      counseling.Experimental group subjects were required to attend 2 supervised exercise sessions&#xD;
      and 2 counseling sessions during Week 1 and Week 2. Supervised exercise and counseling&#xD;
      sessions are realized successively. For Week 3 to 8, participants were required to attend 1&#xD;
      supervised exercise session and 1 counseling session plus 1 home exercise session.Supervized&#xD;
      exercise session consist of 5-min warm-up, 30 min of aerobic activity (stationary bikes), and&#xD;
      a 5-min cooldown with stretching. The training intensity is of 60 to 80% maximum heart rate.&#xD;
      The sessions are supervised by an exercise specialist who verified and documented the heart&#xD;
      rates. Home exercise session consist of 45 min of aerobic exercise (walking, cycling, or&#xD;
      running). The training intensity is 6 to 7 on breathlessness visual analog scale.The smoking&#xD;
      counseling sessions included the following components: review of a participant's smoking&#xD;
      history and motivation to quit, help in the identification of high-risk situations,&#xD;
      management of cigarette craving and the generation of problem-solving strategies to deal with&#xD;
      such situations.Exercise counseling sessions designed to motivate increased regular physical&#xD;
      activity and short bouts of exercise in response to negative affect and urges to smoke. The&#xD;
      goal of this intervention was to increase activity level.Health education group subjects were&#xD;
      required to participate 75-minute supervised sessions with the same frequency of experimental&#xD;
      group. Participants in the health education condition received information on a variety of&#xD;
      health topics including sleep hygiene, nutrition, stress and health screening tests for&#xD;
      cancer prevention. Participants were also asked to read handouts on health education topics&#xD;
      covered during the session.&#xD;
