      The aim of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of two insulin analog mixtures: Listro&#xD;
      Mix75/25® and Humalog Mix75/25® in healthy subjects based on the pharmacokinetic parameter&#xD;
      (PK)AUC (INS-LIS 0-20h) and the pharmacodynamic parameter (PD)AUC (GIR 0-20h) and also assess&#xD;
      the safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male or female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 and ≤50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Considered generally healthy upon completion of medical history, physical examination&#xD;
             and biochemical investigations as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 27.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Non-smoker, defined as no nicotine consumption for at least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.&#xD;
             (Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during&#xD;
             normal management of the subject.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant, breast-feeding or the intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate&#xD;
             contraceptive measures (e.g. intrauterine device (IUD) that has been in place for at&#xD;
             least 3 months, or sterilization, or the oral contraceptive pill, which should have&#xD;
             been taken without difficulty for at least 3 months, or an approved hormonal implant&#xD;
             or double barrier method including male condoms used plus spermicide , diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide plus male condom cap with spermicide plus male condom are acceptable&#xD;
             options).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged&#xD;
             by the Investigator. In particular, subjects with elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT&#xD;
             &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal) or impaired renal function (elevated serum&#xD;
             creatinine values above the upper limit of normal) or elevated blood glucose at&#xD;
             screening as measured by YSI (&gt; 5.5 mmol/L / 100 mg/dL) will not be allowed to enter&#xD;
             the trial. Subjects with abnormal TSH may be required to have additional testing of&#xD;
             thyroid hormones for further clarification. Subjects with abnormal TSH judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator as clinically significant will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any serious systemic infectious disease during the four weeks prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of test drug, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the&#xD;
             results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In&#xD;
             particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (hemoglobin below&#xD;
             the lower limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Cardiac problems defined as decompensated heart failure (New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) class III and IV) at any time and/or angina pectoris within the last 12 months&#xD;
             and/or acute myocardial infarction at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically significant abnormal ECG at screening, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any positive screen for drugs of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Hepatitis B or C or HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of prescription drugs within 3 weeks preceding the first dosing of insulin, except&#xD;
             for oral contraceptives/hormonal implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of non-prescription drugs, except routine vitamins or herbal products, within 3&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first dose of the test drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Occasional use of acetaminophen is permitted. Acetaminophen is not allowed on the&#xD;
             dosing day until 4 hours postdosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of systemic corticosteroids, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, prostaglandin&#xD;
             blockers, systemic non-selective beta-blockers, growth hormones&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Thyroid hormones are not allowed unless stable during the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;

             not allowed within 7 days prior to dosing and on the dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate&#xD;
             understanding or co-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Blood donation of more than 500 ml within the last 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe&#xD;
             anaphylactic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Known or suspected allergy to trial product or related products.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. History of deep leg vein thrombosis or a frequent appearance of deep leg vein&#xD;
             thrombosis in 1st degree relatives (parents, siblings or children) as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would represent an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk for the subject's safety.&#xD;
