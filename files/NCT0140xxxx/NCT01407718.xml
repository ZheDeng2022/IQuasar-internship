      This project will address the incidence of anterior knee pain in the approaches used for&#xD;
      tibial nailing. A parapatellar approach, with nail insertion in relative extension, will be&#xD;
      compared to the approaches in which nail insertion requires the knee to be placed in flexion.&#xD;
      The incidence of anterior knee pain will be compared in each group to assess whether the&#xD;
      compared approaches result in similar levels of anterior knee pain. Patients will be given&#xD;
      the 2000 IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Form to assess anterior knee pain. The 2000 IKDC&#xD;
      Subjective Knee Evaluation Form is a newer assessment tool created by the International Knee&#xD;
      Documentation Committee. It has been validated for use with broad patient populations dealing&#xD;
      with various knee disorders.19&#xD;

      In the population affected by orthopaedic injury, fractures of the tibial shaft are the most&#xD;
      common of all long bone fractures. This fracture pattern occurs approximately 26 times per&#xD;
      100,000 people and accounts for 77,000 hospitalizations per annum.(1, 2) Intramedullary&#xD;
      nailing is the most common operative treatment choice for fractures of the diaphyseal tibia&#xD;
      (tibial shaft). Intramedullary nailing is also commonly used for shaft fractures that extend&#xD;
      into the metaphyses (excluding fractures that extend into the knee and/or exhibit comminution&#xD;
      at the ankle joint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibial nails are inserted at or about the knee. Three different insertion approaches are used&#xD;
      as standard of care at this institution, including the transtendinous, peritendinous, and&#xD;
      parapatellar approach. In all three techniques, the nail is placed in the tibia in the same&#xD;
      manner: after fracture reduction, the proper entry point in the proximal tibia is found and&#xD;
      the tibia is sequentially reamed until a suitable nail can be passed and locked in place with&#xD;
      interlocking screws. The three named approaches vary the (1) angulation of the knee at the&#xD;
      time of insertion and the (2) location of the incision and soft tissue dissection, relative&#xD;
      to the patellar tendon, necessary to locate the proper entry point for the nail. Tibial nails&#xD;
      are inserted with the knee in flexion (bent to ~90°) for the transtendinous and peritendinous&#xD;
      approaches, and in relative extension (less than 30°) for the parapatellar approach. For&#xD;
      insertion, the transtendinous and peritendinous approaches require dissections that allow the&#xD;
      nail to be passed through or around the patellar tendon. In the parapatellar technique,&#xD;
      dissection is carried out juxtaposed to the patella.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior knee pain is the most common complication of intramedullary tibial nailing. It has&#xD;
      been reported in a range of 10% to 86% with average follow up of two years.(3) Review of&#xD;
      current literature regarding the subject of anterior knee pain and tibial nailing reveals&#xD;
      four commonly attributable causes: skin incision location,(4,5) approach in reference to the&#xD;
      patellar tendon,(6-9) nail insertion site,(10) and nail prominence.(11-13) No study has&#xD;
      specifically examined whether knee angulation at the time of insertion impacts anterior knee&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
