  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled dietary intervention trial of high versus low dietary intake of&#xD;
      advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in 24 adults; and to gather preliminary data on the&#xD;
      impact of high versus low AGE diet health parameters. The investigators hypothesize that it&#xD;
      will be feasible to conduct a randomized, parallel arm, controlled dietary intervention in a&#xD;
      pilot study involving 24 subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), bioactive molecules formed by the non-enzymatic&#xD;
      glycation of proteins, are emerging as a possible dietary risk factor for many key adverse&#xD;
      health outcomes related to obesity and to aging. Major sources of systemic AGEs are&#xD;
      endogenous AGEs generated in the body and exogenous AGEs found in foods. When food is heated&#xD;
      to high temperatures, the characteristic &quot;browning&quot; generates Maillard reaction products,&#xD;
      known as AGEs. Although AGEs have been implicated in atherosclerosis, insulin resistance,&#xD;
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, aging-related eye disease, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease, the possible adverse effects of dietary AGEs have not been well characterized&#xD;
      in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a randomized,&#xD;
      parallel arm, controlled dietary intervention in a pilot study involving 24 subjects; and to&#xD;
      compare the effects of a high-AGE and low-AGE diet on (a) serum and urine&#xD;
      carboxymethyl-lysine and serum receptor for AGEs (RAGE), (b) endothelial function, (c)&#xD;
      interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, (d) lipids, (e) adipokines, (f) glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      insulin resistance, (g) renal function, and (h) cognition.&#xD;
