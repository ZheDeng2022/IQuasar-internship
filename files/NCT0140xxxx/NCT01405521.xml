      Using an established model of human typhoid infection, whereby healthy adults are&#xD;
      deliberately infected with typhoid-causing bacteria, the investigators will determine how&#xD;
      effective a new oral typhoid vaccine (M01ZH09) is in preventing infection. A previously&#xD;
      licensed oral typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) will be used to make sure the challenge model used&#xD;
      works properly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid is a serious infection killing up to 600,000 people every year; it is a frequent&#xD;
      cause of fever and hospital admission in areas where disease is common. As the infection is&#xD;
      restricted to humans, it should be possible to eliminate typhoid; better vaccines and ways of&#xD;
      confirming infection are required in order for this to succeed. We propose to use a recently&#xD;
      established human typhoid challenge model in order to evaluate a novel oral vaccine candidate&#xD;
      and to develop new methods for diagnosing typhoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are vaccines available to prevent typhoid, they offer little protection to&#xD;
      populations where typhoid predominates, especially young children. Currently, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of vaccines against typhoid cannot be predicted, as measures of protection&#xD;
      against typhoid are unknown. As a result, implementation of vaccine programmes in disease&#xD;
      endemic regions currently requires large and expensive trials in each new population,&#xD;
      significantly delaying programmatic implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a typhoid challenge model to achieve our goal of accelerating the introduction of&#xD;
      more effective vaccines into populations with a high burden of disease. Healthy adults will&#xD;
      be vaccinated with either a novel oral typhoid vaccine or vaccine-placebo prior to being&#xD;
      infected with the bacteria causing typhoid. This will allow us to measure the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the vaccine and to identify components of the immune response important in producing&#xD;
      protection against infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods for confirming typhoid infection are slow and insensitive, particularly in&#xD;
      endemic regions where the cost of laboratory equipment is prohibitive. In this project, we&#xD;
      will also explore ways to diagnose typhoid, with the aim of developing tests that are quick,&#xD;
      reliable and are be cost-effective in resource-poor settings. This would improve individual&#xD;
      patient management, and allow accurate measurement of disease burden, which is vital to&#xD;
      improve the efforts of vaccine programmes.&#xD;
