      Objective: to evaluate the perforator based interposition plasty in comparison to the&#xD;
      standard technique (full thickness graft) for scar contracture releases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomised controlled multicentre intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients, aged 18 years and older, who require surgery for release of a&#xD;
      scar contracture, are eligible for this study. In total 50 patients will be recruited with a&#xD;
      follow-up of 3 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A release of the contracture will be performed in combination with òr the&#xD;
      standard technique (full thickness graft) òr the perforator based interposition plasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: the main study parameter is the amount of contraction of the&#xD;
      flap/graft after three months.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scar contracture remains a considerable problem for the burned patient. The standard method&#xD;
      of treatment is contracture release in combination with the application of a full or split&#xD;
      thickness graft to close the defect. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of skin grafts is&#xD;
      limited by scar contraction, which often necessitates additional reconstructions. Moreover,&#xD;
      parts of the skin graft may be lost due to poor revascularisation or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the discovery of perforator vessels, many types of new flaps can be harvested as long&#xD;
      as it incorporates a perforator bundle (artery and vein). This flap design based on&#xD;
      perforator vessels and local available skin, should lead to an increased flap survival and&#xD;
      superior functional outcome. Based on this concept we developed and explored the possibility&#xD;
      of an algorithm for treatment by means of a pilot study performed on 22 patients with a scar&#xD;
      contracture. Results show a survival of all flaps of 100% and an expansion of the surface&#xD;
      area by 16% after a follow up of at least 3 months. However the implications of the use of&#xD;
      perforator based flaps for burn surgery by means of a RCT has yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is interpositioned skin of superior quality, as represented by less contraction with the use&#xD;
      of the perforator based interposition flaps, compared to the gold standard (full thickness&#xD;
      grafts), after 3 months, as measured by transparent sheet planimetry?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival of the flap/graft: i.e. measured by the amount of necrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality of the scar: elasticity, colour, subjective scar evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication for release of burn scar contracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sufficient tissue for a perforator- based interposition flap (preferably normal skin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location: scars on the face and scalp&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking (however, the patient is eligible if smoking is quit &gt; 3 weeks before the&#xD;
           operation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric disorders (if a loss to follow-up is anticipated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Language barrier&#xD;

    <description>In our concept the flap is designed based on a selected perforator and locally available, preferably normal skin adjacent to the burn scar contracture. The flap consists of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue. Based on the pre-operative defined perforator, the required length and width and the available preferable normal skin, a design for the perforator flap is made.</description>
