      OBJECTIVE It is the objective of the REMEDEE OCT study to assess vascular healing after&#xD;
      deployment of the Abluminal Sirolimus Coated Bio-Engineered Stent (Combo Bio-Engineered&#xD;
      Sirolimus Eluting Stent) in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) with single de novo&#xD;
      native coronary artery lesions ranging in diameter from ≥2.5 mm to ≤3.5 mm and ≤ 20 mm in&#xD;
      length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The REMEDEE OCT study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study designed&#xD;
      to enroll 60 patients with ACS who will be randomized 1:1 to be treated with the Combo stent&#xD;
      versus the commercially available everolimus eluting stent (Xience V or Promus). Patients&#xD;
      will receive Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Quatitative Coronary Angiography (QCA)&#xD;
      follow-up imaging at 60 days post procedure. Clinical follow-up is scheduled at 30, 60, 180,&#xD;
      360 and 540 days. Furthermore, QCA and OCT will also be performed at baseline in all&#xD;
      participants of the study.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The implantation of bare-metal stents (BMS) has significantly reduced clinical and&#xD;
      angiographic restenosis compared to balloon angioplasty alone after PCI due to eliminating&#xD;
      elastic recoil and reducing arterial remodeling. However, in-stent restenosis still occurred&#xD;
      frequently after BMS implantation in 20% to 40% of patients due to neointimal proliferation.&#xD;
      The development, clinical validation and widespread use of drug-eluting stents (DES) have&#xD;
      revolutionized the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Large-scale,&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter double-blind randomized trials have provided strong evidence that&#xD;
      drug-eluting stents significantly reduce angiographic restenosis and enhance event-free&#xD;
      survival compared with BMS after implantation in native coronary arteries (3-6).However,&#xD;
      despite an improved efficacy in the prevention of restenosis and target vessel failure safety&#xD;
      concerns have been raised for DES, focusing on a small but clinically important increase in&#xD;
      stent thrombosis occurring greater than one year after the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients receiving drug-eluting stents, the acute coronary syndrome has been identified as&#xD;
      one of the major risk factors of stent thrombosis (10). Therefore, concerns about the&#xD;
      long-term outcome and safety after drug-eluting stent implantation due to late stent&#xD;
      thrombosis and late stent malapposition have been raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent thrombosis, in particular late stent thrombosis, has been related to an impaired stent&#xD;
      healing, most of all to a reduced endothelial repair, i.e. reduced stent strut coverage,&#xD;
      after implantation of drug-eluting stents. This has resulted in the recommendation of a&#xD;
      prolonged 12-month double antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent implantation, however, how long double antiplatelet therapy is needed is&#xD;
      unknown at present. These observations have resulted in an intense search for alternative&#xD;
      strategies to promote stent healing and endothelial repair, rather than to inhibit the&#xD;
      endothelialisation of the stent, that is common to the substances used to prevent neointima&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, endothelial repair can be substantially stimulated by CD34+ endothelial progenitor&#xD;
      cells. The Combo stent is therefore covered with a CD34+ antibody to attract endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells to promote endothelial and stent healing, and on the abluminal side releases&#xD;
      sirolimus to prevent neointima formation and restenosis. Several preclinical studies in the&#xD;
      porcine coronary artery model have shown, that endothelialisation and stent healing are&#xD;
      accelerated in the Combo stent. The present study has therefore been designed to compare&#xD;
      stent healing of the Combo stent with the everolimus-eluting stent by optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography analysis (optical frequency domain imaging; OFDI), a high resolution intracoronary&#xD;
      imaging technique allowing accurate evaluation of stent coverage and healing, in patients&#xD;
      with an acute coronary syndrome. Previous studies have indicated, that coronary stent healing&#xD;
      after DES implantation is particularly impaired in patients with ACS, and therefore this&#xD;
      patient population is in a particular need of improved &quot;pro-healing&quot; stent concepts with a&#xD;
      high efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE An important limitation of stents eluting only growth-inhibiting substances is,&#xD;
      that also the desirable endothelial cell growth over the stent struts is prevented, that is&#xD;
      thought to represent a major cause of &quot;late-stent-thrombosis&quot;. The rationale for the design&#xD;
      of the &quot;combo-stent&quot; is therefore to combine a growth inhibiting substance with abluminal&#xD;
      release with an endothelial progenitor cell attracting design to promote endothelial repair.&#xD;
      In the pre-clinical studies, the &quot;Combo Stent&quot; demonstrated significantly lower neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia, while also showing improved endothelial coverage relative to other commercially&#xD;
      available DES. There was also a noticeably lower presence of inflammation and foreign body&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT- Examination of Vessel Healing Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel&#xD;
      intravascular imaging modality based on infrared light emission that has a 10-20 fold higher&#xD;
      resolution (10-20 µM) as compared to current intravascular ultrasound systems, and allows a&#xD;
      detailed examination of stent healing. Strut coverage, strut apposition and neointima can be&#xD;
      quantified at a micron-scale level with a resolution 10-20 times higher than conventional&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound. The quantification of stent healing by intravascular OCT analysis&#xD;
      has recently been validated against histology, demonstrating an excellent accuracy of the OCT&#xD;
      examination. Moreover, the safety and feasibility of OCT examination in a multicenter study&#xD;
      has been demonstrated. Newer modalities of OCT image acquisition, as used in this study, have&#xD;
      been reported to further simplify the technique and reduce procedural time.&#xD;
