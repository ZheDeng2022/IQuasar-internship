    <textblock>
      This study will assess relationship between ischemic time and the extent of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction with cardiac magnetic resonance image in patients with STEMI (ST elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance image (CMRI) is the preferred method of assessing myocardial&#xD;
      infarct size and function. However,the relationship between CMRI changes and the ischemic&#xD;
      time [symptom onset to device activation time (S2D)] in patients with primary percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) is not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the primary hypothesis that there is strong (at least 70%) direct&#xD;
      correlation between the S2D time and infarct size by CMRI and inverse correlation with&#xD;
      myocardial salvage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study a prospective cohort of 80 consecutive patients with STEMI and&#xD;
      primary PCI. The investigators will perform CMRI at day 3 to 1 post STEMI and a repeat CMRI&#xD;
      30 to 40 days post STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exclude patients with 1)-culprit lesion in the distal artery,&#xD;
      2)-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2, 3)-pacemaker, defibrillator, aneurysm&#xD;
      clips, 4)-body weight &gt; 400lb, 5)-history of allergic reactions to gadlinium based contrast&#xD;
      agents, and 6)-those unwilling to participate in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the CMRI myocardial infarct size (scar). The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the CMRI transmurality of scar, area at risk, myocardial salvage index,&#xD;
      microvascular obstruction (MVO), left ventricle (LV) thrombus, and LV ejection fraction (EF).&#xD;
      Important covariates include symptoms and ST segment resolution before and after the PCI,&#xD;
      peak cardiac troponin (cTn), and angiographic TIMI flow and myocardial perfusion grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed with repeat CMRI at 30 to 40 days and with phone survey at 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;
