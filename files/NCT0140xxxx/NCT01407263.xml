  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine how different ways of performing prostate cancer surgery affect&#xD;
      patient outcomes, such as recurrence of cancer or regaining control of bladder function&#xD;
      (continence) after surgery. Surgery to remove the prostate is known as a &quot;radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy&quot;. Surgeons know many things about the best way to do a radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
      However, there is uncertainty about some methods of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the surgeons who are taking part in this study have used these techniques at different&#xD;
      times. However, they are unsure as to what is the best approach. This trial will evaluate&#xD;
      whether the following two aspects of surgical technique influence outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph node template. Prostate cancer can sometimes spread to the lymph nodes near the&#xD;
      prostate. Surgeons often remove these lymph nodes to make sure that no cancer is left in the&#xD;
      body. However, there is uncertainty about which lymph nodes to remove (the &quot;template&quot;). In&#xD;
      particular, not all surgeons think that it is important to remove a large number of lymph&#xD;
      nodes. Some believe that prostate cancer found in the lymph nodes is not aggressive. As a&#xD;
      result, these surgeons feel that removing additional lymph nodes does not improve the chance&#xD;
      that a patient will be cured. In the study patients will either have the standard lymph node&#xD;
      dissection or a modified approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Port site incision. Some surgeries are conducted with the help of what is called a surgical&#xD;
      &quot;robot&quot;, or using a laparoscopic approach (sometimes known as &quot;keyhole&quot; surgery). The&#xD;
      surgeons have to make small cuts (&quot;incisions&quot;) in order to insert their surgical instruments.&#xD;
      Some surgeons believe that the way in which this cut is made can affect the chance that a&#xD;
      patient will develop a hernia in the months after surgery. This is when tissues in the&#xD;
      abdomen protrude through the incision, creating a small bulge that has to be surgically&#xD;
      corrected. In the study, patients will either have the incision made vertically or&#xD;
      horizontally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics. About a week after surgery, you will return to the hospital to have your&#xD;
      catheter removed. To guard against the chance of infection, you will be given antibiotics.&#xD;
      These do help prevent infection, but are also harmful. Doctors are unsure whether to give a&#xD;
      short course of antibiotics or whether patients really need several days of treatment. In the&#xD;
      study, patients will receive antibiotics for either one or three days.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-reported hernia is a routine assessment on post-operative questionnaires completed by prostate cancer patients at MSKCC. The questionnaire asks about hernia near the surgical scar and if there has been a need for surgical repair of the hernia.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical recurrence is defined as any postoperative PSA of 0.2 ng / mL or higher, or treatment with hormones, radiotherapy or chemotherapy starting six months or more after radical prostatectomy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>urinary tract infection (UTI)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>urinary tract infection (UTI) within 10 days of catheter removal. We will use the CDC's definition of UTI: symptomatic UTI diagnosed in patients with positive urine cultures (â‰¥100,000 microorganisms per cm3) and at least one of the following signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause: fever (&gt;38oC), urgency, frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness.50 UTI is routinely captured by clinical staff as a surgical complication.</description>
