  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the few mostly observed distressing&#xD;
      toxicity of cancer treatment. It can occur up to 90% in case of highly emetogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy use. CINV causes disturbance in daily living of cancer patient and reduces&#xD;
      compliance with treatment Even with the standard anti-emetic measures up to 50% patient can&#xD;
      suffer from this complication. Whereas there is standard anti-emetic guideline exists in case&#xD;
      of adult patients, there no such guidelines made in pediatric population. The new drug&#xD;
      Aprepitant has been recommended for use in adults with high efficacy, there no such concrete&#xD;
      data available in children regarding its use. There are few retrospective reports and limited&#xD;
      data available regarding use of Aprepitant in children with satisfactory efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      CINV. As there no randomized large data to suggests its efficacy and its routine use in&#xD;
      children, we have planned this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents (5-18 years) with weight between 15-65 kg receiving highly&#xD;
      emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin/Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin/Doxorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique Subjects who met the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned using&#xD;
      random allocation number generated by computer into one of the two groups. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization will be the subject at first cycle of HEC. The same patient will not be&#xD;
      enrolled for twice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The data will be collected from each patient from d1 to d10 of chemotherapy of which&#xD;
           patient will received chemotherapy in day care, maximum up to d3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After taking consent patient will be enrolled as per inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
           and randomized to one of two groups. All baseline assessment will be done. Patient will&#xD;
           be explained about the filling of the diary. In first 2 days. The subjects will fill the&#xD;
           diary under the investigator supervision, and the rest of filling will be in home.&#xD;
           Reinforcement will be done over phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure of double blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double blinding will be done for the intervention. Four different boxes will be made for&#xD;
           capsules. Total 3 capsules for 3 days will be made in a blister pack, mentioning the d1,&#xD;
           d2, d3 (for each capsule). Two different body weight groups will be made: 15-40 kg, and&#xD;
           41-65 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;A&quot; will be the code for Aprepitant group and group &quot;B&quot; will be code for control&#xD;
           group. Both patient and the investigator will be blinded regarding medicine in the code.&#xD;
