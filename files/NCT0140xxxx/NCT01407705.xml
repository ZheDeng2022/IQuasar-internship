    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective study, designed to analyze the efficacy of&#xD;
      High-Resolution Diffusion Tensor Imaging for accurately sensing white matter tracts in&#xD;
      subjects with spinal cord injury. Study subjects will not be randomized, as treatment will&#xD;
      follow the doctor's &quot;standard of care.&quot; Patients will be selected and offered enrollment&#xD;
      based upon the clinical diagnosis of spinal cord injury, either due to degenerative disease&#xD;
      or trauma. Enrollment will be based on the chronology of patient presentation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result from trauma as well as degenerative conditions, such as&#xD;
      cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Both have a profound impact on the physical and mental&#xD;
      health of the affected individual. The symptoms of CSM can include weakness in the arms or&#xD;
      legs, difficulty with walking and balance, loss of dexterity in the hands, and bowel or&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction. Traumatic spinal cord injury often includes damage to white matter&#xD;
      tracts resulting in irreversible functional deficits such as paraplegia or quadriplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although current diagnostic imaging can reveal highly specific parameters of spinal canal&#xD;
      anatomy, the functional anatomy of the spinal cord remains unknown. Patients with similar&#xD;
      diagnostic findings can vary clinically with many patients having minimal to no symptoms&#xD;
      while others may be severely incapacitated. Conventional MRI methods, such as T1/T2 weighted&#xD;
      MRI, may easily identify the region of the damage and may depict permanent changes in the&#xD;
      spinal cord tissue. However, conventional MRI methods are limited in their ability to&#xD;
      correlate imaging findings with short and long term functional outcomes from spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. DTI has the potential to improve upon conventional MRI imaging by providing&#xD;
      information about tissue microstructure and may be particularly well suited for assessing the&#xD;
      integrity of fiber tracts in SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) is a new technique that is highly sensitive&#xD;
      in detecting the integrity of white matter tracts. Although information obtained from DTI has&#xD;
      been utilized for white matter abnormalities in the brain, DTI of the spinal cord in vivo has&#xD;
      provided many challenges. The small size of the spinal cord and the close packing of its&#xD;
      white matter tracts require a very high image resolution to visualize these individual&#xD;
      tracts. The resolution required to image the small cross sectional area of the spinal cord&#xD;
      has been difficult to achieve using most widely used DTI sequences. To date, DTI measurements&#xD;
      reports have demonstrated a practical application of DTI on the cervical spinal cord with&#xD;
      limited spatial resolutions from 8 mm3 to 16 mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve high-resolution DTI of the spinal cord, two novel imaging techniques for&#xD;
      high-resolution in-vivo DTI on a clinical 3T MRI system (Trio, Siemens Medical Solution,&#xD;
      Erlangen Germany) have been developed: 2D singleshot Interleaved Multiple Inner Volume DWEPI&#xD;
      (ss-IMIV-DWEPI) and 3D singleshot DW STimulated EPI (3D ss-DWSTEPI). These optimized DTI&#xD;
      pulse sequences have typically achieved approximately 2.0 or 1.253 mm3 spatial resolution&#xD;
      within clinically achievable imaging time (~5 min.). The sequences have been designed&#xD;
      especially for high-resolution DTI of cervical spinal cord. They have been applied to spinal&#xD;
      cord specimens ex vivo as well as to a small group of healthy volunteers and multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis patients.&#xD;
