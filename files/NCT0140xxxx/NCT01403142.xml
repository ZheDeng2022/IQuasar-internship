  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a unique form of accelerated plaque formation seen in&#xD;
      the coronary arteries of patients who have received heart transplantation. It is a major&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after heart transplant. Little progress has been&#xD;
      made in characterizing this disease process, with more sophisticated imaging allowing for&#xD;
      more detailed analysis of CAV, superior stratification of transplant recipients is possible&#xD;
      and earlier interventions can be performed if necessary to prevent mortality and graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a novel imaging modality with much higher resolution&#xD;
      then Intra-Vascular Ultrasound (IVUS). This study will involve examining patients post-heart&#xD;
      transplant using this high-resolution imaging modality. It is currently the standard care for&#xD;
      patients post-heart transplant to receive annual coronary angiograms with close follow up.&#xD;
      Patients will be imaged using OCT at the time of their routine annual angiogram, and will be&#xD;
      re-imaged one year later at the time of the next annual angiogram or earlier if clinically&#xD;
      indicated. The study goal is to better characterize CAV in vivo with OCT imaging and to try&#xD;
      to identify patterns of the disease, including intra-coronary risk assessment.&#xD;

      This study will involve imaging up to 100 patients at different points in time post heart&#xD;
      transplant as part of their standard of care, with various degrees of disease and with&#xD;
      different lesion subtypes. Imaging will take place at the time of routine coronary angiogram,&#xD;
      which is standard of care in this patient population,or when clinically indicated. In prior&#xD;
      studies using IVUS todetect CAV, the yield was significantly higher with multi-vessels&#xD;
      imaged. OCT is an intravascular light-based imaging modality that measures the intensity of&#xD;
      reflected light waves and converts these echoes into a high-resolution tomographic image. It&#xD;
      is a catheter-based invasive imaging system analogous to IVUS but uses light as opposed to&#xD;
      ultrasound to generate in vivo images of coronary arteries. It has the highest resolution of&#xD;
      any intravascular imaging modality, capable of obtaining detailed cross-sectional images of&#xD;
      coronary arteries in vivo at a resolution of 10 um or near histologic. This device, which is&#xD;
      FDA approved for intracoronary evaluation, has been used in evaluating patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, specifically for plaque composition analysis, as well as for proper stent&#xD;
      deployment after percutaneous intervention.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post heart transplant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients presenting for their routine annual or clinically indicated coronary&#xD;
             angiogram post-heart transplant. The decision for coronary angiogram will be made by&#xD;
             the treating physician from the heart-failure-transplant team (not by the physician&#xD;
             who will do the angiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically suspect or evidence of CAV in previous coronary angiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed-consent obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any complications that occur during routine biopsy of the coronary arteries during the&#xD;
             same cath-lab visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline renal failure with Cr &gt; 1.8&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication for anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigators would alter the safety of&#xD;
             participation, or interfere with the ability to adhere to study procedures.&#xD;
