  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Status Asthmaticus is recognized as a common cause of morbidity in children in the United&#xD;
      States (CDC). In recent years, hospitalization rates have reached an all time high. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the effect of early use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation&#xD;
      (NPPV) in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with moderate to&#xD;
      moderately severe status asthmaticus to test the hypothesis that early initiation of NPPV&#xD;
      plus standard of care will result in decreased length of PICU stay, significant improvement&#xD;
      in clinical asthma score (CAS) and reduced patient care costs when compared to standard of&#xD;
      care alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common, chronic and complex disorder of the airways, with symptoms that are&#xD;
      variable and recurring. It is characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness to various&#xD;
      stimuli, airflow obstruction that is often reversible, and underlying inflammation.&#xD;
      Conventional therapy for status asthmaticus is directed at relieving broncho-constriction,&#xD;
      decreasing airway inflammation and clearing airway mucus. However, in some patients, maximal&#xD;
      standard therapies are inadequate and can lead to prolonged hospitalization. Intubation and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in patients with asthma is associated with significant risks. NPPV has&#xD;
      several advantages over invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation. It leaves the upper&#xD;
      airway intact, and avoids the risks associated with endotracheal intubation including upper&#xD;
      airway trauma, laryngeal swelling, postextubation vocal cord dysfunction, and nosocomial&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, open-labeled, randomized clinical trial comparing the use&#xD;
      of NPPV plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in children admitted for status&#xD;
      asthmaticus. A simple random numbers table will be used to assign subjects to either the NPPV&#xD;
      plus standard of care group or standard of care alone group. In the first hour, all patients&#xD;
      in both groups will receive a 2mg/kg dose of systemic steroid, continuous albuterol at&#xD;
      0.5mg/kg/hr (max of 15mg/hr) with 3 doses of 0.25-0.5 mg nebulized ipratropium bromide, and&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen keep saturation &gt;92%. Patients on both therapeutic arms will continue to&#xD;
      receive 2mg/kg dose of systemic steroid per day, continuous albuterol at 0.5mg/kg/hr (max of&#xD;
      15mg/hr) and supplemental oxygen to keep saturation &gt;92%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the NPPV plus standard of care group will be fitted with a nasal or&#xD;
      face mask and placed on the Respironics V60 bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)&#xD;
      Ventilator 33. Masks with gel seals at different pressure points will be used to prevent skin&#xD;
      breakdown. To optimize patient cooperation, the mask will initially be applied manually to&#xD;
      the patient's face. After a short adaptation period for the patient to feel comfortable, the&#xD;
      mask will be firmly applied with head straps to minimize air leak without causing skin&#xD;
      injury. Pressures will initially be low for comfort and acceptance while being placed on the&#xD;
      machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the standard of care group will be placed on a similar continuous&#xD;
      nebulizer attached to a similar oxygen blender as the ones used with the V60 unit set-up,&#xD;
      using the same liter flow (11 liters per minute). An aerosol mask will be placed on the&#xD;
      patient to aid in the delivery of the medication. The oxygen will be analyzed at the site of&#xD;
      this mask with the initial set-up and any time the oxygen is decreased or increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline as soon as the patient is enrolled in the study. It will&#xD;
      include: demographic variables, medical record number, age, race, gender; history and&#xD;
      physical findings, other medical conditions, vital signs, oxygen saturation at baseline, CAS,&#xD;
      peak flow in children &gt;6 years of age, asthma severity prior to admission, NPPV settings,&#xD;
      length of stay in the PICU, side effect profiles (tremor, tachycardia, agitation, nausea,&#xD;
      nasal bridge pain, skin irritation/ulceration, gastric distension, dry eyes/mucosal dryness,&#xD;
      sinus/ear pain, aspiration pneumonia, hypotension and pneumothorax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child's participation in the study will end when the child is transferred from the PICU.&#xD;
