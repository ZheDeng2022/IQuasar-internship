  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several multicenter studies have shown the equivalence of hypofractionated radiotherapy and&#xD;
      normofractionated radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. However, the treatment in&#xD;
      these studies was carried out with conventional techniques and not with the modern IMRT. Also&#xD;
      the evaluation of quality of life and cosmetic outcome were not standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a two-arm prospective study comparing normofractionated and hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer using tangential IMRT techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are acute and chronic cosmetic breast changes. The secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is the patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients to be included are breast cancer 60 years old patients or older with tumour stages&#xD;
      pTis-pT3, pN0-pN1a, M0 after breast-conserving surgery. Patients with right sided breast&#xD;
      cancer are stratified to receive a hypofractionated treatment course (40.05 / 2.67Gy in 15&#xD;
      fractions) and the left sided breast cancer a normofractionated irradiation (50/2Gy in 25&#xD;
      fractions). In both arms, patients between 60-69 years are to receive a boost (16 Gy / 2Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, a tangential intensity-modulated radiation technique aiming to achieve&#xD;
      optimal dose homogeneity is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since higher single radiation dose to the heart can lead to higher morbidity and/or&#xD;
      mortality, patient stratification according to the diseased side was adopted where the&#xD;
      left-sided breast cancer patients would receive normofractionated 2Gy single dose. Therefore&#xD;
      there is no randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For classification and grading of adverse cosmetic events, the &quot;Common Toxicity Criteria&#xD;
      (CTC-AE V3.0) and the recognized LENT-SOMA scores are to be regularly documented. Quality of&#xD;
      life is to be documented with two standardized, validated questionnaires &quot;QLQ C30 and BR23&quot;&#xD;
      of the EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer). The questionnaires&#xD;
      are to be filled by the patients themselves at different time points during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sum of grade III fibrosis, grade III telangiectasia and grade II hyperpigmentation of&#xD;
      around 20% is expected after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power&#xD;
      of 80% with a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 15% within 2 years results in the need&#xD;
      for recruiting 226 patients (113 in each arm) (non-inferiority of hypofractionated therapy).&#xD;
