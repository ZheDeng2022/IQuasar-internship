      This study aims to observe the therapeutic effect of leukotriene modulator montelukast alone&#xD;
      or combined with inhaled corticosteroid(ICS) on cough variant asthma(CVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cough score and cough reflex sensitivity will be improved after treatment with&#xD;
           montelukast, inhaled corticosteroid/β2 agonist(ICS/LABA), and two combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Combination of leukotriene modulator and inhaled corticosteroid/β2 agonist may have&#xD;
           better efficacy when compared to montelukast, corticosteroid/β2 agonist alone while MON,&#xD;
           is comparable to symbicort.&#xD;

      Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      99 patients diagnosed with CVA will be randomised into three groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: inhaled corticosteroid+β2 agonist The patients with cough variant asthma received&#xD;
      Symbicort Turbuhaler (Budesonide 160µg and Formoterol 4.5µg) 1puff Q12h for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: montelukast The patients with cough variant asthma received montelukast 10mg QN for&#xD;
      8 weeks, without any other corticosteroid or β2 agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: montelukast combined with inhaled corticosteroid+β2 agonist The patients with cough&#xD;
      variant asthma received montelukast 10mg QN combined with Symbicort Turbuhaler (Budesonide&#xD;
      160µg and Formoterol 4.5µg) 1puff Q12h for 8 weeks..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First Visit (Visit 1, day -6):&#xD;
&#xD;
           A full medical history and physical examination to be undertaken to determine whether&#xD;
           patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the informed consent has been signed, the following samples are obtained from all&#xD;
           patients: blood samples for routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology, biochemistry&#xD;
           and chest x-ray). A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of childbearing&#xD;
           potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bronchial provocation test by methacholine inhalation are performed to determined the&#xD;
           presence of bronchial non-specific hyper-responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are given the Diary Card.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening Period ( day -6 to day 0, 6 Days) Patients took two medications as bellows for&#xD;
           3 days and followed by 3 days of wash-out period. Patients should completed 6 days diary&#xD;
           card, starting from day -6 to week 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bambuterol HCI (Bambec, brand name), 10 mg qn po Theophylline tablet sustained release,&#xD;
           100mg bid po&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Second Visit (Visit 2, Week 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
           A physical examination were to be performed. All laboratory tests results are obtained&#xD;
           to determine whether patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Concurrent&#xD;
           medication were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Diary Card were collected, reviewed and assessed whether ICS, bronchodilator or&#xD;
           ICS/BD treatment is efficient for cough symptom (symptom score improved 1 at least).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Capsaicin challenge test and FENO were performed and hypertonic saline induced sputum&#xD;
           samples for cell differential, urine leukotriene, serum IgE, were taken from enrolled&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrolled patients were randomized into different groups, and the study medication were&#xD;
           dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During Treatment 1(Week 0 to Week 4, 14 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients were to take study medication for 28 days and completed Diary Card for 7 days&#xD;
           from Week 3 to Week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Third Visit (Visit 3, Week 4):&#xD;
&#xD;
           A physical examination were to be performed. The Diary Card were collected and reviewed.&#xD;
           Adverse events, secondary complications, concurrent medication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Capsaicin challenge test and FENO were performed and hypertonic saline induced sputum&#xD;
           samples for cell differential were taken from enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. During Treatment 2 (Week 4 to Week 8, 14 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients were to take study medication for 28 days and completed Diary Card for 7 days&#xD;
           from Week 7 to Week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Forth Visit (Visit 4, Week 8):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination and were to be performed. The Diary Card were collected and reviewed.&#xD;
      Residual (unused) medications were to be returned. Adverse events, secondary complications,&#xD;
      concurrent medication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsaicin challenge test and FENO were performed and hypertonic saline induced sputum samples&#xD;
      for cell differential, urine leukotriene, serum IgE, were taken from enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology and biochemistry) were&#xD;
      obtained, if a clinically significant laboratory abnormal result was noted at the visit 4, AE&#xD;
      and a follow-up visit would be considered.&#xD;
