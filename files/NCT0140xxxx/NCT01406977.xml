  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine tolerability, PK/PD and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      BPS804 in adult patients with HPP treated with multiple escalating doses of BPS804.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow a comparison of several doses of the study drug within the first two&#xD;
      weeks after administration and after a longer assessment period for the highest dose level to&#xD;
      enable selection of dose ranges to be tested in subsequent studies in the HPP indication.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients 18 to 60 years of age in good health (other than&#xD;
             pre-established clinical diagnosis of HPP) as determined by past medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously established clinical diagnosis of HPP with confirmed ALPL mutation by&#xD;
             genetic test and as manifested by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum alkaline phosphatase levels below the age-adjusted normal range and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiologic evidence of osteopenia or osteomalacia or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of plasma PLP at least twice the upper limit of normal range or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of rickets, or history of premature loss of decidious teeth, or bone deformity&#xD;
             consistent with osteomalacia or past rickets, or past non-traumatic fracture,&#xD;
             pseudofracture, or non-healing fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  25-(OH) vitamin D3 serum level of ≥20 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normocalcemia with serum calcium ≥8.5 mg/dL and ≤10.2 mg/dL and normal phosphate&#xD;
             levels (2.4 - 4.1 mg/dL) (or according to local laboratory ranges).&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;

             of the skin and for skeletal malignancies see below), within the past 5 years,&#xD;
             regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of skeletal malignancies or bone metastases at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of external beam radiation to the skeleton.&#xD;

             endocrine disorders or conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any anti-resorptive medication (e.g., oral and/or injectable),&#xD;
             bisphosphonates and/or teriparatide (e.g., ForteoTM) within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to blood products or monoclonal antibodies within previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any deformation of the spine (e.g., severe scoliosis, ankylosing spondylitis) or the&#xD;
             hip which would preclude proper acquisition of lumbar spine or hip BMD by DXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
