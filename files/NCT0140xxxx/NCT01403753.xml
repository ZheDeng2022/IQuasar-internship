  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to measure and quantify children's beliefs about the satiating&#xD;
      properties (i.e. expected satiation)of snack foods. The investigators predicted that children&#xD;
      who were especially familiar with snack foods would expect them to deliver greater satiation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Palatability is regarded as a major determinant of children's energy intake. However, few&#xD;
      studies have considered other &quot;non-hedonic&quot; beliefs about foods. In adults there is emerging&#xD;
      evidence that expectations about the satiating properties of foods are an important&#xD;
      determinant of meal size, and that these beliefs are learned over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we measured and quantified children's 'expected satiation' across&#xD;
      energy-dense snack foods using a psychophysical technique known as method of adjustment.&#xD;
      Participants changed a comparison-food portion (pasta and tomato sauce) to match the&#xD;
      satiation that they expected from a snack food. We predicted that children who were&#xD;
      especially familiar with snack foods would expect them to generate greater satiation, and&#xD;
      that children who were unfamiliar would match expected satiation based on the physical&#xD;
      characteristics (perceived volume) of the foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, seventy 11- to 12-year-old children completed computerised measures of expected&#xD;
      satiation, perceived volume, familiarity, and liking across six snack foods. Our analyses&#xD;
      focused on the associations between these measures. This approach enabled us to establish&#xD;
      differences in healthy behaviours that are evident across individuals.&#xD;
