    <textblock>
      This is a four-part study of the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of sodium nitrite&#xD;
      inhalation solution (AIR001) of ascending multiple doses (Part A) and of escalating doses&#xD;
      with steady-state sildenafil (Part B) to healthy male and female subjects, as well as&#xD;
      assessment of the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of AIR001 to patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (part C) with a single dose PK study of AIR001 utilizing&#xD;
      three different nebulizers (Part D).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in the blood pressure (BP) in the small pulmonary&#xD;
      vessels, arteries, veins or capillaries that results in progressive increases in right&#xD;
      ventricular afterload, often leading to right ventricular failure and death. Pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension can result from a multitude of pathologies, including arterial etiologies,&#xD;
      venous, chronic hypoxia related, thromboembolic, and other miscellaneous etiologies. In the&#xD;
      recent Dana Point Classification, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was classified as&#xD;
      Group 1. In Group 1 PAH, the pathologic lesion is localized to the small muscular pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries, resulting in luminal narrowing and resistance to blood flow. Group 1 PAH includes&#xD;
      idiopathic or sporadic PAH and heritable PAH which includes those with a family history of&#xD;
      PAH. Associated PAH includes disease associated with connective tissue disease as well as PAH&#xD;
      associated with congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, and human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Drug and toxin induced PAH is also in Group 1.&#xD;
      Untreated, patients with PAH have an average life expectancy of 3 years, which declines to&#xD;
      approximately 1 year if right heart failure is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a potent acute vasodilator. Its acute administration results in&#xD;
      improved hemodynamics in the 10 to 15% of patients with PAH who demonstrate acute&#xD;
      vasoreactivity. However, the usefulness of NO for chronic therapy is limited by the need for&#xD;
      continuous inhalation. In patients who demonstrate vasoreactivity during an acute challenge&#xD;
      with inhaled NO or a prostanoid challenge, therapy with calcium channel blockers has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to result in improved symptoms and survival. In patients who do not demonstrate&#xD;
      an acute vasodilator response, available therapies for PAH include prostanoids, endothelin&#xD;
      receptor antagonists (ERA), and phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. However, the&#xD;
      route and frequency of administration of the prostanoids, the hepatotoxicity of the ERAs, and&#xD;
      concerns about the sustained efficacy of both the ERAs and PDE-5 inhibitors suggests that&#xD;
      many patients with PAH could benefit from an effective therapy which offers ease of&#xD;
      administration and a favorable toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a novel therapeutic, AIR001, for the treatment of&#xD;
      PAH. The active ingredient in AIR001 is sodium nitrite, formulated in a buffered, pH-adjusted&#xD;
      solution for nebulization. Preclinical data suggest that under the hypoxic, acidotic&#xD;
      conditions present in the pulmonary hypertensive lung, inhaled sodium nitrite serves as a&#xD;
      sustained release source of NO which will act as an acute pulmonary vasodilator. In addition,&#xD;
      because decreased levels of NO have been shown to stimulate vascular remodeling, the&#xD;
      increased NO resulting from nitrite inhalation is postulated to attenuate or reverse the&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial remodeling process, resulting in both symptomatic improvement and&#xD;
      pulmonary hemodynamic improvement in patients with PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical experiments have shown that AIR001 by oral, IV, and inhalation routes of&#xD;
      administration is effective in treating PAH induced by hypoxia or monocrotaline when&#xD;
      administered as infrequently as once weekly at doses that generate plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      approximately 1 to 10 uM and above. While the precise mechanism by which AIR001 exerts&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive actions in PAH models remains to be elucidated, nitrite itself has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be metabolized to NO in animals and humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single doses of AIR001 have been shown to be well tolerated in humans at dose levels that&#xD;
      generate peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in the target range established in preclinical&#xD;
      models and no safety issues have been identified. AIR001 reduced PH induced by hypoxic gas&#xD;
      inhalation in healthy volunteers at doses that are well tolerated. Preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      data support further clinical investigation of inhaled AIR001 for the treatment of PAH.&#xD;
      Before progressing to studies in patients with PAH, the safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      dose administration of AIR001 will be evaluated in Part A of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PDE-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, is approved for use in patients with PAH and commonly used&#xD;
      in the initial treatment for PAH. AIR001 is converted to NO, which increases cGMP dependent&#xD;
      vasodilatation. Because PDE-5 inhibitors prevent the catabolism of cGMP by phosphodiesterase,&#xD;
      it is possible that an exaggerated drug effect could be observed when AIR001 is administered&#xD;
      to patients being treated with sildenafil. Therefore, combination safety and tolerability (in&#xD;
      particular orthostatic effects) of escalating single doses of AIR001 will also be evaluated&#xD;
      in combination with steady-state sildenafil in Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of patients with previously diagnosed PAH on stable background therapy will be&#xD;
      assessed for safety and tolerability of multiple doses of AIR001 in Part C of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part D of the study will assess the PK, safety and tolerability of single dose AIR001 with&#xD;
      each of three different nebulizers in a randomized crossover design.&#xD;
