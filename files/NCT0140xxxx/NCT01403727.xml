      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the differences between PercuNav assisted and&#xD;
      unassisted biopsy in the areas of CT radiation dose, procedure time and biopsy accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will compare the use of electromagnetic&#xD;
      tracking and image guidance (CT) during biopsy procedures verses the typical CT image guided&#xD;
      procedure alone.&#xD;

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the differences between PercuNav assisted and&#xD;
      unassisted biopsy. The primary objective of this study is to assess and quantify any&#xD;
      differences between assisted and unassisted CT guided biopsy procedures of the liver with&#xD;
      respect to radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess and quantify any differences between&#xD;
      assisted and unassisted CT guided biopsy procedures with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total procedure time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accuracy of needle targeting (distance from defined target on PercuNav and angle of&#xD;
           entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of needle passes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target registration error (TRE- distance between &quot;virtual&quot; needle position (tracking&#xD;
           data) and the actual needle position (CT confirmation scan))&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 50 patients from 1 site. The expected completion time for&#xD;
      enrollment is 3 months, but will depend on the ability of the clinic to enroll patients.&#xD;
      There are two arms in the study. An Unassisted Biopsy Control arm (physician and patient&#xD;
      blinded to needle positioning using PercuNav system) and Assisted Biopsy (Physician not&#xD;
      blinded to needle positioning using PercuNav). Patients will be randomized to each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PercuNav provides real-time, three-dimensional visualization and navigation tools for all&#xD;
      stages of diagnosis and surgery including pre-procedure planning and intra-procedure&#xD;
      navigation. PercuNav transforms two-dimensional patient images (scan sets), derived from CT,&#xD;
      PET/CT and MRI into dynamic representations on which a tool can be navigated and fused with&#xD;
      ultrasound. The system performs spatial mapping from one image space to another image space&#xD;
      or from image space to physical space (registration) allowing the physician to correlate scan&#xD;
      sets with each other and to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this trial, each patient will have a pre-procedure CT image set of the area of interest.&#xD;
      The image set should display the patient in the same position that the biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed in, although not requisite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unassisted Biopsy - CONTROL GROUP (Physician blinded to PercuNav system):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tracking device will be placed on the patient's skin at the desired point of entry.&#xD;
      Without displaying the PercuNav screen to the physician, a screen capture will be taken to&#xD;
      record the approach path. At the point of insertion, the time stamp will be recorded and the&#xD;
      start button will be pressed. Once the physician states they are at the defined target a&#xD;
      screen capture will be taken on the PercuNav and the distance to target and time stamp will&#xD;
      be recorded by pushing the start button again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final dose of radiation displayed by the CT scanner will be recorded on the Case Report&#xD;
      Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assisted Biopsy - STUDY GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tracking device will be placed on the patient's skin at the desired point of entry.&#xD;
      Without displaying the PercuNav screen to the physician, a screen capture will be taken to&#xD;
      record the approach path. The physician will be shown the PercuNav screen and will correct&#xD;
      the desired approach path and another screen capture will be taken. At the point of&#xD;
      insertion, the time stamp will be recorded and the start button will be pressed. Once the&#xD;
      physician states they are at the defined target a screen capture will be taken on the&#xD;
      PercuNav and the distance to target and time stamp will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final dose of radiation displayed by the CT scanner will be recorded on the Case Report&#xD;
      Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to quantify, in terms of a point estimate and confidence&#xD;
      interval, the treatment effect which characterizes the mean difference in number of CT scans&#xD;
      between the &quot;unassisted&quot; CT and &quot;assisted&quot; CT groups during guided liver biopsy procedures.&#xD;
      More specifically, the goal will be to show with 95% Confidence that the &quot;assisted&quot; CT&#xD;
      procedure leads to 3 fewer scans, on average, than the &quot;unassisted&quot; CT group during guided&#xD;
      liver biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: uT - aT &lt; 3 scans HA: uT - aT &gt;= 3 scans uT = mean number of scans during &quot;unassisted&quot; CT&#xD;
      procedure aT = mean number of scans during &quot;assisted&quot; CT procedure Equivalently, the desired&#xD;
      superiority will have been demonstrated whenever the lower 95% confidence limit on the&#xD;
      difference, &quot;unassisted&quot; CT minus &quot;assisted&quot; CT, exceeds 3 scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint and Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study is the number of CT radiation exposure scans received&#xD;
      during the course of a CT guided liver biopsy procedure. The primary study objective is to&#xD;
      characterize the difference in the number of scans received between the &quot;assisted&quot; and the&#xD;
      &quot;unassisted&quot; CT groups during guided liver biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measure that will be assessed and quantified is any differences between assisted&#xD;
      and unassisted CT guided liver biopsies with respect to radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary measures that will be assessed and quantified are any differences between&#xD;
      assisted and unassisted CT guided procedures with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total procedure time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accuracy of needle targeting (distance from defined target on PercuNav and angle of&#xD;
           entry)&#xD;
