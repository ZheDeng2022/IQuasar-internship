      The objective of the proposed research is to improve quality of care for older outpatients&#xD;
      who present to Emergency Departments and Fracture Clinics with an osteoporosis-related wrist&#xD;
      or other upper extremity fracture. Although most of these patients warrant evidence-based and&#xD;
      guideline-recommended osteoporosis testing and treatment, numerous studies demonstrate&#xD;
      treatment rates less than 10-20% in the year post-fracture. Several trials, including the&#xD;
      investigators own prior studies, have tried to address this osteoporosis care-gap and have&#xD;
      reported that various multifaceted interventions (combinations of patient and physician&#xD;
      education, guidelines, and physician reminders) can modestly improve treatment rates compared&#xD;
      with usual care, although 60-70% of the patients exposed to these interventions still remain&#xD;
      untreated. The investigators believe that a case-manager (who identifies and independently&#xD;
      sees patients in clinic, arranges bone mineral density [BMD] tests, and offers&#xD;
      guideline-based treatment to those with low BMD) represents a potential solution that holds&#xD;
      great promise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that an osteoporosis case-manager will effectively and&#xD;
      efficiently increase rates of osteoporosis treatment in older outpatients with upper&#xD;
      extremity fractures when compared with a documented effective and cost-saving multifaceted&#xD;
      intervention. To test this hypothesis the investigators propose a pragmatic patient-level&#xD;
      randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial with blinded outcomes ascertainment&#xD;
      that compares the case-manager strategy with the multifaceted intervention.&#xD;

      Objective: To improve treatment of osteoporosis in older patients with upper extremity&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Osteoporosis causes low bone mass and skeletal fragility leading to fractures of&#xD;
      the hip, spine, and upper extremity that cause pain, deformity, disability, and even death.&#xD;
      It affects 2 million older Canadians and costs us a billion dollars a year. Guidelines&#xD;
      recommend aggressive treatment in older patients with osteoporosis-related fractures because&#xD;
      risk of another fracture is 20% within 1-year and because bisphosphonate treatment reduces&#xD;
      fracture risk by 50%. Unfortunately, less than 10% of older outpatients are treated for&#xD;
      osteoporosis in the year post-fracture and even the most effective multifaceted interventions&#xD;
      tested so far (i.e., combinations of patient education with physician guidelines and&#xD;
      reminders) have only increased post-fracture osteoporosis treatment rates with&#xD;
      bisphosphonates to 22%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Strategy: Osteoporosis case-managers will identify older fracture patients in&#xD;
      Emergency Departments and Fracture Clinics; arrange bone mineral density (BMD) tests; meet&#xD;
      with patients to counsel them and go over their results; and then offer and prescribe&#xD;
      bisphosphonate treatment to those with low BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An osteoporosis case-manager will effectively and efficiently increase rates of&#xD;
      BMD testing and bisphosphonate treatment in older high-risk patients with upper extremity&#xD;
      fractures compared with a previously tested effective and cost-saving multifaceted&#xD;
      osteoporosis intervention (an active-comparator control consisting of telephone-based&#xD;
      education for patients and treatment guidelines with reminders for family physicians).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: To determine whether an osteoporosis case-manager strategy can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase rates of osteoporosis treatment more than a multifaceted intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase rates of BMD testing more than a multifaceted intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Be cost-effective when compared with either multifaceted intervention or usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial with blinded&#xD;
      (allocation-concealed) ascertainment of outcomes comparing case-managers to the multifaceted&#xD;
      intervention. Eligible patients will be 50 years and older with an upper extremity fracture&#xD;
      and not already treated with bisphosphonates, recruited from Emergency Departments and&#xD;
      Fracture Clinics. Primary outcome will be the proportion starting bisphosphonates within&#xD;
      6-months. Secondary outcomes include BMD testing, any osteoporosis treatment, and appropriate&#xD;
      care. Case-managers are expected to increase bisphosphonate treatment rates to 43% (achieved&#xD;
      in our pilot trial) vs published multifaceted intervention rates of 22%. With alpha=0.05,&#xD;
      beta=0.9, and 10% attrition rates, the total minimum required sample size is 240 patients.&#xD;
      Using 1-year outcomes and micro-costing data from the trial and our published Markov decision&#xD;
      analytic model for osteoporosis quality improvement interventions, the incremental costs and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the case-manager will then be compared to both the multifaceted intervention&#xD;
      and usual care. Major secondary outcome includes long-term treatment persistence, and to&#xD;
      examine this question (e.g., 80% persistence rates with case-manager vs 50% persistence with&#xD;
      multifaceted intervention) will require a sample size of at least 360 patients.&#xD;
