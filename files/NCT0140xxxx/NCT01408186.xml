  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peptic ulcer bleeding associated with ASA or NSAIDs is a major cause of hospitalization in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. The investigators previously showed that ASA or NSAIDs accounted for about half of&#xD;
      all cases of hospitalizations for peptic ulcer bleeding. Currently, ASA use has contributed&#xD;
      to about one-third of the bleeding ulcers admitted to the investigators hospital that serves&#xD;
      a local population of 1.5 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke who develop ASA-induced&#xD;
      bleeding peptic ulcers, whether ASA should be discontinued before ulcers have healed is a&#xD;
      major dilemma. In another double-blind randomized trial, the investigators have shown that&#xD;
      discontinuation of ASA after endoscopic treatment of bleeding ulcers was associated with a&#xD;
      significantly increased in mortality within 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of safer aspirins, co-therapy with a gastroprotective drug remains the&#xD;
      dominant preventive strategy. Given the vast number of people taking ASA, however, it is only&#xD;
      cost-effective to identify and treat those who are at high risk of ulcer bleeding and who&#xD;
      have a strong indication for ASA use. Data from observational studies and randomized trials&#xD;
      have consistently shown that PPIs are effective in reducing the risk of ulcer bleeding&#xD;
      associated with ASA. Other potential preventive strategies include eradication of H. pylori&#xD;
      infection, substitution of ASA for other non-aspirin anti-platelet drugs, and co-therapy with&#xD;
      misoprostol or H2RAs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No dose of &quot;low-dose&quot; aspirin (ASA) is safe in terms of the risk if ulcer bleeding. Even at a&#xD;
      dose as low as 75 mg daily, ASA doubles the risk of ulcer bleeding when compared to the risk&#xD;
      in non-users. This rise in the incidence was associated with a 44% increase in usage of ASA.&#xD;
      In Hong Kong, ASA is also a major cause of peptic ulcer complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of safer aspirins, co-therapy with a gastroprotective drug remains the&#xD;
      dominant preventive strategy. Given the vast number of people taking ASA, however, it is only&#xD;
      cost-effective to identify and treat those who are at high risk of ulcer bleeding and who&#xD;
      have a strong indication for ASA use. Data from observational studies and randomized trials&#xD;
      have consistently shown that PPIs are effective in reducing the risk of ulcer bleeding&#xD;
      associated with ASA. Other potential preventive strategies include eradication of H. pylori&#xD;
      infection, substitution of ASA for other non-aspirin anti-platelet drugs, and co-therapy with&#xD;
      misoprostol or H2RAs. Among these preventive strategies, co-therapy with a PPI for prevention&#xD;
      of ulcer bleeding in high-risk ASA users remains the most studied and best proven strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are relatively weak acid suppressing drugs when compared to&#xD;
      PPIs. Very few studies have evaluated the efficacy of H2RAs in the prevention of peptic ulcer&#xD;
      bleeding with ASA. Two case-control studies yielded conflicting results with regard to the&#xD;
      efficacy of H2RAs in reducing the risk of hospitalizations for ulcer bleeding with ASA. There&#xD;
      is a limited data on the efficacy of H2RAs, however, our local health authority has endorsed&#xD;
      the use of H2RA as a co-therapy in high-risk ASA users since 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, H2RAs have two potential advantages over PPIs. First, generic H2RAs are&#xD;
      much cheaper than generic PPIs in Hong Kong. Second, unlike the interaction between PPIs and&#xD;
      clopidogrel, concomitant use of H2RAs and clopidogrel is not associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Thus, H2RA might be a cheap and safe&#xD;
      gastroprotective drug in patients requiring dual anti-platelet therapy (i.e., ASA and&#xD;
      clopidogrel) who require coronary stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke who develop ASA-induced&#xD;
      bleeding peptic ulcers, whether ASA should be discontinued before ulcers have healed is a&#xD;
      major dilemma. In another double-blind randomized trial, we have shown that discontinuation&#xD;
      of ASA after endoscopic treatment of bleeding ulcers was associated with a significantly&#xD;
      increased in mortality within 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that PPI is superior to H2RA for the prevention&#xD;
      of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ASA users with a history ulcer bleeding&#xD;
