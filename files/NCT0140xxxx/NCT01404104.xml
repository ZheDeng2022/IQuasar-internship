  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temsirolimus is a drug that is being studied to possibly treat kidney cancer. It works by&#xD;
      starving the cancer of nutrients, by cutting off the blood supply, which is hoping to shrink&#xD;
      the cancer. This study will look at the experimental use of temsirolimus, 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
      the surgical removal of the entire kidney or a portion of the kidney that is involved by the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will also find out whether or not there are certain biological factors that show&#xD;
      up in patients during their treatment with this drug. This will be able to predict how their&#xD;
      disease will respond to the therapy (biomarkers), and this will possibly allow anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies to be developed in the future to tailor to a patient's needs.&#xD;
