  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best known measurement of kidney function. Serum&#xD;
      creatinine (blood test) is the most commonly used marker to predict GFR. It is a convenient,&#xD;
      inexpensive test that involves a single blood draw with rapid results. However, creatinine&#xD;
      has several limitations because its blood level is dependent on age, body mass, and sex. One&#xD;
      of the gold standards for measuring GFR is plasma clearance of an IV injected agent, iohexol.&#xD;
      It has been found to be safe and nontoxic in prior studies, but is not practical in the&#xD;
      clinical setting due to the need for several timed blood draws. Recent studies have&#xD;
      investigated the use of cystatin C as an alternative marker to predict GFR. Cystatin C also&#xD;
      involves only a single blood draw, and has less confounding factors than creatinine since it&#xD;
      is independent of age, body mass, and sex. Currently, it remains controversial whether&#xD;
      cystatin C is a significantly better biomarker of estimated GFR than creatinine. To date,&#xD;
      there has not been a large prospective cohort study to compare cystatin C and creatinine in&#xD;
      pediatric kidney transplant patients who are on maintenance immunosuppression (anti-rejection&#xD;
      drugs). Accurate measurement and early detection of deterioration of GFR is critical in the&#xD;
      care of this patient population. The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of&#xD;
      estimating GFR by using cystatin C versus creatinine clearance equations when compared to the&#xD;
      surrogate gold standard of iohexol GFR in pediatric renal transplant patients.&#xD;

      Study patients will come in for their surveillance biopsy done as standard of care&#xD;
      post-transplant. They we be made NPO at midnight prior to the biopsy per routine. On arrival,&#xD;
      they will have standard of care pre-biopsy bloods drawn along with baseline study labs&#xD;
      including serum enzymatic creatinine (1mL of blood), cystatin C (1.5 mL of blood), and 1mL of&#xD;
      blood collected pre-iohexol infusion. Two IV's will be started, one for iohexol&#xD;
      administration and fluids, and the other for blood draws. Study patients will be started on&#xD;
      1x maintenance intravenous fluids. The patient will then have their standard of care protocol&#xD;
      biopsy in the ultrasound suite. After the biopsy 5 mL Iohexol (Omnipaque 300) will be&#xD;
      administered over 1-2 minutes, with epinephrine, solumedrol, and diphenhydramine on hand in&#xD;
      the event of a reaction although this is very unlikely. The patient will be observed and&#xD;
      vital signs will be taken 10 minutes post-infusion. After biopsy, maintenance fluids will be&#xD;
      continued until completion of the study. Blood for determination of Iohexol levels (1mL) will&#xD;
      be drawn at 10, 30, 120, and 300 minutes post iohexol infusion when patient is being observed&#xD;
      post biopsy. At completion of the study at 300 minutes post iohexol infusion, serum&#xD;
      creatinine (1mL of blood), cystatin C (1.5 mL of blood) will be drawn again. The total volume&#xD;
      of blood drawn for the study will be 10mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinine (enzymatic method) will be determined on the Olympus system, and Cystatin C&#xD;
      (Gentian assay) will be determined on the AU400 Olympus System at the UCLA Department of&#xD;
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Outreach Laboratory. Iohexol GFR will be determined at the&#xD;
      University of Rochester Medical Center in Dr. Schwartz's laboratory. Kidney biopsies will be&#xD;
      graded by updated Banff criteria, and reviewed by blinded pathologist.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from UCLA pediatric kidney transplant patients with stable&#xD;
        allograft function that come in for routine surveillance biopsy. Patients will be induced&#xD;
        with either daclizumab, basiliximab, or thymoglobulin and maintained on tacrolimus,&#xD;
        mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid-free or steroid-based immunosuppression.&#xD;
