  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively investigate if intermittent Phosphodiesterase 5&#xD;
      inhibition for 15 weeks improves myocardial perfusion by angiogenesis in patients with&#xD;
      therapy refractory myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery disease judged to be unsuitable&#xD;
      for surgical or percutaneous revascularisation. For proof of efficacy the following tests&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline and one day and 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy:&#xD;
      Exercise tolerance will be evaluated by bicycle exercise testing. Blood tests will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate markers of angiogenesis (endothelial progenitor cells, vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor). The improvement of myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion will be tested functionally as increase of coronary flow reserve by positron&#xD;
      emission tomography. Moreover, changes in ventricular function, symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled monocentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to two groups; PDE5 inhibitor (vardenafil) or placebo taken as&#xD;
      one tablet twice per day for 15 weeks. The analyses will be performed under blinded&#xD;
      conditions by external experts not having any direct contact to the investigators or the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe coronary artery disease who are judged to be unsuitable for surgical&#xD;
      revascularization because of a bad general state of health or unsuitable for percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization because of the bad morphology of coronary arteries by an expert panel of&#xD;
      interventionists and cardiac surgeons are eligible for this study. Eligible patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be invited for participation. At the screening visit (Visit -1)&#xD;
      demographic data, medical history, and concomitant medication are documented, vital signs are&#xD;
      checked, a physical examination, an ECG, and a routine laboratory test is performed. After&#xD;
      giving written informed consent for participation in the study, the patient is randomized to&#xD;
      one of the two study groups - PDE5 inhibitor (vardenafil) or placebo taken as one pill twice&#xD;
      per day for 15 weeks. Within three weeks after this screening visit, baseline efficacy tests&#xD;
      are performed. After the last baseline test the study medication is distributed to the&#xD;
      patient (Visit 0). During the treatment phase follow-up visits are scheduled after week 1, 3,&#xD;
      6, and 12 (Visit 1-4). Between week 13 and 15 the same efficacy tests as performed at&#xD;
      baseline will be repeated. The final visit after the last efficacy test terminates the active&#xD;
      study phase at week 15 (Visit 5). During visit 0 to 5 a clinical examination, an ECG, and&#xD;
      clinical routine laboratory parameters (blood chemistry, blood cell count, and coagulation&#xD;
      parameters) of the patient are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For proof of efficacy the following tests will be performed at baseline and one day and 4&#xD;
      weeks after discontinuation of therapy: Exercise tolerance will be evaluated by bicycle&#xD;
      exercise testing. Blood tests will be performed to evaluate markers of angiogenesis&#xD;
      (endothelial progenitor cells, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor). The improvement of myocardial perfusion will be tested functionally as increase of&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve by positron emission tomography. Moreover, changes in ventricular&#xD;
      function, symptoms and quality of life will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
