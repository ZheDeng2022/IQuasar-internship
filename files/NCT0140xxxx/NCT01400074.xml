      In this study, the efficacy of nilotinib at 400 mg BID will be compared with imatinib at 400&#xD;
      mg BID in suboptimal molecular response patients. To determine study eligibility, suboptimal&#xD;
      molecular response will be defined as patients who have achieved a complete cytogenetic&#xD;
      response (CCyR) but have not achieved a MMR, after at least 18 months of treatment on first&#xD;
      line imatinib therapy at a minimum dose of 400mg daily (Baccarani 2006).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) binds to the inactive conformation of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      suppressing the Ph+ clone in CML (Giles et al, 2005). It is effective in CML and is a major&#xD;
      advance in therapy. With standard dose imatinib, the MMR and complete molecular response&#xD;
      (CMR) rates are 35% to 40% and 6% to 10% respectively at 12 months. These surrogate endpoints&#xD;
      have been associated with high long term survival rates (Kantarjian et al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who had a CCyR and MMR (defined as a reduction in Bcr-Abl transcript levels of&#xD;
      at least 3 log at 12 months following imatinib therapy), the probability of remaining&#xD;
      progression-free was 100 percent at 24 months, compared with 95% for patients achieved a CCyR&#xD;
      but no MMR and 85% for patients who did not achieve a CCyR (P&lt;0.001) (Hughes et al,&#xD;
      2003/Druker et al, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With continued doses of imatinib 400 mg/day, MMR at 24 months is 54% (IRIS SmPC data),&#xD;
      however with high dose imatinib 800 mg/day, MMR may be 70%. Higher doses of imatinib improved&#xD;
      the CCyR rates to 90% both in patients who failed prior IFN-alfa therapy and in those&#xD;
      previously untreated (Cortes et al, 2005). Higher doses are expected to yield higher MMR&#xD;
      rates at 24 months (Cortes et al, ASH 2004 poster). There is also a continued increase in the&#xD;
      cumulative major/complete cytogenetic and molecular response rates with therapy, even after 2&#xD;
      years (Kantarjian 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nilotinib is a novel, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with improved potency compared with&#xD;
      imatinib. In pre-clinical models of imatinib-sensitive CML cell lines, nilotinib was 20-50&#xD;
      times more potent than imatinib, and 3-7 times more potent in imatinib-resistant cell lines.&#xD;
      In a Phase I dose-escalation trial [Study CAMN107A2101], 119 imatinib-resistant Ph+ CML and&#xD;
      ALL patients were treated with single oral doses of nilotinib ranging from 50-1200 mg daily&#xD;
      or 400 mg and 600 mg given twice daily. Nilotinib produced high hematologic and cytogenetic&#xD;
      response rates of 92% and 53%, respectively (CCyR in 35%), in patients with chronic phase&#xD;
      CML, who were resistant to imatinib. Nilotinib was found to have an acceptable tolerability&#xD;
      profile (Kantarjian et al, 2005). Preliminary results from an ongoing Phase II study appear&#xD;
      to confirm the efficacy and safety profile of nilotinib (Kantarjian et al, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achievement of a major molecular response is an important short-term goal in CML therapy as&#xD;
      it appears to predict for long-term event-free survival. This study is designed to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of nilotinib 400 mg twice daily with patients' maximum tolerated doses of&#xD;
      imatinib (optimally 800 mg/day) in producing a major molecular response after 12 months of&#xD;
      treatment in individuals previously not in major molecular remission. It will also examine&#xD;
      the rates of major molecular and complete molecular response in each of the treatment arms,&#xD;
      as achievement of these endpoints may also be of prognostic significance.&#xD;
