  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) or the relevant biological dose (RBD) in the absence if a MTD of a new drug BI&#xD;
      836845 which blocks the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway believed to be involved in&#xD;
      cancer growth. BI 836845 will be administered for the very first time into cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also look at the overall safety of the drug, and examine the drug levels in&#xD;
      the body at specific timepoints during the trial (pharmacokinetic profile); the effect the&#xD;
      drug may have on tumours will also be examined (pharmacodynamics).&#xD;
