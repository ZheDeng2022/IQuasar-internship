    <textblock>
      This study will treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with MRC375 (either 75 mg 3&#xD;
      times a day, 150 mg 3 times a day or placebo 3 times a day)in patients 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older that can be currently on low doses of methotrexate or can stop treatment of current RA&#xD;
      medications to enter the study. Safety of MRC375 will also be evaluated. There are up to 8&#xD;
      clinic visits over 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of MRC375 at 75 mg or 150 mg with matching placebo (taken tid with meal or light&#xD;
      snack) in patients with moderate to severe RA. Patients will be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      following study arms for 24 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 1, Placebo: 2 tablets taken tid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 2, MRC375: 1 tablet of 75 mg tetracycline HCL plus 1 matching placebo tablet&#xD;
           taken tid. Total daily dose = 225 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment 3, MRC375: 2 tablets of 75 mg tetracycline HCL taken tid. Total daily dose =&#xD;
           450 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication should be taken within 30 minutes of a meal or light snack (either before or&#xD;
      after).&#xD;
