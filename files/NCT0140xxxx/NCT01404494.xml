      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Previous studies have shown that computer-based devices that simulate everyday tasks can be&#xD;
      helpful for evaluation and rehabilitation in people who have had strokes. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in studying whether similar devices can be used to evaluate and treat individuals&#xD;
      who have had a traumatic brain injury, to determine if the device should be developed to help&#xD;
      with rehabilitation in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based simulation compared with actual&#xD;
      performance of actions in individuals who have had a traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have had a non-penetrating mild or moderate&#xD;
      traumatic head injury within the past year and have experience playing computer games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical and neurological examination and medical&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires and an interview about mood and feelings,&#xD;
           stress levels, quality of life, and how well they function at work or at home.&#xD;
           Participants will also have tests of memory, attention, thinking, and reasoning. Some of&#xD;
           the questionnaires and tests will be completed in writing, some orally, and some on a&#xD;
           computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have movement and coordination tests that involve simple tasks such as&#xD;
           putting pegs in a pegboard, using a key, lifting different objects, and folding things.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will duplicate the movement and coordination tests by using a computer&#xD;
           program that simulates the tasks with a cursor on a computer screen. Participants will&#xD;
           do four separate simulated tasks (such as arranging letters or hitting a nail with a&#xD;
           hammer) three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The full visit will take about 4 hours, and no followup visits are required.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adults who have suffered traumatic brain injury are people who have a wide variety of signs&#xD;
      and symptoms. These often include problems with motor planning and learning, memory,&#xD;
      cognitive performance and behavior. The physical findings and self reports of symptoms are&#xD;
      heterogeneous, and do not always correlate with anatomic findings. Evaluation and measurement&#xD;
      of function in this population, and treatment of functional deficits are being developed so&#xD;
      that treatments can be specifically targeted toward functional recovery. Additionally,&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment usually relies heavily on labor intensive interventions. This study&#xD;
      will assess the feasibility of using haptic devices that interface the user via touch using&#xD;
      force as feedback in subjects with a TBI. Haptic devices are similar to joysticks. The&#xD;
      specific haptic device we are using in this project is a stylus, shaped like a pen with which&#xD;
      the subject navigates virtual space moving a cursor on a computer screen. The project aims to&#xD;
      obtain pilot data in relation to how an individual with TBI performs measuring their&#xD;
      engagement and interaction with the haptic, which is programmed to simulate functional&#xD;
      activity and cognitive tasks, and whether the haptic devices can reliably be used for data&#xD;
      capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of a non-penetrating TBI will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subjects will need to be at least 1 year from date of initial brain injury. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from NIH, affiliated hospitals/clinics, and in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of a non-penetrating&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury. Subjects will be recruited and assessed at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health. Data will be shared and stored at NIH. Subjects will be stratified according to&#xD;
      findings into cohorts for comparison. Subjects will not be treated with experimental&#xD;
      therapies as part of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of multimodal visuo-sensory motor input learning using haptic devices will be&#xD;
      explored in this project. Virtual reality has been applied to both the evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment of persons with TBI. The application of simulated environments has helped engage&#xD;
      patients in therapeutic activities and also has provided real life situations that call for&#xD;
      integration of sensory, cognitive and motor activities Haptic and robotic devices, which&#xD;
      provide sensory and force input to assist in human movement, have been used to help in&#xD;
      neurorecovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have only one test session and there will be no further follow-up&#xD;
      appointments. The haptic session is designed to take no more than 1 hour. However, it may&#xD;
      take longer for some to complete the battery of tests. It may take up to four hours to&#xD;
      complete the NIH processes such as admissions, the history and physical, and the haptic&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance on haptic tasks will be assessed for time to completion, distance of trajectories&#xD;
      and frequency of repeated trajectories.&#xD;
