      This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      clinical effects of orally administered PWT33597 mesylate in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in&#xD;
      2 phases. The Dose Escalation Phase (up to 36 patients) will determine the MTD of PWT33597&#xD;
      mesylate and evaluate its safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical effects;&#xD;
      the subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase (up to 36 patients) will be a cohort expansion at or&#xD;
      below the MTD of PWT33597 mesylate. Subjects will be treated with once-daily oral doses of&#xD;
      PWT33597 in consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety.&#xD;
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after completion of the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may&#xD;
      continue to receive PWT33597 mesylate at the discretion of the principal investigator for up&#xD;
      to 24 cycles&#xD;

             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the&#xD;
