    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to show that valsartan can be used safely in the setting of acute&#xD;
      stroke to lower elevated blood pressure. There are novel properties of this class of drug (an&#xD;
      angiotensive-receptor blocker or ARB), and promising human and animal data, that would&#xD;
      suggest this drug can be safely used to lower blood pressure in the setting of acute stroke&#xD;
      without compromising brain blood flow (i.e. cerebral perfusion). If this is proved to be the&#xD;
      case, this compound could potentially be used routinely in this setting, with the hope of&#xD;
      improving outcome. This pilot study may pave the way for a larger randomized trial looking at&#xD;
      outcome measures in stroke patients. Further, a positive result in the this pilot study will&#xD;
      serve as proof of concept that ARBs maintain cerebral perfusion while decreasing blood&#xD;
      pressure, an overall favorable property.&#xD;

      Patients who are suffering from a stroke often present to the hospital with elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure. Elevated blood pressure in the setting of stroke increases the risk of brain&#xD;
      swelling or bleeding into the brain. Even so, there has been concern about lowering the blood&#xD;
      pressure with medications because the newly injured parts of the brain may not get the blood&#xD;
      flow they need, thereby worsening the damage from the initial stroke. We hope to demonstrate&#xD;
      that the drug valsartan can be used to safely and modestly lower blood pressure in acute&#xD;
      stroke patients, without having a detrimental effect on brain blood flow or neurologic&#xD;
      status. Novel MRI techniques to measure brain blood flow will be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      clinical scales to demonstrate safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to enroll 20 patients (10 for active drug, 10 for placebo) over an 16 month period.&#xD;
      Patients admitted with the diagnosis of acute stroke and hypertension will be eligible for&#xD;
      the study. All patients will be screened by the attending physician on the Stroke Service.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or a suitable surrogate. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics will be recorded including demographics, drug allergies, date and time of&#xD;
      presumed stroke, prior stroke history, history of hypertension, current blood pressure&#xD;
      regimen, other cardiovascular risk factors, baseline physical exam, National Institute of&#xD;
      Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and baseline modified Rankin score. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated and examined daily by neurologists from the Stroke Service and/or Neurocritical Care&#xD;
      teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sustained mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 110 (~150/90) or greater is needed for inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. Upon admission, as per our usual protocol, antihypertensive medications will be&#xD;
      withheld. In general, we do not administer antihypertensive agents to acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients unless the blood pressure is greater than ~200/110 (MAP 140) or the patient has&#xD;
      signs or symptoms thought to be secondary to elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure will be&#xD;
      taken at least every four hours, as per protocol, either manually or with an automated&#xD;
      device. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be calculated using a standard formula (MAP =&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure). Patients admitted to the ICU may have&#xD;
      arterial lines placed for continuous blood pressure monitoring, if needed as part of their&#xD;
      routine care. Routine blood chemistries, including serum creatinine and liver function tests&#xD;
      will be drawn prior to administering drug or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, the patient will be randomized to receive either valsartan or placebo. The&#xD;
      first dose of study medication will not be administered until after the baseline MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo an initial MRI that includes diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and&#xD;
      perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI). The initial MRI is standard care for stroke patients. After&#xD;
      the initial MRI, patients will be given a 160 mg dose of valsartan or placebo, in a&#xD;
      double-blinded fashion. A sustained MAP reduction of 15-20% will be the goal. If the MAP&#xD;
      remains within 15% of the initial value (prior to the first MRI scan) 24 hours after the&#xD;
      first dose of valsartan (or placebo), the patients will be given a 320 mg dose of valsartan&#xD;
      (or placebo) and will remain on valsartan 320 mg (or placebo) daily until day 7, or hospital&#xD;
      discharge (whichever is sooner). If the MAP is falls by more than 20% after the 160 mg (or&#xD;
      placebo) dose, the patient will be switched to 80 mg of valsartan (or placebo) until day 7,&#xD;
      or hospital discharge (whichever is sooner). If the blood pressure is lowered by 15-20% (the&#xD;
      goal), the patients will remain on valsartan 160 mg (or placebo) daily for the duration of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up MRI with PWI and DWI will be obtained between 48-96 hours of the initial scan.&#xD;
      Additional antihypertensive agents will not be administered until after the follow-up MRI&#xD;
      scan unless deemed medically indicated by the attending physician. If additional agents are&#xD;
      administered, any antihypertensive can be used except for an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Any&#xD;
      additional agents needed for blood pressure control will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will continue taking valsartan vs. placebo throughout the duration of his/her&#xD;
      hospitalization. At the time of discharge, an NIHSS and modified Rankin score will be&#xD;
      recorded. On hospital day 7, or discharge (whichever is sooner), study medication will be&#xD;
      discontinued and blood pressure medication will be at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 30-day follow-up will include assessment of a modified Rankin score and Glasgow Outcome&#xD;
      Score. This 30 day follow-up will be conducted by telephone unless the patient is coming to&#xD;
      the clinic for a routine hospital follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo two brain MRIs during the initial hospitalization, each requiring a&#xD;
      scanning time of approximately 45 minutes. Standard sequences will be obtained, including DWI&#xD;
      and PWI.&#xD;
