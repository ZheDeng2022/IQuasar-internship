      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative care&#xD;
      intervention for evidence based management of alcohol use disorders in primary care settings&#xD;
      within the Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Care System (Seattle and American Lake&#xD;
      Divisions). The study will test whether patients offered the collaborative care intervention&#xD;
      have fewer heavy drinking days at 12 months follow-up and to be abstinent or drinking below&#xD;
      recommended limits without problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention for&#xD;
      evidence-based management of alcohol use disorders in primary care settings. The&#xD;
      investigators will specifically test whether patients offered Collaborative Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have fewer heavy drinking days at 12 months follow-up; and Are more likely to be abstinent or&#xD;
      drinking below recommended limits without problems at 12 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized controlled encouragement trial. Consenting patients who complete&#xD;
      all baseline assessments will be randomized to be offered the Collaborative Care (CC)&#xD;
      intervention or receive Usual Care and will be assessed prospectively. Due to the powerful&#xD;
      effect of alcohol assessments on drinking behavior, a cohort of men identified through&#xD;
      VISTA/CPRS queries as being potentially eligible for the study will be followed&#xD;
      electronically for the following year. A random 25% sample of these men will serve as a &quot;no&#xD;
      contact control group&quot; and will have no contact with the study. The remaining 75% will be&#xD;
      eligible for screening and recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The study will enroll up to 400 subjects (age &lt; 65 years) with probable alcohol&#xD;
      use disorders, in order to randomize 300 subjects who complete all baseline assessments.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria include a recent AUDIT-C screening score ≥ 5, phone number available in&#xD;
      CPRS, and frequent heavy drinking days in the past four weeks (≥ 5 drinks for men, ≥4 drinks&#xD;
      for women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CC intervention will consist of offering subjects: 1) an in-depth baseline assessment, 2)&#xD;
      frequent (weekly first, then monthly) visits with a nurse care manager, 3) alcohol dependence&#xD;
      medications prescribed by a Nurse Practitioner. An interdisciplinary CC team will supervise&#xD;
      nurse care managers weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled participants will have telephone surveys at baseline, 3 months and 12 months;&#xD;
      and lab testing at baseline and 12 months. Main study outcomes include: 1) number of heavy&#xD;
      drinking days in the past four weeks, and 2) abstinence or drinking below recommended limits&#xD;
      at 12 months. Secondary analyses will compare CC and Usual Care groups on process measures of&#xD;
      engagement in alcohol-related care, secondary drinking outcomes, laboratory markers,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, health care utilization, and health care costs. For the&#xD;
      observational cohort, secondary analyses will compare drinking behaviors (AUDIT-C scores),&#xD;
      alcohol-related diagnoses, and health care utilization between men who have no contact with&#xD;
      study procedures and other subgroups who are eligible for screening and recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that subjects in the intervention group will decrease their&#xD;
      frequency of heavy drinking and will be more likely to be abstinent or drinking below&#xD;
      recommended limits at 12 months follow-up.&#xD;
