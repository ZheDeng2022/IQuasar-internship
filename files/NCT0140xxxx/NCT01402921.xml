  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastic MCT is a widely recognized and the consensus-approved treatment for chronic venous&#xD;
      insufficiency (CVI).Efficacy evidence level is often insufficient (grade B or C), or based on&#xD;
      studies carried prior to CEAP classification (2004). Item C3 of this classification relates&#xD;
      to patients suffering from chronic venous disease and permanent oedema. Literature mentions&#xD;
      only one study in which volume reduction in venous-induced oedema was primary endpoint.&#xD;
      Indeed, 240 patients showed a 46.7 ± 8.2 ml reduction (SEM) after 12 weeks with a Class 2&#xD;
      compression sock (15-20 mm Hg at ankle). Volume is an accurate and reproducible quantitative&#xD;
      measure considered nowadays as being gold standard when objectifying oedema variation. It is&#xD;
      therefore particularly relevant in a C3-patient trial (CEAP classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current study is to evaluate the clinical effect of Progressiv' MCT&#xD;
      on volume reduction in permanent CVI-oedema after 3 months of treatment.&#xD;
