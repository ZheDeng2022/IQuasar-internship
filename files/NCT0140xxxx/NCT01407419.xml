      The Treat to Target Trial is a clinical trial available to new and existing CORRONA (Data&#xD;
      Collection Program) sites. Subjects are recruited to participate in this 12 month trial&#xD;
      examining outcomes and feasibility of implementing a Treat to Target approach, when compared&#xD;

      New and existing CORRONA sites and patient participants are recruited to participate as&#xD;
      subjects in this 12 month trial examining outcomes and feasibility of implementing a Treat to&#xD;
      Target approach to RA disease management, requiring routine monthly monitoring and regular&#xD;
      escalations of treatment for subjects not achieving low disease activity (LDA) when compared&#xD;
      with a control group of subjects treated with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether practices implementing a&#xD;
      multi-dimensional T2T process can more effectively control active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)&#xD;
      in patients eligible-for-acceleration compared to those practices which continue usual care.&#xD;
      The trial will also determine if the process of treating to target for the selected subjects&#xD;
      is different between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide variety of therapies are used in clinical practice to treat patients with RA. The&#xD;
      CORRONA Data Collection Program is designed to collect and document utilization patterns,&#xD;
      effectiveness, and safety of DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs), biologic&#xD;
      agents, and many other treatments currently used in the management of rheumatic diseases. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that the study data may help improve the quality of information upon which&#xD;
      clinical decisions are based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Co-primary Objectives 1. To measure rates of low disease activity (by CDAI score)&#xD;
      between treatment arms (T2T vs usual care) at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. To assess implementation of a T2T Protocol by comparing rates of acceleration, frequency&#xD;
      of visits, time to next visit, and probability of acceleration conditional on disease&#xD;
      activity between subjects treated in a T2T intervention group, compared with a control group&#xD;
      treated with usual care (UC) at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine mediators of differences in LDA rates between the two randomized groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the association between the process of treating to target and LDA&#xD;
           (regardless of randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the proportion of subjects with active RA and moderate to high disease&#xD;
           activity by CDAI eligible for acceleration at Baseline that will have achieved low&#xD;
           disease activity (LDA) by CDAI at 6 months in subjects treated in a T2T intervention&#xD;
           group compared with a control group treated with usual care (UC), and to baseline&#xD;
           disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare performance of derived outcome metrics between the T2T intervention and usual&#xD;
           care at 6 and 12 months, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. DAS28 ESR&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patient Reported Outcomes- RAPID 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the frequency of ineligibility for treatment acceleration due to risks,&#xD;
           comorbidities, concomitant medication or clinician judgment in potential T2T study&#xD;
           enrollees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare rates of drug toxicities between the T2T and UC groups over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare rates of Targeted Adverse Events (TAEs) between the T2T intervention and UC&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives To determine the rates and reasons for non-acceleration of subjects&#xD;
      with qualifying CDAIs, enrolled in the T2T and UC arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis disease activity (defined as CDAI score&#xD;
      &gt;10) will be enrolled in the trial at participating sites. Sites will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the Treat to Target or Usual Care arms. Visits will include a Baseline, Month 3, 6,9, and 12&#xD;
      visit for all subjects. In addition, subjects enrolled at sites participating in the Treat to&#xD;
      Target Arm that have not achieved low disease activity (CDAI ≤10) will be expected to return&#xD;
      for Monthly Assessment visits. Treatment acceleration will be expected to occur as frequently&#xD;
      as monthly and at least every 3 months in these subjects, unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment acceleration for the purposes of this trial include the following options:&#xD;
      Initiation or Change in prescribed treatment or dosage of &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;biologic&quot; Disease&#xD;
      Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) or a change in the route of Methotrexate&#xD;
      administration (from oral to subcutaneous)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, physicians and subjects complete Enrollment Questionnaires, including a 28&#xD;
      joint assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted Adverse Event Reporting Qualifying adverse events which occur during participation&#xD;
      in the study and are reported on the Targeted Adverse Event (TAE) Questionnaires. TAE&#xD;
      Questionnaires are completed and submitted when a flagged event on a Physician Follow-up&#xD;
      Questionnaire has been selected. Submission of de-identified source documents (i.e. hospital&#xD;
      records, laboratory results, etc.) in support of the reported TAE is required in order to be&#xD;
      valid, unless otherwise determined by the CORRONA Organization. The TAE should be&#xD;
      simultaneously reported on both the TAE Questionnaire and on the CORRONA Data Collection&#xD;
      Program Physician Follow-up Questionnaire visit date that most closely follows the event&#xD;
      (unless the TAE occurs on the date of the Follow-up Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, sites will be encouraged to forward CORRONA, Inc.de-identified reports on&#xD;
      qualifying Serious Adverse Events within 24 hrs of learning of them using the CORRONA SAE&#xD;
      report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data submitted for inclusion in the Database does not include the names, addresses, telephone&#xD;
      numbers, email addresses, or social security numbers of subjects. Data from Questionnaires&#xD;
      are tracked in the CORRONA Database by a unique CORRONA identifier assigned at the&#xD;
      physician's office. A link is maintained at the physician's office between&#xD;
      patient-identifying information (e.g., name, address, telephone number) and the unique&#xD;
      CORRONA identifier. The physician's office does not share information with CORRONA that is&#xD;
      needed to match subject names with these unique CORRONA identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site Enrollment: Selected rheumatologists are invited to participate as investigators in the&#xD;
      Treat to Target study.Not all rheumatologists who are involved in the CORRONA Data Collection&#xD;
      Program will be involved in this study. Physicians are selected carefully to identify sites&#xD;
      that have appropriate qualifications and infrastructure to support the trial and comply with&#xD;
      applicable regulations and Good Clinical Practices to protect the rights of human subjects.&#xD;
      All potential sites are screened for clinical research experience and GCP (Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice) training. Investigators must obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.&#xD;
      Private physician offices and those not affiliated with an academic institution may submit to&#xD;
      New England IRB (NEIRB). Sites at academic centers submit to their local institutional IRBs&#xD;
      using approved templates and guidelines for submission, or to the NEIRB if this is approved&#xD;
      by their institutional IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained by the investigator and/or&#xD;
      designee(s). Informed consent is obtained in the office setting, and in accordance with FDA&#xD;
      regulations and guidelines prior to commencement of any study-specific related activities.&#xD;
      Patient participation is voluntary, and participants may withdraw their consent at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CORRONA Organization conducts systematic reviews of submitted records. Additionally, all&#xD;
      sites participating in the Treat to Target trial are expected to have at least one on-site&#xD;
      monitoring visit during the course of the trial. This frequency may be adjusted, as needed,&#xD;
      to address data quality issues.&#xD;
