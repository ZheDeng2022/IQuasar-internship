    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that relieving the oxidative stress experienced by hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients may help improve cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that administration of coenzyme Q10, as a&#xD;
      targeted antioxidant therapy, will ameliorate the excessive oxidative stress experienced by&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. This will lead to improvements in biomarkers of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oxidative stress status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inflammatory status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  endothelial dysfunction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are more than 400,000 patients receiving dialysis in the United States, and the&#xD;
      investigators expect that this number will go up. For those on hemodialysis, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) accounts for a large part of the health problems that these patients have.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular problems come from damage to the heart or blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the investigators have no treatments proven to help prevent CVD in those on&#xD;
      dialysis. For the general population, the investigators know about many factors that increase&#xD;
      the risk of CVD, such as having a high level of &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. But for people on&#xD;
      dialysis, the investigators believe that there are other risk factors that are just as&#xD;
      important in the development of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People on dialysis often have high blood levels of waste products. This is called &quot;uremia&quot;.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that uremia can set up chemical reactions in the blood which can&#xD;
      lead to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), an important part of CVD. Compounds&#xD;
      called antioxidants, which stop the chemical reactions, may help prevent CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 is a naturally occurring compound in blood and tissues. It is also a readily&#xD;
      available dietary supplement often used as an alternative to other medicines. It is a strong&#xD;
      antioxidant. The investigators already know that blood levels of coenzyme Q10 are lower in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. Because of this, it is important for us to find out if giving coenzyme&#xD;
      Q10 to hemodialysis patients can help prevent CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, many people take medications called &quot;statins&quot; to help reduce risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The investigators know that statins can lower coenzyme Q10. It is&#xD;
      important for us to know if hemodialysis patients taking statins have lower levels of&#xD;
      coenzyme Q10. It may be that taking coenzyme Q10 could increase the good effects of statin&#xD;
      medication in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not last long enough for us to look at the development of CVD in subjects.&#xD;
      But the investigators will be able to look at biomarkers of oxidative stress, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, and endothelial function. The investigators know that these biomarkers tell us&#xD;
      about uremia and other harmful chemical reactions in the blood. If coenzyme Q10 improves the&#xD;
      biomarkers, then the investigators believe that it will also help prevent CVD in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. Our goal is for improvements in cardiovascular risk for those on hemodialysis.&#xD;
