  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is planned to assess the suitability of a low dose Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#xD;
      inhalation as a challenge model. As LPS effects are based on a different mode of action, this&#xD;
      challenge model will provide the possibility to test a wider spectrum of potential drugs in&#xD;
      the future. Provided that the LPS response is reproducible, it is planned to test whether a&#xD;
      single high dose of inhaled steroid can serve as a positive control in the LPS model. Another&#xD;
      major aim of the study is to test a variety of novel tools for the non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      airway inflammation induced by LPS challenge.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, airway inflammation will be induced by LPS inhalation. In case a neutrophilic&#xD;
      airway inflammation can be safely induced by inhaled LPS, the LPS challenge will be repeated.&#xD;
      If neutrophil airway inflammation after LPS challenge is reproducible LPS challenge will be&#xD;
      repeated after pre-treatment with a single high dose of inhaled fluticasone propionate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine airway inflammation, the subjects' exhaled breath will be analyzed by different&#xD;
      techniques, and blood samples as well as induced sputum will be collected.&#xD;
