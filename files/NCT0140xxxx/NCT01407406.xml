    <textblock>
      Rationale for the Study: Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) data is needed in Chinese and Japanese&#xD;
      populations to support future clinical development of BIIB023 in China and Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a single-dose study to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      BIIB023 administered intravenously (IV) to adult Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The Caucasian group is included to allow comparison of PK data from different&#xD;
      groups using data from the same study under the same controlled conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be in the clinic for 48 hours around the time of dosing and in the study for up&#xD;
      to 100 days.&#xD;
