    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical practice of the prophylactic use of&#xD;
      ethanol locks for the prevention of catheter related blood stream infections in pediatric&#xD;
      intestinal rehabilitation program patients requiring total parenteral nutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter- related blood stream infections are a serious complication for pediatric patients&#xD;
      receiving parenteral nutrition. The leading causes of death in infants with short bowel&#xD;
      syndrome (SBS) who are being treated with parenteral nutrition are central line sepsis and&#xD;
      liver failure associated with the prolonged use of parenteral nutrition. (Cuffari, 2006)&#xD;
      Incidence of infection ranges from 3% to 60% over the life span of each catheter. (Fratino,&#xD;
      2002) Interruption of nutritional support, antibiotic resistance and septic complications&#xD;
      resulting from frequent infections can be life threatening to this fragile patient&#xD;
      population. This patient population is dependent upon maintenance of central venous access&#xD;
      for survival. Frequent hospitalizations, loss of work, and financial complications result in&#xD;
      decreased quality of life for these patients and their caretakers. The cost of hospital&#xD;
      treatment of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) has been estimated to range from&#xD;
      $4000 to $56,000 for each occurrence. (MMWR 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular access sites are also limited in the pediatric population, and removal of central&#xD;
      access for infection may diminish future ability to provide vital parenteral nutrition.(MMWR,&#xD;
      2002) Therefore, improvements in the ability to prevent infection are of utmost importance in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of antibiotic lock technique was developed in the late 1980s and was derived from&#xD;
      various heparin lock protocols. Antibiotic locks have been used for both management and&#xD;
      prevention of infection in vascular access devices. Antimicrobial choices for use in the&#xD;
      antibiotic lock technique are dependent on the different pathogens suspected to infect the&#xD;
      catheter lumen, characteristics of the organisms, and the pharmacodynamic properties of the&#xD;
      antimicrobial agent. There is a risk of selection for multi-drug resistant organisms when&#xD;
      antibiotic locks are utilized. In addition, heparin must be added to an antibiotic lock&#xD;
      solution to maintain catheter patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, ethanol locks have been utilized as a treatment option for children with&#xD;
      CRBSIs. Ethanol is not only bactericidal and fungicidal in nature but also reveals&#xD;
      thrombolytic properties. (Mouw, 2008) The thrombolytic properties eliminate the need for&#xD;
      heparin addition to maintain catheter patency. Although utilized as treatment, ethanol is not&#xD;
      currently being used for CRBSI prevention at our institution. Along with decreasing the risk&#xD;
      of emerging antibiotic resistance, the investigators are attempting to determine if using&#xD;
      ethanol as a lock solution will diminish the number of infections in the Intestinal&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Program population, leading to decreased patient complications and costs. UNMC&#xD;
      has the largest population of Intestinal Rehabilitation Program participants in the country&#xD;
      making this a uniquely well-suited clinic in which to gather data surrounding this emerging&#xD;
      infection-prevention strategy.&#xD;
