      Clozapine has been virtually the only psychopharmacological choice in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia who either did not response to typical neuroleptics or experienced severe&#xD;
      extrapyramidal side effects and consequently did not tolerate this medication. There are&#xD;
      patients who do not respond to clozapine, and the need to treat these severely ill patients&#xD;
      frequently compels clinicians to adopt therapeutic innovations that lack a sound empirical&#xD;
      basis. One strategy is the combination of various other somatic treatments with clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators conduct a preliminary open trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of fluvoxamine coadministration with clozapine in refractory schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
      The combined treatment is well tolerated, and clinical improvement is observed in our&#xD;
      patients. And the concomitant fluvoxamine could attenuate the clozapine-induced weight gain&#xD;
      and metabolic disturbance. However, the effects of fluvoxamine on the safety and therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of clozapine need to be further clarified in double-blind study.&#xD;

      Background Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental illnesses. The prevalence of&#xD;
      schizophrenia has been variously reported as ranging from 1 to 1.5 percent. More than 50% of&#xD;
      patients can be described as having a poor outcome, with repeated hospitalizations,&#xD;
      exacerbations of symptoms, episodes of major mood disorders, and suicide attempts.&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is costly in medical care, treatment and rehabilitation, and reduced or lost&#xD;
      productivity. Therefore, the development of effective treatment for schizophrenic patients is&#xD;
      an important issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classical antipsychotic drugs are the dopamine receptor antagonists, which are effective&#xD;
      in the treatment of schizophrenia, particularly of the positive symptoms. Even with treatment&#xD;
      of typical antipsychotics, about 50% of schizophrenic patients lead severely debilitated&#xD;
      lives. Second, the classical antipsychotic drugs are associated with annoying and serious&#xD;
      adverse effects. Clozapine has been virtually the only psychopharmacological choice in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia who either did not response to typical neuroleptics or&#xD;
      experienced severe extrapyramidal side effects and consequently did not tolerate this&#xD;
      medication. There are patients who do not respond to clozapine, and the need to treat these&#xD;
      severely ill patients frequently compels clinicians to adopt therapeutic innovations that&#xD;
      lack a sound empirical basis. One strategy is the combination of various other somatic&#xD;
      treatments with clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators conduct a preliminary open trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of fluvoxamine coadministration with clozapine in refractory schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
      The mean plasma clozapine levels obtained by clozapine 100 mg/day plus fluvoxamine 50 mg/day&#xD;
      is close to that produced by 300-mg/day clozapine monotherapy in one of our previous studies.&#xD;
      The combined treatment is well tolerated, and clinical improvement is observed in our&#xD;
      patients. And the concomitant fluvoxamine could attenuate the clozapine-induced weight gain&#xD;
      and metabolic disturbance. However, the effects of fluvoxamine on the safety and therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of clozapine need to be further clarified in double-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study is a three-year proposal. Sixty treatment-resistant schizophrenic&#xD;
      inpatients will participate in this project. The subjects will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      parallel groups: clozapine monotherapy and clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment. The&#xD;
      double-blind active treatment will consist of two periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures of clinical efficacy will be the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression, and Nurses'Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation. The measures of&#xD;
      side effects will be the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale and the UKU Side Effect Rating&#xD;
      Scale. Fasting serum samples are collected to determine the lipid profile (total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, HDL, and LDL), glucose level, and insulin level. Plasma levels of clozapine,&#xD;
      norclozapine, and clozapine N-oxide will be determined by high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following results are expected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients, global antipsychotic effect of clozapine&#xD;
           plus fluvoxamine treatment is superior to clozapine monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment has less adverse effects than clozapine&#xD;
           monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effect of clozapine plus fluvoxamine treatment on body weight and metabolic&#xD;
           disturbances is superior to clozapine monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Steady-state plasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites account for a proportion of&#xD;
           variance of clinical effects.&#xD;
