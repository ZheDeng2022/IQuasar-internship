  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety, efficacy, patient comfort and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction of the combined treatment of Refirme ST and Matrix RF both devices approved&#xD;
      under 510k clearances. The evaluations will include skin condition, physician/subject&#xD;
      improvement assessment, and subject comfort and satisfaction score by questionnaires.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Refirme ST and the Matrix RF applicators are both FDA approved devices indicated for&#xD;
      improvement of skin appearance. The Matrix RF applicator has FDA clearance for ablation,&#xD;
      resurfacing of the skin, and for wrinkles treatment, whereas the Refirme-ST applicator has&#xD;
      FDA clearance for non-invasive wrinkles treatment. The combined treatment of Refirme ST and&#xD;
      Matrix RF is intended to improve skin appearance both by enhancement of collagen production&#xD;
      as the result of the Refirme ST primary heating of the treated area and by causing ablation&#xD;
      and resurfacing of the skin with the Matrix RF. In the current clinical setting, each&#xD;
      applicator is used in a separate session although there is no contra-indication preventing&#xD;
      the usage of these applicators in the same treatment session. A combined treatment in one&#xD;
      session is believed to be more efficient and will be more time effective for the patient and&#xD;
      therefore will have a commercial benefit for the manufacturer.&#xD;
