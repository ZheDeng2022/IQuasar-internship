      What is the difference in subscapularis strength between two different methods of&#xD;
      subscapularis mobilization: incision of the tendon (tenotomy) versus peel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the investigators' hypothesis that a peel of the subscapularis will result in greater&#xD;
      strength, a higher healing rate, and a greater improvement in shoulder function and quality&#xD;
      of life following shoulder replacement.&#xD;

      The primary research question is to determine the difference in subscapularis strength&#xD;
      between two different methods of subscapularis mobilization in shoulder arthroplasty:&#xD;
      intra-substance division of the tendon &quot;tenotomy&quot; versus direct detachment of the&#xD;
      subscapularis tendon from its insertion on the lesser tuberosity &quot;the peel&quot;. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is strength as measured by a hand-held dynamometer in the belly-press position at&#xD;
      one-year post operative. Secondary research questions include determination of the difference&#xD;
      in disease specific quality of life between patients who undergo a subscapularis tenotomy&#xD;
      versus subscapularis peel, as measured by the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder&#xD;
      Index (WOOS), Constant score and the ASES score at one year post-operatively. Finally, the&#xD;
      healing rate of the subscapularis, as measured by ultrasound at 1 year post-operative will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

    <description>After the deltopectoral approach is completed, the subscapularis tendon will be tenotomized one centimeter medial to its insertion on the lesser tuberosity. The tendon will be tagged for later repair. Repair will take place with a combination of transosseous sutures (3) placed in a mattress configuration through the area of exposed lesser tuberosity. In addition, a soft tissue tendon to tendon repair will be carried out using figure-8 stitches using #2 (heavy) non-absorbable suture (Ticron).</description>

    <description>The subscapularis will be elevated from the lesser tuberosity. The tendon will be tagged with stay sutures for later reattachment (3 sutures in mattress configuration). Reapproximation will take place with three non-absorbable mattress sutures placed in a trans-osseous fashion through the bicipital groove, exiting the greater tuberosity and tied over a 4-hole mini-fragment plate.</description>
