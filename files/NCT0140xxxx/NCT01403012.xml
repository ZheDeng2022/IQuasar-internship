    <time_frame>week 0 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this study is to analyze metabolic profiles as well as expression data in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis undergoing systemic treatment with TNF_-inhibitor agents (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab) and fumaric acid ester (FAE) in order to identify clinical and metabolomic markers that underlie variability in response to therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of metabolomic signatures associated with psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim is to identify metabolomic signatures associated with psoriasis and to identify possible treatment-specific metabolomic signatures.&#xD;
It is anticipated, to get insights into mechanisms of anti-TNF drug action and response as well as first indications for metabotypes that are associated with psoriasis. In addition, genetic variants correlated to these metabotypes might be identified.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Male and female patients aged 18 - 80 years, body weight ≤ 180 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dermatological diagnosis of psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiated therapy with TNFα-inhibitor agents (etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab)or&#xD;
             fumaric acid ester (FAE) within the scope of routine patient care by treating&#xD;
             physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent from patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of any skin condition that would interfere with the evaluation&#xD;
             of psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic anti-psoriatic drugs such as steroids, retinoids, methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclosporine within 30 days of Visit 1 or used FAE or other any biologic agent such as&#xD;
             etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are considered potentially unreliable or where it is envisaged the&#xD;
             patient may not consistently attend scheduled study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to complete a patient diary or complete questionnaires on&#xD;
             paper&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other condition or prior/current treatment, which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator renders the patient ineligible for the study schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant unless they use effective contraception during the study. Effective&#xD;
             contraception is defined as either: use of established oral, injected or implanted&#xD;
