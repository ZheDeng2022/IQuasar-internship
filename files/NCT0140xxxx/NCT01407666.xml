      This prospective, randomized study is intended to assess the efficacy and safety of bilateral&#xD;
      continuous paravertebral blocks compared to continuous epidural block for open liver&#xD;
      resection. Hypotheses: Bilateral paravertebral blocks are: 1) equally effective in&#xD;
      controlling the perioperative pain; and 2) safe, with less frequent complications following&#xD;
      open liver resection when compared to continuous epidural block.&#xD;

      Background: A number of studies evaluating unilateral continuous paravertebral block&#xD;
      demonstrate equal or superior analgesia when compared to epidural analgesia for postoperative&#xD;
      pain control (1-7). At the same time, these studies show a decreased incidence of side&#xD;
      effects and complications, including: hypotension, pulmonary complications, urinary&#xD;
      retention, nausea and vomiting and failed blocks. Several studies also indicate that&#xD;
      bilateral paravertebral blocks provide adequate postoperative analgesia (8-14). However, no&#xD;
      study has been performed to date that shows a direct comparison between epidural and&#xD;
      bilateral paravertebral blocks in patients undergoing open liver resection.Objectives: This&#xD;
      prospective, randomized study is intended to assess the efficacy and safety of bilateral&#xD;
      continuous paravertebral blocks compared to continuous epidural block for open liver&#xD;
      resection. Hypotheses: Bilateral paravertebral blocks are: 1) equally effective in&#xD;
      controlling the perioperative pain; and 2) safe, with less frequent complications following&#xD;
      open liver resection when compared to continuous epidural block.Methods: A hundred adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective open liver resection will be randomized to receive a continuous&#xD;
      epidural block or continuous bilateral paravertebral blocks for perioperative analgesia. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the degree of pain control measured by visual analog scale at 24&#xD;
      hours post surgery (at rest and while the patient is performing maximum incentive&#xD;
      spirometry). The secondary outcomes will include: 1) Assessment of pain (at rest, with cough,&#xD;
      and with ambulation) using the verbal numerical pain scale will be performed postoperatively&#xD;
      every 8 hours by floor nursing staff until discharge. During the night the patient will not&#xD;
      be awakened for pain assessment. 2) Intravenous opioid requirement: In addition to pain&#xD;
      score, postoperative intravenous opioid requirements [hydromorphone (mg)] will also be&#xD;
      recorded daily; Frequency of side effects and complications; and other functional status&#xD;
      (volume of maximum incentive spirometry, time to extubation, total time for initial&#xD;
      ambulation, the length of the hospital stay, time to return of bowel function, readiness for&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital, and length of hospital stay). At one month post surgery,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, mortality, and any morbidities will be assessed. Each&#xD;
      variable will be compared between the paravertebral group and the epidural group to examine&#xD;
      the hypotheses above. Clinical Implications: Bilateral continuous paravertebral blocks could&#xD;
      be an equally effective and safe alternative to a continuous epidural block for perioperative&#xD;
      pain management in patients who undergo open liver resection.&#xD;
