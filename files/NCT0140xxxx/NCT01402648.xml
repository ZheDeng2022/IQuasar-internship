  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decreased Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) expression in the non adenomatous mucosa of&#xD;
      ApcMin/+ mice favours intestinal neoproliferation. The dietary supplementation with a blend&#xD;
      of ERβ agonists and lignin has been shown to recover ERβ to the healthy wild type levels, and&#xD;
      a reduced polyp number and lower dysplasia was also observed in the adenomatous mucosa. In&#xD;
      this randomised, double blind and placebo controlled study, we assessed if ERβ similarly&#xD;
      guides the apoptotic control of cell proliferation in the non adenomatous colon mucosa of&#xD;
      patients affected from sporadic adenopolyposis, prone to polyp recurrence. For 60 day in&#xD;
      advance of the screening colonoscopy, patients were supplemented with a dietary blend of ERβ&#xD;
      agonists and lignin (Eviendep, CM&amp;D Pharma Limited, London, UK) on top their common diet&#xD;
      (left unchanged during the study period), to study if the pro-proliferative behavior of the&#xD;
      non adenomatous mucosa was effected. Sixty patients naïve from previous and concomitant&#xD;
      hormonal or anti-inflammatory CRC chemoprevention were sequentially 1:1 randomised to active&#xD;
      or placebo supplementation. ERα and ERβ (mRNA, Western Blotting, Elisa, immunostaining),&#xD;
      TUNEL, caspase-3 and Ki-67 (immunostaining) were assessed in bioptic normal colon mucosa&#xD;
      samples. Study power: 80%, type 1 error: .05 (two-tails). Statistics: Non parametric Wilcoxon&#xD;
      test for efficacy. MANOVA for proliferative and apoptotic biomarkers relationships to the&#xD;
      common diet and to the 60 day supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients were actively ongoing the surveillance program for the follow up of polyp&#xD;
      recurrence and progression to CRC. Eligible patients should have undergone a polypectomy&#xD;
      since 2003, affected by multiple polyps &lt; 10 mm or one-two adenomas &lt; 10 mm and/or with a&#xD;
      grade of dysplasia to make them classified at intermediate risk for CRC, and scheduled to&#xD;
      screening colonoscopy each 3-5 years. Patients were sequentially 1:1 randomly allocated to&#xD;
      placebo or Eviendep at baseline (T0). The dietary supplements were administered twice a day&#xD;
      for 60 days in advance of the screening colonoscopy, thus covering approximately eight&#xD;
      complete colon epithelial turnover to occur. Five days in advance of T60 colonoscopy,&#xD;
      patients refrained from fresh and cooked fruit and vegetable intake. Bowel cleansing was&#xD;
      achieved by PEG 4000 oral administration (1120 g/4 L water solution). N=8 biopsy&#xD;
      samples/patient were collected from the non adenomatous mucosa in the sigmoidal colon. Small&#xD;
      polyps (diameter less or equal 0.5 cm) were topically electrocoagulated, whereas villous and&#xD;
      tubulovillous polyps (diameter equal or higher than 0.5 cm) were submitted to the&#xD;
      histological assessment.&#xD;
