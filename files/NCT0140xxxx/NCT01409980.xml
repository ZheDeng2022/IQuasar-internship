    <textblock>
      A triphalangeal thumb is a thumb with three phalanges. The thumb often appears long and&#xD;
      fingerlike, and can sometimes be in the same plane as the other fingers. Anatomically, the&#xD;
      extra phalanx can have different shapes. Several classification systems have been used, but&#xD;
      the simplest and most often used is the Wood (1976) classification by the shape of the extra&#xD;
      phalanx. If the extra phalanx is triangularly shaped it is classified as a type I. Type II&#xD;
      has a rectangular shaped extra phalanx but it has not developed as a full phalanx. Type III&#xD;
      is a full extra phalanx.&#xD;

      A triphalangeal thumb is a thumb with three phalanges. The thumb often appears long and&#xD;
      fingerlike, and can sometimes be in the same plane as the other fingers. Anatomically, the&#xD;
      extra phalanx can have different shapes. Several classification systems have been used, but&#xD;
      the simplest and most often used is the Wood (1976) classification by the shape of the extra&#xD;
      phalanx. If the extra phalanx is triangularly shaped it is classified as a type I. Type II&#xD;
      has a rectangular shaped extra phalanx but it has not developed as a full phalanx. Type III&#xD;
      is a full extra phalanx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different treatment strategies have been developed based on the type of triphalangeal thumb.&#xD;
      This project looks specifically at type I, or a delta phalanx. The goals of surgery in any&#xD;
      type are to reconstruct the anatomic deformity with a stable, functional thumb while&#xD;
      providing an acceptable appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus on how triphalangeal thumbs with a delta phalanx should be treated.&#xD;
      Bunnell and Campbell in the 1940s advocated doing no surgery at all. Milch advocated excising&#xD;
      the abnormal phalanx in the pediatric population but supporting non-operative treatment for&#xD;
      the adult population. A potential unwanted result of excision has been an angulated joint.&#xD;
      Buck-Gramcko proposed that excision of the delta phalanx combined with ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction could give a better result than with excision alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hovius recommended different treatment based on the age of presentation. For patients less&#xD;
      than 6 years, he advocated excision of a transverse oval piece of skin, resection of the&#xD;
      extra phalanx with reconstruction of the radial collateral ligament at the new IP joint, and&#xD;
      lengthening of the ulnar collateral ligament. For patients older than 6 years, he advocates&#xD;
      partial resection of the extra phalanx with correction of the angle and arthrodesis of the&#xD;
      DIP joint. Usually, collateral ligament reconstruction is not necessary in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Horii et al reviewed 13 type I delta triphalangeal thumbs with no associated hand&#xD;
      abnormalities. Surgical treatment for these patients consisted of excision of an accessory&#xD;
      phalanx and the repair of the collateral ligament. The IP joint was temporarily fixed with&#xD;
      Kirschner wires for 4-6 weeks. Mean follow-up was 8.9 years. All patients were satisfied with&#xD;
      the improvement in appearance. The mean IP joint motion was 54 degrees. No patients&#xD;
      complained of instability or pain in the IP joint. Only one patient had ten degrees of&#xD;
      lateral bending. They recommend operating on these patients between ages 1-2 years, when the&#xD;
      phalangeal epiphyses becomes clear. They felt that earlier excision allows for better joint&#xD;
      adaptation. The children also will learn how to use their hands correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it has been debated that it is beneficial to wait to operate on these children until&#xD;
      they are older, and their bones and joints have matured. At that point, an osteotomy could be&#xD;
      performed. Although these results have not been published yet, several well-respected hand&#xD;
      surgeons have concluded that their outcomes have been better on patients who have had delayed&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our institutions, children generally have their thumb reconstructed using a delta phalanx&#xD;
      excision with repair of the ligament around 1 to 2 years.&#xD;
