      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled open label study of teriparatide in men or&#xD;
      women with rheumatoid arthritis and joint erosions. Specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      examine whether teriparatide in combination with a biologic can retard the development of&#xD;
      joint erosions. The study will be conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital Arthritis Center,&#xD;
      several Brigham and Women's Hospital Arthritis Center satellite practices, the University of&#xD;
      Massachusetts Medical Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of teriparatide with biologic will be much&#xD;
      more effective at retarding erosion progression then a biologic alone.&#xD;

      I. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While generalized osteoporosis causes tremendous disability in patients with Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis (RA) and occurs relatively frequently in such patients, there has been little&#xD;
      research on treatments for osteoporosis in patients with RA. Not only are there important&#xD;
      questions about the effects of teriparatide on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in patients with&#xD;
      RA, but little is known about how it might affect localized bone erosions or RA disease&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data in a mouse model of RA suggest that intermittent para-thyroid hormone (PTH) in&#xD;
      the setting of potent immunosuppressives may indeed heal bone erosions. This study showed an&#xD;
      additive effect of PTH in addition to a biologic on erosion healing. To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, this has yet to be demonstrated in humans. That is the primary aim of the proposed&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effects of teriparatide among a group of patients with RA and erosions, all&#xD;
      using biologics, with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Joint erosion volume by 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lumbar BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hip BMD by DXA; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RA disease activity measured by the Disease Activity Score (DAS) and acute phase&#xD;
           reactants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses to be tested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Joint erosion scores, measured by 3D CT scan, will be significantly improved at study&#xD;
           completion in patients taking teriparatide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Teriparatide will significantly increase BMD at all sites as measured by DXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RA disease activity measures will be stable during the study year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total erosion volume will be calculated for each hand/wrist and for each of the six&#xD;
      sub-regions: radius, ulna, proximal carpals [scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform),&#xD;
      distal carpals (capitate, hamate, trapezium, trapezoid, and the carpometacarpal (CMC)&#xD;
      joints), metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. We will&#xD;
      perform the hand level-analysis with the individual hands as our study units. In a pre-trial&#xD;
      study, repositioning reproducibility was excellent at the hand-level (N = 10) as noted in&#xD;
      Duryea et al (REF ). The average total erosion volume in a single hand/wrist was 428.1 mm^3.&#xD;
      Average erosion volume was smallest at the ulna (6.4 mm^3) and largest in the distal carpals&#xD;
      (144.8 mm^3). The intra-class correlation (ICC) values were excellent, ranging from 0.97 to&#xD;
      1.00. The root mean square stand deviation (RMSSD) was 31.2 mm^3 with a coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (CoV) of 7.3%. The CoVs for the six measured hand regions ranged from 7.6% to&#xD;
      21.0%. Individual regions with increased erosion volume tended to have correspondingly larger&#xD;
      RMSSD values, while the dependence of the CoV on the total volume was less pronounced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome for the primary analysis will compare the changes in erosion volume from baseline&#xD;
      to follow-up for the subjects receiving teriparatide versus those not. If we find that the&#xD;
      change in whole hand erosion volume is significantly better for teriparatide users than&#xD;
      controls, then we will have met the primary outcome. In a secondary analysis, we will assess&#xD;
      the change in erosion volume at each of the six anatomic sites. As these are secondary&#xD;
      analyses, no correction for multiple testing will be pursued. Significance at the whole hand&#xD;
      and anatomic site level will be based on a two-tail test of significance with a p-value &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all analyses, we will analyze the data at the level of the hand, adjusting for within&#xD;
      subject correlation between the two hands using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM).&#xD;
      Baseline subject characteristics will be compared between the two groups using two sample t&#xD;
      tests, Chi-square tests or non-parametric tests when applicable. Characteristics of interest&#xD;
      include age, gender, duration of RA, serologic status [rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and&#xD;
      anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive], use of oral corticosteroids, use of&#xD;
      concomitant non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), baseline DAS score,&#xD;
      baseline Total Sharp Score, and baseline health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score. If any&#xD;
      of these characteristics are found to be imbalanced across groups (p-value &lt; 0.10), those&#xD;
      variables will be introduced as possible covariates in the model. However, for this small&#xD;
      study with 48 hands, the final model will include no more than 5 predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several exploratory subgroup analyses will be pursued. These include subgroups of patients&#xD;
      based on/with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corticosteroid users or not at baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than or greater than 2 years of RA at baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In RA remission, defined in three ways: as DAS28 ≤ 2.6, simple disease activity index&#xD;
           (SDAI) ≤ 3.3, and boolean [swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), patient&#xD;
           global and c-reactive protein (CRP) ≤ 1];&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) &lt; 3mg/L versus ≥ 3mg/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than median # of erosions (based on Sharp Score) versus greater than;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than median erosion volume at baseline versus greater than; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depth of erosion: 25% deepest erosions versus other erosions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary analyses will all be considered exploratory and will follow the same analytic&#xD;
      strategy as the primary analyses. Due to small sizes, unadjusted GLMM model will be used in&#xD;
      sub-group analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of secondary outcomes noted above will also be considered exploratory. They will&#xD;
      also follow the same analytic strategy as the primary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If follow up is less than complete, we will estimate the effect under intention-to-treat.&#xD;
      Several missing value techniques will be applied to impute the missing outcomes including&#xD;
      last observation carried forward, single imputation (e.g. replacing missing values with the&#xD;
      sample mean or median), and multiple imputation. Sensitivity analysis will compare these&#xD;
      methods with complete case analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Sample Size Estimates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have used the estimates derived from the pre-trial replication study to estimate sample&#xD;
      size for the trial. We considered analyses both at the level of the subject and at the level&#xD;
      of the individual hand. Assessing individual hands provides twice as many observations (two&#xD;
      hands for each patient), but these observations are not independent of one another. In our&#xD;
      pilot analysis that evaluated 5 patients (10 hands), log-transformation was applied to total&#xD;
      volumes to achieve an approximately normal distribution. The average value of log-transformed&#xD;
      total volume was 5.32, with standard deviation of 1.34. Assuming that a reasonable ICC&#xD;
      between two hands/wrists, on the same patient ranges from 0.20 to 0.50, we estimated the&#xD;
      sample size required to achieve 80% power, given a range of differences with a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.050 using a two-sided test (see Table 2) 17. To detect a moderate difference of&#xD;
      15%-25% between groups, the sample size needed to achieve adequate statistical power would&#xD;
      range from 10 to 34 per study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recruited 12 patients per group (24 hands), assuming an ICC of 0.5.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline in Joint Erosion Volume Measured by 3-Dimensional Computed Tomography (3D CT) Scan</title>
        <description>Both hands were scanned using a CT scanner. A semi-automated software tool was used to segment the erosion margins in 3D. A board certified radiologist identified the individual erosions in six sub-regions: radius, ulna, proximal carpals, distal carpals, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. The average total in a single hand/wrist was calculated. A negative change from Baseline(less joint erosions) indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 Joint Count C-Reactive Protein (DAS-28 CRP)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) for a total possible score of 2 to 10. Higher values indicate higher disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
