  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocenter single-arm, prospective clinical study in 20 type 1 diabetic subjects,&#xD;
      who will be equipped with the GlucoMen速Day system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be investigated for up to 100 hours after implantation of the microdialysis&#xD;
      probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to verify the clinical effectiveness of the GlucoMenDay the subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to perform a total of six self testing measurements per day using the GlucoCard G-Meter&#xD;
      according to the following scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before breakfast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60-120 minutes after lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before dinner&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60-120 minutes after dinner&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at 3 AM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to come to the research facility every day to obtain a venous blood&#xD;
      sample and to check system functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized either to Procedure A - Multiple sampling or Procedure B -&#xD;
      Meal/Insulin test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure A - Multiple sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure can be performed at days 2-4 of the study period. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      standardized lunch (100 g of CHO), administration of insulin will be performed by the subject&#xD;
      based on insulin to carbohydrate ratio. An intravenous catheter will be inserted in one&#xD;
      forearm and venous sampling will start 1 hour after lunch ingestion. Arterialized-venous&#xD;
      blood sampling will be performed every 15 minutes for a period of two hours. Samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed for glucose using the Super GL; concomitantly capillary measurements using the&#xD;
      GlucoCard G Meter will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure B - Meal/Insulin test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure will be performed on days 2 and four of the experiment. Subjects randomized to&#xD;
      procedure B will be asked to undergo this investigation twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a standard breakfast (75g CHO), the usual morning insulin dose will be&#xD;
      post-poned. An increased dose of rapid-acting insulin analogue aiming to produce minor&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia based on insulin to carbohydrate ratio will be injected subcutaneously.&#xD;
      Arterialized-venous sampling will be performed every 10 minutes for a period of two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analyzed for glucose using the Super GL; concomitantly, capillary&#xD;
      measurements using the GlucoCard G Meter will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 5 subjects will return to the clinical trial unit for collection of a final blood&#xD;
      sample and removal of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to come to the research facility at 48 and 72 hours after removal of&#xD;
      the device for an evaluation of local site reactions.&#xD;
