      A research study to evaluate the effect of aging and HIV on neurocognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      (declining ability to process information), physical frailty and heart disease. HIV-infected&#xD;
      participants whose virus is controlled on antiretroviral medications will be studied to&#xD;
      determine the rates and risk factors of developing these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With advances in antiretroviral therapy, the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      continues to improve with older individuals representing a rapidly growing proportion of&#xD;
      those infected. However, despite improved life expectancy, substantial residual morbidity&#xD;
      remains in treated HIV including increased rates of neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. As these conditions also increase with normal aging, HIV is often&#xD;
      thought to be a risk factor for &quot;early&quot; or &quot;accelerated&quot; aging. Prior studies have generally&#xD;
      focused on HIV-specific factors and risk for neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, while few have examined extensively risk factors found to be&#xD;
      significant for these conditions in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the effects of age and HIV will be synergistic on the&#xD;
      rates of non-AIDS morbidity. While the correlates and risk factors for non-AIDS morbidity in&#xD;
      younger individuals may largely be related to HIV, in older individuals with sustained&#xD;
      virologic control, traditional risk factors for neurocognitive disease, frailty, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease will contribute more significantly to disease than HIV-specific risk&#xD;
      factors. Our primary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Define the prevalence and incidence of neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in a well-defined cohort of aging virologically suppressed&#xD;
           HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify correlates and risk factors for prevalent and incident neurocognitive&#xD;
           dysfunction, frailty, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare and contrast the identified correlates and risk factors for the co-morbidities&#xD;
           of interest in older (&gt;50 years old) and younger HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an HIV RNA level below the limit of quantification (e.g., &lt;75&#xD;
             copies, &lt;50 copies, or &lt;48 copies/mL, depending on the assay used) for at least 6&#xD;
             months excluding &quot;blips&quot; (e.g., a single measurement between 48-200 copies/mL preceded&#xD;
             and followed by measurements below the limit of quantification) while on&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Completed treatment for any acute systemic infection (other than HIV-1) less than four&#xD;
             weeks before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any active brain infection (except for HIV-1), brain neoplasm, or space-occupying&#xD;
             brain lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of immunomodulating medication (e.g., corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, etc.)&#xD;
             within four weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any active psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, severe depression, or severe&#xD;
             bipolar affective disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound&#xD;
             the analysis of the neuropsychological test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active drug or alcohol abuse that, in the investigator's opinion, could prevent&#xD;
             compliance with study procedures or confound the analysis of study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
