      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Studies have shown that listening to music can decrease pain and anxiety. Following&#xD;
      surgery, patients in intensive care units (ICUs) often need drugs to treat their pain and&#xD;
      anxiety. But these drugs can cause side effects such as low blood pressure and confusion. If&#xD;
      listening to music can help lower pain and anxiety levels, less medication might be needed&#xD;
      and these side effects could be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the effects of music on patient pain and anxiety in the first few days after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have surgery that requires a&#xD;
      24-48-hour stay in intensive care afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a medical history before having surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups: one group will listen to music after&#xD;
           surgery, and the other will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before surgery, participants will answer questions about their pain and anxiety levels.&#xD;
           They will also be shown how to control the device that lets them administer their own&#xD;
           pain medication after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following surgery, all participants will be transferred to the ICU and will answer the&#xD;
           same questions about pain and anxiety levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The music group will listen to a specially created CD of instrumental music for about 50&#xD;
           minutes, four times a day. The standard group will not listen to this music. All other&#xD;
           treatments will be the same in both groups. Both groups will continue to answer the same&#xD;
           questions about pain and anxiety levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a final 15- to 20-minute interview after leaving the ICU. They&#xD;
           will answer questions about the ICU stay and (for those in the music listening group)&#xD;
           the music.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Listening to music is a common human activity. Music listening has been associated with&#xD;
           decreased pain scores, increase in attentiveness and decrease in anxiety scores.&#xD;
           Recently, with interest in holistic and complementary and alternative therapies, there&#xD;
           has been increased awareness of the potential positive health effects of music&#xD;
           listening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inadequate pain management remains common especially in postoperative patients. Acute&#xD;
           perioperative pain affects over 46 million Americans every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As music is processed by the limbic system, enkephalins and endorphins are released.&#xD;
           These substances are natural occurring opioids, suggesting music may decrease patient s&#xD;
           requirements for opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of music listening on the amount of opioids delivered&#xD;
      postoperatively to adult ICU patients via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) during the first&#xD;
      48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of music listening on pain and anxiety scores experienced by adult&#xD;
      surgical patients during the first 48 hours postoperatively in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -All adult patients (18 years of age or greater) who are scheduled for surgery that have an&#xD;
      anticipated ICU stay of 24-48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a two-group randomized controlled trial. The two groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment -Music group - intervention music delivered for approximately 50 minutes 4&#xD;
           times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control - Standard care&#xD;
