  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are going to use a special type of bronchoscopy test to examine patients who have had&#xD;
      previous surgical treatment for lung cancer or head and neck cancer. The aim is to determine&#xD;
      a) whether we can identify precancerous changes in their airways b) whether this type of&#xD;
      testing is acceptable and c) get an initial idea of whether a new drug called gefitinib has&#xD;
      any effect on precancerous areas in the airway.&#xD;
