  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) has been accepted as an effective treatment&#xD;
      for symptomatic patients with moderate or severe mitral stenosis (MS), most asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients are not candidates for PMC owing to the small but inherent procedure-related risks.&#xD;
      Asymptomatic patients with MS show good survival rates up to 10 years, but there was a sudden&#xD;
      deterioration precipitated by atrial fibrillation or embolism in half of the patients.&#xD;
      Because the success rates of PMC were improved to more than 95% in ideal patients from highly&#xD;
      selected centers and early PMC may decrease the occurrence of adverse events, such as atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or embolism, experienced centers tend to perform PMC at an early stage of&#xD;
      disease. However, the potential benefits of early preemptive PMC in asymptomatic patients&#xD;
      should be balanced against the real risks related to the procedure, and further studies of&#xD;
      the efficacy of PMC in the prevention of embolism are necessary to extend its indications to&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients. To the best of our knowledge, No randomized trials have been performed&#xD;
      to ascertain the optimal timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with significant MS.&#xD;
      The early percutaneous MITral Intervention versus conventional manaGement in Asymptomatic&#xD;
      moderate miTral stEnosis (MITIGATE) trial was designed to compare clinical outcomes of early&#xD;
      intervention with those of a conventional management based on current guidelines in&#xD;
      asymptomatic moderate mitral stenosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We enroll consecutive asymptomatic patients with moderate mitral stenosis who are candidates&#xD;
      for both early percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) and conventional treatment at 3&#xD;
      centers in Seoul, Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic evaluation is performed before enrollment, immediately after PMC and&#xD;
      annually during follow-up. All patients undergo two-dimensional echocardiography and/or&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography to detect left atrial thrombi. Morphologic features of the&#xD;
      mitral valve (MV) are categorized as described previously (14), and total echocardiographic&#xD;
      score is obtained by adding the scores for leaflet mobility, thickness, calcification, and&#xD;
      subvalvular lesions. The MVA is measured by direct planimetry of the mitral orifice, and MS&#xD;
      severity is graded as mild, moderate, or severe when MVA was &gt; 1.5, 1.0 to 1.5, or &lt; 1.0 cm2,&#xD;
      respectively. The severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is assessed&#xD;
      semiquantitatively or using quantitative methods and classified as mild, moderate, or severe.&#xD;
      Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAP) is estimated by continuous wave Doppler with the&#xD;
      simplified Bernoulli equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients regularly visit their attending physicians at 3 monthly interval for&#xD;
      maintenance of anticoagulation therapy or every year for annual re-evaluation. Patients in&#xD;
      the conventional treatment group who become symptomatic during follow-up are referred for PMC&#xD;
      or mitral valve surgery. An embolic event is defined as a systemic embolism fulfilling both&#xD;
      prespecified criteria: acute onset of clinical symptoms or signs of embolism and occurrence&#xD;
      of new lesions confirmed by imaging studies. A specific diagnosis of cerebral infarction is&#xD;
      confirmed by an experienced neurologist and additional brain magnetic resonance imaging is&#xD;
      performed if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that a sample size of 166 patients would provide 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      significant difference with respect to the primary end point at the 2-sided significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05, assuming 3-year event rates of 13% in the conventional treatment group and 2%&#xD;
      in the early PMC group, and drop-out rate of 5%. These rates are based on the results of our&#xD;
      previous study. Analyses are performed on an intention-to-treat basis. To analyze primary&#xD;
      outcome, estimates of cumulative event rates are calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and&#xD;
      compared employing the log-rank test. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, we analyze all clinical&#xD;
      events by time to first event. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals are derived with&#xD;
      the use of the Cox proportional hazards model.&#xD;
