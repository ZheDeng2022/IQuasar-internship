  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there have been remarkable advances in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (MRCRC), long term survival cannot be expected in most patients with MRCRC&#xD;
      because of inevitably developing resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs except some MRCRC&#xD;
      patients who can undergo complete resection (metastasectomy). Until now, approved cytotoxic&#xD;
      drugs for treatment of MCRC are only 3 categories (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      irinotecan). Recently, molecularly targeted drugs are approved for MRCRC patients, and&#xD;
      bevacizumab and cetuximab (for K-ras wild type tumors) are available. When cytotoxic and&#xD;
      targeted drugs are appropriately combined, about 24 months of overall survival (OS) can be&#xD;
      expected in patients with MRCRC. However, when these drugs are all used or patients cannot&#xD;
      afford to receive expensive targeted drugs because of economical problems, there is no option&#xD;
      for chemotherapy and best supportive care is the only option, although some patients still&#xD;
      have good performance status and medical conditions. Therefore, there are unmet needs for&#xD;
      additional salvage chemotherapy regimens for patients with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-refractory MRCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some previous studies, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy showed some antitumor activities in&#xD;
      MRCRC patients. Especially, when combined with fluoropyrimidine, gemcitabine has been shown&#xD;
      to exert synergic effects on antitumor activities. On these backgrounds, this phase 2&#xD;
      clinical study was designed. In this study, efficacy and safety of gemcitabine plus UFTE&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be evaluated in MRCRC patients.&#xD;
