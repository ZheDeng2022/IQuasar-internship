    <textblock>
      Stem cells can be transplanted from a healthy donor to a patient to combat blood cancers and&#xD;
      other disorders. This process is called stem cell transplantation. Stem cells normally live&#xD;
      in the bone marrow. A bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is when the bone marrow is directly&#xD;
      transplanted into a patient. However, stem cells can also be stimulated to move from the bone&#xD;
      marrow to the blood where they can be collected, a process is called mobilization. When these&#xD;
      stem cells are transplanted it is called peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT).&#xD;
      Both stem cell sources are used for different reasons, but PBSCT is much more common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable debate as to which stem cell source, BMT or PBSCT, is optimal. There&#xD;
      are differences between the two sources in important transplant outcomes. The stem cell&#xD;
      product that is transplanted, also called the stem cell graft, contains more than just stem&#xD;
      cells. Results from studies suggest that the variation in the cells with grafts may account&#xD;
      for the variation in outcomes. Preliminary data from a recent study conducted by the Canadian&#xD;
      Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Group has associated relative frequencies of particular cell&#xD;
      populations with leukemic relapse and another important outcome called graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD). While the later essentially equates to a failed transplant, the former is the&#xD;
      most common and devastating complication of stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only drug used to mobilize stem cells into the blood of health donors for collection is&#xD;
      G-CSF. However there is a new mobilization drug recently approved called plerixafor. This&#xD;
      drug is able to mobilize stem cells when G-CSF has failed and pre-clinical studies suggest&#xD;
      that it may produce a superior stem cell graft to G-CSF alone. There is little information&#xD;
      available, besides safety and efficacy data, about the effects that plerixafor has on the&#xD;
      stem cell graft of normal healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the stem cell graft in normal healthy donors following plerixafor&#xD;
      mobilization versus plerixafor and G-CSF mobilization. Specifically, they will look at the&#xD;
      cell populations that have been previously correlated with important transplantation outcomes&#xD;
      like relapse and GVHD. The investigators suspect that the stem cell graft mobilized by&#xD;
      plerixafor and G-CSF will provide a superior graft to that mobilized by plerixafor alone.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplantation (SCT) involves transfusing stem cells collected from 3 potential&#xD;
      sources: bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord. There are 2 major types of&#xD;
      transplantation. Autologous SCT involves transplanting the patients own stem cells, while&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation involves transplanting stem cells from someone else. Whatever the&#xD;
      source, the transplanted stem cell product is called the graft. Currently, the most common&#xD;
      source is peripheral blood, However, there is considerably debate as to the optimal stem cell&#xD;
      source because different sources have been associated with different transplant outcomes. One&#xD;
      key outcome is graft versus host disease (GVHD). This is the most common complication of SCT&#xD;
      and contributes significantly to transplant morbidity and mortality, as well as relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells normally populate the bone marrow. Drugs are used to encourage stem cells to go&#xD;
      into the peripheral blood, a process call mobilization. In the peripheral blood stem cells&#xD;
      can be collected and subsequently transplanted. In Canada, the only drug used to mobilize&#xD;
      stem cells from donors is filgrastim, a form of granulocyte colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (G-CSF). Although well tolerated, there are some shortcomings to this agent and there is&#xD;
      clearly room to improve in terms of the donor experience and providing the optimal stem cell&#xD;
      graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A soon to be completed study conducted by the Canadian Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Group&#xD;
      (CBMTG), called CBMTG 0601, is evaluating the best stem cell source. The study is aimed to&#xD;
      compare the outcomes between allogeneic transplant patients who receive either G-CSF&#xD;
      stimulated bone marrow or peripheral blood. This will be a seminal study that should provide&#xD;
      valuable information as to the optimal stem cell source in allogeneic SCT. Early results&#xD;
      suggest that the investigators may be able to predict important SCT outcomes, such as&#xD;
      transplant related mortality, relapse or graft versus host disease, by looking at cell&#xD;
      populations in the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plerixafor is a new mobilization agent that is approved for use in combination with neupogen&#xD;
      in myeloma and relapsed lymphoma who are undergoing an autologous SCT. Following numerous&#xD;
      publications on the safety and dosing of plerixafor, there were 2 pivotal high quality&#xD;
      studies performed in this patient population. The results of this study lead to FDA approval,&#xD;
      and Health Canada approval is close. Plerixafor may be a clinically superior mobilizing agent&#xD;
      to Neupogen. More importantly though, it has a formidable safety profile and arguably&#xD;
      superior in this respect. There has also been a case report and a trial demonstrating both&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of plerixafor in healthy donors as well. Finally, preclinical work&#xD;
      suggests that plerixafor mobilization may yield a superior graft. Taken together, this work&#xD;
      supports the notion that plerixafor may be a superior mobilization agent over neupogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the shortcomings of neupogen and the demonstrated potential of plerixafor in&#xD;
      trials with autologous SCT patients, it would be logical to further investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of plerixafor in normal healthy donors for allogeneic SCT. The investigators can confidently&#xD;
      state that plerixafor is safe. Furthermore, plerixafor can mobilize myeloma and lymphoma&#xD;
      patients who have failed neupogen mobilization. However, although suggested in preclinical&#xD;
      data, there is no firm evidence to suggest that plerixafor mobilization provides a superior&#xD;
      stem cell graft. The investigators will administer either plerixafor or plerixafor and&#xD;
      neupogen then compare the cell populations in both peripheral blood and bone marrow..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of SCT has steadily increased in the last 20 years. This has especially increased&#xD;
      since using neupogen to mobilize stem cells thereby making transplants easier. Now that there&#xD;
      is a new agent available that is likely safer and perhaps more efficacious, its use may&#xD;
      improve both donor experience and patient outcomes. If plerixafor grafts consist of cell&#xD;
      populations that are associated with superior transplant outcomes as determined in CBMTG&#xD;
      0601, then it will likely be used in an upcoming larger clinical trial comparing neupogen and&#xD;
      plerixafor in normal healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to determine the best timing for harvesting stem cells from normal&#xD;
      donors given plerixafor with or without neupogen. A secondary objective is to evaluate and&#xD;
      compare the change over time after plerixafor with or without neupogen administration on the&#xD;
      population of cells in the graft predicted to give superior transplant outcomes. The other&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate and compare the change over time after plerixafor with or&#xD;
      without neupogen administration on the concentration of cells in the PB and BM of normal&#xD;
      donors predicted to give GVHD or relapse. The investigators hypothesise that plerixafor with&#xD;
      neupogen will provide a graft with increased cell populations associated with superior SCT&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
