    <description>40 mg LY2940094 was administered orally, one time only (it was originally expected that 100 mg LY2940094 would be administered).&#xD;
If the receptor occupancy (RO) for a given dose is lower than 50%, (time to maximum concentration [tmax] or an optimal time window) then a higher dose will be administered to the next cohort whereas if the RO for a given dose is higher than 50%, then a lower dose will be administered to the next cohorts.</description>

    <description>The dose levels for subjects in Cohort 2 will be defined based on the results of the receptor occupancy (RO) data of previous cohort and the ongoing review of safety data. This dose was determined to be 10 mg, and was administered orally, one time only.&#xD;
If the RO for a given dose is lower than 50%, (tmax or an optimal time window) then a higher dose will be administered to the next cohort whereas if the RO for a given dose is higher than 50%, then a lower dose will be administered to the next cohorts.</description>

If the RO for a given dose is lower than 50%, (tmax or an optimal time window) then a higher dose will be administered to the next cohort whereas if the RO for a given dose is higher than 50%, then a lower dose will be administered to the next cohorts.</description>
