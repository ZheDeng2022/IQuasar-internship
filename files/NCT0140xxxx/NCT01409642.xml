    <textblock>
      Pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic, impairing condition that accrues&#xD;
      significant concurrent and long-term risk to affected youth (Piacentini et al. 2003; Pine et&#xD;
      al. 1998). Although a host of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments have proliferated&#xD;
      over the past decade (Barrett et al., 2008), many youth fail torespond to treatment and many&#xD;
      who do respond continue to exhibit lingering symptoms and impairment. Thus, there is still&#xD;
      much to be done by way of optimizing treatment outcomes for pediatric OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly, efforts to improve existing treatments have focused on aspects of the family&#xD;
      environment that may affect treatment adherence and the maintenance of therapeutic gains.&#xD;
      Such work suggests that parental accommodation and criticism are common characteristics of&#xD;
      the home environment for both adults and children with OCD (Calvocoressi et al., 1999; Peris,&#xD;
      Roblek, Langley, Chang, McCracken, &amp; Piacentini, 2008; Van Noppen et al., 1991) and that, in&#xD;
      adult samples, these family features are associated with poorer treatment outcome and greater&#xD;
      risk of relapse (Amir, Freshman, &amp; Foa, 2000; Chambless &amp; Steketee, 1999;Leonard et al.,&#xD;
      1993). These family-level variables are logical targets for intervention, particularly among&#xD;
      treatment refractory groups of youth with OCD. However, they often are unaddressed in extant&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study tests a novel intervention that specifically targets family accommodation&#xD;
      and conflict in an effort to foster an environment that supports a graded exposure approach&#xD;
      to treatment. The proposed treatment, Positive Family Interaction Therapy (PFIT), is composed&#xD;
      of an innovative blend of techniques that address several potential barriers to treatment.&#xD;
      First, the treatment is guided by the specific needs of youth with OCD and their families&#xD;
      (e.g., accommodation, conflict). The first phase of the proposed study will involve an open&#xD;
      case series in order to assess the utility of the PFIT protocol and feasibility of training&#xD;
      other therapists and using the manual with a range of patient presentations. The second phase&#xD;
      will involve a small controlled feasibility trial evaluating the extent to which recruitment,&#xD;
      randomization, and implementation of the control condition are viable for further study. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that the PFIT treatment will be feasible to implement and will yield higher&#xD;
      levels of patient satisfaction compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is among the most common disorders of&#xD;
      childhood, affecting between 1 and 3% of the youth population. The disorder is associated&#xD;
      with substantial impairment in academic, social, and family functioning, and it carries a&#xD;
      host of risks as youth age into adulthood. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged as&#xD;
      the treatment of choice for pediatric OCD, with typical treatment protocols involving&#xD;
      exposure to feared stimuli, identification and evaluation of maladaptive beliefs, relaxation&#xD;
      training, and behavioral rewards. Although these techniques have produced favorable results,&#xD;
      one third of youth with OCD do not demonstrate significant response to treatment and many of&#xD;
      those who do respond continue to evidence some degree of symptoms and impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to improve therapy outcomes for youth with OCD increasingly have attempted to augment&#xD;
      individual CBT with greater family involvement. These programs typically involve&#xD;
      psychoeducation about OCD as well as general behavioral strategies for enhancing adherence to&#xD;
      treatment. Although current family-focused treatments vary with regard to the nature and&#xD;
      extent of parent involvement, to date, the incremental benefit of adding a family treatment&#xD;
      component to traditional individual treatment remains unclear. Indeed, there does not appear&#xD;
      to be a relation between the degree of family involvement and degree of treatment response,&#xD;
      and current family treatments do not appear to affect change in family beliefs or behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This picture suggests that either family involvement does not contribute to significant&#xD;
      improvement in child outcomes or that current treatments may not be sufficiently focused on&#xD;
      features of the home environment that are relevant for shaping and maintaining OCD symptoms.&#xD;
      Building from theoretical literature which identifies familial blame and accommodation as key&#xD;
      characteristics that are important for course and outcome in OCD, we have developed a novel&#xD;
      family intervention for use in treating pediatric OCD. Using techniques that are well&#xD;
      established, Positive-Family Interaction Therapy (P-FIT) attempts to reduce family blame,&#xD;
      accommodation, and conflict and to enhance family cohesion in high stress, high conflict&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to investigate a manualized P-FIT program for youth with OCD&#xD;
      first with a small open trial of up to ten families to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      tolerability of the treatment and then with a randomized trial (the main study) to assess its&#xD;
      incremental efficacy over usual care (i.e., individual cognitive behavioral therapy). For the&#xD;
      initial pilot stage, up to four children between the ages of 9-17 will be treated with P-FIT&#xD;
      through the UCLA Child OCD, Anxiety, and Tic Disorders Program after completing a diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation to confirm eligibility. During this pilot study, procedures and materials for the&#xD;
      manual will be refined and finalized for the controlled trial. The treatment will consist of&#xD;
      12 sessions of standard cognitive behavioral therapy that is augmented with a novel 6-session&#xD;
      family focused treatment module. Assessments involving interviews, questionnaires, and&#xD;
      several short tasks will be conducted at the beginning, midpoint and end of the treatment. We&#xD;
      will also follow up with families 3 months following treatment in order to assess durability&#xD;
      of any treatment gains. Study staff will meet weekly to discuss each open trial therapy&#xD;
      session, including the feasibility, efficacy, and acceptability of the treatment manual, and&#xD;
      make adjustments as needed. Once this group reaches consensus regarding the suitability of&#xD;
      the manual, recruitment into the open trial will end and subsequent eligible families will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial (the main study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the main study, 40 youngsters will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      individual child-centered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) or the P-FIT intervention (ICBT&#xD;
      + 6 sessions of family treatment). All subjects regardless of response status will be&#xD;
      evaluated at all scheduled assessment points. In addition to comprehensive parent, child, and&#xD;
      clinician reports, the primary outcome variables will be assessed by blind independent&#xD;
      evaluators. Manualized intervention and assessment protocols plus state-of-the art quality&#xD;
      assurance (i.e., weekly supervision with an expert clinician specializing specifically in OCD&#xD;
      treatment) and adverse event monitoring procedures will insure participant safety. Results&#xD;
      from this investigation will be used to support a larger controlled comparative trial&#xD;
      comparing the degree to which P-FIT improves outcomes for youth with OCD above and beyond&#xD;
      current available treatments.&#xD;

          -  Child has failed a previous trial of CBT for anxiety within the previous 2 years&#xD;
             judged adequate by at least 10 treatment sessions over a period of less than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child has a major neurological disorder or a major medical illness that would&#xD;
             interfere with participation in the study (e.g., frequent hospitalizations, frequent&#xD;

             psychiatric disturbance of sufficient severity to contraindicate study participation&#xD;
             and/or (b) insufficient command of the English language. Parent psychiatric status&#xD;
             will be screened using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). This process will include&#xD;
