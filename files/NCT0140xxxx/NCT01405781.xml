      The objective of this study is twofold: First, to determine whether higher levels of&#xD;
      pre-operative psychological distress predict worse outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair; second, to obtain functional outcomes (VAS pain, VAS satisfaction, VAS function,&#xD;
      Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Score), physically&#xD;
      examine and perform a radiographic analysis of patients at a minimum of 6 months after&#xD;
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, arthroscopic&#xD;
      scapulothoracic bursectomy, acromioclavicular joint reconstruction and arthroscopic rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair.&#xD;

      Clinical outcome studies have been performed in the evaluation of a variety of shoulder&#xD;
      pathologies after surgical treatment. Among these disease processes include glenohumeral&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, rotator cuff arthropathy, acromioclavicular separations and scapulothoracic&#xD;
      bursitis. A variety of outcomes studies have been performed on these pathologies although few&#xD;
      have utilized several functional outcome measures. Also with respect to each of these&#xD;
      diagnoses, several specific areas of research regarding outcomes assessment have not been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is one of the most common shoulder pathologies treated by&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons. For endstage osteoarthritis, an anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty&#xD;
      provides excellent pain relief and functional improvement. In order to perform the&#xD;
      replacement, the rotator cuff tendon in the front of the shoulder (subscapularis) needs to be&#xD;
      taken down and then repaired at the completion of the case. There are three basic methods of&#xD;
      takedown and repair: tenotomy, peel-off and lesser tuberosity osteotomy. The osteotomy has&#xD;
      been compared clinically to tenotomy and found to provide a lower rate of subscapularis&#xD;
      tears, higher outcome scores and universal healing evaluated using ultrasound and the PENN&#xD;
      shoulder score.1 Gerber et al has also evaluated long-term outcomes of total shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty with lesser osteotomy using the Constant score as a measure of outcomes.2&#xD;
      Unfortunately, many outcome studies evaluating total shoulder arthroplasty utilize the Simple&#xD;
      Shoulder Test and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Score which have not been&#xD;
      evaluated. Also, osteotomy was performed only utilizing a &quot;fleck&quot; of bone instead of the&#xD;
      entire lesser tuberosity. No studies to date have evaluated TSA with an osteotomy of the&#xD;
      entire lesser tuberosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty has shown be a predictable operation for the treatment of&#xD;
      rotator cuff arthropathy with clinical improvements in both pain and function at long term.&#xD;
      3,4 Dislocation has been reported between 0% to 9% after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty&#xD;
      and has been defined as one of the top three most common complications associated with&#xD;
      reverse TSA.3-10 There is considerable debate regarding whether the subscapularis tendon&#xD;
      needs repair after reverse TSA. Edwards et al reported a statistically significant reduction&#xD;
      in dislocation rates from 9% to 0% with addition of subscapularis repair.10 These results had&#xD;
      significant bias with regards to randomization of patients. Similarly, all patients in the&#xD;
      non-repair group were at the initial portion of his learning curve. Consequently, the risk&#xD;
      for instability is likely lower than reported in his series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acromioclavicular joint separations represent one of the most common shoulder injuries&#xD;
      accounting for approximately 9% of shoulder girdle injuries.11 Acromioclavicular injuries&#xD;
      have been classified with increasing severity from I to VI based upon disruption of the&#xD;
      various ligamentous and muscular supports including the acromioclavicular ligaments,&#xD;
      coracoclavicular ligaments and deltotrapezial fascia.12 Recommended initial treatment for&#xD;
      grade I to III injuries has been nonoperative with reasonable clinical results while initial&#xD;
      surgical stabilization has been recommended for higher grade injuries.12-15&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of surgical stabilization techniques for acromioclavicular joint separations have&#xD;
      been reported including the transfer of the coracoacromial ligament from the acromion to the&#xD;
      end of the resected distal clavicle originally described by Weaver and Dunn in 1972.16 A&#xD;
      modification of the Weaver-Dunn acromioclavicular reconstruction was subsequently described&#xD;
      which included coracoclavicular stabilization with nonabsorbable suture.17 Despite this&#xD;
      modification, residual subluxation or dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint has been&#xD;
      identified in up to 29% of patients.17 Consequently, alternative constructs have been&#xD;
      described including an anatomic reconstruction utilizing a tendon graft which has been shown&#xD;
      to have superior biomechanical strength compared to a Weaver-Dunn reconstruction.18&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the surgical transition from the modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction as described&#xD;
      by Weinstein et al. to a reconstruction using a tendon graft, augmentation of the&#xD;
      coracoclavicular suture fixation with either allograft or autograft tendon as well as&#xD;
      performing the coracoacromial ligament transfer has been described.17,19 This differs from&#xD;
      the anatomic reconstruction described by Mazzocca et al., as it includes both the transferred&#xD;
      coracoacromial ligament and the hamstring graft for stabilization instead of just the&#xD;
      graft.11 Coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with a tendon graft has been reported as a&#xD;
      treatment option for failed Weaver-Dunn reconstructions.20,21 Possible benefits of the&#xD;
      combined reconstruction include improved construct strength and a vascularized ligament.&#xD;
      Drawbacks include increased surgical dissection, increased operating room time and disruption&#xD;
      of the coracoacromial arch. With the advances in arthroscopic techniques, acromioclavicular&#xD;
      reconstructions utilizing a tendon graft are now being performed arthroscopically which has&#xD;
      been described without the addition of coracoacromial ligament transfer.22 Reconstructions&#xD;
      without coracoacromial ligament transfers may increase the ease of performing a&#xD;
      reconstruction through smaller incisions with arthroscopic assistance. No study has evaluated&#xD;
      the clinical effects of adding a coracoacromial ligament transfer to an acromioclavicular&#xD;
      joint reconstruction utilizing a coracoclavicular tendon graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scapulothoracic bursitis or &quot;snapping scapula syndrome&quot; is an under-recognized shoulder&#xD;
      disorder where the bursal sac between the scapula and chest wall becomes irritated and&#xD;
      inflamed. The etiology is overuse causing reactive bursa formation between the scapula and&#xD;
      thorax. If conservative measures fail as initial attempts at management, surgical excision of&#xD;
      the inflamed bursa with resection of the superior medial angle of the scapula can be&#xD;
      performed. The procedure can be performed either arthroscopically or open. A two-portal or&#xD;
      three-portal technique can be utilized if performed arthroscopically. Very limited data&#xD;
      exists regarding outcomes of two-portal or three-portal techniques with no use of validated&#xD;
      patient-based outcome scores.23,24&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotator cuff tearing is the most common shoulder pathology treated by orthopedic surgeons.&#xD;
      Healing rates after rotator cuff repair have varied in the literature from less than 5% to&#xD;
      100% dependent on tear size, age, repair construct and muscle quality.25,26 A variety of&#xD;
      methods have been used to repair the tendon. A recent biomechanical study has shown that&#xD;
      repair with triple-loaded suture anchors have improved initial biomechanical properties&#xD;
      compared to other constructs.27 No clinical data exists on healing after repair with triple&#xD;
      loaded anchors or how healing effects function.&#xD;
