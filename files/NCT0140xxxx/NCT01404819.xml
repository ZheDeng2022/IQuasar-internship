  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to show that, in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy,&#xD;
      brain damage, assessed by the determination of S100B before removing the clamp, is less&#xD;
      severe with a balanced anesthesia consisting of remifentanil combined with Xenon&#xD;
      (experimental arm) compared with remifentanil anesthesia associated with propofol (reference&#xD;
      arm).&#xD;
