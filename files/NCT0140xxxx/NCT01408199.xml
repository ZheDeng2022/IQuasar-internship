  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Lupus is frequent. Approximately 70% of patients with SLE will develop cutaneous&#xD;
      involvement at some point during course of their disease. In spite of the esthetic&#xD;
      consequence during the acute phase, the main problem is still related to its disfiguring and&#xD;
      incapacitating nature. Topical steroids and/or antimalarial therapy continue to be the&#xD;
      conventional therapy. Unfortunately, approximately 30% will be refractory to these measures.&#xD;
      For those patients, immunosuppressive therapy can be an alternative with controversial&#xD;
      results. Several series have shown a 90% of clinical efficacy in patients treated with&#xD;
      Thalidomide. Unfortunately, the main drawback has been the serious described side effects&#xD;
      such as fetal malformations, polyneuropathy and drowsiness. Recently, a new thalidomide&#xD;
      analogue, more potent, efficient and with better safety profile has been discovered. The main&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide for patients&#xD;
      with Refractory cutaneous Lupus. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of this&#xD;
      drug on the systemic manifestations of lupus disease, the adverse effects, frequency of flare&#xD;
      after withdrawal, the sequela and the effect on the seric parameters. Methods: Twelve&#xD;
      patients with refractory cutaneous lupus will be included. Lenalidomide will be started at&#xD;
      5mg/day and tapered progressively. Blood test and EMG will be performed at onset and at the&#xD;
      end of follow up.&#xD;
