    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: One couple out of 6 consults for infertility during their sexual life. In 60% of&#xD;
      cases a male factor is associated or is the main infertility factor. Inflammatory Syndrome&#xD;
      (IS), characterized by the presence of a leukocytospermia is found in 12% of the cases.&#xD;
      Leukocyte degranulation causes oxidative stress (OS) through the formation of free radicals&#xD;
      attacking the sperm cell functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: To establish the responsibility of the IS, and OS, in chronicle inflammatory male&#xD;
      infertility, the investigators hypothesize that its treatment (as well as its possible cause)&#xD;
      must restore or improve the fertilizing capacity of patients sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This prospective randomized study will test the response to the treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators shall measure cellular degradation products due to the OS, thereby certifying&#xD;
      that it does have a deleterious effect on sperm cell. Seminal biochemistry will also assess&#xD;
      the impact of the syndrome on the genital tract glands and follow its evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be included in the study as soon as the leukocytospermia will be &gt;&#xD;
      0,5*106/ml or as soon as the elastase will be &gt; 500 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examinations will be performed using flow cytometry, CASA (Computer Assisted Semen&#xD;
      Analysis). The analysis of sperm morphology will be centralized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be a reduction in the percentage of 8OH-dG below 35 %. We anticipate&#xD;
      that it should arrive to 20 % of the patients included in the arm treatment by corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy. All in all will thus be needed 50 patients in the group placebo and 50 in the group&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint the improvement of the spermatic parameters and the reduction of the&#xD;
      fragmentation of the DNA of sperm cells to the treated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these biological markers will be evaluated 6 month after the treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fragmentation of the spermatic DNA below 37 % during the follow-up in 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukocytospermia and elastase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seminal biochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other markers of the inflammatory syndrome and oxidative stress (protein carbonyl,&#xD;
           8OHd-Guanosine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possibly the radiological examinations (Ultrasound and MRI of the genital tract)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition it would allow us to propose a policy of prevention towards acquired&#xD;
      post-infectious male infertility.&#xD;

      Progress of research. Timeframe Search&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of inclusions: 30 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of patient follow-up: 7 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total duration of the study: 37 months Within the framework of their coverage in AMP,&#xD;
           the barren couples have a consultation with the doctors of the reproduction and one with&#xD;
           the biologists. Between these two visits, a spermatic balance assessment (EXAMINATION&#xD;
           N°0) is made including a semen culture, a spermogram or a test of migration survival&#xD;
           (TMS) and an elastase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the occasion of this examination, aliquots for the measure of 8OH-dG, fragmentation of the&#xD;
      spermatic DNA and seminal biochemistry will systematically be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the framework of this standard balance assessment of infertility, it is possible that&#xD;
      an echography and a MRI of the genital ways are prescribed; if it is the case, the data of&#xD;
      these examinations will be collected in the case report form. But these examinations will not&#xD;
      be specifically asked for the search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a leukocytospermia ≥ 0,5*106/ml is discovered or an increase of the elastase ≥ 500 ng /&#xD;
      ml, the dosages of 8OH-dG, the fragmentation and the seminal biochemistry will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be seen in consultation of biology (CONSULTATION OF BIOLOGY N°0 =&#xD;
      visit of inclusion and randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patients present 8OH-dG &gt; 35 %, and that their semen culture is negative, it will&#xD;
           be suggested to them being included in the protocol and the randomization will be made&#xD;
           that very day; the patients will receive or an anti-inflammatory treatment (Prednisone)&#xD;
           is a treatment placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 8OH-dG &lt; 35 % it will be suggested to them participating in the study of the&#xD;
           follow-up of the spontaneous evolution of the SO and of SI over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first complete balance assessment will be made in 1 month (EXAMINATION N°1) after the&#xD;
      beginning of the treatment in the study (Prednisone or placebo) so as to estimate the&#xD;
      evolution at the end of the treatment of the inflammatory and oxidative parameters This&#xD;
      balance assessment will not be realized at the inclusive but not randomized patient's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in the study will have laboratory tests including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A semen analysis (leukocytospermia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measure of oxidative stress (8OHd guanosine assay - assay of protein carbonyl - DNA&#xD;
           fragmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A seminal biochemistry (acid 1-4)alpha phosphatase, citrate, zinc, fructose, carnitine&#xD;
           and glucosidase&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second balance assessment will be asked 6 months (EXAMINATION N°2) after the beginning of&#xD;
      the treatment for two reasons: the first reason is that the improvement of the spermatic&#xD;
      parameters is slowly made. If a spermatic change settled down during years she is not going&#xD;
      to disappear in the fortnight. It is effectively the experience which we have of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the spermatogenesis continuing over three months, a new cycle of production of sperm&#xD;
      cells can be estimated only more than three months after the treatment. The second reason is&#xD;
      that the second offenses of the chronic inflammations of the reproductive organ are extremely&#xD;
      frequent and it is to estimate this rate of second offense that the balance assessment will&#xD;
      be remotely asked for more by the treatment or in 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This review will include all tests of initial assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A semen analysis (leukocytospermia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measure of oxidative stress (8OHd guanosine assay - assay of protein carbonyl - DNA&#xD;
           fragmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A seminal biochemistry (acid 1-4)alpha phosphatase, citrate, zinc, fructose, carnitine&#xD;
           and glucosidase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ultrasound of the genital tract and genital tract RMI without injection of any&#xD;
           compound&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will be scheduled for all patients, whether randomized or not. During this visit,&#xD;
      the results of tests carried out at 1 month and 6 months after initiation of treatment will&#xD;
      be analyzed. The investigator will collect adverse events that occurred since the&#xD;
      randomization visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who during the examination in 6 months have a very significant improvement in their&#xD;
      semen parameters will propose cryopreserving their sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays and analysis on the semen Collections of semen will be done in the Laboratory of&#xD;
      Reproductive Biology of each participating centre of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most assays and analysis will be centralized at the Cochin Hospital. Measurement of elastase&#xD;
      Elastase assays will be centralized in the Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Hospital&#xD;
      Cochin. The assays will be carried out from 150 µl total sperm collected after liquefaction&#xD;
      and frozen at -20 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migration Survival Test (MST) This test will be done locally in each participating centre. A&#xD;
      smear slide will be made for a centralized analysis of the morphology, to avoid any &quot;centre&quot;&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seminal Biochemistry The biochemical seminal will be centralized in the Laboratory of&#xD;
      Biochemistry, Hospital Cochin. This assay, carried out on total sperm collected after&#xD;
      liquefaction, including assays of acid phosphatase, citrate, zinc, fructose, carnitine and&#xD;
      1-4.alpha Glucosidase The semen will be collected, centrifuged at 600g for 5 minutes. After&#xD;
      centrifugation, 500μl of the supernatant will be frozen at - 20 ° C and used for biochemical&#xD;
      seminal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of oxidative stress The extent of oxidative stress will be centrally assessed in&#xD;
      Cochin Hospital. This assay, carried out on total sperm collected after liquefaction,&#xD;
      including the determination of 8OHd-Guanosine, the dosage of protein carbonyl and DNA&#xD;
      fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The semen will be collected centrifuged at 600g for 5 minutes. After centrifugation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  250μl of the supernatant be frozen at - 20 ° C and used for determination of protein&#xD;
           carbonyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pellet will be used for the assay of 8OHdguanosine and DNA fragmentation.&#xD;
           Measurement of sperm motion parameters by CASA The measurement of sperm motion&#xD;
           parameters by CASA will be performed locally in each participating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound and MRI of the genital tract Ultrasounds and MRI will be performed in the genital&#xD;
      tract in the central radiology department of hospital Necker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservation of the remaining sample of semen For patients with very significant improvement&#xD;
      in their semen parameters during the examination at 6 months, it will be offered&#xD;
      self-preservation of semen for any subsequent attempt of ART after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the remaining sample of semen, except if opposition from the patient, will&#xD;
      be kept after the end of the research for later use in future research on fertility and&#xD;
      inflammation. This collection will be kept at CECOS - Cochin Hospital, Bldg. Cassini - 27 rue&#xD;
      du FAUBOURG St Jacques, 75014 Paris under the supervision of Professor Jean-PHILIPPE Wolf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules Patients may discontinue their participation in research if they wish, at any&#xD;
      time and for whatever reason, or upon the decision of the investigator. However, the&#xD;
      treatment should not be stopped suddenly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules for the participation of a person seeking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poor adherence to protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intercurrent disease between the inclusion visit and the visit at 1 month requiring&#xD;
           cessation of study. Following the study is that of surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for monitoring output test All output tests should be documented and the&#xD;
      investigator must specify the reason. For patients considered lost of sight, case report&#xD;
      forms should be filled to the last visit. The investigator will make every effort to contact&#xD;
      the patient and to know the reason for leaving the trial and his health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences Patients who quit from the trial will not be re-included in the study. Their&#xD;
      numbers are not effectively reused. These patients will still be followed in the&#xD;
      non-randomized part of the study.&#xD;
