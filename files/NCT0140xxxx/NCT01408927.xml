      The primary objective of this prospective clinical registry is to determine the prevalence&#xD;
      and level of thienopyridine resistance seen in a population undergoing contemporary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study of 1000 patients presenting to the Washington Hospital&#xD;
      Center for percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective clinical registry is to determine the prevalence and level of&#xD;
      thienopyridine resistance seen in a population presenting for cardiac catheterization and&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).&#xD;
      Thienopyridine resistance will be measured by flow cytometry of the vasodilator-stimulated&#xD;
      phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, and/or the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, and/or the&#xD;
      Chrono-Log Lumi-Aggregometer, and/or the PlaCor PRT 7000 platelet reactivity assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this study is to correlate a variety of genetic polymorphisms with&#xD;
      levels of platelet reactivity.&#xD;
