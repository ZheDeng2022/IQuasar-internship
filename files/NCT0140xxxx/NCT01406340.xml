    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      GSK1278863 and metabolites in normal subjects and subjects with impaired renal function,&#xD;
      including those who are hemodialysis dependent. GSK1278863 will be administered once daily&#xD;
      for 14 days to normal subjects and subjects with Stage 3 and Stage 4 renal function, and 15&#xD;
      days to subjects with Stage 5 renal function. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be made on&#xD;
      Days 1 and 14 (normal subjects, subjects with Stage 3 and Stage 4 renal function) or Days 14&#xD;
      and 15 (dialysis and non-dialysis days; Stage 5).&#xD;
