  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve fusion (bony healing) techniques and improve patient&#xD;
      recovery by identifying cells in your body that make bone. Patients with spine problems often&#xD;
      need surgeries that include fusion (bony healing) of vertebrae (bones in your back) together&#xD;
      in order to hold the bones steady allowing them to heal together (fusion). If the vertebrae&#xD;
      (back bones) fail to heal together, which occurs about 10-15% of the time, it can result in a&#xD;
      slower recovery and may require revision (another) surgery. By using a small portion of the&#xD;
      graft taken during surgery the investigators hope to define the cells that make bone most&#xD;
      efficiently. This will help reduce the need for revision surgeries and improve patient&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;

      This study requests using your additional bone tissue (the extra tissue not needed after your&#xD;
      back surgery is complete).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tissue will be measured for total volume (amount), labeled with your age, gender, date&#xD;
      and time the tissue was removed (date and time of surgery), and taken to a lab for analysis.&#xD;
      You will not be billed for the collection of your additional tissue or the lab analysis. All&#xD;
      routine procedures (surgery and all follow-up care relating to your back surgery) will still&#xD;
      be paid for by you or your insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once your extra tissue sample has been collected, measured, labeled, and sent to the lab for&#xD;
      testing, no further participation is required from you in this research study. The&#xD;
      investigators will use your sample in our research to enhance bone healing.&#xD;
