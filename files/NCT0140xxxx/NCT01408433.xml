    <textblock>
      This study seeks to compare the pregnancy and delivery rates of patients who undergo a single&#xD;
      embryo transfer, when the embryo has been tested and determined to be chromosomally normal,&#xD;
      with pregnancy and delivery rates of patients who undergo a two (2) embryo transfer of&#xD;
      untested embryos.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients from the NJ/NY/CT/eastern PA area only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twin and higher-order multiple pregnancies are the most common and most significant&#xD;
      complication of pregnancies conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Twin&#xD;
      rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles are approximately 30%. These pregnancies have&#xD;
      increased complications for both the mother and the babies. A singleton, one baby, is the&#xD;
      safest outcome for an IVF cycle. The surest way to reduce the risk of multiple births in IVF&#xD;
      cycles is to transfer fewer embryos. Prior studies on single embryo transfer (SET) have shown&#xD;
      decreased pregnancy rates because of the difficulty in selecting which embryo to transfer.&#xD;
      Being chromosomally normal is necessary for the delivery of a healthy baby. The investigators&#xD;
      are now able to screen all 24 chromosomes of an embryo with greater than 97% accuracy within&#xD;
      four hours, allowing for a fresh embryo transfer of a tested embryo, using Comprehensive&#xD;
      Chromosome Screening (CCS). This study seeks to show that the transfer of a single CCS-normal&#xD;
      embryo will result in delivery rates equal to those resulting from a two embryo transfer, the&#xD;
      current standard of care in IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo IVF according to the protocol recommended by their primary doctor. On&#xD;
      the day of egg retrieval, all mature eggs will be fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm&#xD;
      injection (ICSI) per routine laboratory protocol. Embryos will then be cultured out to day 5&#xD;
      per routine laboratory procedure. The embryos will be assessed by the embryologist on day 5&#xD;
      to determine if the patient is a candidate for a fresh transfer. Patients who are a candidate&#xD;
      for fresh transfer will be randomized into either the single embryo transfer of a&#xD;
      chromosomally normal embryo group or the double, untested embryo group. Patients will have a&#xD;
      50:50 chance of being in the single or double embryo transfer group. Embryos in the single&#xD;
      embryo group will undergo biopsy for CCS and patients will then undergo transfer of the&#xD;
      morphologically best, chromosomally normal embryo. Additional embryos will be cryopreserved.&#xD;
      Patients in the double embryo transfer group will undergo a two embryo transfer. Additional&#xD;
      embryos will be cryopreserved. If patients are not a candidate for a fresh transfer&#xD;
      (potentially because of endometrial lining development, risk of ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      syndrome, or embryos that are not suitable for biopsy on day 5), they will still be&#xD;
      randomized into either the single or double embryo transfer group. Patients in the single&#xD;
      embryo transfer group will have all embryos biopsied for CCS prior to being frozen. Patients&#xD;
      will then immediately undergo a synthetic frozen embryo transfer cycle in accordance with&#xD;
      their randomization. Patients in the double embryo transfer group will have their embryos&#xD;
      frozen and will then immediately prepare for a synthetic frozen embryo transfer cycle in&#xD;
      accordance with their randomization. Any patient who does not become pregnant during their&#xD;
      fresh transfer cycle will immediately undergo a synthetic frozen embryo transfer cycle in&#xD;
      accordance with their original randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical follow up will be per routine regarding pregnancy testing, early pregnancy&#xD;
      monitoring and subsequent transfer of care to the patient's obstetrician. If clinical&#xD;
      miscarriage occurs, cells from the products of conception will be collected, if possible, and&#xD;
      submitted for genetic analysis. If the pregnancy progresses to delivery, a buccal swab (small&#xD;
      swab touched to the inside of the baby's cheek) will be collected and submitted for genetic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
