  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark around 3500 procedures are conducted involving a heart-lung-machine per year. An&#xD;
      increase in the prevalence of postoperative kidney insufficiency have been observed following&#xD;
      these procedures, during the last years. Kidney related complications are associated with a&#xD;
      higher mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason and mechanisms behind this impaired kidney function is unknown. One possible cause&#xD;
      could be that the blood pressure used in the heart-lung-machine is too low, during surgery.&#xD;
      In the PPC trial we plan to include 100 patients. One half of the patients are operated with&#xD;
      a normal, lower, blood pressure on the heart-lung-machine. The other half receives a blood&#xD;
      pressure of &gt; 60 mmHg during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the trial is to measure the kidney function (GFR) the day before surgery&#xD;
      compared to day 4 - 6 and 4 months (+/- 14 days) after surgery. During the surgery a catheter&#xD;
      is inserted through the femoral vein into the kidney vein. This makes it possible to measure&#xD;
      several biochemical markers and the oxygen consumption of the kidney, during the surgery.&#xD;
      Urine samples are also collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is better preserved after cardiac surgery with extra&#xD;
      corporal circulation with an intended increased periprocedural arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      compared to current practice.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Renal function and cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           Impaired kidney function is a well known complication to cardiac surgery and is observed&#xD;
           in up to 30% of the patients, depending on the definition of acute kidney injury (AKI).&#xD;
           The precise pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown, it is, however, quite obvious&#xD;
           that AKI is not initiated by a single harmful factor but seems to be the result of&#xD;
           different combined factors. Known risk factors for the development of postoperative AKI&#xD;
           are cardiac incompensation, poor ejection fraction, gender, chronic obstructive lung&#xD;
           disease, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), previous heart surgery, acute&#xD;
           surgery, complexity of surgery, preoperative creatinine levels and prolonged duration of&#xD;
           extracorporeal perfusion. These associations are not necessarily causal. It is not&#xD;
           surprising that a subacute operation for a severe aortic stenosis in a patient with&#xD;
           preoperatively poor circulation and a marginally increased S-creatinine, results in&#xD;
           impaired renal function postoperatively. However, to conclude that cardiac surgery is&#xD;
           the reason for AKI is not justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several peroperative factors are likely to contribute in the development of AKI. Renal&#xD;
           perfusion and oxygen delivery might be reduced (hypotension, lack of pulsatile flow&#xD;
           during extracorporeal circulation (ECC), vasoactive pharmacological agents,&#xD;
           anaesthesia), risk for emboli, general inflammatory response, direct nephrotoxins (free&#xD;
           haemoglobin, free radicals, gentamycin etc.) and haemodilution. Current knowledge is&#xD;
           limited and the general insight into regional perfusion during extracorporeal perfusion&#xD;
           (heart-lung-machine) is very sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There do, however, exist guidelines regarding flow and blood pressure during ECC, but&#xD;
           these are based upon empiric data, which are controversial and vary from centre to&#xD;
           centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary focus has been on regional cerebral perfusion and the possibilities to&#xD;
           reduce the frequency of cerebral complications after cardiac surgery. This interest can&#xD;
           easily be explained by the obvious catastrophic consequences for the patient due to&#xD;
           coma, hemiparesis or serious cognitive dysfunction. The consequences of AKI are less&#xD;
           evident, however there is a direct and strong association between a moderately increased&#xD;
           postoperative creatinine level, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 30 day&#xD;
           mortality as long term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent analysis of the kidney function of lung transplanted patients in our department&#xD;
           after use of ECC showed that GFR was dramatically reduced by 40% 14 days after surgery.&#xD;
           This impairment has furthermore been shown to be irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cyclosporine A is known to be nephrotoxic in the long term, but this can hardly explain&#xD;
           the observed GFR reduction after 14 days, which must result from the combined influence&#xD;
           of surgical/anaesthesiological trauma, cyclosporine, and side effects of antibiotic,&#xD;
           antiviral, antifungal and immunosuppressive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data from our internal prospective registry shows an increasing incidence of patients&#xD;
           with renal complications. In 2008 temporary dialysis was necessary in 7% of the patients&#xD;
           (76/1130) and in 19% of the patients a postoperative increase of S-creatinine &gt; 200&#xD;
           Î¼mol/l was observed, mirroring a reduction in kidney function of 60-70%. We assume that&#xD;
           the kidney function is completely normalized over time, but this is actually not known&#xD;
           because these patients are not routinely controlled on a cardiac surgery outpatient&#xD;
           basis. Currently, we are gathering 1-year outcome data on patients, who have undergone&#xD;
           postoperative dialysis in 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One of the reasons for the increasing frequency of AKI might be increasing patient age,&#xD;
           and thereby, an increase in comorbidity. At the same time the administration of ECC has&#xD;
           changed. Ten years ago patients were routinely cooled during ECC. This is not the case&#xD;
           anymore and results in a reduced degree of peripheral vessel constriction and&#xD;
           consequently reduced blood pressure. The question regarding which blood pressure and&#xD;
           which blood flow is optimal during ECC remains controversial, but generally a much lower&#xD;
           blood pressure is now accepted, as long as the calculated blood flow is maintained and&#xD;
           cerebral saturation values are sufficient (not measured routinely).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The literature on the subject is sparse but two randomized trials exists. One had a&#xD;
           primary focus on kidney autoregulation at different perfusion pressures, the other&#xD;
           recent trial could not demonstrate significant differences in kidney function measured&#xD;
           by s-creatinine at 3 different perfusion pressures. However, S-creatinine is a very&#xD;
           crude method for measuring kidney function. In addition, the trial included patients&#xD;
           with low risk of postoperative AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperative increase in S-creatinine typically occurs on day 2 or 3 after surgery, and&#xD;
           S-creatinine does not increase before GFR is reduced below 50%. This implies that the&#xD;
           possible initial 50% reduction in kidney function cannot be detected by routine&#xD;
           biochemistry. It is fair to assume that kidney injury occurs during surgery or within&#xD;
           the first postoperative 24 hours. From a biochemical point of view there is an apparent&#xD;
           lack of robust and reliable early markers of tubular kidney damage, which would allow a&#xD;
           relevant early clinical intervention, and possible prevention of AKI aggravation.&#xD;
           Creatinine kinases MB and troponins are very reliable markers for cardiac damage and can&#xD;
           reveal acute myocardial infarction within hours after the occlusion of coronary vessels.&#xD;
           A corresponding early diagnosis of AKI does not exist. At the same time it seems likely&#xD;
           that specific enzymatic or cell membrane components could be detectable in the urine a&#xD;
           few hours after an AKI. There has been some focus on possible candidates for early&#xD;
           detection of AKI, but none have shown to be sufficiently robust for clinical use, yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the last 20 years there have been a few trials with focus on prevention and&#xD;
           prophylactic intervention to avoid AKI with anti-inflammatory drugs, natriuresis&#xD;
           inducing agents (ANP) or renal blood flow increasing pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
           However, none of these interventions have had sufficiently convincing effects for&#xD;
           further clinical testing. A recent Japanese study seems to indicate that prophylactic&#xD;
           infusion of ANP can reduce postoperative kidney impairment, but these results need&#xD;
           confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our department is currently performing a phase 2 trial in cooperation with Action Pharma&#xD;
           (a Danish biotech company) in which we are testing AP214, a new small anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           protein, with potential kidney protective characteristics (clinicaltrials.gov:&#xD;
           00903604). At the same time we are investigating if AP214 can reduce the nephrotoxic&#xD;
           effect of cyclosporine in a pig kidney transplant model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Summary / Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An increasing incidence of renal complications is seen after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The aetiology is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is unclear if the reduction in renal function is reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Renal complications are associated with increased short- and long term mortality&#xD;
                and morbidity after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Renal regional perfusion during extracorporeal circulation is poorly understood,&#xD;
                and the impact of blood pressure and perfusion on postoperative kidney function in&#xD;
                patients with increased risk for AKI after cardiac surgery is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are several potential biochemical markers for the early detection of acute&#xD;
                tubular kidney damage, however there is a substantial lack of clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Several interventions might be kidney protective, however there are no robust&#xD;
                clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis for the PPC trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is better preserved after cardiac surgery with ECC&#xD;
           with an intended increased periprocedural arterial blood pressure compared to current&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Phase 1: Randomized proof of concept trial, n = 12. Simple 1:1 randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Phase 2: If the proof of concept trial turns out positive and logistically feasible&#xD;
                (which we have shown, see later) the trial will be extended to include 2 x 50&#xD;
                patients. There are no similar trials or data in the literature on which to base an&#xD;
                estimate of the necessary trial size. N = 100 is a qualified assumption based on&#xD;
                what is clinically possible to include within a 1-1Â½ year period. As earlier shown&#xD;
                in the lung transplant population GFR was reduced with 40%. A clinically relevant&#xD;
                improvement of an average reduction in GFR would be a reduction of 20%. However,&#xD;
                GFR data are quite heterogeneous and some patients have perfectly normal GFR's&#xD;
                throughout surgery and the postoperative course, while others develop pronounced&#xD;
                AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Phase 3: Test of different preventive and prophylactic interventions (AP214,&#xD;
                proANP, reduced haemodilution, pulsatile flow during ECC).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Trial size and outcome measures will be dependent on results from phase 2. There&#xD;
                are no earlier data on continuous saturation measurement in renal venous blood or&#xD;
                sequential mass spectrometric analysis of urine in a cardiac surgery population.&#xD;
                Current results will therefore decide on future primary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Inclusion- and exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Patients with increased risk of postoperative AKI, who give written consent after&#xD;
                appropriate information, are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Age &gt; 70&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Combined procedures (heart valve-, bypass surgery and aortic aneurysm)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Age &lt; 70&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  S-creatinine &gt; 200 Âµmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Acute operation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Operation procedure and ECC run are performed according to current guidelines at&#xD;
                the Dept. of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery / Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
                During ECC run a MAP &gt; 60 mmHg is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In both groups GFR measurements are performed using the Cr-EDTA clearance method.&#xD;
                GFR is measured the day before surgery, day 4-6 after surgery and finally after 4&#xD;
                months (+/- 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
                A catheter is inserted in the renal vein through the femoral vein. The position is&#xD;
                controlled by fluoroscopy. Repeated saturation measurements, by blood gas analysis,&#xD;
                will be performed during and in the first 24 hours after surgery. Blood samples are&#xD;
                taken from the same access. The catheter is removed before discharge from the&#xD;
                intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Primary outcome measure: Cr-EDTA clearance, the day before surgery, at day 4 - 6&#xD;
                and 4 months (+/- 14 days) after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Oxygen consumption on-line in renal venous blood&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Renal renin and proANP excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  U-NGAL, U-Apolipoprotein M, U-IL-18, U-KIM-1 and S-cystatin C&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Urine proteomics (mass spectrometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Tertiary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Standard clinical data collection (haemodynamics, diuresis, routine biochemistry)&#xD;
                and clinical outcome in terms of time in intensive care, time to discharge,&#xD;
                incidence rates of adverse- and serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Economy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is a non-profit trial. None of the project members have economic interests&#xD;
      in the trial. The involved clinical departments cover direct and indirect expenses regarding&#xD;
      the prolonged admission, GFR-measurements and additional biochemical analyses estimated to be&#xD;
      15.800 DKK per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Heart Association covers the salary for Ph.D. student Kristian Kandler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5: Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project combines expert knowledge from different medical fields on a highly scientific&#xD;
      and clinical level (advanced cardiac surgery in high risk patients, advanced postoperative&#xD;
      intensive care, innovative monitoring (invasive, biochemical, clinical physiology). We expect&#xD;
      to provide original, innovative and scientifically relevant results that will contribute to a&#xD;
      better understanding of the renal pathophysiology and autoregulation during and after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. As a clinical randomised trial this study may show new possibilities to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative renal complications in a group of patients with significant&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
