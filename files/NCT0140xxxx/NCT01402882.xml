      The CRASH-3 trial will provide reliable evidence about the effect of tranexamic acid on&#xD;
      mortality and disability in patients with traumatic brain injury. The effect of tranexamic&#xD;
      acid on the risk of vascular occlusive events and seizures will also be assessed.&#xD;
      Additionally, a nested study will be conducted in a subset of CRASH-3 trial participants.&#xD;
      This nested study (CRASH-3 Intracranial Bleeding Sub-Study [CRASH-3 IBS]) will examine the&#xD;
      effect of tranexamic acid on intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia using CT Scans&#xD;
      in approximately 1,000 patients randomised into the CRASH-3 trial.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Worldwide, over 10 million people are killed or hospitalised because of traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) each year. About 90% of deaths from TBI occur in low and middle income&#xD;
      countries. TBI mostly affects young adults and many experiencing long lasting or permanent&#xD;
      disability. The social and economic burden of TBI is considerable. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is&#xD;
      commonly given to surgical patients to reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusion.&#xD;
      TXA has been shown to reduce the number of patients receiving a blood transfusion by about a&#xD;
      third, reduces the volume of blood transfused by about one unit, and halves the need for&#xD;
      further surgery to control bleeding in elective surgical patients. More recently, the CRASH-2&#xD;
      trial showed that the administration of TXA within 8 hours of injury significantly reduces&#xD;
      deaths due to bleeding (RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p=0.008), and all-cause mortality&#xD;
      (RR=0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97; p=0.0035), with no apparent increase in vascular occlusive&#xD;
      events. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of TXA in TBI showed a significant&#xD;
      reduction in haemorrhage growth (OR=0.61, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.91) and mortality (OR=0.59, 95%CI&#xD;
      0.35 to 0.99) with TXA. Although the results from these trials are promising, the estimates&#xD;
      are imprecise and there are no data on the effect of TXA on disability. Additionally, a&#xD;
      nested study will be conducted in a subset of CRASH-3 trial participants. This nested study&#xD;
      (CRASH-3 Intracranial Bleeding Sub-Study [CRASH-3 IBS]) will examine the effect of tranexamic&#xD;
      acid on intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral ischaemia using CT Scans in approximately 1,000&#xD;
      patients randomised into the CRASH-3 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The CRASH-3 trial will provide reliable evidence about the effect of tranexamic acid on&#xD;
      mortality and disability in patients with TBI. The effect of TXA on the risk of vascular&#xD;
      occlusive events and seizures will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is death in hospital (within 28 days of injury) of&#xD;
      patients randomised within 3 hours of injury (cause of death will be described).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vascular occlusive events (myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, clinical&#xD;
           evidence of deep vein thrombosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In hospital disability assessed using the Disability Rating Scale and Patient Orientated&#xD;
           Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neurosurgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Days in intensive care Other adverse events will be described&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcome Measures: CRASH-3 IBS Primary outcome - the total volume of intracranial&#xD;
      haemorrhage after randomisation, adjusting for baseline haemorrhage volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of progressive haemorrhage: number of patients with a post-randomisation CT&#xD;
           scan with total haemorrhage volume of more than 25% of the volume on the&#xD;
           pre-randomisation scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of delayed haemorrhage: number of patients with haemorrhage on the&#xD;
           post-randomisation CT scan when there was not one on the pre-randomisation scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New focal ischaemic lesions: ischaemic lesions which appear on the post-randomisation CT&#xD;
           scan but not on the pre-randomisation scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total volume of intracranial bleeding in patients who undergo surgical evacuation of&#xD;
           haemorrhage after randomisation, adjusting for volume of baseline bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN: A large, pragmatic, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial among&#xD;
      13,000 traumatic brain injury patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOSIS AND INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with traumatic brain injury who&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are within eight hours of injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with any intracranial bleeding on CT scan or who have a GCS of 12 or less, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have no significant extra-cranial haemorrhage The fundamental eligibility criterion is&#xD;
           the responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' as to whether or not to use tranexamic acid in&#xD;
           a particular patient with traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST PRODUCT, REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION: A loading dose of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1 gram by intravenous injection) or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) will be given as soon as&#xD;
      possible after randomisation. A maintenance dose of tranexamic acid (1 gram by intravenous&#xD;
      injection) or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) will be given after the loading dose is&#xD;
      finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: This trial will be coordinated from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine&#xD;
      (University of London) and conducted worldwide in hospitals in low, middle and high income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
