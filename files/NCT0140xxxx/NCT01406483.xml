  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this exploratory cohort study is to describe levels of platelet&#xD;
      reactivity in patients on a thienopyridine awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent emergence of platelet reactivity testing as a potential option for evaluating the&#xD;
      degree of platelet inhibition promises to add another level of understanding to our concept&#xD;
      of CABG-related bleeding. There is an emerging literature that links high levels of platelet&#xD;
      reactivity with adverse clinical events, primarily in patients on clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, studies of the VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet function assay have shown that Platelet&#xD;
      Reactivity Units (PRU) &gt; 235-240 in patients on clopidogrel therapy appears to predict&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.15,16 There is a paucity of literature, however, on the use of platelet&#xD;
      reactivity testing to predict bleeding events and complications. In other words, if&#xD;
      excessively high levels of platelet reactivity predict ischemic events, do excessively low&#xD;
      levels of platelet reactivity predict bleeding events? This is an especially relevant&#xD;
      question, given the emergence of prasugrel as a therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose an exploratory cohort study of patients receiving a&#xD;
      thienopyridine (clopidogrel or prasugrel) and undergoing CABG, in order to describe levels of&#xD;
      platelet reactivity in such patients by using a variety of platelet function tests.&#xD;
