  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the cosmetic outcome and examine factors contributing to cosmetic&#xD;
      outcome in women treated with lumpectomy or bilateral breast reduction mammoplasty/mastopexy&#xD;
      (BRM) followed by hypofractionated whole breast irradiation. Breast conservation is now an&#xD;
      established method of treatment for early breast cancer. Because breast conservation is&#xD;
      essentially a cosmetic alternative to mastectomy, quality of life, cosmetic outcome and tumor&#xD;
      control are all important considerations during comprehensive treatment planning. Irradiation&#xD;
      schemes have been demonstrated to be efficacious and with excellent short term cosmetic&#xD;
      outcomes. However, their interaction with currently evolving surgical techniques needs to be&#xD;
      examined in order to maintain optimal local control while preserving cosmetic outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer outcomes and cosmesis may differ by race. Limited but controversial data&#xD;
      suggests that African-American women have worse cosmetic outcomes with hypofractionated&#xD;
      irradiation than with conventional breast conservation. A growing body of data also suggests&#xD;
      that African-American women have diminished oncologic outcomes when compared to Caucasian&#xD;
      women in the United States. Further evaluation is needed to better understand the reason for&#xD;
      these discrepancies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal, medullary, papillary, colloid&#xD;
             (mucinous) lobular or tubular histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) DCIS or Stage T1- T2, N0 histologically&#xD;
             confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast treated with partial mastectomy with&#xD;
             axillary evaluation as appropriate, axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy&#xD;
             (SLN). Patients with DCIS with or without SLN or axillary node dissection are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients greater than 70 years old, with stage 1 disease who are&#xD;
             estrogen/progesterone receptor positive (ER/PR+), with or without SLN or axillary node&#xD;
             dissection are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Partial mastectomy with or without reconstruction consisting of local tissue&#xD;
             rearrangement and/or reduction mammoplasty (ipsilateral and bilateral). Patients who&#xD;
             have undergone surgery and/or chemotherapy prior to treatment with radiation therapy&#xD;
             are still eligible for enrollment and all evaluations and photographs will begin prior&#xD;
             to radiation. Retrospective Placement of at least 3 surgical clips in the lumpectomy&#xD;
             cavity is strongly encouraged. Retrospective data may be collected on women who have&#xD;
             completed their entire course of treatment as long as they are formally consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unifocal breast cancer which may be encompassed by excision of a single portion of&#xD;
             breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative inked histologic margins of partial mastectomy or re-excision specimen to be&#xD;
             confirmed prior to radiation. Positive margins are unacceptable. Every effort should&#xD;
             be made by the surgeon to obtain negative margins with the initial excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative post-partial mastectomy mammography (if malignancy associated&#xD;
             micro-calcifications were initially present.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tamoxifen or Arimidex therapy is allowed. If chemotherapy is administered prior to&#xD;
             radiation (but following surgery), then a minimum of two weeks must elapse prior to&#xD;
             the start of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be 50 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed study-specific informed consent form prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled on another clinical trial involving any treatment which may affect&#xD;
             the cosmesis of the bilateral breasts. This would include the taking of medications,&#xD;
             vitamin supplements, variation in radiation or surgery or topical application to the&#xD;
             breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are node positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palpable or radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary, supraclavicular,&#xD;
             infraclavicular or internal mammary nodes, unless there is histologic confirmation&#xD;
             that these nodes are negative for tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previously treated contralateral breast carcinoma or synchronous ipsilateral&#xD;
             breast carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior non-hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for the current breast cancer; prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy if administered less than two weeks from the start of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Paget's disease of the nipple.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior breast reconstructive surgery including breast mastopexy or breast&#xD;
             augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with skin involvement, regardless of tumor size.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with collagenous diseases, specifically systemic lupus erythematosis,&#xD;
             scleroderma or dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe peripheral vascular disease or coronary artery disease (ex.&#xD;
             Previous acute myocardial infarction requiring stents or coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
             within past two years; prior bypass graft of any type etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with co-existing medical conditions with life expectancy less than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancy except non-melanomatous skin cancer less than 5 years prior to&#xD;
             participation in this study; the disease free interval from any prior carcinoma must&#xD;
             be continuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
