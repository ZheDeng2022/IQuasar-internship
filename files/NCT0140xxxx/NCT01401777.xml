      The objective of this study is to assess and quantify any differences between assisted (using&#xD;
      real-time visualization of tracked cryo-probes) and unassisted cryoablation procedures using&#xD;
      pre-procedure CT scans or CT fluoroscopy with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ &quot;TRE&quot; Target Registration Error (distance between &quot;virtual&quot; needle position (tracking data)&#xD;
      and the actual needle position (CT confirmation scan))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accuracy of needle targeting - The vector of each needle insertion (The initial vector&#xD;
           allows us to project the path to the pre-defined target. If the initial entry point is&#xD;
           not ideal, the path to the target will need adjustment) Based on a two-sample t-test&#xD;
           (significance level of 0.05, two-tailed), the study has 89% power to detect a difference&#xD;
           of 2mm in accuracy between the two treatment groups (assuming a standard deviation of&#xD;
           1.9mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure time difference between assisted and unassisted procedure&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to assess and quantify any differences between assisted (using&#xD;
      real-time visualization of tracked cryo-probes) and unassisted cryoablation procedures using&#xD;
      pre-procedure CT scans or CT fluoroscopy. To assess this, physicians will perform ablation&#xD;
      procedures with and without the Percu Nav device. Data will be collected on the angle of&#xD;
      needle entry unassisted and then assisted by PercuNAv to determine if the added imaging&#xD;
      information modifies the physician's needle approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have a pre-procedure CT image set of the area of interest acquired. The&#xD;
      patient will be scanned in the same position that the ablation will be performed in, although&#xD;
      not requisite. Sterile registration patches will be applied to the patient's skin around the&#xD;
      area of interest prior to the scan, ensuring that suitable windows are left available for&#xD;
      needle entry. The patient will undergo these pre-procedural scans as part of the usual&#xD;
      clinical evaluation of the lesion to undergo ablation. The scans may be acquired with or&#xD;
      without contrast, at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: The physician will perform the procedure using the standard of care method (CT&#xD;
      only), without the additional information being recorded by the PercuNav device. The tracking&#xD;
      device will be placed on the patient's skin at the desired point of entry. Without displaying&#xD;
      the PercuNav screen to the physician, a screen capture will be taken to record the approach&#xD;
      path. At the point of insertion, the time stamp will be recorded and the start button will be&#xD;
      pressed. Once the physician states they are at the defined target a screen capture will be&#xD;
      taken on the PercuNav and the distance to target and time stamp will be recorded by pushing&#xD;
      the start button again. At the end of the procedure a verification CT scan will be taken with&#xD;
      the needle in place and sent to the PercuNav.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percu Nav group: The physician will perform the procedure using the standard of care&#xD;
      procedure with the additional information displayed and recorded by the PercuNav device (CT&#xD;
      and PercuNav). The tracking device will be placed on the patient's skin at the desired point&#xD;
      of entry. Without displaying the PercuNav screen to the physician, a screen capture will be&#xD;
      taken to record the approach path. The physician will be shown the PercuNav screen and will&#xD;
      correct the desired approach path and another screen capture will be taken. At the point of&#xD;
      insertion, the time stamp will be recorded and the start button will be pressed. Once the&#xD;
      physician states they are at the defined target a screen capture will be taken on the&#xD;
      PercuNav and the distance to target and time stamp will be recorded. At the end of the&#xD;
      procedure a verification CT scan will be taken (as is part of the regular standard of care&#xD;
      procedure) with the needle in place and sent to the PercuNav.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures that will be evaluated in the groups include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Accuracy - The distance between the &quot;virtual&quot; needle position (tracking data) and the&#xD;
           actual needle position (CT confirmation scan)), where applicable (TRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to reach a clinically acceptable target in the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The total procedure time&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Accuracy of needle targeting - The vector of each needle insertion (The initial vector&#xD;
           allows us to project the path to the pre-defined target. If the initial entry point is&#xD;
           not ideal, the path to the target will need adjustment)&#xD;
