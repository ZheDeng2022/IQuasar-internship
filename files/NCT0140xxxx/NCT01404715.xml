  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address the following question: Does imatinib influence the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of metformin in healthy volunteers? Recent studies in the Giacomini laboratory have indicated&#xD;
      that imatinib may block metformin elimination from the kidney by inhibiting organic cation&#xD;
      transporter efflux of metformin. 1. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of&#xD;
      imatinib to metformin therapy will reduce the renal clearance (CLR) of metformin leading to&#xD;
      increased plasma concentrations and risk for toxicities 2. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction profile of metformin with organic cation transporter inhibitors, such as&#xD;
      imatinib, is important to help develop safer more effective drug therapy with reduced side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      Screening Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, subjects will be asked to come to the Clinical and Translational Science&#xD;
      (CTSI) Clinical Research Centre (CRC) at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). The study&#xD;
      protocol and procedures will be explained in detail, all questions will be answered, and&#xD;
      subjects will be provided a consent form to sign. The screening visit must be conducted&#xD;
      within 14 days of the first inpatient visit i.e. first metformin alone or metformin and&#xD;
      imatinib dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only after subjects have consented to participate in the study will the screening procedures&#xD;
      commence. All subjects recruited in this study will have already consented to the&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics in ethnically diverse populations (SOPHIE) study, a previously established&#xD;
      cohort of healthy people living in San Francisco. A review of the subject's medical history&#xD;
      and health questionnaire will be conducted, by the research staff, to re-assess health status&#xD;
      and confirm eligibility. Changes in medical or drug use history will be noted during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, vital signs as well as blood and urine samples will be taken from&#xD;
      all subjects for laboratory analysis. A single blood sample (10 mL) will be taken by&#xD;
      venipuncture to measure a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen&#xD;
      (BUN), creatinine, and liver function tests (LFTs) to screen for anemia and renal or hepatic&#xD;
      insufficiency (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their screening visit, an equal number of subjects will be randomized, by a random&#xD;
      number generator in excel, into one of the two study arms; metformin alone followed by the&#xD;
      co-administration of metformin and imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures During Main Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Study Visit Arm 1: Metformin alone Subjects will report to the CRC at&#xD;
      approximately 7:30 AM, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours (since approximately&#xD;
      10:00 PM). Vital signs and a brief history will be taken upon arrival. If all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, one intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted into a&#xD;
      forearm vein to facilitate blood sampling. An initial blood sample of 10 mL will be drawn&#xD;
      from the IV line for the determination of plasma metformin, creatinine, and imatinib&#xD;
      concentrations prior to the administration of metformin (i.e. baseline measurement). Next&#xD;
      each subject will receive an oral dose of 1000 mg of metformin with 8 oz of water followed by&#xD;
      an oral dose of 850mg. Blood samples (5 mL each) will then be drawn at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,&#xD;
      3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours post-dose for the determination of plasma metformin and&#xD;
      imatinib concentrations. An additional 5 mL of blood will be drawn at the 6-hour and 12-hour&#xD;
      time points for the measurement of serum creatinine to allow the calculation of creatinine&#xD;
      clearance (CLcr). Blood samples obtained by finger prick will be taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,&#xD;
      2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 hours after ingestion of metformin (total of 0.1 mL) to measure blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. Additional biomarkers of metformin/imatinib response and toxicities, such as&#xD;
      plasma insulin, glucose and AMPK activation, may also be determined on the blood samples&#xD;
      collected. Subjects will remain at the CRC and receive standardized meals starting 4 hours&#xD;
      post metformin dosing. Subjects will be discharged and allowed to go home the following&#xD;
      morning after the collection for the 24 hour blood and urine sample at approximately 8 AM.&#xD;
      All blood samples will be centrifuged, and the plasma separated immediately and stored at&#xD;
      -80oC until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine collection:Subjects will be asked to void their bladder prior to metformin&#xD;
      administration (baseline urine sample) and to drink 8 oz of water every 4 hours to maintain&#xD;
      urine flow and pH. Aliquots of urine will be collected for the following time frames: 0-2,&#xD;
      2-4, 4-8, 8-12, and 12-24 hours post metformin dosing. Additionally, aliquots from&#xD;
      collections taken between 0-12 and 0-24 hours will be pooled for analysis of creatinine.&#xD;
      Subjects will be advised to collect all urine produced during the inpatient visit. The volume&#xD;
      and pH of each urine collection will be recorded and an aliquot (20 mL) from each collection&#xD;
      period will be stored at -80Â°C for determination of urinary metformin and creatinine&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Study Visit Day 2:Co-administration of metformin with imatinib Subjects will&#xD;
      present to the CRC after an overnight fast as previously described. After the collection of&#xD;
      the baseline blood and urine samples, subjects will receive an oral dose of 600 mg imatinib&#xD;
      and 1000 mg of metformin with 8 oz of water followed by an oral dose of 850mg. The study&#xD;
      procedures described in &quot;Randomized Study Visit Day 1&quot; and &quot;Urine collection&quot; will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Restrictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires that healthy participants refrain from taking any medications (except for&#xD;
      daily vitamins or oral contraceptives) for the duration of the study, in particular&#xD;
      medication(s) that interfere with the pharmacokinetics of metformin or imatinib (See&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria 13.7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Study Restrictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to use adequate contraceptive means to avoid pregnancy throughout&#xD;
      the study. Subjects must remain within the CRC throughout the two 24 hour inpatient visits&#xD;
      unless accompanied by a CRC staff member. Subjects are to refrain from smoking and from&#xD;
      ingesting caffeine, alcohol, orange and grapefruit juice containing products from the night&#xD;
      before each inpatient study day until the study is complete, approximately 24 hours after&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Laboratory Determinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of metformin, creatinine, imatinib and CGP74588 in plasma and urine will be&#xD;
      preformed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (MS/MS) using assays previously described and validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology, Blood Chemistry and Urinalysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following standard biochemistry, blood chemistry and urinalysis will be performed at the&#xD;
      screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hematology, (Complete Blood Count with differential, CDP): WBC with differential, red&#xD;
           blood cells (RBC), RBC indices (HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC) and platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood chemistry (Metabolic Comprehensive Panel, METC): sodium, potassium, chloride,&#xD;
           carbon dioxide, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, calcium, bilirubin (total),&#xD;
           phosphate (total), AST, ALT, albumin and alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Urinalysis: urine protein (dipstick) and blood (dipstick).&#xD;
