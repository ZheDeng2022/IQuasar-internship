      This study will investigate the usefulness of an optical probe in the differentiation of&#xD;
      thyroid cancer from normal thyroid tissue in a thyroidectomy specimen. This is the next step&#xD;
      in the research that this team has conducted through our prior Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB)H-28135, in which the investigators successfully demonstrated that use of the optical&#xD;
      probe readings on thyroid specimens ex vivo could successfully discriminate benign from&#xD;
      malignant disease. The Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy (ESS) probe has also been IRB approved&#xD;
      and a clinical trial conducted in vivo at Boston University/Boston Medical Center by Dr.&#xD;
      Satish Singh and Dr. Irving Bigio. The investigators intend to now bring this project to the&#xD;
      clinical setting of thyroid disease. The optical real-time readings will be compared to the&#xD;
      histological analysis from the same area. Subjects already undergoing thyroid biopsy for&#xD;
      thyroid disease including thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer and thyroid goiter with nodules&#xD;
      will be eligible to participate. During the already scheduled thyroid procedure using a fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration biopsy needle, optical readings will be taken from the thyroid gland and&#xD;
      these same areas will then be analyzed in the usual standard fashion. The reading will then&#xD;
      be correlated with the histological results. In addition, if lymph nodes are biopsied as part&#xD;
      of the evaluation they will also be tested prior to histological standard processing. All&#xD;
      specimens and data will be de-identified once data collection and analysis is complete. Our&#xD;
      goal is to use optical real-time readings to improve the differential diagnosis of benign&#xD;
      from malignant thyroid nodules and avoid surgery for the purpose of diagnosis alone.&#xD;

      Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. The current gold&#xD;
      standard, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, yields approximately 10-25% of indeterminate&#xD;
      results, leading to patients undergoing thyroidectomy for diagnosis. Elastic scattering&#xD;
      spectroscopy (ESS) is a new, minimally invasive optical-biopsy technique, mediated by&#xD;
      fiber-optic probes, that which is sensitive to cellular and sub-cellular morphological&#xD;
      features. We assessed the potential to incorporate an ESS probe into a 23-gauge needle biopsy&#xD;
      to use in preoperative trans-cutaneous biopsy of the thyroid to differentiate benign from&#xD;
      malignant thyroid nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We designed and built a miniaturized ESS probe that can fit through a 23-gauge&#xD;
      biopsy needle and tested it under an IRB-approved protocol on 34 patients undergoing&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of thyroid nodules in the endocrine clinic. ESS data was&#xD;
      collected during the conduct of their biopsy using optical 5 repetitive readings from three&#xD;
      distinct locations within the thyroid nodule. Using cytology as our gold standard, spectral&#xD;
      analyses were compared between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. For indeterminate&#xD;
      cytology, final post-surgery pathology of the tissue was used for the comparison.&#xD;

    <description>The objective is to assess a device called an optical probe for the differentiation of thyroid cancer from normal thyroid tissue, benign thyroid nodules or parathyroid glands, and the detection of thyroid cancer within lymph nodes. The gold standard for diagnosis is ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule. Based on cytology from Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), 10% of nodules are cancer, 70% are benign (not cancer) and 20% are &quot;indeterminate.&quot; The proposed device aims to decrease the number of patients that undergo surgery for diagnosis.</description>
