      This pilot study will use tissues and fluids that are normally discarded during the course of&#xD;
      total knee replacement surgery to investigate potential sex differences in knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Basic clinical demographic information will be obtained as well as&#xD;
      preoperative functional and pain assessment scores, functional tests, and pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold measurement. The purpose of the study will be to investigate if any sex differences&#xD;
      can be identified in these tissues and to investigate if there appears to be any relationship&#xD;
      between these differences and functional scores and tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if sex differences can be identified in the knee joint&#xD;
      that can contribute to the differences in incidence and severity of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      observed in men and women, particularly over the age of 50. Recent studies assessing the&#xD;
      responses of articular chondrocytes to systemic factors suggest that there are underlying&#xD;
      differences in the biochemical and molecular characteristics of male and female cells. It is&#xD;
      also known that immune responses differ in males and females, suggesting that there may be&#xD;
      important differences in the levels of immune modulators in the joint tissues, including the&#xD;
      synovial membrane, the synovial fluid, and the cartilage itself. Responses to the vitamin D&#xD;
      metabolite 1_,25(OH)2D3 are upregulated in osteoarthritic cartilage, raising the possibility&#xD;
      that males and females differ in their circulating levels of vitamin D, in the content of&#xD;
      vitamin D metabolites in the synovial tissues, or in the ability of the cells to respond to&#xD;
      this steroid. Similarly, in post-menopausal women, circulating estrogen is reduced relative&#xD;
      to testosterone, but it is not known if this might impact the knee. Most importantly, it is&#xD;
      not known if potential sex differences can be correlated with severity of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on the hypothesis that sex differences exist in different tissues of the&#xD;
      knee joint, which contribute to the increased incidence and severity of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      in older women as compared to older men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use tissues and fluids that are normally&#xD;
      discarded during the course of total knee replacement surgery to investigate potential sex&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
