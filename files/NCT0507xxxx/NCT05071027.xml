  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Dual Antiplatelet Therapy adherence in patients&#xD;
      undergoing stent-based endovascular treatment for unruptured cervical and intradural,&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either a medication&#xD;
      reminder app group or a control group, with patients in both groups receiving the standard of&#xD;
      care. The app in question, Endovascular Neurosurgery, is available on the app store. The app&#xD;
      does not collect user data and has not been officially deemed HIPAA compliant. The only data&#xD;
      inputted into the app are the patient's procedure date and the antiplatelet medications the&#xD;
      patient has been prescribed. The app does not possess sensitive patient data. Patients will&#xD;
      input the time notifications will be sent and the app will be available in both Spanish and&#xD;
      English. The investigators will be assessing medication adherence via the Adherence Barriers&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized control trial, with patients undergoing stent-based endovascular&#xD;
      treatment for unruptured cervical and intradural, intracranial aneurysms. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from participating patients. Patients will be assigned to either the app&#xD;
      group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The particular stent-based therapy, either flow-diverter devices [FDD] placement or&#xD;
      stent-assisted coiling, will be chosen for each patient by the clinical team. During the&#xD;
      study consultation, the app group will have the app installed on their smart phones and will&#xD;
      be trained in its usage. Thromboelastography [TEG] and Aspirin inhibition percentage will be&#xD;
      determined for each patient following the procedure. Patients with TEG less than 60% will&#xD;
      have Dual Antiplatelet Therapy [DAPT] changed from 81 mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel to 81&#xD;
      mg aspirin and 10 mg prasugrel. Patients with aspirin inhibition percentages of less than 20%&#xD;
      will have their aspirin doses increased to 325 mg. Medication compliance of all participants&#xD;
      will be assessed on the day of the procedure via a medication compliance questionnaire. The&#xD;
      same questionnaire will be administered during follow-up appointments 2-4 weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Change in baseline medication adherence, from the day of the procedure to ultimately 6 months post-procedure, as assessed by a medication compliance score generated by the Adherence Barrier Questionnaire. This score ranges from 14 to 52 and a higher score indicates that a patient faces greater barriers to medication adherence.</description>
