  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective double-blind study in the United States is designed to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of a single dose of COVI-DROPS or matched placebo in outpatient adults&#xD;
      with mild symptoms associated with COVID-19 and a recent positive COVID-19 test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of COVI-DROPS (40 mg) or placebo in&#xD;
      a double-blind manner. Investigational product (COVI-DROP or placebo) will be administered&#xD;
      once on Study Day 1 and followed to Day 29. Subjects will be stratified based upon prior&#xD;
      history of infection or vaccination versus the group who is unvaccinated and not previously&#xD;
      infected with COVID-19.&#xD;

             planned treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have mild illness/symptoms based upon NIH criteria. The NIH illness severity&#xD;
             definition for &quot;mild&quot; states as follows: &quot;Individuals who have any of the various&#xD;

          -  Is an immunocompromised subject even if previously fully vaccinated against COVID-19&#xD;
             or recovered from a prior COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely impact&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has participated or is participating in a clinical research study evaluating COVID-19&#xD;
             convalescent plasma, other non-EUA-cleared mAbs against COVID-19 or intravenous&#xD;
             immunoglobulin within 3 months or less than 5 half-lives of the investigational&#xD;
             product (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit&#xD;
