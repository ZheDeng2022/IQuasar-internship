  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Randomized Control Trial will directly compare helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV)&#xD;
      combined with high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) versus HFNO alone in patients with Acute&#xD;
      Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot multicentre, concealed, stratified, permuted block randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial enrolling patients with AHRF who are admitted to the intensive care unit. Patients with&#xD;
      imminent need for intubation, or a contraindication to study interventions will be excluded.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive either (1) sessions of at least 12 hours per day of&#xD;
      helmet NIV oxygen interspersed with HFNO or (2) HFNO alone over at least 2 calendar days.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed to hospital discharge or 60 days, whichever occurs first, with&#xD;
      an additional quality of life assessment via telephone interview 6 months after enrolment.&#xD;

    <description>HNIV will be connected to a ventilator by a conventional closed respiratory circuit. Sessions of HNIV will be delivered with PEEP targeting a minimum 12 hours/day. PEEP will be titrated according to patient comfort, work of breathing, and O2 saturation. Pressure support will be titrated to lowest level tolerated. Between HNIV sessions, patients will be supported with HFNO at the same required FiO2. Starting on study day 3, patients will be screened for discontinuation of HNIV. Once HNIV is stopped, patients will be transitioned to HFNO and then weaned from HFNO as tolerated.</description>

    <description>HFNO will be provided. FiO2 will be titrated to achieve a target O2 saturation of 92-97%, and flows will be initiated at 50 litres/minute and titrated as per usual practice for comfort and oxygenation. Once the target O2 saturation is achieved, the FiO2 will be titrated to the minimal value to maintain this target saturation. HFNO will be provided continuously over a minimum of 2 calendar days. Starting on study day 3, patients will be weaned from HFNO as tolerated.</description>
