  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to reports of a severely reduced insulinotropic effect of the incretin hormone&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), GIP has not been&#xD;
      considered therapeutically viable in T2D. Recently, however, tirzepatide, a novel dual&#xD;
      incretin receptor agonist (activating both the GIP receptor and the glucagon-like peptide 1&#xD;
      (GLP-1) receptor) demonstrated massive improvements in glycaemic control and robust body&#xD;
      weight losses; greater than observed with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide. However,&#xD;
      the contribution of GIP receptor activation to these effects remains unknown. The present&#xD;
      study will evaluate the glucose-lowering effect of GIP in the context of pharmacological&#xD;
      GLP-1 receptor activation in patients with T2D.&#xD;
