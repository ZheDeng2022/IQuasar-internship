    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment represents the standard of local therapy in patients with early breast&#xD;
      cancer, however in women over75, the comorbidities related to aging reduce the possibility of&#xD;
      candidates for surgical treatment. In the United Kingdom it is estimated that over 40% of&#xD;
      elderly women do not receive surgery for their breast cancer, and that their primary&#xD;
      treatment is hormonal only, the so-called primary endocrinotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Italy the recent AIOM guidelines of 2019 exclude, in patients with hormone-sensitive&#xD;
      disease and age older than 70, the omission of surgery in favor of hormone therapy alone,&#xD;
      thus underlining the importance of a treatment local. However, there are currently no local&#xD;
      treatments that could in any way effectively control the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, SRT has widely found space as a therapeutic alternative in patients not fit&#xD;
      for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Radiotherapy is a non-invasive treatment with ablative intent obtained with&#xD;
      highly focused high intensity fields for a few fractions (generally 1-5). It is the standard&#xD;
      treatment for surgically inoperable lung cancers, and is also used in the treatment of liver&#xD;
      metastases, intermediate-risk prostate cancer and locally advanced pancreatic cancers. The&#xD;
      applications of stereotactic treatment in breast cancer are limited to the neoadjuvant and&#xD;
      adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this backgroung, in elderly patients with localized breast cancer candidates for&#xD;
      hormonal therapy and non-fit for surgery due to age or comorbidity, a SBRT could more&#xD;
      effectively control local disease, not excluding local treatment rather than in itself it is&#xD;
      considered very important.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in females; with population ageing, this&#xD;
      diagnosis may increase in 75 years old or older patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to AIRTUM data, 22% of new cases of breast cancer and 14% of death by breast cancer&#xD;
      are expected in women over 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is the gold standard of treatment for breast cancer, but advanced age and age-related&#xD;
      comorbidity could reduce the ability of a surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that over 40% of older women will not receive surgical&#xD;
      treatment for breast tumor, while endocrine therapy alone is frequently offered. This&#xD;
      treatment is known as primary endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our country, AIOM guidelines favor endocrine therapy alone in women over 70 with&#xD;
      ER-positive tumors instead of surgical resection, even emphasizing the importance of local&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among nonsurgical methods to treat breast cancer, radiofrequency ablation and focused&#xD;
      ultrasound have been investigated, but they are not widely available at present time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy has been used to treat patients with inoperable breast cancer, but most of&#xD;
      these treatments were palliative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited clinical data supporting the use of definitive conventionally fractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy and more specifically stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy in breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A collaborative study between the Gustave-Roussy Institute and the Princess Margaret Hospital&#xD;
      reviewed the use of radiotherapy alone as definitive breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had inoperable disease or who were unable to undergo general anesthesia received&#xD;
      definitive hypofractionated radiotherapy (40Gy in 16 fractions, 45Gy in 20 fractions, or 45Gy&#xD;
      in 18 fractions). This retrospective study demonstrated tumor dose as being a highly&#xD;
      significant factor for local control, with very low rates of disabling complications at 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Van Limbergen et al. also performed a retrospective analysis of 221 patients withTis-T3N0-1&#xD;
      breast cancer treated with radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of local recurrence was significantly associated with tumor size, age, radiation&#xD;
      dose, and length of radiation. They concluded that doses needed to provide local control&#xD;
      similar to a combination of surgery and radiation are 10 Gy higher for T1 tumors and 35Gy&#xD;
      higher for T2 tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, higher doses may result in worsened cosmetic outcomes. Van Limbergen et al&#xD;
      reviewed 161 patients, and those that received dose higher than 75Gy recorded very poor&#xD;
      cosmetic results in more than 30% of patients; if total dose was up to 80Gy only 15% of&#xD;
      patients reported good cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to remember that these papers are more than 25 years old, using older&#xD;
      radiotherapy techniques and larger treatment fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of modern radiation therapy techniques, and the adoption of Stereotactic&#xD;
      Body RadioTherapy (SBRT) tumoricidal doses are delivered without severe complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT is a non-invasive cancer treatment with ablative intent delivered with highly focused&#xD;
      and accurate radiation beams for few fraction (generally 3-5 fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many trials established the safety and efficacy of SBRT in multiple organ sites including the&#xD;
      lung, liver, spine, prostate and pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT is actually shared as standard treatment in inoperable lung tumors: Timmerman et al.&#xD;
      published one of the earlier extracranial SBRT trials on its use in early stage lung cancer,&#xD;
      demonstrating excellent local control rates and side effect outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT also offers a noninvasive alternative treatment for patients with liver metastases, who&#xD;
      are not candidates for surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stanford group initially established the safety of single fraction SBRT in 6 patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, subsequently a multi-institutional phase II study,&#xD;
      reported by Herman et al. demonstrated equivalent efficacy in 1-year local progression&#xD;
      freedom with acceptable toxicity profile in 49 patients with LAPC treated with 5 fractions&#xD;
      SBRT following gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scandinavian HYPO-RT-PC trial showed non-inferiority to conventionally fractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy for ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy for intermediate-to-high risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer regarding failure-free survival with similar late toxicity in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, SABR to primary tumor in breast cancer treatment has been mainly investigated in&#xD;
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Bondiau et al. conducted a Phase I study involving 25&#xD;
      patients to determine the maximum tolerable dose of SBRT concomitant with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy before surgery. Thirty-six percent of patients had a pathological complete&#xD;
      response, with the highest rate (67%) at dose level of 25.5 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions.&#xD;
      However, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached (highest dose level 31.5 in 3 consecutive&#xD;
      fractions) as the group found that early SABR related toxicities were rare. Also in other&#xD;
      studies toxicity was limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first SBRT studies in the management of early stage breast cancer were post-operative&#xD;
      studies. SBRT was used either as a boost, or for accelerated partial breast radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Age was not an exclusion criterion, but mean ages were under 65 years. The&#xD;
      proportion of patients aged &gt;65 years were not given. SBRT has not yet been studied&#xD;
      specifically in elderly patients who paradoxically most often have tumors with better&#xD;
      histoprognostic factors than younger women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead, SBRT role as a definitive ablative therapy in breast cancer is less considered and&#xD;
      there are no prospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in elderly patients (over 75y) eligible for hormone therapy only and unsuitable&#xD;
      for surgery, SBRT could improve locoregional control by means of a short and highly effective&#xD;
      treatment without any interruption of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim of this trial is to evaluate dose limiting toxicity for SBRT in elderly patients&#xD;
      elected to receive hormone therapy only for breast cancer.&#xD;
