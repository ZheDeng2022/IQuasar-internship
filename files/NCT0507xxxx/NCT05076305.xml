  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancers is highly individualized to&#xD;
      each patient and their pattern of disease, and this decision is often made at the&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meeting . The PelvEx collaborative was designed with the intent&#xD;
      to provide greater international consensus on appropriate treatment decisions for this&#xD;
      cohort. However, we propose that international variation exists in how certain patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated, assessed and ultimately treated despite having the same disease. We plan to&#xD;
      measure this variation in order to provide a greater understanding of the differences that&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PelvEx collaborative is an international research collaborative that was designed with&#xD;
      the aim of collating data on patients undergoing pelvic exenteration from all corners of the&#xD;
      globe. These extensive procedures, despite their associated morbidity, have revolutionised&#xD;
      the approach to advanced pelvic malignancy and provide hope to patients whose cancers would&#xD;
      have once been deemed inoperable. Despite the increasing frequency with which surgeons are&#xD;
      performing these more radical resections (1), relatively few of these procedures are carried&#xD;
      out when compared with more traditional surgical operations. Furthermore, this cohort of&#xD;
      patients and the wide-ranging procedures which they undergo represent a heterogenous group.&#xD;
      These factors combine to make it more difficult for academic surgeons to draw meaningful&#xD;
      conclusions from their study, and further illustrate the need for prospective international&#xD;
      collaboration in order to inform appropriate treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the great demand for international collaboration, it is vital that there is&#xD;
      an appreciation of the variation in the approach to managing these complex cases between&#xD;
      hospitals, countries and continents. While surgeons would like to believe that in any case&#xD;
      where their local multi-disciplinary team meeting has made an informed treatment decision&#xD;
      that it is the single most appropriate option, geographic variation in beliefs, attitudes,&#xD;
      terminology and patient preferences may influence those decisions at an individual level.&#xD;
      Nowhere is this more relevant than in the approach to advanced pelvic malignancy. One study&#xD;
      analysing regional variation in the management of locally advanced and recurrent rectal&#xD;
      cancer noted a significantly lower rate of pelvic exenteration in France when compared with&#xD;
      Australia, despite intercountry blinding of radiological findings (2). These differences are&#xD;
      influenced by a host of psychosocial factors that are as yet to be fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present analysis is to provide further insight in to the geographical&#xD;
      variation that exists in the assessment of the patients who are potential candidates for a&#xD;
      pelvic exenteration in the hope that it will improve our understanding of these differences&#xD;
      and increase the validity of the conclusions that can be drawn from our research on a&#xD;
      prospective collaborative basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed by having &quot;real-world&quot; cases selected by our participating centres,&#xD;
      anonymising the case and radiological information necessary and by presenting these cases&#xD;
      over a series of weeks at MDT meetings all over the world. The data will then be analysed to&#xD;
      assess the differences in the ways that certain groups/countries approach the management of&#xD;
      these complex and highly varied cases.&#xD;
