  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical performance of UV1&#xD;
      vaccination as add on to standard pembrolizumab treatment in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic PD-L1 positive (CPS &gt;=1) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the efficacy in terms of overall survival ,objective response&#xD;
      rate and duration of response. Moreover, this study will explore patient subgroups most&#xD;
      likely deriving benefit from a targeted immunotherapy approach combining a checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor with a cancer vaccine and help to establish liquid biopsy tumor monitoring in&#xD;
      HNSCC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall survival of patients with metastatic or recurrent HNSCC has improved over the past&#xD;
      decade but remains poor overall. Median overall survival is limited to less than 15 months,&#xD;
      with the current standard of care (immune checkpoint blockade with or without chemotherapy).&#xD;
      Many patients with HNSCC are frail and therefore cannot tolerate chemotherapy, reducing their&#xD;
      treatment options to checkpoint inhibitor. Therefore, the development of effective and&#xD;
      tolerable combination regimens is urgently needed, especially in first-line therapy. The&#xD;
      FOCUS study will evaluate such a combination regimen in patients with metastatic or recurrent&#xD;
      HNSCC. The experimental regimen evaluated in this study will test the first-line standard&#xD;
      drug pembrolizumab in combination with the novel UV1 cancer vaccine. In the comparator arm,&#xD;
      patients receive pembrolizumab as the standard of care. The aim is to assess whether the&#xD;
      addition of UVI can increase the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor. Based on currently&#xD;
      available data, a decrease in efficacy due to the combination of standard first-line therapy&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab is unlikely. The FOCUS study could therefore establish a new 1st-line&#xD;
      regimen with increased efficacy and acceptable tolerability, which would need to be compared&#xD;
      with the standard of care in a larger phase III trial. Based on the biomarker data from the&#xD;
      FOCUS study, a subsequent Phase 3 study would potentially test the regimen only in&#xD;
      subpopulations with increased response probability. From the perspective of the individual&#xD;
      patient, participants may benefit from the experimental combination through improved&#xD;
      efficacy. On the other hand, this is a novel combination study for HNSCC, and there is a risk&#xD;
      that efficacy may not improve.&#xD;
