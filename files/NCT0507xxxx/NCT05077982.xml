      An observational cohort study of patients discharged from the ICU following admission with&#xD;
      COVID19 infection, looking at their medical wellbeing 6 months after discharge from the ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 epidemic has placed an unprecedented strain on medical services worldwide.&#xD;
      Throughout 2020 and early 2021, hospitals and their critical care services have been&#xD;
      inundated with patients suffering from critical illness due to COVID-19, some of whom&#xD;
      developed multi-organ failure and required a prolonged ICU stay. While the medical literature&#xD;
      is now replete with publications and research on the acute phase of illness due to COVID-19,&#xD;
      including critical illness, there is a paucity of studies detailing the long-term outcomes&#xD;
      following COVID-19 critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the negative long-term physical health, mental health and quality-of-life related&#xD;
      effects of ARDS have been well documented, there has been very little long-term COVID-19 ARDS&#xD;
      specific outcome studies published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational cohort study that aims to assess the long-term health outcomes of&#xD;
      adult patients admitted to Mater Dei Hospital Intensive Care Unit with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
      Patients will initially be assessed at 6 months after discharge from ITU. They will be&#xD;
      interviewed by trained researchers using validated questionnaires. These questionnaires will&#xD;
      assess their physical health, mental health and functional status. Participants will be&#xD;
      examined and asked to do a 6minute walk test also using validated non-invasive physical&#xD;
      assessment tools. They will be offered pulmonary function tests to be carried out at the&#xD;
      Pulmonary function laboratory.&#xD;
