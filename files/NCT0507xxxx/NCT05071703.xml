  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, real-world study in Chinese patients with extensive stage small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Trilaciclib's protection against&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression, the safety and the impact on the antitumor&#xD;
      effects of the combination with chemotherapy in Chinese patients with ES-SCLC in the real&#xD;
      world. Patients with ES-SCLC who already use or plan to use Trilaciclib will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Data were collected from 28 days prior to initial chemotherapy&#xD;
      (platinum/etoposide or topotecan systemic chemotherapy) after patients signed informed&#xD;
      consent until patients died, dropped out of the study, lost to follow-up, informed&#xD;
      withdrawal, or study termination. The end time of the study was defined as withdrawal of&#xD;
      information, loss of follow-up or death of all enrolled patients, or 12 months after the last&#xD;
      patient was enrolled, whichever happened earlier.&#xD;
