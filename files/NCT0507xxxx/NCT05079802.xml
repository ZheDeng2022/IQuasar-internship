      Clinical and Radiographic Evaluation of Lesion Sterilization and Tissue Repair in Non-vital&#xD;
      Primary Molars Using Double Antibiotic Paste with Two Different Vehicles (Randomized Clinical&#xD;
      Trial and In Vitro Study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy primary teeth are important for speech, mastication and to maintain the space for&#xD;
      their permanent successors developing in the jaw underneath. Teeth with infected root canals,&#xD;
      particularly those in which the infection has reached the peri-radicular tissues, are a&#xD;
      common problem in the primary dentition. A relatively new biologic approach, lesion&#xD;
      sterilization and tissue repair therapy (LSTR) was introduced. It was modified from 3 mix&#xD;
      1:1:1 metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and minocycline to double mix where 1:1 metronidazole and&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin are mixed with propylene glycol. It is indicated for primary teeth with&#xD;
      significant root resorption (external resorption greater than 1 mm and/ or internal&#xD;
      resorption) needing non-vital pulp therapy. It is also indicated when the clinician decides&#xD;
      not to extract the tooth with significant preoperative root resorption, LSTR should be the&#xD;
      choice over pulpectomy to save such teeth for up to 12 months. Chitosan it is a natural&#xD;
      nontoxic, biocompatible, biodegradable polysaccharide with broad antibacterial spectrum&#xD;
      (covering gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as fungi), and it has antioxidant&#xD;
      and antitumor properties, also it has the ability to form Ô¨Ålm and gel. Chitosan and chitosan&#xD;
      nanoparticle can be used as a vehicle for incorporating natural or chemical antimicrobial&#xD;
      agents, however, chitosan nanoparticles exhibit a higher antimicrobial activity than&#xD;
      chitosan. Also, chitosan nanoparticles have better absorption and penetration into dentinal&#xD;
      tubules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of using double antibiotic paste&#xD;
           mixed with chitosan nanoparticles gel vs. double antibiotic paste mixed with propylene&#xD;
           glycol in lesion sterilization and tissue repair in non-vital primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Both materials will be compared in terms of ease of handling, time to perform procedure&#xD;
           and convenience of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparing the antibacterial effect of double antibiotic paste mixed with chitosan&#xD;
           nanoparticles gel vs. that mixed with propylene glycol in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In Vitro Microbiological Study Before the initiation of the clinical trial, an in vitro&#xD;
           study will be carried out. A pilot study to assess the antimicrobial effect of double&#xD;
           antibiotic paste mixed with a vehicle of chitosan nanoparticles gel of 2 different&#xD;
           concentrations (0.3% and 0.5%) in order to determine which is the better concentration&#xD;
           to be used in the lesion sterilization and tissue repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A microbiological study will be carried out to compare the antimicrobial effect of&#xD;
           double antibiotic paste mixed with the better concentration of chitosan nanoparticles&#xD;
           gel according to the pilot study and double antibiotic paste mixed with propylene&#xD;
           glycol. Sample size n=14, each group n=7.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A swab will be taken from non-vital primary molars with a paper point and it will be&#xD;
           inserted in a suitable transporting medium and cultivated in a suitable medium and&#xD;
           different bacterial strains will be identified. The strains will then be isolated and&#xD;
           cultivated in suitable media. Materials under investigation will be added to identify&#xD;
           the inhibition zones diameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In Vivo Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation ratio to either study group (group 1) or&#xD;
      control group (group 2). Participants will be medically free children, in the age group 4-7&#xD;
      years, having non-vital primary molars with root resorption more than 1 mm that needs to be&#xD;
      retained a tooth for up to 12 months that otherwise would be extracted. Sample size: n=36&#xD;
      molars, (group1) n=18 molars where LSTR will be performed with double antibiotic paste mixed&#xD;
      with chitosan nanoparticles gel and (group 2) n=18 molars here LSTR will be performed with&#xD;
      double antibiotic paste mixed with propylene glycol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries will be removed with a sterile large round high-speed then pulpotomy will be performed&#xD;
      and coronal pulp tissue will be removed using a sterile small sharp excavator, followed by&#xD;
      irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Dryness will be done then double antibiotic will be&#xD;
      mixed with chitosan nanoparticles gel until a creamy mix is formed then the mix will be&#xD;
      placed in the pulp chamber for (group 1), while double antibiotic will be mixed with&#xD;
      propylene glycol until a creamy mix is formed, then the mix will be placed in the pulp&#xD;
      chamber for the (group 2). The glass ionomer will be injected to fill the pulp chamber and&#xD;
      finally the tooth will be restored with a stainless-steel crown. Follow up will be for one&#xD;
      year with recall visits at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcome: Reduction/absence of pain, no abnormal mobility/ swelling or abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic outcomes: Decrease or resolution in interradicular radiolucency and&#xD;
      decrease/absence of internal resorption.&#xD;
