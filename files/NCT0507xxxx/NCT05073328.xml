  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, 3.5 million people have been infected with SARS-COV2 in France, and about&#xD;
      250 000 patients have been hospitalized and successfully discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a majority of cases, the evolution of the disease is favourable, but both hospitalized or&#xD;
      patients with a mild form of the disease may present so called &quot;Long-COVID&quot; syndrome - a&#xD;
      patient-created term which describes the effects of COVID-19 that continue for weeks or&#xD;
      months beyond the initial symptoms. There is thus an urgent need to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      medical resource utilisation (MRU) and health care burden incurred by patients with&#xD;
      Long-COVID, as well as risk factors for Long-COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the SNDS database to extract and analyze the data relevant to the project&#xD;
      objectives. Indeed, the SNDS database is the French NHS database providing individual&#xD;
      anonymous information of primary and secondary care linked at individual level (data from&#xD;
      PMSI, the French DRG-based medical information system). It currently covers more than 98% of&#xD;
      the French population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first time, our study will provide an estimation of MRU and associated costs of&#xD;
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It will also provide an estimation of the rate of long COVID&#xD;
      forms developed by hospitalized COVID patients, as well as detailed MRU and costs incurred by&#xD;
      long COVID patients compared to patients with non-long COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, 3.5 million people have been infected with SARS-COV2 in France, and about&#xD;
      250 000 patients have been hospitalized and successfully discharged . Currently, the French&#xD;
      epidemiological situation shows a stable and high level of new cases of COVID-19 (around 20&#xD;
      000 per day) and associated hospitalizations (around 9 000 per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID19 may present mild or severe forms, the latter possibly requiring conventional (20%) or&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (5%). In most cases, the evolution of the disease&#xD;
      is favorable, but both hospitalized or patients with a mild form of the disease may present&#xD;
      so called &quot;Long-COVID&quot; syndrome - a patient-created term which describes the effects of&#xD;
      COVID-19 that continue for weeks or months beyond the initial symptoms. Persistent symptoms&#xD;
      have been described in 5 to 36% of the patients, i.e. symptoms persisting for 4 weeks or more&#xD;
      after the onset of the disease. There is growing evidence of the post-COVID-19 chronic&#xD;
      syndrome as a postinfectious entity, including but not limited to a range of symptoms ranging&#xD;
      from cough and shortness of breath, to fatigue, headache, palpitations, chest pain, joint&#xD;
      pain, physical limitations, depression, and insomnia, persisting for longer than two months.&#xD;
      This post-COVID chronic syndrome is often called &quot;long COVID&quot;. As it is more and more&#xD;
      described since the start of the pandemic, the French national health agency (Haute Autorité&#xD;
      de Santé, HAS) has recently published specific recommendations for the management of patients&#xD;
      presenting long COVID forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the evidence is still scarce, patients who have been hospitalized for COVID19 may be&#xD;
      at higher risk of presenting long COVID. Consequently, they may require more healthcare&#xD;
      resource use. As they are easy to identify through administrative databases, we propose to&#xD;
      focus on hospitalized and discharged COVID-19 patients with persisting symptoms, in order to&#xD;
      investigate their healthcare resource use and corresponding costs, and to compared them to&#xD;
      patients not presenting the long COVID form of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess &quot;long-COVID&quot; patients' health care burden (costs) and resource use and to&#xD;
           compare them to COVID patients not developing the long form of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify predictive variables for the development of &quot;long-COVID&quot;,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate whether different patterns of long-COVID healthcare consumption may be&#xD;
           identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed using the Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS) French&#xD;
      medico-administrative database.&#xD;
