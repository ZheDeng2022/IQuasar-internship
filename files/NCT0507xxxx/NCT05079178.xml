  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known about the impact on the newborn of late pre-partum maternal SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care without separation of the mother and her newborn with continued breastfeeding has been&#xD;
      advocated in France and by the WHO but is being debated in some countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the development of newborns in their first month of life with this strategy&#xD;
      associated with close and secure follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of reporting the potential benefits / risks of this treatment to guide the care of&#xD;
      newborns in a persistent epidemic context in a particularly affected region.&#xD;
