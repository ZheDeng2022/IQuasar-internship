    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to quantitatively assess the presence of gene&#xD;
      mutations in subject's skin collected non-invasively. Subjects who consult with a&#xD;
      dermatologist or other clinicians will be approached for participation in the study. Once IRB&#xD;
      approved informed consent is obtain, subject demographic information, history of sun exposure&#xD;
      and samples will be collected.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to quantitatively assess the presence of gene&#xD;
      mutations in subject's skin collected non-invasively. Subjects who consult with a&#xD;
      dermatologist or other clinicians will be approached for participation in the study. Once&#xD;
      confirmation of participation is confirmed subjects will undergo the informed consent&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented the subject will have their medical history reviewed, concomitant medications&#xD;
      and demographic information recorded, complete a sun-exposure questionnaire, have photoaging&#xD;
      characteristics (such as melasma, wrinkles, AK lesion(s)) recorded, record their assessment&#xD;
      of photoaging, have skin samples collected non-invasively and complete the local skin&#xD;
      reaction and local tolerability assessments. A select number of subjects will also have a&#xD;
      facial photograph taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the location to be sampled contains a lesion, then the collection should occur as close as&#xD;
      possible to the target area. The site staff and/or subject will be responsible for collecting&#xD;
      the skin samples.&#xD;

        Up to approximately 5,000 adults presenting to clinics for consultations will be enrolled&#xD;
        into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be enrolled across a wide range of demographics and age ranges. A minimum of&#xD;
        3000 subjects of Fitzpatrick Skin Type I-III skin types (Group 1) and 1000 subjects of&#xD;
        Fitzpatrick IV-VI (Group 2) will be enrolled. This will include, but is not limited to&#xD;
        races such as Caucasian, African American, and subjects of Asian descent. At least 100&#xD;
        subjects per Fitzpatrick Skin Type group will be from the following age ranges; 21-30,&#xD;
        31-40, 41-50, 51-60 and &gt;61 will be enrolled.&#xD;
