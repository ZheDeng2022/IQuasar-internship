  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to understand if hospital-based violence interventions are effective&#xD;
      for reducing youth violence among violently injured youth. This study will allow researchers&#xD;
      to learn more about the intervention's effectiveness. The researchers also want to understand&#xD;
      if the violence intervention impacts other behaviors, such as firearm use, drug use,&#xD;
      aggression, risky behaviors, and rates of violent re-injury.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a hospital-based violence intervention&#xD;
      (Bridging the Gap) is effective for reducing youth violence. Researchers think that youth who&#xD;
      receive the Bridging the Gap will see greater improvements than youth who do not receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Approximately 300 youth patients and 300 adult caregivers will enroll in this&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomized into a study group (either Bridging the Gap or&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual). If patients agree to the study but do not like the group they are&#xD;
      assigned to, they can request to switch groups. Participants assigned to the Treatment as&#xD;
      Usual intervention will receive a brief violence awareness brochure during their hospital&#xD;
      stay. Participants assigned to the Bridging the Gap intervention will receive an in-hospital&#xD;
      intervention and, once released from the hospital, will receive 3-months of community case&#xD;
      management services with their families. The study team thinks that youth who receive the&#xD;
      Bridging the Gap intervention will see greater improvements than youth who do not receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Participation in this study will last up to 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Bridging the Gap: Bridging the Gap is a hybrid model for violence prevention which integrates a hospital-based brief violence intervention (BVI) delivered to the patient while in hospital with a wrap-around community case management prevention strategy.&#xD;
Firearm Counseling Program: The firearm counseling program was developed to be administered in the hospital alongside the 6-step intervention program, as well as in the patient's home after hospital discharge. The firearm safety counseling program includes 3 components aimed at understanding patient risk, reducing firearm-related violence risk-factors, and helping patients increase firearm safety practices.</description>
