  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the degree to which sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB)&#xD;
      warning labels increase consumers' knowledge about the potential health harms of SSBs and&#xD;
      reduce SSB purchases and consumption. 216 racially and ethnically diverse parents of children&#xD;
      6-11 years old will be recruited to buy snacks and beverages for four weeks via an online&#xD;
      store that ships participants their purchases. Participants will be randomized to either 1)&#xD;
      calorie labels (control); or 2) sugar graphic warning labels. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that sugar graphic warning labels displayed in an online store in weeks 2-4 will lead to the&#xD;
      greatest reductions from week 1 across both primary outcomes compared to the control group&#xD;
      that will only see calorie labels.&#xD;

      During this study, participants will shop in an online store created using Shopify for four&#xD;
      weeks. In this within-participant design, the first week of shopping is baseline.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized to different store interfaces for the remaining three&#xD;
      weeks based on one of two warning label conditions: 1) calorie labels (control); or 2) sugar&#xD;
      graphic warning labels. Participants will complete a brief survey at the start of the study&#xD;
      to assess demographic information, information about parent and child beverage consumption,&#xD;
      and their online shopping experiences. At the end they will complete another survey about&#xD;
      their beverage consumption, their experience shopping in the store, whether they noticed and&#xD;
      used the warning labels, and their ability to recall the warning label message. Participants&#xD;
      will also be asked about their perceptions of a specific type of warning label in this final&#xD;
      survey. Upon completion of the survey, participants will be shown a debriefing statement&#xD;
      explaining the study purpose. After they read the information, they will be asked whether or&#xD;
      not they consent to allow their data to be used in this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized, controlled online study will capture beverage and snack purchases from an online store. These products will be mailed to participants for each of the 4 shopping weeks. Participants' consumption will be measured at the beginning and end of the study. As this is a within-participant study, consumption for each arm will be compared to baseline for that participant (Week 1 shopping).</intervention_model_description>
