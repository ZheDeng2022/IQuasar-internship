  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This panel study aims to evaluate the effects of air pollutants on cardiopulmonary health of&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and explore the potential&#xD;
      biological mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This panel study was conducted in a group of stable patients with COPD in Beijing, China. The&#xD;
      health measurements including lung function, blood pressure and airway inflammation were&#xD;
      conducted, and morning urine, exhaled breath condensate, saliva and venous blood were&#xD;
      collected at the time of enrollment and at 3, 6 and 9 months after enrollment. Individual&#xD;
      exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), ozone (O3) and nitrogen&#xD;
      dioxide (NO2) were performed for 24 hours at each follow-up. And the daily concentrations of&#xD;
      air pollutants were collected from the Beijing Air Quality Real-time Publishing Platform and&#xD;
      meteorological data were collected from the National Meteorological Information Center. The&#xD;
      linear mixed effects model was used to analyze the association between air pollution and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary health in patients with COPD.&#xD;
