      The aim of the study is to evaluate the adverse events and the efficacy of virus specific T&#xD;
      lymphocytes selected in vitro from a family donor to treat some refractory viral infections&#xD;
      as Adenovirus (ADV), Ebstein Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) that developed in young&#xD;
      patients (age between 0 and 21 years) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&#xD;
      (allo-HSCT) performed at the Transplant Clinical Unit of the IRCCS G. Gaslini Institute&#xD;
      (IGG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the study is based on the evidence that, despite the progress obtained in&#xD;
      the management and prevention of viral infections in the patients who received allo-HSCT,&#xD;
      some viral infections continue to be severe complications that may occurred before the immune&#xD;
      recovery. Some of these viral reactivations are not responsive to the first or second line&#xD;
      treatment and their treatment may be represent an important issue. The adoptive cellular&#xD;
      immunotherapy based on the infusion of virus-specific T lymphocytes represent a valid&#xD;
      therapeutic option and the quick access to this cellular therapy is crucial to prevent severe&#xD;
      organ complications related to viral infection. In this study, the use of virus-specific T&#xD;
      lymphocytes obtained from a seropositive family donor, briefly activated in vitro and&#xD;
      immunomagnetically captured by their capacity to secrete IFN-gamma allows to obtain a rapidly&#xD;
      usable T-lymphocyte population (both CD4+ and CD8+) potentially able to expand into the&#xD;
      patient. The effectiveness, safety (peptides used are synthetic, no animal components, closed&#xD;
      system production), good tolerance and speed of modality (less than 36 hours for production)&#xD;
      is reported by many clinical studies.&#xD;

    <description>The product is obtained by leukapheresis of a family donor responsive to the virus: consists of virus- specific T lymphocytes (both CD4+ and CD8+) resuspended in PBS / EDTA buffer plus 0.5% Albumin Human. The productive process lasts two consecutive days and includes two phases: a brief activation with specific viral peptide followed by immunomagnetic separation using the CliniMACS® CCS (IFNγ) capture system which allows a fast and automated separation of IFNγ secreting lymphocytes</description>
