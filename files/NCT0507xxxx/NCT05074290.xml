  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer are commonly treated with taxane chemotherapy. Some very common&#xD;
      side effects of taxanes, such as anemia and peripheral neuropathy, are often as not well&#xD;
      addressed during treatment, resulting in dose reductions, dose delays and early&#xD;
      discontinuation (collectively called relative dose intensity) of these chemotherapy agents in&#xD;
      15-80 % of patients on these drugs. This reduction in relative dose intensity (RDI) results&#xD;
      in worse clinical outcomes such as progression free and overall survival. Pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies in mouse models subjected to standardized chemotherapy regimens containing paclitaxel&#xD;
      or oxaliplatin have shown that the nutritional supplement Epidiferphane™ reduces both&#xD;
      neuropathy and anemia. This study will investigate whether the use of Epidiferphane™ in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer receiving taxane chemotherapy results in an attenuation of the&#xD;
      side effects experienced, as well as an improvement in tumor response rate. The safety and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of Epidiferphane™ in this patient population will also be determined&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

    <description>During the phase I portion of the study, subjects will be assigned to take either two (half target dose) or four (full target dose) Epidiferphane tablets orally three times daily following a 3 + 3 design. Three subjects will be sequentially enrolled at each of the 2 dose levels (beginning with the half target dose) until at least one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs. Dosing escalation will be stopped if two or more DLTs occur at either dose level. The maximum tolerated dose will be one dose level lower than the dose level at which 2 or more DLTs occur. Dose escalation will occur separately for each of the two taxane regimens (weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel every 3 weeks).&#xD;
All subjects in the phase II portion of the study will receive the maximum tolerated dose determined in the phase I portion of the study for their taxane regimen.&#xD;
Subjects in both portions of the study will receive treatment with Epidiferphane for a maximum of three months.</description>
