  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial hyperglycemia or rapid rise in blood glucose is defined as a blood glucose&#xD;
      level&gt;7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) 1- 2 hours after consumption of food. It is associated to the&#xD;
      development of diabetes among healthy individuals and a risk factor for the onset and&#xD;
      progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications among diabetic patients. In&#xD;
      Ramadan, postprandial hyperglycemia is often observed after the iftar (fasting break after&#xD;
      sunset). The frequency of eating normally decreases during Ramadan, however, the energy&#xD;
      intake remains questionable because dietary practices during Ramadan are influenced by local&#xD;
      culture, economic status and individual dietary behaviors. In many Muslim societies including&#xD;
      Malaysia, Ramadan has known as a month of feasting. Iftar meals are typically high calorie,&#xD;
      carbohydrate-rich and usually sweet food resulting in rapid rise in glucose after the meal.&#xD;
      This poses a challenge for the people with diabetes to manage their glucose level. D-allulose&#xD;
      (a C-3 epimer of D-fructose) is a rare sugar and reported to have several health benefits,&#xD;
      such as suppressing a rise in postprandial glucose levels. There is still a scarcity of&#xD;
      research on patients with diabetes. As a result, the current clinical study sought to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of supplemental D-allulose on participants with type 2 diabetes who&#xD;
      consume real-meal calories during Ramadan iftar.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      D-allulose (a C-3 epimer of D-fructose) is one of the rare sugar types with zero calories,&#xD;
      has 70 % sweetness as sucrose, and occur in a small quantities in nature. Extensive basic and&#xD;
      clinical studies have reported beneficial outcomes to human health, includes improve&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, reduced postprandial hyperglycemia, hypolipidemia, and antioxidant. D-allulose&#xD;
      can be taken up to 0.5 g/kg daily will no side-effect on the human body. The U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) has declared that D-allulose is Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS)&#xD;
      for use as a food ingredient and with other sweeteners. Previous clinical studies on&#xD;
      D-allulose had shown an effective glucose suppressive effect after the meal, mostly in&#xD;
      healthy individuals and pre-diabetics. There is still a scarcity of research on patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. As a result, the current clinical study sought to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      supplemental D-allulose on participants with type 2 diabetes who consume real-meal calories&#xD;
      during Ramadan iftar (breaking fast at sunset). This was a non-randomized intervention study,&#xD;
      which involved a single-arm group, and conducted during Muslim fasting month (Ramadan)&#xD;
      between 13 April to 12 May 2021. The protocol required continuous 14 days of Ramadan and it&#xD;
      was divided into two consecutive periods; began with first 7-day of control period and&#xD;
      followed with a consecutive 7-day of D-allulose period. At the D-allulose period, 8.5g of&#xD;
      D-allulose was consumed before the iftar meal. The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitory&#xD;
      system (CFGM) was used to measure the glucose values.&#xD;
