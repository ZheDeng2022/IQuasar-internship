  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer includes endocrine&#xD;
      monotherapy or combination regimens, both with benefit diminishing as resistance develops.&#xD;
      Nowadays, various studies have demonstrated that estrogen interacts with many angiogenic&#xD;
      pathways and is an important mechanism for resistance leading to the question of whether&#xD;
      combination with antiangiogenesis and antiestrogen therapies could be an appropriate&#xD;
      therapeutic modality. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that&#xD;
      effectively inhibit VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, c-KIT, c-MET and RET. Previous studies have proven&#xD;
      the efficacy of both anlotinib monotherapy and combination regimens in advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer. This phase II study aims to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      anlotinib combined with endocrine therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, phase II clinical trial. The secondary&#xD;
      endocrine-resistant is defined as disease relapse within 12 months after at least 24 months&#xD;
      endocrine adjuvant therapy, or disease progress after at least 6 months endocrine salvage&#xD;
      therapy. Eligible patients were treated with oral anlotinib plus intramuscular fulvestrant&#xD;
      till disease progression or intolerant toxicity. In the part of statistical analysis, 40&#xD;
      patients are required to have a 80% power to detect significant improvement in median&#xD;
      progression-free survival from 5.8 (fulvestrant alone) to 10 (fulvestrant combined with&#xD;
      anlotinib) months, if tested at a two-sided significance level of α=0.05.&#xD;
