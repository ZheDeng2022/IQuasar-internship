      Type: prospective observational multicenter trial. Population of interest: adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : laparoscopic lavage during laparoscopic appendectomy is a practice that should&#xD;
      be used in selected patients according to the intraperitoneal grade of contamination and&#xD;
      grade of appendicitis. Nonregulated use of laparoscopic lavage cannot be considered superior&#xD;
      to suction only considering recent evidence. Few RCT available addressing this issue are&#xD;
      available, but any with a high methodological quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of laparoscopic lavage during&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendectomy on the postoperative incidence of intrabdominal abscesses,&#xD;
      stratifying patients in different clusters according to a defined classification considering&#xD;
      the intraperitoneal contamination and grade of appendicitis.&#xD;

      Introduction: Laparoscopic appendectomy has progressively gained acceptance as the standard&#xD;
      of care for acute appendicitis. Focusing on the incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal&#xD;
      abscess after a laparoscopic appendectomy, discordant data have been reported ranging from&#xD;
      1.5 to 20%. Besides, evidence advocating advantages from peritoneal irrigation over suction&#xD;
      only are lacking. Most studies are burdened by a high level of heterogeneity regarding the&#xD;
      severity of the appendicitis and modalities of peritoneal irrigation. One of the main&#xD;
      drawbacks is the lack of an accepted classification for different degrees of appendicitis and&#xD;
      peritoneal contamination. The aim of the study is to introduce a classification to clarify&#xD;
      the relationship between grade of appendicitis, contamination, and postoperative incidence of&#xD;
      IAA considering the surgeon's attitude toward irrigation or suction alone. Preoperative,&#xD;
      intra-operative, and postoperative predictive factors for infectious complication will also&#xD;
      be assessed. This study is meant to be the first Italian multicenter resident-based&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The driving hypothesis of the investigators study is that there should exist a&#xD;
      relationship between different intra-operative treatment protocols (irrigation vs suction&#xD;
      alone) and postoperative incidence of IAA. Furthermore, considering various grades of&#xD;
      appendicitis and peritoneal contamination, the use of irrigation vs suction alone could lead&#xD;
      to different rates of postoperative IAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to introduce and evaluate a classification for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis taking into account the peritoneal contamination to delineate the relationship&#xD;
      between grade of appendicitis and postoperative incidence of IAA considering the surgeon's&#xD;
      attitude toward irrigation or suction alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship among each severity grade of acute appendicitis and postoperative incidence of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal abscesses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of intraperitoneal irrigation or suction alone on the incidence of IAA for each&#xD;
      severity grade&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      See the dedicated section for eligibility criterion. Participants will fill an online form&#xD;
      reporting all clinical and intra-operative data of each patient who will undergo a&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendectomy. All personal information of patients will be removed according to&#xD;
      data anonymization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be reported in accordance with Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies&#xD;
      in Epidemiology guidelines (STROBE) for observational studies [22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents from each involved center will be responsible for data collection. All forms will&#xD;
      be collected in an electronic database by the coordinating residents who will check for data&#xD;
      completeness. All residents taking part in the study will be asked to enter eventual missing&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of IAA after laparoscopic appendectomy reported in the literature ranges from&#xD;
      1.5 to 20% [4, 5, 9,10,11]. Such a wide interval is not negligible when calculating the&#xD;
      sample size (n) of the study cohort. Furthermore, some important basic considerations need to&#xD;
      be taken into account: appendicitis is the most common acute surgical disease so the baseline&#xD;
      population is large and cannot be exactly estimated; the incidence of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      abscesses has never been systematically investigated in regard to the severity of&#xD;
      appendicitis and contamination. All patients included in the study will be classified into&#xD;
      different clusters considering the grade of appendicitis and contamination, lavage vs suction&#xD;
      alone, and postoperative incidence of IAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all these aspects, sample size for power calculation can be reasonably estimated&#xD;
      given a 95% confidence interval with a z-score of 1.96, a 50% standard deviation, and a 0.03&#xD;
      margin of error. This formula does not include the incidence rate of IAA for the&#xD;
      aforementioned reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated sample size would be around at least 1067 patients. Data will be collected in a&#xD;
      computerized spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2016; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond; WA) and&#xD;
      analyzed with statistical software (IBM Corp. Released 2017. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,&#xD;
      version 25.0. Armonk, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      χ2 test will be assessed to compare categorical variables, and univariate logistic regression&#xD;
      will be performed to provide hazard ratios for individual variables, identifying possible&#xD;
      predictors of postoperative complication (IAA above all). All significant (p &lt; 0.05)&#xD;
      variables at univariate analysis will be included in a multivariate regression model in order&#xD;
      to detect independent risk factors for the outcome and to estimate odds ratio and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A scoring system will be built according to the results of statistical analysis. The weight&#xD;
      of each variable will be addressed based on odds ratio values. To evaluate the accuracy of&#xD;
      the score, discrimination and calibration of the model will be explored. The former will be&#xD;
      assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, whereas the latter will&#xD;
      be investigated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Based on the results of the&#xD;
      ROC curve analysis, we will proceed to identify different severity grades of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis each one related to a specific risk of developing delayed IAA. χ2 test will be&#xD;
      assessed to compare categorical variables, and univariate logistic regression will be&#xD;
      performed to provide hazard ratios for individual variables, identifying possible predictors&#xD;
      of postoperative complication (IAA above all). All significant (p &lt; 0.05) variables at&#xD;
      univariate analysis will be included in a multivariate regression model in order to detect&#xD;
      independent risk factors for the outcome and to estimate odds ratio and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The observational nature of this study is mandatory to examine and analyze surgeon&#xD;
      attitude toward peritoneal contamination related to appendicitis during laparoscopic&#xD;
      appendectomy. The optimal study design to address the core matter would be a well-structured&#xD;
      RCT to assess the real effect of lavage plus suction versus suction alone on postoperative&#xD;
      IAA. There is a lack of methodological strictness in the existent randomized trials due to&#xD;
      heterogeneous determination of appendicitis severity and peritoneal contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We feel indispensable to start from identifying different grades of appendicitis, related&#xD;
      contamination, and their relationship with postoperative abscesses, considering surgeons'&#xD;
      attitude. The core step is to classify each patient and create a score to pick out classes of&#xD;
      peri-appendiceal contamination related to different incidence rate of postoperative IAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The General Surgery residency program at the University of Milan is based on a large clinical&#xD;
      network in which residents are distributed in different hospitals. It is a 5-year program.&#xD;
      One hundred thirty residents are involved. The clinical network includes 59 surgical units in&#xD;
      27 hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This system structure allows great exposure to different surgical scenarios, inside and&#xD;
      outside the operating room. The program requires, per year, a minimum of procedures in which&#xD;
      the resident has to be involved. From the first to the fifth year, the difficulty of the&#xD;
      procedure is increased. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, this is one of the most&#xD;
      efficient residency programs in Italy because great attention is dedicated to surgical skills&#xD;
      improvement. On the other hand, this program may underestimate the scientific needs and&#xD;
      educational growth of residents. This study is resident driven as an incitement to a defined&#xD;
      organization for the scientific growth of the University of Milan residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the project start-up phase of this study, an official group of residents of the&#xD;
      General Surgery program at the University of Milan has been created. The main aim of this&#xD;
      group of young doctors is to try to guarantee to each resident, who is interested, the&#xD;
      minimal scientific knowledge and ability to critically understand, ideate, and project a&#xD;
      scientific study.&#xD;
