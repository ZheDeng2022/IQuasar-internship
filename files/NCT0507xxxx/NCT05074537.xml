      This data bank will serve as a data resource for a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and&#xD;
      basic scientists. Specifically, this data bank will allow investigators to generate&#xD;
      preliminary data for competitive consideration in intermural and extramural funding while&#xD;
      enabling advanced analytical tool development and deep learning methodologies. This effort&#xD;
      will enable the use for leading edge innovation in biomedical imaging by using clinical&#xD;
      imaging studies that otherwise could not be used for such developments. We aim to use these&#xD;
      data to improve diagnostics and disease management. With this data bank, we hope to improve&#xD;
      the quality of imaging and the precision of imaging based analytics to better detect&#xD;
      potential health risks, predict treatment response, and monitor disease progression in order&#xD;
      to guide management of future patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The constant advances in computational capabilities and abilities of deep learning&#xD;
      necessitate the availability of large imaging data sets that can be further analyzed. We&#xD;
      therefore create the WIIA - The Wright Center of Innovation Imaging Archive - to serve as a&#xD;
      repository for advanced data analytics and simulation. This will provide researchers access&#xD;
      to a robust, comprehensive pool of imaging data for impactful research. The patient&#xD;
      population under study includes adults who are 18 years of age and older. Children will be&#xD;
      excluded from this study as they are unable to give voluntary consent. A partial waiver of&#xD;
      HIPAA authorization will be requested to permit access to and use of PHI for recruitment&#xD;
      purposes. However, investigational data will only be collected once consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study is acquired. There will be no upper limit to the number of people who participate&#xD;
      in this study. We expect 100-150 participants per year, with plans for the study to continue&#xD;
      indefinitely. Data collected will include coded demographics, abbreviated medical history,&#xD;
      current diagnoses, coded medical reports, coded surgical/nonsurgical treatment procedures,&#xD;
      and follow up information. These data will be collected from Standard of Care (SOC) or&#xD;
      investigational imaging studies. These data will be coded and stored in the Wright Center of&#xD;
      Innovation Imaging Archive, which is a secure database of imaging studies. Data will be&#xD;
      stored indefinitely. Administrative staff will construct and maintain the database as well as&#xD;
      conduct annual quality assurance assessments of bank data. Oversight of the bank will be the&#xD;
      responsibility of the Principal and Co-Investigators of the study. To maximize the use of&#xD;
      this data bank and to promote collaborative, multi-institutional research, we are not&#xD;
      limiting future data use. Data may be shared with Ohio State or non-Ohio State researchers.&#xD;
      However, only investigators with sound, hypothesis driven research proposals can request data&#xD;
      by completing a Data Request Form. This study will impose minimal medical risk to&#xD;
      participants. At data leak is the primary risk, which will be minimized through precautions&#xD;
      to protect PHI. Nevertheless, in the event of a data breach, the nature of the collected data&#xD;
      ensures minimal financial or professional impact on the patient. This study does not confer a&#xD;
      direct benefit to the patient. However, society may benefit from imaging advancements that&#xD;
      arise from future studies using this data.&#xD;
