  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite documented evidence of disordered eating (DE) among Active Duty (AD) Service Members&#xD;
      (SM) and Veterans, DE has not been assessed in SM undergoing the transition from AD to&#xD;
      Veterans status (AD-VS). The objective of the current study is to explore gender differences&#xD;
      and associations between nutrition knowledge, DE attitudes and behaviors, mental health, and&#xD;
      military-specific experiences in women and men undergoing the AD-VS transition, and then use&#xD;
      this information along with qualitative feedback from focus groups to inform adaptations of&#xD;
      an existing nutrition education program for pilot testing in AD-VS women and men.&#xD;

      Despite documented evidence of disordered eating (DE) among Active Duty (AD) Service Members&#xD;
      (SM) and Veterans, DE has not been assessed in SM undergoing the transition from AD to&#xD;
      Veterans status (AD-VS). DE describes psychologically-driven, subclinical, maladaptive eating&#xD;
      behaviors that do not meet diagnostic criteria for eating disorders (ED), which are serious&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions that require intensive medical intervention and treatment. DE, while&#xD;
      less clinically severe than ED, likely affects a much larger proportion of individuals and&#xD;
      often goes unreported and/or underdiagnosed, thereby paving the way for chronic DE and&#xD;
      development of deleterious outcomes. Mental health is intimately connected with eating&#xD;
      behaviors and associations between DE/ED and other mental comorbidities have been described&#xD;
      in AD and Veteran populations. By addressing DE during the AD-VS transition time, it may be&#xD;
      possible to mitigate the long term clinical consequences that result from chronic DE. The&#xD;
      AD-VS time frame is an especially opportune time to intervene with health-focused&#xD;
      interventions given the evidence of weight gain and reductions in physical activity that&#xD;
      occurs following separation from AD service. The contribution of DE behaviors to weight gain&#xD;
      during and immediately following the AD-VS transition has not been explored and could be one&#xD;
      factor to target in order to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors during this critical&#xD;
      juncture. Interventions that provide SM with resources and strategies to prevent or minimize&#xD;
      DE behaviors and improve mental health early in the AD-VS transition process may help to&#xD;
      prevent adverse outcomes for Veterans. Based on the available evidence linking DE and mental&#xD;
      health in Veterans, interventions that are able to address these issues holistically and&#xD;
      prevent downstream clinical outcomes are worthy of investigation in AD-VS women and men.&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of the current study is to explore gender differences and associations&#xD;
      between nutrition knowledge, DE attitudes and behaviors, mental health, and military-specific&#xD;
      experiences in women and men undergoing the AD-VS transition, and then use this information&#xD;
      along with qualitative feedback from focus groups to inform adaptations of an existing&#xD;
      nutrition education program for pilot testing in AD-VS women and men. Ultimately, this study&#xD;
      is the first step in determining a strategy to attenuate the deleterious mental and physical&#xD;
      health impacts of poor nutrition and DE in Veterans.&#xD;

    <description>Scores on Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory. The Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) is a self-report questionnaire that includes 45 items covering 8 subscales: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant's experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. Scores range from 0-180. Lower scores are more desirable.</description>

    <description>Scores on Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire Short. The Eating Disorder Examination - Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS) was developed as a 12-item version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) with a 4-point response scale that assesses eating disorder (ED) symptoms over the preceding 7 days. Scores range from 0-36. Lower scores are more desirable.</description>
