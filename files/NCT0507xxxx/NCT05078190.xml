  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study for patients with breast cancer that will be treated with&#xD;
      doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and/or trastuzumab (Herceptin). The study will help the&#xD;
      investigators learn more about how these medications affect the heart and how those effects&#xD;
      relate to patients' medical history and social determinants of health (such as race, gender&#xD;
      identity, education, occupation, access to health services and economic resources). Patients&#xD;
      on this study will have echocardiograms, blood draws, and answer questions about their&#xD;
      symptoms and activity level. Patients will be followed on this study for up to 15 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective longitudinal cohort of breast cancer patients treated&#xD;
      with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab to determine the associations between social&#xD;
      determinants of health (SDOH) and cardiotoxicity risk and to determine whether associations&#xD;
      between SDOH and cardiotoxicity risk differ according to race. Patients will be followed with&#xD;
      serial echo, blood draw, and surveys every 3 months for the first year, then annually for two&#xD;
      years. After 3 years following start of cancer therapy, patients will have study visits every&#xD;
      other year for up to 15 years.&#xD;
