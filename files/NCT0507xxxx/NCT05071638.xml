  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, case-controlled trial that evaluates the efficacy of autologous&#xD;
      cord blood mononuclear cells(ACBMNC) infusion as a Treatment for BPD. The results of this&#xD;
      trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for recommendations on the treatment of BPD in&#xD;
      extremely preterm infants. Informed consent before birth is signed. In this prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial, preterm neonates less than 28 weeks who previously stored ACBMNC and then&#xD;
      suffer BPD will be assigned to be ACBMNC infusion group, while those who do not previously&#xD;
      stored ACBMNC or then refuse ACBMNC infusion and suffer BPD will be assigned to be control&#xD;
      group. In the ACBMNC infusion group, when BPD occurred, the pre-stored ACBMNC will be removed&#xD;
      and rewarmed, and then ACBMNC(5×107 cells /kg) will be intravenously injected within 24&#xD;
      hours. The control group receives standardized treatment without special treatment. The total&#xD;
      number of participants is 76 and the same in both groups. The primary outcome is the rate of&#xD;
      mortality or ratio of severe BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include other common preterm complication rate and the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations due to pneumonia within 1 year of postmenstrual age.&#xD;

      Study design and settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, case-controlled trial that evaluates the efficacy of autologous&#xD;
      cord blood mononuclear cells(ACBMNC) infusion as a Treatment for BPD. Informed consent before&#xD;
      birth is signed. Preterm infants in the ACBMNC infusion group will have their umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood collected after birth. Umbilical cord blood was collected into a collection bag after&#xD;
      delivery and labeled. The collection bag was placed in a 4° refrigerator for refrigeration&#xD;
      and sent to the Guangdong Province umbilical cord blood Bank. ACBMNC will be separated and&#xD;
      preserved with liquid nitrogen. The total content of umbilical cord blood cells, the number&#xD;
      of mononuclear cells per ml and the volume before and after separation were provided&#xD;
      immediately for the later calculation of the total volume of infusion. In this prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial, preterm neonates less than 28 weeks who previously stored ACBMNC and then&#xD;
      suffer BPD will be assigned to be ACBMNC infusion group, while those who do not previously&#xD;
      stored ACBMNC or then refuse ACBMNC infusion and suffer BPD will be assigned to be control&#xD;
      group. In the ACBMNC infusion group, when BPD occurred, the pre-stored ACBMNC will be removed&#xD;
      and rewarmed, and then ACBMNC(5×107 cells /kg) will be intravenously injected within 24&#xD;
      hours. The control group receives standardized treatment without special treatment. The total&#xD;
      number of participants is 76 and the same in both groups. The primary outcome is the rate of&#xD;
      mortality or ratio of severe BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include other common preterm complication rate and the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations due to pneumonia within 1 year of postmenstrual age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent before birth will be signed by the parents. All premature infants included&#xD;
      in the study received standardized treatment after admission to the NICU. In the ACBMNC&#xD;
      infusion group, when BPD occurred, the pre-stored ACBMNC will be removed and rewarmed, and&#xD;
      then ACBMNC(5×107 cells /kg) will be intravenously injected within 24 hours. The control&#xD;
      group receives standardized treatment without special treatment.&#xD;
