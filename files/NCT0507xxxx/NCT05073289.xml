  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research was conducted to examine the effect of sandplay activity on anxiety and&#xD;
      well-being levels in patients in psychiatric clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was carried out in Isparta SÃ¼leyman Demirel University Psychiatric Clinic as a&#xD;
      single-blind randomized controlled experimental study in the pre-test, final-test order&#xD;
      between 2020-2021. Ethical permission was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee and application permission from the institution for pre-research. 63 patients&#xD;
      (intervention-32 and control-31) selected by block randomization method formed the universe&#xD;
      of the study. No intervention was applied to the control group. A preliminary test and a&#xD;
      final test were performed two days apart, one hour apart on the first and fourth days. Two&#xD;
      sessions of sandplay activity were applied to the intervention group with a decongest of two&#xD;
      days, and each session was pre-tested. The data was collected using &quot;The Personal Information&#xD;
      Form&quot;, &quot;The Spielberger Status Anxiety&quot; inventory, and &quot;Well-Being Star Scale&quot; and also data&#xD;
      showed normal distribution. In statistical analysis, T-Test, Chi-Square Test, pearson&#xD;
      correlation test was used dependent and independent groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the research, the hypotheses of the research are as follows::&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis (H1): after intervention, anxiety levels of patients who underwent sandplay&#xD;
           activity (in a psychiatric clinic) are lower than in the control grouproup&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis (H1): after intervention the level of well-being of patients undergoing sand&#xD;
           play activity (in a psychiatric clinic) is higher than that of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis (H1): there is a negative correlation between the level of anxiety and the&#xD;
           level of well-being in psychiatric clinics who sandplay activity is practiced and not&#xD;
           practiced.&#xD;
