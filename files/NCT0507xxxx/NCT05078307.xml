  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operative hysteroscopy (OH) is an endoscopic technique for the treatment of benign&#xD;
      intrauterine lesions and in particular uterine fibroids. The limit of this technique is the&#xD;
      duration of the operation which is correlated with the operative risks. Thus, when there is a&#xD;
      large fibroid or several fibroids, this technique can sometimes not be used or require&#xD;
      several sessions. Today there is a new technique of HO that theoretically allows a gain in&#xD;
      operative time. There are few comparative studies showing a clinically interesting gain in&#xD;
      operating time. The aim of this study is to compare the operative time between the classical&#xD;
      HO technique by resection and the vaporization technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, single-center study. The study population corresponded to women aged&#xD;
      over 18 years requiring operative hysteroscopy for fibroids. After obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent, patients will be randomized into two groups: a vaporization hysteroscopy group and a&#xD;
      resection hysteroscopy group. The primary endpoint will be operative time. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be intraoperative characteristics and complications (amount of distension&#xD;
      fluid used, cervical injury, uterine perforation), immediate postoperative data (pain) and&#xD;
      medium-term data (postoperative synechiae). The starting hypothesis is that the technique of&#xD;
      hysteroscopy by vaporization would reduce the operative time by 30%. The number of subjects&#xD;
      required per group will be 27 patients, or 54 patients in total over 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results are a significant decrease in operative time with the vaporization&#xD;
      hysteroscopy technique. This would be important because the reduction in operative time is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in complications of operative hysteroscopy and the possibility of&#xD;
      treating larger fibroids with this technique.&#xD;
