  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1.7 million hip and knee replacements are performed every year worldwide. These&#xD;
      surgeries are associated with high blood loss and transfusion rates. In older patients, the&#xD;
      high blood loss can result in postoperative anemia. Anemia is a condition where there is a&#xD;
      lack of healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. This means, the patient may&#xD;
      need a blood transfusion. This can result in different immune responses such as lung injury,&#xD;
      fluid overload, and sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find an optimal dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) to be given&#xD;
      during a hip or knee replacement surgery. TXA is one of the drugs given during surgery&#xD;
      because it lowers the amount of bleeding and the risk of a blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who are chosen to participate in the study will be split into two separate&#xD;
      groups. After anesthesia is administered, study participant will be given the hospitals&#xD;
      standard dose of TXA which is 20mg/kg. However, in patients with kidney problems and lower&#xD;
      kidney functions, the dose will be lowered because TXA is filtered out of the body through&#xD;
      the kidneys. Throughout the surgery and after it, patients will have about 30-50mL (3-5&#xD;
      tablespoons) of blood samples drawn at specific time points. This will be done through IV&#xD;
      line which will stay in place during the surgery and post operation to minimize the amount of&#xD;
      needle puncturing's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help to development a new dosing guideline for TXA in patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing joint replacement surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study follows a prospective cohort study design without randomization or blinding. 20&#xD;
      patients undergoing unilateral hip or knee replacement will be recruited and stratified into&#xD;
      2 groups (each with 10 patients) with either glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2 (and dialysis) or GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2. This GFR cut-off was chosen based on&#xD;
      previous data showing low variability at GFR below and above 60, and plasma TXA levels&#xD;
      differed due to reduction in TXA clearance rates between patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After spinal/regional or general anesthesia, a single intravenous bolus of 20 mg/kg TXA will&#xD;
      be administered (as per our standard of care) over 15 minutes. Serial 4-5 ml blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn at: baseline/pre-TXA administration, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1h, 1.5h, 2h,&#xD;
      6h+/-2h and 12h+/-4h post-bolus. These time points capture 2-3 TXA half-lives, including peak&#xD;
      and end of surgery (average 2 h) concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each blood sample will be collected into standard citrate collection tubes. Tubes will be&#xD;
      inverted a minimum of 5 times to ensure proper mixing with anti-coagulant (sodium citrate).&#xD;
      Each sample will be labeled with an anonymized patient study number (to de-identify patient&#xD;
      information) and sample time. The tubes will be stored on ice bath following sample&#xD;
      collection and then centrifuged within 2 hours at 2000g for about 15 min at 4˚C. The&#xD;
      subsequent supernatant will be frozen and stored at -70˚C until analyzed. Measurement of TXA&#xD;
      and other drug concentrations, renal biomarkers and metabolomics will be performed using&#xD;
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) using previously described&#xD;
      methodology. Patients will otherwise receive routine perioperative care. Patient follow up&#xD;
      will be to hospital discharge.&#xD;
