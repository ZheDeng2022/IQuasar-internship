  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project aims to examine the impact of motor coordination deficits and the&#xD;
      effects of motor intervention on preschool-aged children's perceived competence,&#xD;
      health-related physical fitness, activity participation and physical activity. Eighty&#xD;
      children, aged 4-6 years,with or without motor coordination deficits will be recruited and&#xD;
      assigned to to motor intervention (DCD-t), control 1 (DCD-c) or control 2 (TD) group.&#xD;
      Children in the intervention group will receive motor intervention for 12 weeks. All children&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, 0-, 3- and 6-month post-intervention.&#xD;

      This research project aims to examine the impact of motor coordination deficits on&#xD;
      preschool-aged children's perceived competence, health-related physical fitness, activity&#xD;
      participation and physical activity. Furthermore, the investigators are to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of motor intervention on children's competence and participation during preschool&#xD;
      age. This study plans to recruit 40 children with motor coordination deficits, aged 4-6&#xD;
      years, and 40 age- and gender-matched typically developing children. Children with motor&#xD;
      coordination deficits will further be randomly assigned to motor intervention (DCD-t) or&#xD;
      control (DCD-c) group. At baseline assessment, all children will be assessed for motor&#xD;
      coordination competence, self-perception of competence, health-related physical fitness and&#xD;
      daily activity participation. Physical activity will also be quantitatively measured using&#xD;
      accelerometry. During the intervention phase, children in the DCD-t group will receive&#xD;
      task-oriented motor intervention combined with fitness training three times per week while&#xD;
      children in the DCD-c group remain usual activities. All children will be re-assessed at 0-,&#xD;
      3- and 6-month post-intervention. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to examine the&#xD;
      differences of motor competence, self-perception, fitness and activity participation among&#xD;
      the 3 groups of children and over the 9-month period. The effects of motor intervention on&#xD;
      DCD children's competence and participation will also be examined.&#xD;
