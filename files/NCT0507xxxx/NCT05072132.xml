    <textblock>
      In recent years, returning genetic results to research participants has become a topic of&#xD;
      debate, with a growing consensus that researchers should offer to return incidental findings&#xD;
      and research results to participants. Currently, the research and debates surrounding return&#xD;
      of results (ROR) have primarily taken place in high-income countries. Less attention has been&#xD;
      paid to ROR in lower-resource countries. However, research participants in these settings may&#xD;
      have additional threats, barriers, and/or competing interests that reduce the benefit or&#xD;
      relevance of receiving genetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arsenic is a toxic metal. Exposure to arsenic increases a person's risk for cancer,&#xD;
      especially in the lung, kidney, bladder and skin. Many people in Bangladesh are exposed to&#xD;
      elevated environmental levels of arsenic through naturally contaminated drinking water.&#xD;
      People who metabolize arsenic (remove it from their body) slower compared to people who&#xD;
      metabolize arsenic more efficiently are at higher risk for arsenic toxicities (e.g. cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a study in which they plan to enroll individuals who have had&#xD;
      consistently high urine As levels (≥200 µg/g creatinine) based on 15-20 years of follow-up&#xD;
      data. The treatment and control groups will be selected based on genotype (i.e. inefficient&#xD;
      and efficient As metabolizers, respectively), allowing for the selection of the groups to be&#xD;
      quasi-random (based on inherited genotypes). A standard informational intervention will be&#xD;
      provided to both the treatment and controls groups, reminding them of the effects of As&#xD;
      exposure and strategies to reduce their exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is whether the treatment group will, have a larger decrease in urine&#xD;
      arsenic levels compared to the control group, indicating that the ROR intervention caused a&#xD;
      change in water-seeking behavior leading to lower arsenic exposure.&#xD;

      Abstract: In recent years, returning genetic results to research participants has become a&#xD;
      topic of debate, with a growing consensus that researchers should offer to return incidental&#xD;
      findings and research results to participants. The research and debates surrounding return of&#xD;
      results (ROR) have primarily taken place in high-income countries. Less attention has been&#xD;
      paid to ROR in lower-resource countries. The investigators propose to examine the impact of&#xD;
      ROR on behavioral changes related to arsenic exposure reduction within The Health Effects of&#xD;
      Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort (IRB18-1331). This cohort study is located in&#xD;
      Araihazar, Bangladesh, a rural area of Bangladesh with substantial exposure to arsenic&#xD;
      through naturally contaminated drinking water from local wells. In this cohort, the&#xD;
      investigators have participant data on inherited genetic variation known to impact arsenic&#xD;
      metabolism efficiency and risk for arsenic toxicities. These genetic data allow us to&#xD;
      identify participants who are inefficient (vs. efficient) arsenic metabolizers. The&#xD;
      investigators previously surveyed 200 HEALS participants regarding their attitudes towards&#xD;
      receiving information about their genetic susceptibility to arsenic toxicity, and 100% of the&#xD;
      participants indicated they wanted to receive this information. The investigators are&#xD;
      proposing a study in which they enroll adults who have had consistently high urine arsenic&#xD;
      levels (≥200 µg/g creatinine) based on 15-20 years of follow-up data. The 2 intervention&#xD;
      groups (n=200) will be selected based on genotype (i.e. inefficient and efficient arsenic&#xD;
      metabolizers, respectively), allowing for the selection of the groups to be quasi-random&#xD;
      (based on inherited genotypes). The control group (n=100), will be selected at random within&#xD;
      the HEALS participants who have had consistently high urine arsenic levels. The intervention&#xD;
      will consist of three arms: 2 intervention groups (n=200) and 1 control group (n=100). The&#xD;
      intervention arm will consist of two groups; intervention 1 and intervention 2. Participants&#xD;
      in intervention 1 group will be selected based on being inefficient arsenic metabolizers,&#xD;
      while participants in intervention 2 group will be selected based on being efficient arsenic&#xD;
      metabolizers. The control group will consist of a random sample of HEALS participants. A&#xD;
      standard informational intervention will be provided to both the intervention and controls&#xD;
      groups, reminding them of the effects of arsenic exposure and strategies to reduce their&#xD;
      exposure. The intervention groups will additionally be offered information on their arsenic&#xD;
      metabolism efficiency (i.e., their genetic results indicating they are inefficient/efficient&#xD;
      metabolizers and at increased/decreased risk for arsenic toxicities). Six months after the&#xD;
      intervention, the urine arsenic levels of all groups will be measured. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intervention 1 group (inefficient arsenic metabolizers) will have a&#xD;
      larger decrease in urine arsenic levels compared to the control group. The&#xD;
      investigatorshypothesize that the intervention 2 group will have urine arsenic levels that&#xD;
      differ from intervention 1 group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To enroll arsenic-exposed individuals to an intervention study to assess the impact of&#xD;
      returning information on genetic susceptibility on arsenic exposure levels. To achieve this&#xD;
      aim, The investigators will first recruit HEALS participants (residing in Araihazar,&#xD;
      Bangladesh) with consistently high arsenic exposure (based on &gt;15 years of exposure data).&#xD;
      Using genetic information to perform quasi-randomization, the investigators will then assign&#xD;
      low-efficiency metabolizers to the intervention 1 arm and high-efficiency metabolizers to the&#xD;
      intervention 2 arm(return of genetic results + exposure reduction information) and the&#xD;
      control arm (exposure reduction information only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To assess the impact of the ROR intervention on arsenic exposure levels, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect urine samples 6 months after the intervention and compare the&#xD;
      arsenic levels to arsenic levels assessed in urine at baseline. The investigators will test&#xD;
      the association between the intervention arms and the change in arsenic levels between&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Returning genetic results to research participants has become a topic of debate in&#xD;
      recent years due in part to increasing availability of whole-genome genotyping and sequencing&#xD;
      data and an improved understanding of genetic causes of disease. Whole genome sequencing data&#xD;
      can contain information relevant to the health care of a research participant, although not&#xD;
      necessarily relevant to the research questions; this has been termed &quot;incidental findings.&quot;&#xD;
      There is a growing consensus that researchers should offer to return such incidental findings&#xD;
      to research participants. Groups such as the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) have&#xD;
      provide recommendations regarding which genes and variants should be considered &quot;medically&#xD;
      relevant and offered to participants as part of the incidental findings. There is also a&#xD;
      trend among researchers and funders to make research participants' genetic data freely&#xD;
      available to them should participants want to access to it. These types of data could be&#xD;
      specific research results (i.e., the specific genetic variants[s] under study in meeting a&#xD;
      research project's aims) or genome-wide measures of genetic variation (potentially&#xD;
      communicated as polygenic estimates of risk for specific disease or as an interpretation of&#xD;
      participants' genetic ancestry). It has been suggested that providing participants their&#xD;
      genetic results is one way by which researchers can demonstrate respect for participants and&#xD;
      enhance participants' engagement in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study overview This study's primary goals are to test the feasibility and benefits of&#xD;
      returning genetic results to a population in a rural and low resource setting. To accomplish&#xD;
      the specific aims, the investigators will use data from the HEALS cohort from which they have&#xD;
      previously obtained information regarding arsenic exposure as well as genomic information&#xD;
      from Bangladeshi adults (age 18-70). Participants within this cohort will be eligible for&#xD;
      this intervention study if they have had consistently high urine arsenic levels throughout&#xD;
      the follow-up period (15-20 years of information). The information and knowledge gained from&#xD;
      this study is critical for advancing understanding the potential benefits of returning&#xD;
      genetic results within a low resource setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collaborate with UChicago Research Bangladesh (URB) to enroll&#xD;
      individuals from the HEALS cohort in Araihazar, Bangaldesh. URB will identify HEALS&#xD;
      participants who have had consistently high urine arsenic levels (≥200 µg/g creatinine) based&#xD;
      on 15-20 years of follow-up data. Intervention1 and intervention 2 groups will be selected&#xD;
      based on genotype (i.e. inefficient and efficient arsenic metabolizers, respectively),&#xD;
      allowing for the selection of the groups to be quasi-random (based on inherited genotypes).&#xD;
      The control group will be selected randomly from HEALS participants. At initial contact (Time&#xD;
      1), URB filed staff in Araihazar will obtain urine samples from all participants. A standard&#xD;
      informational intervention will be provided to intervention and controls groups, reminding&#xD;
      them of the effects of arsenic exposure and strategies to reduce their exposure. The&#xD;
      intervention groups will additionally be offered information on metabolism efficiency (i.e.,&#xD;
      their genetic results). Six months after the onset of the intervention (Time 2), the urine&#xD;
      arsenic levels of both intervention and control groups will be measured again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration The length of the data collection period for each participant will be 6 months. The&#xD;
      initialization of the study will be Time 1, at which the first urine sample will be obtained,&#xD;
      6 months later (Time 2) the URB researchers will follow-up with the participants to obtain&#xD;
      the last urine sample for this study. Given that data collection will be staggered across&#xD;
      participants, collection of all urine samples is expected to take 1 year. Measurement of&#xD;
      arsenic in those samples will take 6 months, and downstream analyses of data will take&#xD;
      another 6 months. So the investigators expect ~2 years for this study once data collection&#xD;
      has begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location Collection of biospecimens and questionnaire data will take place in Araihazar,&#xD;
      Bangladesh. The URB has local offices in this area. Arsenic measurement will occur at the&#xD;
      University of Illinois in Chicago. Data analyses will occur at the University of Chicago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and participant selection: All participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Araihazar, Bangladesh, a study that&#xD;
      has &gt;20,000 participants. HEALS is a prospective study of health outcomes associated with&#xD;
      arsenic exposure through drinking water in a cohort of adults in Araihazar, Bangladesh, a&#xD;
      rural area east of the capital city, Dhaka. Trained study physician conducted in-person&#xD;
      interviews, clinical evaluations (including ascertainment of skin lesions), and urine&#xD;
      collection at baseline and follow-up visits (every 2 years). Blood samples were also&#xD;
      collected from the participants at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and number of experimental subjects: For this present study, Uchicago Research&#xD;
      Bangladesh (URB) study staff will work to identify patients who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria from the established HEALS cohort study during which the URB staff will&#xD;
      obtain informed consent. The inclusion criteria for the study are HEALS cohort members (age&#xD;
      18-70) who have had consistently high urine arsenic levels (≥ 200 µg/g creatinine) based on&#xD;
      15-20 years of follow-up data and participants who have genetic information regarding the&#xD;
      AS3MT variant that classifies them as being an inefficient or efficient arsenic metabolizer.&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria for this study would be HEALS members who are missing baseline urine&#xD;
      samples as well as those who are missing the latest follow-up urine samples. There will be a&#xD;
      total of 300 subjects enrolled,100 for the intervention 1 group, 100 for the intervention 2&#xD;
      group and 100 for the control group. The investigators will collect urine samples from each&#xD;
      participant to assess current levels of arsenic exposure. Urine samples will be shipped to&#xD;
      the University of Chicago. Information regarding each HEALS participant's well usage will be&#xD;
      updated at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic information and Classification of slow vs. Fast metabolizers: Once consumed,&#xD;
      inorganic arsenic is converted to mono- and di-methylated (DMA) forms. DMA, expressed as a&#xD;
      percentage of urinary arsenic, is a measure of arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME). Common&#xD;
      variation in the 10q24.32 region, containing the arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) gene, is&#xD;
      associated with AME. Additionally, a genetic variant in the formiminotransferse&#xD;
      cyclodeaminase (FTCD) gene is associated with AME. FTCD is critical for catabolism of&#xD;
      histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate&#xD;
      cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In the HEALS cohort, these&#xD;
      genetic variants in FTCD and AS3MT together explain ~10% of the variation in DMA% and have&#xD;
      clear effects on risk for arsenic toxicity (i.e. arsenic-induced skin lesions). These&#xD;
      inherited genetic variants will be used in the present study to classify participants as&#xD;
      efficient or inefficient arsenic metabolizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (receiving information on arsenic): In this study, intervention and control&#xD;
      groups will receive a standard informational intervention which will remind them of the&#xD;
      effects of arsenic exposure and potential strategies that can be implemented to reduce their&#xD;
      exposure. In addition, the intervention groups will receive information regarding their&#xD;
      genetic results that informs them of their arsenic metabolism efficiency. The intervention&#xD;
      groups will receive this information through a factsheet appropriate for a lay audience. The&#xD;
      factsheet will contain information regarding arsenic metabolism and its role in removing&#xD;
      arsenic from the body. The factsheet will describe how there is variability among individuals&#xD;
      with respect to the efficiency with which arsenic is removed from the body, due to inherited&#xD;
      differences in genes that affect arsenic metabolism. The factsheet will connect metabolism&#xD;
      speed with toxicity risk. In other words, slower metabolizers remove arsenic slower from the&#xD;
      body compared to others while fast metabolizers remove arsenic faster from the body compared&#xD;
      to others. This leads to increased risk for arsenic toxicities, normal arsenic metabolizer&#xD;
      remove arsenic from the body at an average rate, and fast arsenic metabolizers remove arsenic&#xD;
      from the body faster than most other people, which leads to decreased toxicity risk. Lastly,&#xD;
      the factsheet will inform the participants in the intervention groups that they have been&#xD;
      identified as a slow/fast metabolizer of arsenic based on their genes. This information will&#xD;
      be given to participants by URB staff, with a study physician available during the study&#xD;
      visit who would be able to address additional questions and concerns from the participant.&#xD;
      The control group will not receive the information regarding their genetic results that&#xD;
      informs them of their arsenic metabolism efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arsenic Assessment and Urine Sample: Urine samples will be obtained by URB study staff at&#xD;
      Time1 (initial contact) and Time2 (Six months after the onset of the intervention). The&#xD;
      investigators plan to assess arsenic exposure from urine samples from all recruited&#xD;
      participants. Prior studies have demonstrated high correlation between water arsenic levels&#xD;
      and urinary arsenic. Urine arsenic will be measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (ICPMS) at the CACHET (The Chicago Center for Health and Environment) biomarkers&#xD;
      core facility at UIC (University of Illinois at Chicago).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: All participants will undergo a genetic comprehension questionnaire. Genetic&#xD;
      information presents challenges to all participants within studies, but especially those with&#xD;
      low and marginal genetic literacy. Low genetic comprehension may be a barrier for&#xD;
      participants to understand the utility of the return of genetic results information,&#xD;
      therefore, the investigatorswill measure genetic comprehension through the use of the&#xD;
      questionnaire the Measure of Genetic Susceptibility Knowledge. This questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered orally to the study participants by the URB staff who will follow structured&#xD;
      protocols. This questionnaire was created by selecting questions from previous questionnaires&#xD;
      that measure genetic knowledge in the general population as well as creating comprehension&#xD;
      questions from a previous questionnaire that used on this population called the Return of&#xD;
      Results (Genetic) Questionnaire from IRB18-1331.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arms will also be given a questionnaire to measure any&#xD;
      psychological stress due to receiving ROR. It is important to understand the psychological&#xD;
      consequences for patients receiving genomic tests results in a variety of settings,&#xD;
      therefore, the investigators will measure psychological stress through the use of the&#xD;
      Feelings About genomiC Testing Results (FACToR) questionnaire, that has been designed to&#xD;
      measure the psychological impact of receiving genomic test results in a wide range of&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participants identified the well water used as their primary source of drinking&#xD;
      water at baseline in the HEALS cohort study, the investigators will follow-up on this&#xD;
      question to have the most up to date information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and benefits: There is no more than minimal physical risk to participate in&#xD;
      this study. The investigators are requesting to obtain urine samples and questionnaire data&#xD;
      from all of the participants. While the study is no more than minimal physical risk/harm, the&#xD;
      investigators will have numerous precautions to protect confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there may be some risk of stigma or stress to individuals in the intervention&#xD;
      arm, who are identified as slow arsenic metabolizers, however, this is offset by the&#xD;
      potential health benefit gained through the knowledge. According to the health belief model,&#xD;
      if genetic risk information changes an individual's perceived susceptibility to arsenic&#xD;
      toxicities, the likelihood to adopt health behaviors may change. Therefore, for the&#xD;
      participants in this specific study who are at higher risk for arsenic toxicities due to&#xD;
      having higher urine arsenic levels throughout the 15-20 years of follow-up data in the HEALS&#xD;
      cohort, obtaining information regarding being a slower arsenic metabolizers may additionally&#xD;
      motivate lifestyle modification if it increases an individual's risk perception, thereby&#xD;
      offsetting the potential risk through this benefit. Furthermore, a subset of 200 participants&#xD;
      in the HEALS study have previously been asked if they would like to receive their genetic&#xD;
      information regarding arsenic metabolism efficiency, 100% of the participants questioned&#xD;
      stated they would want this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of Safety: This study involves no physical risks. The intervention is&#xD;
      informational in nature, and occurs at a single point in time (i.e., the baseline visit).&#xD;
      Should individuals want to further discuss the genetic information received with a health&#xD;
      care professional, a contact number for a HEALS study physician will be provided to all&#xD;
      participants. Furthermore, all HEALS participants can access free primary health care through&#xD;
      the local HEALS clinic, should participants have any health concerns related the&#xD;
      arsenic-related information received during participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure to obtain and record informed consent: For this present study, Uchicago Research&#xD;
      Bangladesh (URB) study staff will work to identify patients who meet the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria from the established HEALS cohort study during which the URB staff will&#xD;
      obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: While the study is no more than minimal physical risk/harm, the&#xD;
      investigators will have numerous precautions to protect confidentiality. The study does not&#xD;
      involve the collection of identifiable information, and the URB study staff will assign a&#xD;
      coded unique study ID to all participant data and samples. The investigators will ensure that&#xD;
      all samples are coded, and all data will be protected, stored, and analyzed on secure&#xD;
      password-protected servers in the Department of Public Health Studies (PHS) at the University&#xD;
      of Chicago.&#xD;

        For this present study, UChicago Research Bangladesh (URB) study staff will work to&#xD;
        identify patients who meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria from our established HEALS&#xD;
        cohort study during which the URB staff will obtain informed consent. The inclusion&#xD;
        criteria for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HEALS cohort members&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age 18-70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  consistently high urine arsenic levels (≥ 200 µg/g creatinine) based on 15-20 years of&#xD;
             follow-up data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  existing data on genetic information regarding the AS3MT variants that classify them&#xD;
             as being an inefficient or efficient arsenic metabolizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The exclusion criteria for this study would be HEALS members who are&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  missing baseline urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  missing the latest follow-up urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be a total of 300 subjects enrolled,100 for the intervention 1 group, 100 for&#xD;
        the intervention 2 group and 100 for the control group.&#xD;
