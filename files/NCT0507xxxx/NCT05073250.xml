  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are the most common inert non&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). The standard first-line treatment of advanced FL / MZL is based on&#xD;
      rituximab. Whether combined with chemotherapy or not, iNHL can induce lasting remission, but&#xD;
      most of it is usually incurable. Therefore, early treatment of advanced iNHL should focus on&#xD;
      protecting the bone marrow function of patients. Although the first-line immunochemotherapy&#xD;
      offer high efficacy but also high incidence of toxicity. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)&#xD;
      pathway plays an important role in the occurrence and development of B-cell malignant tumors.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that PI3K inhibitor alone has good antitumor effect and tolerance in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent refractory iNHL. In addition, PI3K inhibitor combined with rituximab&#xD;
      showed better prognosis compared with rituximab monotherapy in FL / MZL patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      the chemo-free regime, PI3K inhibitor in combination with rituximab may explore a new avenue&#xD;
      for FL and MZL patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are the most common inert non&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Their natural courses are slow but highly variable. The standard&#xD;
      first-line treatment of advanced FL / MZL is based on rituximab. Whether combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or not, it can induce lasting remission, but it is usually incurable. Although&#xD;
      the first-line immunochemotherapy regimen has high efficacy, it also has high toxicity.&#xD;
      Cytotoxic chemotherapy is related to many side effects, including bone marrow suppression and&#xD;
      immunosuppression, gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity, neurotoxicity and the occurrence of&#xD;
      secondary tumors. About 20% of FL patients relapse within 2 years after first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The overall prognosis of these patients is poor. The median age of FL / MZL&#xD;
      diagnosis is over 60 years old. These patients cannot tolerate conventional&#xD;
      immunochemotherapy due to old age or complications. Compared with young and non complicated&#xD;
      patients, the long-term survival is significantly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays an important role in the occurrence and&#xD;
      development of B-cell malignant tumors. IBI376 (INCB050465) is a second generation, effective&#xD;
      and highly selective PI3Kδ inhibitor. Recently, the results of two key phase II clinical&#xD;
      trials of CITADEL-203 and CITADEL-204 show that IBI376 monotherapy has a rapid and&#xD;
      long-lasting high response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory iNHL, and is safe&#xD;
      and tolerable. In addition, the CRONOS-3 study showed that copanlisib, an intravenous pan&#xD;
      class I PI3K inhibitor, combined with rituximab showed better progression free survival and&#xD;
      clinically significant improvement in objective remission rate compared with standard&#xD;
      rituximab monotherapy in FL / MZL patients. In conclusion, we speculate that the chemotherapy&#xD;
      free regimen of IBI376 combined with rituximab may produce deep and lasting remission in&#xD;
      patients with FL and MZL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, open label, single arm phase II clinical trial, which is divided&#xD;
      into cohort A (follicular lymphoma) and cohort B (marginal zone lymphoma). The two cohorts&#xD;
      are carried out at the same time. A total of 40 patients were treated with IBI376 combined&#xD;
      with rituximab. The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of PI3K&#xD;
      inhibitor IBI376 in combination with rituximab in patients with untreated FL and MZL. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of PI3K inhibitor IBI376 in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab in patients with untreated FL and MZL. The exploratory objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the clinical predictive biomarkers for efficacy.&#xD;
