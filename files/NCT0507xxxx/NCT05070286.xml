  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: An assessment by paediatric neurologists specializing in demyelinating conditions&#xD;
      brought attention to the rapid weight change seen among patients recently diagnosed with, and&#xD;
      receiving therapy for, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS). An overview of the current literature pinpointed weight change as a concern, and&#xD;
      identified fatigue and fear as limiting factors for participation in physical activity, with&#xD;
      BMI trajectories in this population significantly higher compared to healthy peers. A look at&#xD;
      current patient data highlighted extreme NMOSD cases where some patients' weight doubled in&#xD;
      two years. There is currently no available research that addresses weight change and&#xD;
      management in paediatric MS or NMOSD patients, but there is research to highlight the&#xD;
      importance of maintaining health behaviours. The aim of this research is to co-develop a&#xD;
      comprehensive lifestyle weight management program for this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Unpinned by the Medical Research Council guidance for developing complex&#xD;
      interventions, this research will involve a fourfold approach. It will build on a previously&#xD;
      completed systematic review, and a secondary data analysis of current clinical data regarding&#xD;
      weight changes in these populations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
      patients, parents and clinicians in order to obtain qualitative data regarding the collective&#xD;
      perspectives of nutrition, weight change and overall health. A list of factors will be&#xD;
      identified and presented in a logic model. A program will then be designed, informed by&#xD;
      previously gathered information and will be reviewed by a group of stakeholders via&#xD;
      stakeholder meetings. This will output a program design, implementation and evaluation plan&#xD;
      which will then be evaluated for feasibility. Recruitment, participation, implementation and&#xD;
      adherence to the program will be tested. A patient, public involvement (PPI) approach will be&#xD;
      taken, with a PPI panel of experts overseeing and guiding the project for its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The results of this research will output a primary version of the lifestyle weight&#xD;
      management program for paediatric patients with demyelinating conditions, ready for a&#xD;
      feasibility trial.&#xD;

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To co-develop a comprehensive lifestyle weight management program catered specifically for&#xD;
      paediatric patients with demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and&#xD;
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore perspectives and perceptions regarding weight change, health and quality of&#xD;
           life, through semi-structured interviews of young people with MS and NMOSD, their&#xD;
           parents and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish a list of factors that contribute to weight change in the paediatric MS and&#xD;
           NMOSD patients following steroid treatment, mapped out in a logic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To co-design a lifestyle weight management program for paediatric MS and NMOSD patients&#xD;
           through the compilation of information and data obtained, and the input from stakeholder&#xD;
           meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final outcome of this study will be a lifestyle weight management program that is ready&#xD;
      for a feasibility trial. It will output a set of end-user requirements as well as a fully&#xD;
      formed underpinning logic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN and METHODS of DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on a previously completed scoping review, and an audit of the research team's&#xD;
      pre-existing patient data and information from the collaborating institutions, this stage of&#xD;
      the research involves three distinct phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1) Foundational co-development- Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2) Logic model of factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3) Program design and implementation plan- Stakeholder Meetings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Interviews. Young people with MS or NMOSD, their families/carers and health care&#xD;
      professionals (HCPs) will participate in interviews to gain perspectives and perceptions with&#xD;
      regards to weight change, in order to develop a suitable intervention for implementation in&#xD;
      the care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participatory design with semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the factors affecting the management of these conditions, with regards to&#xD;
           quality of life, health and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify potential modifiable/non-modifiable factors that contribute to weight change in&#xD;
           this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Highlight and extract important concerns and themes, and explore the barriers and&#xD;
           facilitators to implementing a lifestyle management system for this population within&#xD;
           the care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 young people aged 10-25 with MS or NMOSD (Including MOG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 parents/carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 health care practitioners from medical, nursing and AHP backgrounds with at least two&#xD;
           years' experience in NMOSD and MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N= 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews underpinned by a thematic analysis with patients, parents and&#xD;
      clinicians. The questions will be focused around predetermined themes and factors, extracted&#xD;
      from the previously performed scoping review and data audit, and involving nutrition, weight&#xD;
      changes, overall health and quality of life. The team psychologist will co-develop questions&#xD;
      related to behaviour, and The nutritionist and exercise specialist will co-develop in their&#xD;
      respective fields. The PPI members will co-develop all interview formats and methods. There&#xD;
      will be three different versions of the questions; one for patients, one for parents and one&#xD;
      for clinicians. The interview questions will remain consistent throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with parents, patients and HCP's will be performed virtually via video call, using&#xD;
      the secured Google Hangouts platform. Invitations to join the link will be sent via email,&#xD;
      and events will be made private.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have the option to participate while at home, or at one of the three&#xD;
      research sites during one of their clinical appointment days. It is foreseen that patients&#xD;
      and their parents will participate virtually from their home, however, should they need&#xD;
      assistance or accommodation, this will be provided by one of our three research sites. In&#xD;
      this case, the clinical nurse will assist with the virtual interview, when the patient is&#xD;
      present at one of the hospitals for their bi-yearly day of clinical appointments. Clinicians&#xD;
      will also be given the option to either participate virtually from home, or from one of the&#xD;
      research sites. The interviewer will perform the interview from a private room at Oxford&#xD;
      Brookes University. Parents will be interviewed on their own, whereas patients will be&#xD;
      interviewed with their parent present- if under 16. Patients aged 16+ years may have their&#xD;
      parents present should they wish, but the parent will be asked not to contribute. The&#xD;
      estimated interview time is 45- 60 mins, subject to change during the development process.&#xD;
      There will be a brief post interview questionnaire where the participants will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to mention anything they might not have been able to discuss in the interview. It&#xD;
      will also allow for the research team to collect data with regards to the execution of the&#xD;
      research and to consequently assess the chosen methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be recorded using a secured Google Hangouts platform to provide accurate&#xD;
      accounts of participant discussions and then transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy.&#xD;
      Only the audio component of the interview will be recorded, not the video component, in order&#xD;
      to protect the privacy of participants. The design, conduct and dissemination of this&#xD;
      research will be guided by the COREQ Checklist. Semi-structured interviews will be guided&#xD;
      with an interview schedule and topic guide. Recordings will be transcribed by the third party&#xD;
      transcription company: Rapid Transcriptions . The investigators will take a subtle realist&#xD;
      position to allow the inclusion of a-priori knowledge and use an inductive thematic analysis.&#xD;
      To report themes and patterns within the data. NVivo 12 for Windows will be used to assist&#xD;
      with the organisation and retrieval of data. The design, conduct, and dissemination will be&#xD;
      guided by the COREQ Checklist. The transcripts will be read by two of the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use young people friendly age applicable materials and tools to&#xD;
      facilitate conversations such as TALKING- MATs; a system in which the participant can use&#xD;
      pictures or actions and answers in order to help facilitate their communication. A&#xD;
      pre-interview questionnaire will be performed to inform the interviewer of patient status&#xD;
      prior to starting. A traffic light system will also be introduced, to allow the patient to&#xD;
      express their desire to stop the interview if they feel the need to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Logic model of factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a list of factors that contribute to weight change in paediatric MS and&#xD;
           NMOSD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a logic model of the problem and contributing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will integrate the findings from the first three stages of the program of&#xD;
      work including background foundation work (review, and audit) and the Phase 1 interviews&#xD;
      (perspectives of patients, families and clinicians). A list of factors that contribute to&#xD;
      weight changes in this population will be identified based on the extraction of data form the&#xD;
      previously completed scoping review, data audit, and the interviews completed in the previous&#xD;
      stage. In keeping with the Intervention Mapping methodology structuring this research&#xD;
      project, a logic model will be created. These factors will be in the domains of environment,&#xD;
      behaviour, clinical features and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Stakeholder Meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain input from a stakeholder panel to decide measures, factors and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finalise the content and delivery protocols of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-design the program and context of use including delivery systems and content to sit&#xD;
           within the care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •N=12 (4 clinicians, 4 parent, 4 young people with MS or NMOSD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from Phase 1 and the research team will be invited to participate considering&#xD;
      the same inclusion/exclusion criterion. Four parent and patients members will attend the&#xD;
      meetings with our research team in person, while four our consulting clinicians will attend&#xD;
      the meeting via video call through the Google Hangouts platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The logic model created in Phase 2, which outlines all the identifiable factors that&#xD;
      contribute to weight change will be presented to the panel of key stakeholders in&#xD;
      co-production workshops. There will be two workshops in the form of meetings. These will be&#xD;
      run on a virtual platform, via Google Hangouts, and ideas recorded using a virtual&#xD;
      whiteboard. No audio or video recordings will be taken. Real-time Board inc (Miro) is&#xD;
      compliant with GDPR and is registered and certified with the Cloud security alliance&#xD;
      https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/registry/realtimeboard-inc/ for meeting industry&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 1 development: This meeting will review and identify outcomes in order to finalize&#xD;
      content by bringing together evidence from the literature, clinical data and the perspectives&#xD;
      of patients, families and clinicians. The investigators will use a modified nominal group&#xD;
      approach following the steps: preparation of logistics/focus, silent idea generation,&#xD;
      round-robin recording of ideas, serial discussion of ideas, preliminary consensus formation,&#xD;
      discussion and final agreement of logic model, and intervention and evaluation plan and&#xD;
      intervention. Provisional program outcomes and objectives will be established, and a logic&#xD;
      model of change. The research team will then co-design the lifestyle weight management&#xD;
      program by generating program themes, components, and delivery protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 2 consensus: The program and its themes, components and protocols will then be&#xD;
      presented to the panel during the second meeting. The same nominal group methodology will be&#xD;
      used as in the first session. Feedback will be obtained regarding recruitment, participation,&#xD;
      implementation and adherence in order to put forth the most appealing program for patients,&#xD;
      parents, clinicians and researchers. Following the second meeting adjustments to the program&#xD;
      will be made, so that it is ready for the feasibility stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING Phase 1: Interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre study and will involve virtually interviewing patients, parents and&#xD;
      clinicians at their homes, or at one of our three sites, listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK. Evelina&#xD;
      Hospital, London, UK. The decision to conduct interviews through these sites was made with&#xD;
      the patient in mind, as the data collection will be integrated into the patients' bi-annual&#xD;
      clinic in which they travel to the hospital(s) for the completion of several appointments.&#xD;
      The interview will last approximately 45-60 minutes and will be in-cooperated into their&#xD;
      appointment schedule for that day. Furthermore, as the patients regularly attend these&#xD;
      hospitals, the research site will be familiar to them. The interviewee will be set up in a&#xD;
      room located on one of the three aforementioned study sites, or at their home. This option&#xD;
      has been added in order to accommodate for any participants that might not deem it safe&#xD;
      enough to visit one of the three research sites during the current status of the COVID global&#xD;
      pandemic. The decision to perform the interviews virtually was made following current COVID&#xD;
      guidelines, in order to protect both interviewer and interviewee through the limitation of&#xD;
      contact and consequently lowering of risk. The interviewer will be located in a private room&#xD;
      at Oxford Brookes University. Recruitment will also occur at these three sites, and will be&#xD;
      performed by the clinical nurse associated to the appropriate MS/NMOSD team at each site&#xD;
      prior to the scheduled interview days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Stakeholder Meetings This phase of the research will occur virtually via the same&#xD;
      Google Hangouts platform as Phase 1. Participants will be asked to attend two stakeholder&#xD;
      meetings occurring on two different days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample identification and recruitment Phase 1: Interviews Potential eligible participants&#xD;
      (young people and their parents) will be identified by the clinical nurse located at each of&#xD;
      our three research sites (JR in Oxford, GOSH and Evelina in London) from their current list&#xD;
      of patients. The role of the nurse will involve participant identification and eligibility&#xD;
      checks. Once potential participants have been identified, the clinical nurse will mail out a&#xD;
      patient information package (containing research team contact information) alongside their&#xD;
      bi-annual appointment reminder. The potential participants will then have the option to opt&#xD;
      into the study. Potential health care practitioners will be identified by our lead clinicians&#xD;
      and clinical nurses, and will be contacted by the research nurse via email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Stakeholder Meetings Participants (young people and parents) for phase 3 will be&#xD;
      existing participants recruited from those who participated in Phase 1. During the consent&#xD;
      procedure for phase 1, the participants will have the option to consent to being contacted by&#xD;
      the research team regarding future research; those who consent will be recruited for phase 3.&#xD;
      Health care professionals that are currently members of our advisory team will be included.&#xD;
      No further recruitment will be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Informed Consent The participant must sign and date the latest approved version of&#xD;
      the Informed Consent form, before any study specific procedures occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written and verbal versions of the Participant Information and Informed Consent will be&#xD;
      presented to the participants detailing no less than: the exact nature of the trial; what it&#xD;
      will involve for the participant; the implications and constraints of the protocol; the known&#xD;
      side effects and any risks involved in taking part. It will be clearly stated that the&#xD;
      participant is free to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason without prejudice&#xD;
      to future care, without affecting their legal rights and with no obligation to give the&#xD;
      reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be allowed as much time as wished to consider the information, and the&#xD;
      opportunity to question the Investigator, their GP or other independent parties to decide&#xD;
      whether they will participate in the trial. Written Informed Consent will then be obtained by&#xD;
      means of participant dated signature and dated signature of the person who presented and&#xD;
      obtained the Informed Consent. Informed assent will be sought from any participant aged&#xD;
      10-15, as well as informed consent from their parent/guardian. There will be child friendly&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheets catered for those aged 10-15, so as to assure their assent is&#xD;
      well informed. The person who obtained the consent must be suitably qualified and&#xD;
      experienced, and have been authorised to do so by the Chief/Principal Investigator. A copy of&#xD;
      the signed Informed Consent will be given to the participant. The original signed form will&#xD;
      be retained at the trial site. Outcomes will be analysed after recruitment of the last&#xD;
      participant in the trial. Phase 1 of the study will close once the final participant has&#xD;
      completed their interview. Informed consent for Phase 3 will commence after the completion of&#xD;
      Phase 1, and the informed consent procedure will remain the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal and loss to follow-up Parents/ guardians of participants, and the participants,&#xD;
      have the right to withdraw consent/assent for participation in any aspect of this trial at&#xD;
      any time. Routine medical care will not be affected at any time by declining to participate&#xD;
      or withdrawing from the trial. The investigators will make every effort to reduce loss to&#xD;
      follow-up. One primary contact within each centre will contact all participants and act as&#xD;
      liaison with the assessor and therapy team. The primary contact person will obtain&#xD;
      information about the participants' preferred method of contact (text, telephone, email, and&#xD;
      letter) and trial researchers will contact them using this preferred method when possible.&#xD;
      Contact details will be updated if applicable at each assessment. All appointments will be&#xD;
      made at the research participant's convenience wherever possible. If an appointment is missed&#xD;
      the investigators will try to rearrange this on one more occasions.&#xD;

        This study will see a total of 57 participants (some repeated) over the course of phase 1&#xD;
        and phase 3. Phase 1 will include a sample size of n=45: 15 young people, 15 parents and 15&#xD;
        clinicians. Phase 3 will include 4 parent, 4 patient, and 4 clinicians for a total of n=12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As these are rare conditions, with complicated diagnostic criteria, it is difficult to&#xD;
        obtain exact national figures; however it is estimated that 200 young people across the UK&#xD;
        have relapsing demyelinating syndromes (RDS). This figure includes MS and NMOSD cases, but&#xD;
        also includes other such as CID, but only accounts for patients aged 18 and under. It is&#xD;
        very difficult to provide an accurate number of patients aged 10-25 with MS or NMOSD who&#xD;
        have been diagnosed prior to the age of 18. The three PIC sites associated with this study&#xD;
        are part of the national MS and NMOSD services, and there is currently a combined total of&#xD;
        64 MS patients aged 10-18, and 73 NMOSD cases aged 10-18; for a total of n=137.&#xD;
