  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of using Ossium&#xD;
      vertebral Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (vBM-MSC) to treat people with an ileal&#xD;
      pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) who develop a fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease of the&#xD;
      pouch.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for&#xD;
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with&#xD;
      restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life.1 2 While less than 30% of patients experience short-term&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity following IPAA,3-5 up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to&#xD;
      technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the&#xD;
      pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations.1,2,6-8 Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is&#xD;
      notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local&#xD;
      repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a&#xD;
      devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high safety profile, and relative success in treating perianal disease, we sought&#xD;
      to use a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs to establish safety and secondarily&#xD;
      monitor for healing in patients with ileal anal anastomosis and ileal pouch fistulas. This&#xD;
      trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce&#xD;
      regenerative signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior&#xD;
      and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Subjects who are&#xD;
      refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Subjects enrolled will be&#xD;
      those that meet current indications.&#xD;
