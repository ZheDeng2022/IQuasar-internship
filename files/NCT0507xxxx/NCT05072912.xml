  <condition>Previous Diagnosis With a Complement-mediated Disease and/or With Clinical Manifestations Reasonably Associated With Complement Factor I Deficiency</condition>
  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients previously diagnosed with a complement-mediated disease and/or with clinical&#xD;
        manifestations in which a reasonable etiological association with Complement Factor I (CFI)&#xD;
        deficiency has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Examples of these diseases and conditions are (but not limited to): atypical hemolytic&#xD;
        uremic syndrome, Complement 3 Glomerulopathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,&#xD;
        systemic lupus erythematosus, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, recurrent bacterial infections,&#xD;
        unexplained inflammation or edema, and some autoimmune disorders.&#xD;

        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A male or female â‰¥6 months of age who has been diagnosed with a complement-mediated&#xD;
             disease in which a reasonable etiological association with CFI deficiency has been&#xD;
             reported&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Affirmation of participant's informed consent or LAR's willingness to provide informed&#xD;
             consent with signature confirmation before any study-related activities.&#xD;
             (Study-related activities are any procedures that would not have been performed during&#xD;
             normal clinical management of the participant.) The participant (if a minor) must be&#xD;
             willing to give written informed assent if the minor is within the age groups 7 to 11&#xD;
             years old and 12 to 17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) Diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration that is complement-related with no&#xD;
        concurrent systemic complement involvement&#xD;
