  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are doing this study to find out whether combining 177Lu-PSMA-617 with SBRT&#xD;
      is a safe and effective treatment in people who have hormone-sensitive oligometastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The researchers also want to learn more about how the study treatment&#xD;
      affects daily life and the symptoms of cancer. This study is the first to test the&#xD;
      combination of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and SBRT in people.&#xD;
