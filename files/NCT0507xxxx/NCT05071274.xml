      This single-center, proof of concept trial is being conducted over the course of 42 days&#xD;
      followed by a 2-month post-last treatment visit in order to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of the Sponsor's SkinPen device in treating Acne Vulgaris on the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no published medical or scientific literature demonstrating the effect of&#xD;
      Microneedling on Acne Vulgaris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of acne is attributed to four major factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i)sebaceous gland hyperplasia; (ii) abnormal follicular hyperkeratinization; (iii)&#xD;
      Propionibacterium acnes; and (iv) inflammatory and immune reactions. Increased sebum&#xD;
      secretion is a major cause associated with the development of acne. Conventional treatments&#xD;
      include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and oral antibiotics and&#xD;
      retinoids. However, most of these treatments take a long time to achieve a cure, and,&#xD;
      recently, increasing resistance to antibiotics and isotretinoin's teratogenic potential have&#xD;
      limited the use of traditional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof of Concept study serves to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Microneedling&#xD;
      with SkinPen in female and male Subjects with facial Acne Vulgaris, ages 18 through 45.&#xD;
      Overall assessment of clinical outcome and safety will be based on clinic visits. The&#xD;
      Investigator will apply an objective and precise assessment, the Lesion Count of inflammatory&#xD;
      and non-inflammatory lesions.&#xD;
