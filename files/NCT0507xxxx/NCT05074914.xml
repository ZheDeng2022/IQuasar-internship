  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cancer of the oesophagus is increasing. While surgical removal of the tumour&#xD;
      (oesophagectomy) may offer the best chance of cure, such major operations are associated with&#xD;
      long-term complications such as poor appetite, unintentional weight loss and nutritional&#xD;
      impairments. In the long-term, unintentional weight loss of 10-30% increases the risk of&#xD;
      disease and death. However, a knowledge gap exists as there has been no comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of how this surgery changes the mechanisms of how the gut communicates with the&#xD;
      brain (gut-brain pathways) and its relation to food intake and eating behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oesophagectomy induces changes in the small intestine barrier (gut mucosa) and changes&#xD;
           in hormonal signals after food consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oesophagectomy reduces appetite, eating behaviour, and food intake and shifts food&#xD;
           selection from high-fat and high-glycaemic index items (quickly digested carbohydrates)&#xD;
           to low-fat and low-glycaemic index items (slowly digested).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oesophageal cancer accounts for 27,700 deaths per year in the European Union (1).&#xD;
      Oesophagectomy is a key component of state of the art multi-modal (preoperative chemo[radio]&#xD;
      therapy) treatment for these patients (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may require additional chemo(radio)therapy and/ or a feeding jejunostomy for the&#xD;
      initial period after surgery. Half of the patients remain cancer free five years after&#xD;
      oesophagectomy (3), however many of them have unintentional weight loss as the patients&#xD;
      involuntarily reduce food intake (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to curative surgery, unintentional weight loss is a common presenting feature among&#xD;
      patients with oesophageal cancer. Initially after surgery, reduced food intake may be&#xD;
      compounded by the impact of the operation on the patient. This can be due to inflammation of&#xD;
      the gut mucosa during chemo(radio)therapy. However, in contrast to many other operations of&#xD;
      similar complexity, when patients recover from the surgical insult and are cured of cancer,&#xD;
      restoration of normal food intake does not typically occur (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unintentional weight loss of 10-30% (from starting weight following surgery) increases long&#xD;
      term morbidity and mortality even in those in remission of cancer. Effective nutritional&#xD;
      support reduces early postoperative associated morbidity but does not modify long-term&#xD;
      oncologic outcome even when surgical techniques, tumour size, and malignant potential are&#xD;
      standardized. Empirical support that it is possible for patients to increase their food&#xD;
      intake voluntarily after oesophagectomy remains equivocal. The investigators don't understand&#xD;
      why these patients, who are tumour free, suffer unintentional weight loss (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing putative aetiological factors do not fully explain continued unintentional&#xD;
      weight loss. Initially after surgery gastric emptying is delayed, but after 6 months gastric&#xD;
      emptying is rapid. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and/or small intestinal bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth are present in 40% of patients after oespohagectomy. A subset of patients also&#xD;
      experiences early postprandial intestinal discomfort (dumping syndrome) after consuming&#xD;
      refined carbohydrates. However, the severity of bacterial overgrowth, pancreatic exocrine&#xD;
      insufficiency, or dumping syndrome does not correlate with unintentional weight loss.&#xD;
      Moreover, treatments of these do not consistently lead to weight regain. Another potential&#xD;
      factor, the reduction of the &quot;hunger hormone&quot; ghrelin after oesophagectomy does not fully&#xD;
      explain unintentional weight loss as ghrelin recovers to baseline levels after 12-24 month&#xD;
      and therapy with ghrelin analogues has had limited success in terms of increasing long term&#xD;
      food intake and bodyweight. Consequently, a knowledge gap exists as to which other factors&#xD;
      involved in the gut-brain pathway are key to the profound degree of weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a series of experiments investigating the gut, eating&#xD;
      behaviour, and food intake in 64 patients who will be recruited from the INCOGC. These&#xD;
      patients are all eligible for treatment with curative intent involving removal of the food&#xD;
      pipe tumor. As a comparator group, the investigators will also recruit 16 weight stable&#xD;
      patients under surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus (a condition that can develop into&#xD;
      cancer in a small number of people) in the Irish National Centre for Early Upper GI&#xD;
      Neoplasia. The study visits will be time-matched and balanced for risk-factor profile, age&#xD;
      and gender; the comparator group will confirm that, in the absence of surgery, all end-points&#xD;
      are temporally stable. Each subject will be studied four times at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      after recruitment. Subjects will be excluded if cancer recurrence or ongoing therapy&#xD;
      compromises the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients before and after oesophagectomy have routine endoscopy (procedure to allow&#xD;
      examination of the food pipe) as part of standard care which will allow us to easily conduct&#xD;
      aim 1 as fresh tissue samples from the gut will be easily obtained during this routine&#xD;
      investigation. The initial biopsy sample (pre-intervention) will be obtained during the&#xD;
      surgical episode in theatre so that no additional endoscopies will be required. Aim 2 is&#xD;
      conducted on a separate day as subjects will arrive in the Clinical Research Facility after&#xD;
      an overnight fast (water allowed). Upon arrival on each test day, weight and height will be&#xD;
      recorded and body composition will be assessed. Subjects will be given a standard 400 kcal&#xD;
      meal and have serial blood tests 30 minutes apart. The progressive ratio task (a simple test&#xD;
      in which an increasing number of computer mouse clicks is needed to earn a sweet) will be&#xD;
      conducted followed by a buffet lunch and blood and stool test. In the early afternoon&#xD;
      subjects are allowed to go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the biopsies, blood and stool samples will be collected. The investigators will&#xD;
      correlate changes in gut cells, hormones and microorganisms with changes in food preferences&#xD;
      and eating behaviour.&#xD;
