    <textblock>
      ART (Autologous Regeneration of Tissue) is a revolutionary technology for harvesting skin&#xD;
      without the drawbacks of conventional grafting. This innovative system allows the clinician&#xD;
      to collect hundreds of microcolumns of full-thickness skin tissue and apply them directly to&#xD;
      the wound site. It can all be done in an outpatient setting with minimized donor site&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

      Millions of Americans suffer from acute and hard-to-heal chronic wounds. The National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health estimates that 3% of the U.S. population over the age of 65 has an open&#xD;
      wound. As the population ages in concert with an increased incidence of diabetes and obesity,&#xD;
      the problem will intensify. A recent article suggests that the financial burden of wound care&#xD;
      is approaching 100 billion dollars. Despite the gravity of the problem and the number of&#xD;
      patients afflicted, open wounds can take weeks, months or even years to heal. The search for&#xD;
      interventions that promote healing, reduce suffering and enhance quality of life continues as&#xD;
      does the need to address the underlying issues that disrupt the wound healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Countless hours are spent treating chronic wounds (diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure&#xD;
      injuries). Called the &quot;silent epidemic,&quot; chronic wounds often result in infection, disability&#xD;
      and sometimes amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crafting a treatment plan that addresses the individual needs of each wound and each patient,&#xD;
      hinges on managing the underlying issues that can disrupt healing and increase healthcare&#xD;
      costs. Innovation in wound bed preparation and tissue regeneration bring new hope for these&#xD;
      patients in the form of more effective wound closure, improved quality of life and reduced&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous skin grafting is the gold standard for covering areas of skin loss.4 However,&#xD;
      traditional grafting is limited by accessibility issues and donor site complications-pain,&#xD;
      risk of infection, scarring.&#xD;

    <description>The ART Skin Harvesting System is intended to harvest full thickness skin microcolumns in a minimally invasive manner and scatter them at the recipient site. It consists of three components: (1) a non-sterile, reusable handheld device; (2) a sterile, single-patient use needle cartridge containing the needle array for harvesting skin micrografts from the patient donor site; and (3) a sterile, disposable handheld protective sleeve to cover the handheld device (figure 1). The sterile sleeve reduces contamination of the reusable handheld device and provides a sterile barrier between the non-sterile handheld device and the patient.</description>
