      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics and preliminary efficacy of SKLB1028 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the dose-escalation stage to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of SKLB1028 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. A classic 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD). Patients with advanced solid tumors will receive SKLB1028 orally once daily (QD) in&#xD;
      continuous 28-day cycles, starting at a dose of 200 mg and rising to 400 mg. The second stage&#xD;
      is cohort-expansion study. The safe tolerated dose group will be selected for case expansion.&#xD;
      At this stage, patients with advanced solid tumors with better response on SKLB1028 are&#xD;
      mainly enrolled.&#xD;
