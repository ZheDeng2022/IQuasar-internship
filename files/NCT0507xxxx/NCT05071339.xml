      In the study the investigators would like to examine the effect of GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      administration at the beginning of the follicular phase in patients presenting with high&#xD;
      baseline estradiol levels of 200 pmol/L or above with a leading follicle of 11-13 mm. In the&#xD;
      unit's practice, patients presenting for cycle initiation with a leading follicle &gt; 10 in the&#xD;
      presence of E2 &gt; 200 pmol/L (54 pg/ml) are deferred and receive a priming antagonist protocol&#xD;
      in their sequential cycle. The aim of this intervention is to suppress FSH levels at the&#xD;
      beginning of the cycle thus preventing estradiol secretion of the leading follicle. This may&#xD;
      contribute to better synchronization of the remaining antral follicles cohort and allow for a&#xD;
      better cycle outcome instead of cancellation or one-month postponement. As previous studies&#xD;
      using GnRH antagonist pre-treatment prior to GT initiation for synchronization purposes&#xD;
      demonstrated positive results (including different patient population) , no deleterious&#xD;
      effects are expected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the late luteal phase, parallel to the corpus luteum demise, FSH levels gradually&#xD;
      increase in order to preserve antral follicles from atresia. Early antral follicles show&#xD;
      different sensitivity to FSH possibly contributing to the establishment of the dominant&#xD;
      follicle by starting their development earlier than others. Previous studies indicated larger&#xD;
      follicles are more sensitive to FSH then smaller ones, thus respond to lower levels of FSH.&#xD;
      The premature gradual exposure to FSH may accelerate the development of the larger follicle&#xD;
      and accentuate size discrepancies observed during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During COH exogenous gonadotropins are expected to influence early antral follicle growth to&#xD;
      simultaneously reach functional and morphological maturation. Significant size discrepancy at&#xD;
      the time of HCG administration may result in a larger fraction of immature oocytes, reducing&#xD;
      the number of embryos and the pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since baseline FSH levels are higher in older and poor responder patients, early antral&#xD;
      follicles are exposed to higher levels of FSH thus size discrepancies are observed more&#xD;
      frequently, contributing to higher cancellation rates and reducing furthermore pregnancy&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several protocols have been established to overcome early antral follicle exposure to FSH.&#xD;
      Estradiol priming for 7 days in the late luteal phase prior to GT stimulation achieved FSH&#xD;
      suppression and resulted in size discrepancy reduction and better cycle outcome (higher&#xD;
      number of mature oocytes, embryos and pregnancy rates). A meta-analysis demonstrated reduced&#xD;
      cycle cancellation rate and higher clinical pregnancy rate. GnRH antagonist priming, also by&#xD;
      reducing FSH levels in the late luteal phase, resulted in coordination of early antral&#xD;
      follicular size. These priming protocols require preplanning and a relatively predictable&#xD;
      menstrual cycle in order to start the priming supply in the late luteal phase. Poor responder&#xD;
      patients and those in-between IVF treatment cycles may not have regular menses or may be&#xD;
      waiting for pregnancy test results, thus do not represent optimal potential candidates for a&#xD;
      priming protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated the outcome of GnRH antagonist supplementation at the&#xD;
      beginning of the menstrual cycle prior to GT stimulation. The delayed start protocol which&#xD;
      combines estradiol priming followed by GnRH antagonist for 7 days at the beginning of menses&#xD;
      prior to GT administration to further synchronize antral follicles improved ovarian response&#xD;
      in poor responders and reduced cycle cancellation rate with no significant effect on&#xD;
      pregnancy rates. A preliminary study investigated the effect of three day administration of&#xD;
      GnRH antagonist at the beginning of the follicular phase prior to GT stimulation in normal&#xD;
      responders regardless of baseline hormonal levels and found a trend towards increase in&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy rate, and similar profiles of early embryo development, compared to&#xD;
      standard fixed GnRH antagonist protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not receiving priming protocol that are planned for an antagonist protocol usually&#xD;
      start their stimulation on day 2-3 of menses. A baseline Ultrasound and hormonal blood test&#xD;
      are performed to determine adequacy of cycle start. In a long agonist protocol, gonadotropin&#xD;
      stimulation begins after confirming that effective pituitary downregulation has been achieved&#xD;
      (serum estradiol level &lt;30-40 pg/mL, no follicles &gt;10 mm in diameter). In an antagonist&#xD;
      protocol cut offs may be defined according to the clinical observations and expectations of&#xD;
      each individual program. There have been reports of estradiol level cut-offs between 56pg/ml&#xD;
      and 80pg/ml with an average of 35pg/ml. In a prospective randomised trial Patients who&#xD;
      presented with an elevated day 3 E2 &gt;80 pg/mL in a cycle before IVF-ET had a higher&#xD;
      cancellation rate and achieved a lower PR independent of FSH level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, several studies have proposed the use of different priming modalities in order to&#xD;
      suppress the early rise of FSH at the late luteal stage, including the use of estrogen and&#xD;
      GnRH-antagonist. No study examined the effect of these modalities on women with follicular&#xD;
      and hormonal levels suggesting early recruitment and beginning of development of the leading&#xD;
      follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim: In this study the investigators would like to examine the effect of GnRH&#xD;
      antagonist administration at the beginning of the follicular phase in patients presenting&#xD;
      with high baseline estradiol levels of 200 pmol/L or above (&lt;350) with a leading follicle of&#xD;
      10-13 mm. In the unit's practice, patients presenting for cycle initiation with a leading&#xD;
      follicle &gt; 10 in the presence of E2 &gt; 200 pmol/L (54 pg/ml) are deferred and receive a&#xD;
      priming antagonist protocol in their sequential cycle. The aim of this intervention is to&#xD;
      suppress FSH levels at the beginning of the cycle thus preventing estradiol secretion of the&#xD;
      leading follicle. This may contribute to better synchronization of the remaining antral&#xD;
      follicles cohort and allow for a better cycle outcome instead of cancellation or one-month&#xD;
      postponement. As previous studies using GnRH antagonist pre-treatment prior to GT initiation&#xD;
      for synchronization purposes demonstrated positive results (including different patient&#xD;
      population) , no deleterious effects are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: This is a proof-of-concept pilot study. Patients will be recruited at&#xD;
      the reproductive medicine unit of Shamir Medical Center, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyper stimulation at the IVF unit,&#xD;
      Shamir medical center. Planned recruitment of 15 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This is a proof of concept pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention. A sample size of 15 patients will allow detecting the&#xD;
      potential for use of cycles that would have been cancelled using standard protocols. As the&#xD;
      comparator is mandatory cancellation, i.e. 0% use of cycles, this sample size is sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated at the IVF unit at Shamir Medical Center planned for an antagonist cycle&#xD;
      will undergo blood test and US exam at day 2-3 of their menstrual cycle. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited if a leading follicle &gt; 10mm is shown in the presence of E2 200-350pmol/L.&#xD;
      Following the initial US exam in the morning, if a follicle 10-13 mm will be demonstrated,&#xD;
      the patient will receive a form explaining that the protocol may be changed according to&#xD;
      blood test results with three possible options: 1. Continuation with the original protocol 2.&#xD;
      Cancellation 3. Change in protocol as part of a research if the patient agrees to&#xD;
      participate. As patients undergo blood draws in the morning, with results available in the&#xD;
      afternoon, the initial recruitment will be performed over the phone with signed informed&#xD;
      consent received at the following clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a verbal explanation over the phone and following verbal consent will&#xD;
      start GnRH antagonist injections [Cetrotide (cetrolix) or Orgalutran (ganirelix) - depending&#xD;
      on their primary prescription] for 3-5 days by which time a second blood test (for estradiol,&#xD;
      progesterone, LH and FSH) and US exam will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If estradiol levels have decreased to &lt; 200 pmol/L then ovarian stimulation according to&#xD;
           the original patient's protocol will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If estradiol levels have increased above 5%, the cycle will be cancelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If estradiol levels have slightly decreased but still above 200 or increased in less&#xD;
           than 5% then GnRH antagonist for 3 more days will be prescribed. After these 3 days if&#xD;
           estradiol levels have decreased to &lt; 200, ovarian stimulation according to the original&#xD;
           patient's protocol will be started. If estradiol levels are &gt; 200 then cycle will be&#xD;
           cancelled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When treatment is continued, the previous leading follicle will be separately followed.&#xD;
      Treatment outcomes will be recorded, including the number of large and small follicles,&#xD;
      number of mature oocytes of expected mature oocytes and number of embryos. Leading follicle&#xD;
      outcome will be recorded separately. In patients with a previous or a subsequent cycle with&#xD;
      similar GT dosages, cycle outcomes will be compared to the cycle with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to subjects: No anticipated risks over regular stimulation protocol side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: Descriptive statistics will be used.&#xD;
