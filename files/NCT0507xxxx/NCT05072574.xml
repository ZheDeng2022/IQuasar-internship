    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical response (quality of life, nutritional status, functional&#xD;
      capacity, and disease knowledge) of advanced CKD patients who undergo an individualized&#xD;
      dietary intervention and a nutritional education program (group workshops) using motivation&#xD;
      coaching techniques, compared to controls who receive general hygiene-nutritional education&#xD;
      at every visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Randomized study including two parallel groups: patients from the advanced chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) consulting room of the Malaga University Regional Hospital and controls. The&#xD;
      main objective is to assess the clinical response (quality of life, nutritional status,&#xD;
      functional capacity, and disease knowledge) of advanced CKD patients who undergo an&#xD;
      individualized dietary intervention and a nutritional education program (group workshops)&#xD;
      using motivation coaching techniques, compared to controls who receive general&#xD;
      hygiene-nutritional education at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be composed of 54 participants. The control group will be provided general&#xD;
      dietary and lifestyle recommendations (standard procedure in the nephrology consulting room),&#xD;
      whereas the intervention group will receive treatment and individualized dietary follow-up&#xD;
      using coaching techniques, supported by information and communication technologies, and will&#xD;
      participate in a nutritional education program composed of four on-line sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two visits (basal and three months after) will be scheduled during the study to obtain and&#xD;
      analyse the data. Moreover, in these visits researchers will collect a blood sample in order&#xD;
      to perform an assessment of the metabolism, inflammation, and oxidation, and a stool sample&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the gut microbiota.&#xD;

    <description>Kidney Disease and Quality of Life test (KDQOL-36). The generic component of the KDQOL-36 (items 1-12) is the SF-12, which allows obtaining 2 general scores: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). The specific component of the KDQOL-36 (items 13-36), allows obtaining the scores of the specific subscales for the disease.</description>

    <description>Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease test. The Self-Efficacy Scale for the Management of Chronic Diseases (SEMCD) is made up of 6 items on an analog scale, ranging from 1 (not at all sure) to 10 (totally safe).&#xD;
The Spanish version (SEMCD-S) consists of 4 items. A higher number means greater self-efficacy. The scale score is the mean of the items.</description>

    <description>Kidney Disease Knowledge Survey test. The Kidney Disease Knowledge Survey (KiKS) instrument consists of 28 items and aims to assess specific knowledge about chronic kidney disease in non-dialysis patients. One point is considered for each correct answer and zero for the incorrect one. The total score is calculated by adding all the correct points and divided by 28, obtaining a value from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest level of knowledge.</description>

It is a self-administered scale with 14 items divided into 2 subscales (anxiety and depression) whose maximum score is 21 points for each of them.

    <description>Scale of autonomy for activities of daily life &quot;Barthel test&quot;. This test measures the capacity of the person to carry out ten basic activities of daily life, obtaining a quantitative estimate of the degree of dependence of the subject. The range of possible IB values is between 0 and 100, with 5-point intervals for the original version. The closer a subject's score is to 0, the more dependency they have; the closer to 100 the more independence.</description>

    <description>Physical activity test &quot;Short Physical Performance Battery&quot; SPPB. This in turn includes 3 tests: balance, gait speed and getting up and sitting in a chair 5 times. Each test is scored from 0 (worst performance) to 4 (best performance): for the balance test according to a hierarchical combination of performance in the 3 component subtests and for the other 2 tests a score of 0 is assigned to those who do not complete or they attempt the task and scores from 1 to 4 based on the time spent. In addition, a total score for the entire battery is obtained, which is the sum of the 3 tests and ranges from 0 to 12.</description>

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ consists of 7 questions about the frequency, duration and intensity of activity (moderate and intense) carried out in the last seven days, as well as walking and sitting time in a work day. It evaluates three characteristics of physics (PA): intensity (mild, moderate or vigorous), frequency (days per week) and duration (time per day). Weekly activity is recorded in Mets (Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Metabolic Index Units) per minute and week.</description>
