  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the potential influence of sun protection on the&#xD;
      aesthetic outcome of post-surgical scars following the reconstruction of Mohs micrographic&#xD;
      surgery defects via linear repair. This study will be performed as a randomized split-wound&#xD;
      study. Half of the wound will be treated with zinc containing sunscreen and the other half of&#xD;
      the wound would not be treated. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be evaluated via the&#xD;
      patient observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), a validated scar instrument, as well as a&#xD;
      colorimeter to measure the amount of vascularity, and hyperpigmentation between the treated&#xD;
      and the non-treated area compared to the 'surrounding skin' defined as skin in the proximity&#xD;
      but not adjacent to the wound. Any adverse events will also be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary linear repair remains a fundamental and common means of closing skin defects;&#xD;
      however, to date, there are no clinical studies currently within the medical literature that&#xD;
      explore the potential influence that sunlight exposure has on the cosmetic outcome of&#xD;
      surgical site cutaneous scars. Therefore, this study aims to determine the potential effects&#xD;
      of sun protection on post-surgical scar cosmesis following linear repairs on sun-exposed&#xD;
      areas of the face, hairless scalp, and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been thought that sun exposure is associated with a higher chance of erythema and&#xD;
      dyspigmentation in cutaneous wounds, however, this remains unproven and findings pertaining&#xD;
      to this topic remain largely confined to animal studies. In one study, researchers found that&#xD;
      the wounds of rats chronically exposed to UVA radiation exhibited diminished wound&#xD;
      contraction during the healing process compared to non-irradiated controls. Another study&#xD;
      simulated UV radiation before and after laser treatment on vascular skin lesions in groups of&#xD;
      hairless mice. In the postoperative UV-irradiated group, the mice skin displayed significant&#xD;
      fibrosis, slower healing, and marked hyperpigmentation. A different group of researchers&#xD;
      explored the effect of UVA light exposure on wound pigmentation on scars with and without dry&#xD;
      tattooing. This study found that dry tattooing with UVA light exposure demonstrated&#xD;
      significant improvement of hypopigmented scars. The researchers of this study hypothesized&#xD;
      that the light exposure led to an inflammation-driven hyperpigmentation response. A separate&#xD;
      study hypothesized that UV exposure may be beneficial for wound healing by stimulating&#xD;
      melanocyte distribution via keratinocyte-melanocyte cross-talk, and thus, preventing&#xD;
      hypopigmentation. Irregularity in the pigmentation of healing scars remains a large&#xD;
      insecurity of patients and has led to their desire for surgical corrections of these scars.&#xD;
      These researchers suggested that UV exposure will promote melanin production, and thus,&#xD;
      potentiate a protective effect against further UV damage and wound hypopigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin color changes provide information and clues about certain pathologies, disease&#xD;
      progression, and patient response to treatment. Factors such as melanin vascularity&#xD;
      contribute to skin color. Historically, this evaluation of skin color has been subjective,&#xD;
      however, objective analysis is now possible by means of colorimeters. Cutaneous color changes&#xD;
      can be quantified using the standardized CIELAB system, which measures color light intensity,&#xD;
      as well as red/green and yellow/blue intensity. Following Mohs micrographic surgery, the&#xD;
      colorimeter can be used as an objective measurement to assess scar hyperpigmentation and&#xD;
      vascularity.&#xD;

    <description>The primary end point will be the two blinded reviewers sum of the component parts of the patient observer assessment score (POSAS).&#xD;
The observer scale of the POSAS consists of six items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability and surface area). All items are scored on a scale ranging from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable'). The sum of the six items results in a total score of the POSAS observer scale. Categories boxes are added for each item. Furthermore, an overall opinion is scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 10.</description>

    <measure>Colorimeter measurement of wound vascularity and hyperpigmentation.</measure>
    <time_frame>3-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints will be the measures of wound vascularity and hyperpigmentation. The colorimeter uses the variables L*, a*, and b* as a means of expressing color as a quantifiable number. L* measuring color brightness between 0 to 100 with 0 being total black and 100 being total white. The a* parameter changes from positive values for red to negative values for green for evaluating the degree of erythema and vascularity. The b* parameter changes from positive values for yellow to a negative value for blue. The L* and b* values will calculate the ITA measure, which represents the overall pigmentation of skin color, where a higher ITA corresponds to lighter skin color. Increased pigmentation of the skin will be seen by a rising b* value and a decreasing L* value.</description>
