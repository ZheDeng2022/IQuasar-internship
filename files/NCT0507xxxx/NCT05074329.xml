      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study in which 300 evaluable subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive Active or Delayed therapy with Moventis PNS. Subjects in the&#xD;
      Delayed group will start with therapy at 3-month visit follow up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study in which 300 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects will receive Moventis PNS. Target subjects will have idiopathic hip pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into either a delayed or immediate continuation group. Devices&#xD;
      will be activated post-op in accordance to the randomization assignment. Subjects randomized&#xD;
      to the Active group, programming parameters will be set, and therapy will be delivered for a&#xD;
      minimum of 2-hours per day for the duration of the study. Implanted subjects will be educated&#xD;
      on the use of the transmitter. Programming changes can be done as needed during this time&#xD;
      period to maximize clinical response according to pre-programmed settings. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the Delayed group will begin 2-hour stimulation/day at the 3-Month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to demonstrate clinically significant improvements in the pain of&#xD;
      patients in the active group compared to the subjects in the delayed group. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is defined as &gt;50% pain relief at 3-months as measured by the Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) without increase in baseline pain medications. Improvement will be assessed in relation&#xD;
      to the clinical outcome measures of pain, with a target of &gt;50% pain relief.&#xD;
