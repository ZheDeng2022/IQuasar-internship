  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that cromolyn, when combined with standard COVID-19 treatment, will&#xD;
      improve patient symptoms and reduce the number of days to improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will study the effects of adding cromolyn to the standard treatment of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and who require supplemental oxygen. Cromolyn&#xD;
      will be administered as a nebulized treatment four times a day for four days followed by&#xD;
      intranasal administration for two weeks. Investigators may also screen for biomarkers that&#xD;
      could indicate inflammatory responses and treatment-induced improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either study drug or placebo which will be administered by&#xD;
      nebulization for 4 days followed by 14 days of intranasal administration. Participants will&#xD;
      be followed while in the hospital and then as outpatients up to day 21 following&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place in two phases: Phase 1 will be an open label study of 10 patients&#xD;
      who will all receive the Cromolyn nebulization treatment followed by Cromolyn nasal spray to&#xD;
      assess tolerability and response to the study treatment. Investigators may also draw blood&#xD;
      from 10 healthy patients who will be the controls for the cellular and cytokine assays. Phase&#xD;
      2 will be a randomized double blind placebo-controlled study of 50 patients randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive Cromolyn nebulization followed by Cromolyn intranasal spray vs. saline nebulization&#xD;
      and saline intranasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While subjects are hospitalized, investigators will record morning pulse, respiratory rate&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation. Morning and daily peak oxygen supplementation as indicated by the use&#xD;
      of high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation will be&#xD;
      recorded. The investigators will also note any improvement or decline in participant's&#xD;
      condition and any reduction or increase in oxygen supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phone calls (or EMR review if still hospitalized) will be made on days 7, 14, and&#xD;
      21 to assess dyspnea and physical function. Validated questionnaires from the&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)&#xD;
      (https://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis) will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      dyspnea and physical function. Once discharged, patients will also be asked to maintain a&#xD;
      daily log of nasal drug use, COVID-19 symptoms, resting pulse and oxygen saturation which&#xD;
      will be reviewed at the 21 day virtual visit.&#xD;
