  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the short-term clinical&#xD;
      feasibility of a new voice prosthesis and explore its acceptability, limitations and&#xD;
      advantages. As a result of the evaluations, design changes may be implemented and evaluated&#xD;
      until the optimal design has been determined, or until it is decided not to pursue further&#xD;
      development of the device. Main outcome will be the patient's acceptance of the voice&#xD;
      prosthesis, secondary outcomes are stickiness of the valve mechanism and speech.&#xD;
