  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) provides un-synchronized positive pressure&#xD;
      and considered to be superior to nCPAP in preventing extubation failure. Recently,&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Ventilation Neurally-Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NIV-NAVA) was introduced to&#xD;
      NICU. NAVA is a ventilation mode that uses the electrical activity of the patient's diaphragm&#xD;
      (Edi-signal) to guide both timing and magnitude of the support. However, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether NIV-NAVA is superior to NIPPV in preventing extubation failure and preventing BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators aim to compare the effect of NIPPV and NIV-NAVA on diaphragm&#xD;
      function in premature infants with RDS or evolving BPD. Our hypothesis is that infants&#xD;
      treated with NIV-NAVA will have improved diaphragmatic function and lung scoring.&#xD;

      STUDY POPULATION Premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who are admitted to&#xD;
      Mount Sinai NICU and are supported with NIPPV or NIV-NAVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infants that were born at 22 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks gestation and admitted to the NICU at&#xD;
           Mount Sinai Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infants that are on NIPPV or NIV-NAVA respiratory support for at least 24 hours at the&#xD;
           time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infants with congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infants with known genetic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infants with known lung malformation or diaphragm dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Infants of whom parents declined consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cohort study that includes premature infants born at 22 0/7 to 31 6/7&#xD;
      weeks GA in Mount Sinai Hospital and admitted to the NICU. Written consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from parents or guardians prior to enrolment in the study. Enrolment of eligible infants will&#xD;
      start after obtaining approval from Mount Sinai Research Ethics Board and parent's consent.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be done over one year, and the investigators are expecting to recruit about&#xD;
      30 infants in the NIPPV group and similar number in the NIV-NAVA group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of assessment; Eligible infants will be identified by a member of the infant's circle of&#xD;
      care. Parents of infants who are eligible for the study will be approached for consent. Chest&#xD;
      ultrasound (lung ultrasound and diaphragmatic function assessment) will be performed at &gt; 7&#xD;
      days postnatally, provided that the infant is supported by either NIPPV or NIV-NAVA for at&#xD;
      least 24 hours. CUS will be done prior to feeding to avoid any concerns of a full stomach on&#xD;
      diaphragmatic assessment. In case the infant's non-invasive support modality is changed&#xD;
      during the study period (from NIV-NAVA to NIPPV or from NIPPV to NIV-NAVA), a repeat CUS will&#xD;
      be done at least 12 hours after the change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: Functional assessment of the diaphragm combined with lung ultrasound&#xD;
      examination will be done by one of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound assessment technique; Lung ultrasounds will be performed in a standardized&#xD;
      manner. A longitudinal scan of the anterior and lateral chest walls will be performed. Three&#xD;
      chest areas for each side (upper anterior, lower anterior, and lateral) will be assessed.&#xD;
      Each area will have a score of 0 to 3 points with a total score between 0 to 18, which&#xD;
      inversely correlates with lung aeration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragmatic assessment technique; Diaphragm assessment will be performed in the supine&#xD;
      position. To measure diaphragmatic excursion, the curvilinear probe will be placed on the&#xD;
      lower intercostal spaces between the mid-clavicular and anterior axillary lines on the right&#xD;
      side and between the anterior and mid-axillary lines for the left side. Using the B mode, the&#xD;
      proper exploration line of the diaphragm will be detected by directing the beam perpendicular&#xD;
      to the posterior third of the right hemidiaphragm. By M mode, the cyclic caudal diaphragmatic&#xD;
      displacement with respiration will be measured as the perpendicular distance between the most&#xD;
      caudal point of the liver or spleen at the end of expiration and the end of inspiration. The&#xD;
      average of three respiratory cycles will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the diaphragmatic efficiency as a pressure generator will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the diaphragmatic thickness fraction. Diaphragmatic thickness will be measured at the&#xD;
      apposition zone which can be obtained by placing the linear transducer above the 10th rib in&#xD;
      the mid-axillary or anterior axillary lines in the right intercostal spaces. By B mode, three&#xD;
      distinct layers will be seen, the diaphragm as a hypo-echoic area bordered by two clear&#xD;
      echogenic lines of the pleural membrane (upper line) and the peritoneal membrane (lower&#xD;
      line). Using M-mode tracing, inspiratory diaphragmatic thickness will be measured as the&#xD;
      maximum perpendicular distance between pleural and peritoneal layers and by the same way&#xD;
      expiratory diaphragmatic thickness will be recorded. diaphragmatic thickness fraction will be&#xD;
      calculated using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickness fraction = [(inspiratory thickness - expiratory thickness)/expiratory&#xD;
      thickness] x 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average of the calculated diaphragmatic thickness fraction from three respiratory cycles&#xD;
      will be estimated. The higher scores the better the diaphragmatic function. All Chest&#xD;
      ultrasound assessments will be undertaken using a standard aseptic technique.&#xD;
