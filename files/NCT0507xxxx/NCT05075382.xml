      The goal of the project is to describe novel factors affecting outcome after elbow fracture&#xD;
      surgery with an in-depth evaluation of the role played by neuro inflammation from concomitant&#xD;
      peripheral nerve injury or head injury in elbow fracture outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all upper limb fractures, elbow trauma is the most frequently associated with a severe&#xD;
      impact on patient function and quality of life. One of the main reasons for poor outcomes is&#xD;
      the complexity of the elbow joint, which involves three bones and two planes of motion,&#xD;
      essential to position the hand in space. The flexion extension axis is crucial for eating and&#xD;
      hygiene, while forearm pro-supination is mandatory for most professions, from office work to&#xD;
      manual labour.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Elbow fractures are a challenging clinical problem. The advancement of science and technology&#xD;
      has made major contributions to improve outcomes. Nonetheless, even with an anatomical&#xD;
      restoration of the bone architecture, many patients stay with major limitations and pain. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, it is striking to see how two patients with a similar elbow injury can&#xD;
      exhibit completely opposite presentations: one who has completely healed from his/her injury&#xD;
      and the other who has a stiff and painful elbow. The reasons for these changeable outcomes&#xD;
      are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesize that many of the answers will be related to the neurological&#xD;
      system. This would explain why most studies strictly focusing on the orthopedic component of&#xD;
      upper limb injury have yielded little improvement in preventing the adverse outcomes&#xD;
      experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgical treatment of an elbow fracture, patients often present with complications.&#xD;
      Indeed, one third of patients complain of ulnar nerve symptoms after distal humerus fracture&#xD;
      fixation, and 50% of patients treated surgically for elbow fracture-dislocations will have&#xD;
      disabling stiffness and heterotopic ossification (HO). HO results from resident cells of&#xD;
      mesenchymal origin in soft tissues transforming into bone. Furthermore, approximately half of&#xD;
      all patients with fractures feel significant pain leading to persistent narcotic intake 3&#xD;
      months post injury; 40% will suffer from a neuropathic type of pain, which is poorly&#xD;
      controlled by narcotic medication. Opioid usage is also related to increased sensitivity to&#xD;
      pain (hyperalgesia) and dissatisfaction. Complications from opioids prolonged usage are&#xD;
      numerous, from constipation to death due to an overdose. Canada is second worldwide, behind&#xD;
      the United States, when it comes to opioid use and mortality secondary to opioid use. The&#xD;
      majority of opioid dependant users were first exposed to these substances through medical&#xD;
      prescriptions. This makes it imperative to improve the scinetific community understanding of&#xD;
      pain mechanisms and find alternative treatments to opiates in the management of these&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of these observations, the investigator's research must focus on something other than&#xD;
      &quot;satisfactory radiological results&quot; in patients with elbow injuries. To this end, a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach is needed. The investigators oversee research in elbow trauma,&#xD;
      neurotrauma and have an expertise in upper limb evaluation. To improve the understanding of&#xD;
      the underlying physiological principles that contribute to pain and chronic stiffness, one of&#xD;
      the topics targeted by the investigator is the role of neuro-inflammation (NI) in chronic&#xD;
      pain and functional limitation in elbow trauma. The surgical factors that increase NI will&#xD;
      allow surgeons to choose different therapeutic options and develop novel treatments.&#xD;
