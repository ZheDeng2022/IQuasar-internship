    <textblock>
      Sudden hypotension, which may develop during liver resection operations performed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia, can affect the patient satisfaction at a high rate by causing&#xD;
      complications during and after the operation as a result of disrupting the blood supply of&#xD;
      the tissues. Although there are standard monitoring methods such as blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, and oxygen status that show unwanted hypotension during anesthesia, it is possible to&#xD;
      show hypotension in the early period with new generation methods. Although there are many&#xD;
      clinical studies proving the effectiveness of these methods, these methods have not yet been&#xD;
      included in the standard monitoring methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prediction in this study is that the development of intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      complications in patients who will undergo liver surgery, in whom tissue blood flow is&#xD;
      monitored with the help of devices, will be less than in patients who are followed up with&#xD;
      traditional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an individual participate in this study, he will not be subjected to any additional&#xD;
      procedures other than routine practice during the participant's operation. Before standard&#xD;
      general anesthesia for his surgery, heart rate, oxygenation status, blood pressure parameters&#xD;
      will be monitored. After the initiation of general anesthesia, the procedures performed in&#xD;
      each liver surgery will be applied. In addition, he will be followed by using a probe that&#xD;
      allows monitoring of tissue blood flow and reflects a value to the screen, to which it is&#xD;
      attached, by simply sticking to his skin.&#xD;

      Intraoperative tissue ischemia correlates with morbidity and mortality in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, measurement of tissue oxygenation is important in improving&#xD;
      postoperative survival. Although values such as pulse oximetry, blood gas analysis, mixed&#xD;
      venous oxygen saturation are routinely used to measure systemic oxygenation, regional tissue&#xD;
      oxygen saturation measurement has not yet taken place in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The noninvasive measurement of human tissue oxygenation was first performed in 1874 by Karl&#xD;
      Von Vierordt, with the detection of the reduction in the amount of infrared radiation passing&#xD;
      through an ischemia-affected hand. The first portable oximeter was developed by Glen Milliken&#xD;
      in 1942, but the device has only been used as an experimental tool in the aeronautical and&#xD;
      physiology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate oxygen delivery (QO2) to meet the metabolic needs (VO2) of a tissue undergoing&#xD;
      aerobic metabolism is critical for the long-term viability of this tissue. This condition was&#xD;
      first described by Adolph Fick. For example, as the metabolic rate increases in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues such as skeletal muscle, oxygen delivery will increase, so the amount of oxygen in&#xD;
      the venous capillaries decreases and the arteriovenous oxygen difference increases. In&#xD;
      addition, according to Fick's law, it is predicted that tissue oxygen delivery will increase&#xD;
      with increasing oxygen gradient in microvascular tissue. Various invasive and/or expensive&#xD;
      techniques have been developed to understand the balance between oxygen supply and&#xD;
      consumption in peripheral tissue according to Fick's law. MR, PET, and arterial/venous&#xD;
      catheterization are examples of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS (Near Infrared Spectroscopy) Technology NIRS was first used in clinical practice in 1985&#xD;
      to measure cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants. It was developed to measure regional and&#xD;
      systemic oxygenation noninvasively and continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its working principle is based on the measurement by attenuation of light of a certain&#xD;
      wavelength (700-1000 nm) by chromophores such as hemoglobin in the sampled tissue by&#xD;
      absorbing it in the tissue. The NIRS signal is mainly derived from hemoglobin in the entire&#xD;
      vascular space, primarily small vessels (arterioles, capillaries, and venules). As a result,&#xD;
      it provides the measurement of tissue hemoglobin or saturation (StO2) by measuring oxy and&#xD;
      deoxy hemoglobin in the tissue. NIRS can also assist in estimating the amount of tissue&#xD;
      hemoglobin by reflecting either the total tissue hemoglobin (HbT) or the absolute tissue&#xD;
      hemoglobin index (THI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      InSpectra Tissue Spectrometer InSpectra Tissue Spectrometer Model 1615 probe (Hutchinson&#xD;
      Technology Inc. Hutchinson, MN, USA); It measures the StO2 value by placing it in the area&#xD;
      where somatic oxygenation will be measured. In studies with this device, measurements were&#xD;
      made mostly in the thenar region, masseter and deltoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal StO2 values in the thenar region have been shown to be 86%±6% in healthy subjects. In&#xD;
      previous studies, the demonstration of peripheral hypoperfusion with the measurement of StO2&#xD;
      in skeletal muscle has been shown as an early indicator of conditions such as shock and&#xD;
      hypovolemia. In addition, there are studies in the literature in which morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality follow-up by measuring StO2 in critical patient follow-up such as sepsis. It has&#xD;
      been shown that StO2 values below 75% are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in septic&#xD;
      patients. In some studies conducted with trauma patients, StO2 measurement after the vascular&#xD;
      occlusion test was found to be ineffective as an indicator of early hypoperfusion. In major&#xD;
      surgeries such as cardiac surgery and colon resection, significant results have been found by&#xD;
      monitoring morbidity, mortality, and postoperative complications with peripheral perfusion&#xD;
      measurement. In the literature, hepatic StO2 measurement has been made in pediatric cases and&#xD;
      experimental studies; There is no study in which somatic oxygenation measurement was&#xD;
      performed in liver resection surgeries in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O3TM Regional Oximeter System The O3TM Regional Oximeter System (O3 System, Masimo&#xD;
      Corporation, Irvine, CA) is a non-invasive oximeter used to measure and monitor regional&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (rSO2) in tissue. O3 sensors are used to measure somatic oxygen saturation&#xD;
      in adult patients weighing 40 kg or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters that can be measured with this device: rSO2, AUC index ( area under the curve),&#xD;
      baseline, delta baseline (Δbase), delta SpO2 (ΔSpO2), Delta HHb (ΔHHb), Delta O2Hb (ΔO2Hb),&#xD;
      Delta cHb (ΔcHb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      rSO2 is displayed as a percentage and is a measurement of the regional tissue oxygen&#xD;
      saturation value in the local tissue at the sensor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delta SpO2 is also displayed as a percentage and is found by calculating the difference&#xD;
      between SpO2 and rSO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delta baseline reflects the change of current rSO2 values relative to the rSO2 value&#xD;
      initially shown as a percentage. In order to measure this value, basal rSO2 measurement&#xD;
      should be made by pressing the &quot;set baseline&quot; button when the device is connected to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUC (min-%) measures the time and depth that the patient stays below the user-defined rSO2&#xD;
      low alarm limit (LAL). Time (minutes) refers to the time the patient stays below the LAL rSO2&#xD;
      value. Depth (%) expresses the magnitude of the difference between the patient's rSO2 level&#xD;
      and the LAL rSO2. AUC; It increases when the rSO2 value falls below the defined LAL value.&#xD;
      AUC has not been studied in the literature yet, and it has been observed in clinical&#xD;
      experience that tissue oxygenation becomes critical when the AUC value is around 500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delta HHb, Delta O2Hb and Delta cHb; these features are displayed when the head is selected&#xD;
      as the sensor region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since tissue hypoperfusion may develop especially in the vascular clamp stage of liver&#xD;
      resection surgeries, it is thought that the measurement of peripheral tissue oxygenation in&#xD;
      standard monitoring may have a positive effect on patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present observational study, the investigators will evaluate the effects of hepatic&#xD;
      and renal StO2 measurement on early hypoperfusion and postoperative survival in hepatectomy&#xD;
      cases, and peripheral tissue oxygen saturation measurement with StO2 InSpectra Tissue&#xD;
      Spectrometer Model 1615 probe (Hutchinson Technology Inc. Hutchinson, MN, USA) and O3TM&#xD;
      Regional Oximeter System) The investigators aimed to observe by doing it with O3 System,&#xD;
      Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA) devices. The secondary aim of the study is that these values;&#xD;
      age, anatomical region, ASA physical condition, whether it will be affected by the vascular&#xD;
      clamp duration and its correlation with the risk of developing postoperative complications.&#xD;
