  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of applied modified constraint&#xD;
      induced movement therapy (M-CIMT) with threshold electrical stimulation (TES) in addition to&#xD;
      conventional therapy (therapeutic exercise program) in patients wtih stroke. Studies&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of modified constraint induced movement therapy on the upper&#xD;
      extremity in patients with stroke are available in the literature, but there is no study&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of modified constraint induced movement therapy with&#xD;
      threshold electrical stimulation. M-CIMT treatment applied together with TES will be&#xD;
      performed electric stimulation without causing discomfort in patients with stroke and at the&#xD;
      same time, the duration of use of the affected extremity can be extended with task-oriented&#xD;
      exercises with M-CIMT treatment. In this way, the efficiency of the applied treatment program&#xD;
      will be evaluated, the gains obtained will be investigated and presented as a suggestion to&#xD;
      physiotherapists working with stroke patients. Before and after the treatment program we will&#xD;
      evaulate, the pain level of the participants is measured with visual pain scale; sensory&#xD;
      functions with Semmes Weinstein monofilament test battery; muscle tone and spasticity with&#xD;
      the modified tardieu scale and Myoton®PRO Digital Palpation Device, which has a very high&#xD;
      proof value; functional status with Wolf motor function test and Motor Activity Log-28&#xD;
      (MAG-28); quality of life will be assessed by Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale. The&#xD;
      sample size of our study, in the power analysis performed through the G * Power 3.0.10&#xD;
      program, the sample size was calculated to be at least 15 for each group for 80% power&#xD;
      (effect size: 0.8, α: 0.05). It is planned to include 30% (5 people) more participants in&#xD;
      each group against the possibility of data loss, and 20 (15 + 5) participants in each group.&#xD;
      The study example exemplified in the literatüre for power analysis belongs to Yoon and his&#xD;
      colleagues (Yoon et al, 2014). Participants will be included in the study according to the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, the first evaluation of the participants will be made according to the&#xD;
      evaluation parameters, and the participants will be randomly distributed into three groups.&#xD;
      The first group will be treated with M-CIMT, the second group will be treated with M-CIMT&#xD;
      with TES for 4 weeks, and the third group will be the control group. A total of 60&#xD;
      participants will be included in the study. Participants in all three groups will be included&#xD;
      in the routine conventional physiotherapy program. M-CIMT and TES treatment will be applied 3&#xD;
      days a week for a total of 4 weeks. Each treatment session will continue for one and half&#xD;
      hours. A total of two evaluations will be applied before and after treatment. In the&#xD;
      classification of the data to be obtained in the study, qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      statistical methods will be evaluated with the SPSS 11.5 statistical program within 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval, and the significance level will be evaluated at p&lt;0.05 level.&#xD;

      Sixty volunteer participants with stroke aged 18 to 80 years who meet inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into three groups as M-CIMT (modified constraint&#xD;
      induced movement therapy), TES+M-CIMT (Threshold electrical stimulation+modified constraint&#xD;
      induced movement therapy) and control group. The control group will receive only conventional&#xD;
      exercise therapy, while the M-CIMT group will receive modified constraint induced therapy in&#xD;
      addition to conventional therapy, while the TES+M-CIMT group will receive modified constraint&#xD;
      induced therapy with threshold electrical stimulation in addition to conventional exercise&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional physiotherapy program consisting of therapeutic exercise program will be applied&#xD;
      to both groups 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Modified constraint induced therapy program will be&#xD;
      added to the M-CIMT group for 4 weeks, 3 days a week. Modified constraint induced therapy&#xD;
      with Threshold Electrical Stimulation program will be added to TES+M-CIMT group for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      3 days a week. Before and after the treatment program we will evaulate, the pain level of the&#xD;
      participants is measured with visual pain scale; sensory functions with Semmes Weinstein&#xD;
      monofilament test battery; muscle tone and spasticity with the modified tardieu scale and&#xD;
      Myoton®PRO Digital Palpation Device, which has a very high proof value; functional status&#xD;
      with Wolf motor function test and Motor Activity Log-28 (MAG-28); quality of life will be&#xD;
      assessed by Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale and range of motion of upper extremity will&#xD;
      be assessed with a universal goniometer.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline pain at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain (pain of shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers) will be evaulated with VAS (Visual Analog Scale). The VAS consists of a 10 cm straight line which presents a continuum of intensity and has verbal anchors at opposite ends representing 'no pain' at the bottom and 'pain as bad as it can be' at the top. The participants will be asked to mark the representing point of their pain levels. The values will be recorded in centimeters.</description>

    <measure>Muscle tone and viscoelastic properties of muscle:</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline muscle tone at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tone will be evaluated with the Myoton®PRO Digital Palpation Device. It is an evidence-based Class 1 device that evaluates the bio-mechanical properties of soft biological tissues in a non-invasive, objective, reliable, inexpensive, quick and easy way. Myoton® PRO is used in research to evaluate superficial skeletal muscles, connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments, and other soft tissues</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline severity of spasticity at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Tardieu scale will be used to assess the severity of spasticity. In this method, the severity of spasticity is evaluated at different rates determined. At the joint, the first angle at which the increase in resistance is detected is recorded. The range of motion is compared to the angle at completion. The Stretching Velocities are as follows: V1: As slow as possible (slower than the gravity fall speed of the limb segment) V2: At the rate of gravity fall of the limb V3: As fast as possible (faster than the normal gravity fall speed of the limb).</description>

    <measure>Superficial sensory function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline superficial sense of upper extremity at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The Semmes Weinstein monofilament test battery will be used to evaluate the superficial sense of upper extremity. Monofilaments of varying thickness between 1.65 and 6.65 are used in this test battery. The evaluator applies in order from the smallest filament to the largest filament, the test is stopped when the monofilament is detected by the evaluator. It is a reliable method used in the superficial sensory evaluation of stroke patients.</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality Of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline quality of life at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Stroke-specific quality of life scale (SSQOL)&quot; will be used to evaluate quality of life. SSQOL; It is a valid and reliable scale consisting of 12 subsections, including energy, family roles, language, mobility, mood, personality, self-care, social roles, thinking, upper extremity function, vision and productivity, and a total of 49 questions. It is graded with Likert-type scoring ranging from 1 to 5.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline functional status at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Wolf Motor Function test is used to evaluate upper extremity motor functions. For 15 activities, data is collected in 2 areas, &quot;Functional Skill&quot; and &quot;Performance Time&quot;. Using the &quot;Functional Skills Scale&quot;, each activity is evaluated between 0-5 points (0= Never used the affected hand during the activity, 5= Normal movement). The average score is calculated for the Functional Skill Scale. Performance Time&quot; is recorded in seconds (sec).</description>

    <measure>Motor activity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline motor actvity at week 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Motor activity diary-28 (MAG-28) will be used to evaluate motor activity. The MAG-28 is a valid and reliable scale designed to examine how often and how well a person uses their affected arm outside of the treatment session. It consists of two scales that question how often the patient uses the affected side upper extremity for each activity during daily activities (turning the light switch, opening the door, etc.) (Use Frequency Scale), and if so, how well he or she can perform the activity (Movement Quality Scale). The patient scores himself between 0 and 5 (0 = I do not use my affected arm at all, 5 = I use my affected arm with the same frequency/quality as before the stroke). For the average score, the total scores of both scales are calculated separately and divided by the number of questions</description>

    <description>participants in this group will be trained with Modified Constraint Induced Therapy (M-CIMT) in addition to conventional therapy. M-CIMT is shorter versions of CIMT. The original CIMT devotes six or more hours for therapy and constraining of the intact arm for 90% of waking hours per day and over a period of two weeks. Researchers have observed that such a schedule of CIMT is exhaustive and possibly resulting in non-compliance. Because of this reason,s Modified shorter versions of CIMT (mCIMT) have been designed by researchers. Duration of M-CIMT interventions varies from 2 to 10 weeks and the treatment time also varies from as short as 30 minutes to three hours per day in various studies. Nevertheless both CIMT and mCIMT have shown promising success. M-CIMT emphasizes massed practice with the affected upper limb.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>participants in this group will be trained with Modified Constraint Induced Therapy (M-CIMT) and threshold electrical stimulation (TES) in addition to conventional therapy. TES is based on low-intensity (&lt;100 Hz) and long-duration current and is applied with superficial electrodes. TES provides a natural proprioception by depolarizing the sensory and motor nerves without causing any muscle contraction. TES can improve motor learning and motor performance by improving connections between sensory-motor cortical association regions in the brain.</description>
