  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KANOPEE is a free smartphone application providing screening, follow-up tools and autonomous&#xD;
      digital interventions to lower psycho-social stress and its repercussions on sleep and&#xD;
      behaviors in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, KANOPEE permits an adaptation of the intervention to the subject (i.e., an&#xD;
      adapted waiting period, frequency, and content), enabling to perform innovative trial&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this long-term study is to evaluate the efficacy of KANOPEE on users among&#xD;
      the French general population exposed to psycho-social stress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KANOPEE was designed by sleep specialists and psychiatrists to propose autonomous&#xD;
      interventions to improve sleep, physical activity and substance abuse ; aiming at lowering&#xD;
      psycho-social stress's repercussions. The app provides weekly interactions with a virtual&#xD;
      companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each interaction, users answer standardized questionnaires (e.g., Insomnia Severity Index,&#xD;
      Cigarette Dependence Scale) enabling to characterize users' health status (i.e;, the severity&#xD;
      of the complaints) and evolution over time, and therefore provide adapted interventions based&#xD;
      on the literature (e.g., digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapies, diaries, sleep hygiene&#xD;
      recommendations, motivational interviewing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app is freely available to the general population in France, enabling very large sample&#xD;
      size, and the possibility to perform non-randomized trials depending on the selected&#xD;
      interventions by the users and the subject's group.&#xD;
