  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use a three-arm randomized control trial (RCT) implemented in a fully&#xD;
      functional experimental online grocery store, to explore the effects of two low-cost&#xD;
      information and incentive-based strategies. These strategies comprise of injunctive&#xD;
      norm-based messaging and the use of financial incentive leveraging on loss aversion to&#xD;
      encourage the purchase of healthy foods. By leveraging a partnership with a local, commercial&#xD;
      online grocery provider, the investigators have set up an integrated store wherein products&#xD;
      will be purchased by participants and subsequently delivered to homes. This increases the&#xD;
      external validity of these interventions and enables investigators to establish greater&#xD;
      confidence in their generalizability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Asia-Pacific is faced with an epidemic of rising rates of chronic disease. Poor diet&#xD;
      quality is a demonstrated risk factor for non-communicable diseases. Excess intake of&#xD;
      calories, saturated fat and sodium increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes,&#xD;
      and other chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral economics has emerged as a promising strategy to increase the effectiveness of&#xD;
      interventions aimed to address risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Yet, there&#xD;
      is a gap in knowledge concerning how norm-based messaging and peer influence interventions&#xD;
      can be implemented to improve diet quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a three-arm randomized trial with a 3x3 crossover design, investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine whether norm-based messaging and peer comparisons, with or without financial&#xD;
      incentives, improve diet quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be exposed to all of the following intervention arms in random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Control arm. Participants will experience an unmodified version of NUSMart which&#xD;
      replicates the traditional shopping experience of online grocery stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: Participants will experience a modified version of NUSMart with norm-based messaging&#xD;
      and peer comparison features enabled. Nutri-Score labels will be enabled and displayed on all&#xD;
      products within the store. A floating side panel will provide a visual indicator of the&#xD;
      participants' average weighted Nutri-Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Same as Arm 2, except participants are notified of an additional $5 reward towards&#xD;
      participation reimbursement. However, this additional $5 will be forfeited if the basket&#xD;
      average weighted Nutri-Score falls below the average of participants' peers'. (Financial&#xD;
      incentive leveraging on loss aversion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Diet quality, as measured by mean Nutri-Score weighted by number of&#xD;
      servings of all basket items, will be greatest when exposed to the intervention with&#xD;
      norm-based messaging with incentive (Arm 3), followed by the intervention with norm-based&#xD;
      messaging without the incentive (Arm 2), followed by Control (Arm 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will test this hypothesis in total, and separately for foods and beverages&#xD;
      given Singapore's focus on reducing intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are shown a version of NUSMart which includes Nutri-Score labels that are enabled and displayed besides all the products in the store. Additionally, they are shown a video that gives them background information about Nutri-Score labels and describes the following features enabled in this intervention:&#xD;
Norm-based messaging will be displayed in the form of a happy or sad emoticon based on whether the participant's current basket average Nutri-Score (weighted by number of servings) is above or below &quot;other shoppers&quot; (Nutri-Score=3.98).&#xD;
Peer comparison will be implemented as a vertical ruler display of the participant's current basket average Nutri-Score (weighted by number of servings) as well as that of their &quot;peers&quot;.&#xD;
Nutri-Score=3.98 was chosen as it is 10% better than the mean Nutri-Score of baskets purchased by participants in the Nutri-Score labelled intervention arm of a prior study.</description>

    <description>Participants are informed that they have received an additional $5 towards their participant reimbursement. However, this amount will be forfeited if they check-out with a basket average Nutri-Score (weighted by the number of servings) that falls below the average Nutri-Score of &quot;other shoppers&quot; i.e. 3.98. An indicator on the screen that informs the participants of this potential forfeiting will be included.</description>
