  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background University students experience high levels of stress and this may negatively&#xD;
      impact their mental health, coping and academic outcomes. Building resilience has been&#xD;
      described as an ability to maintain mental well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims This study aims to (1) assess the feasibility of the Resilience Skills Enhancement&#xD;
      (RISE) program, (2) evaluate the effects of RISE on undergraduate students' resilience,&#xD;
      coping, emotion regulation, positive emotions and stress and (3) explore students' perception&#xD;
      of RISE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study will be operationalized in three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Feasibility A single-arm pre-post study will be used. 10 students will be recruited&#xD;
      to explore their acceptability, perception, and suggestions for improving RISE. RISE&#xD;
      comprises of six weekly sessions delivered via LumiNUS and Zoom. The Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test will be used to analyse the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Randomized controlled trial A prospective, double blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      and repeated post-tests will be used. A total of 122 students will be recruited from LumiNUS&#xD;
      and social media platforms. Participants will receive a series of six, weekly online sessions&#xD;
      in both groups. The primary outcome is resilience. The secondary outcomes include, coping,&#xD;
      emotion relation, positive emotions, stress. Multivariate analysis of variance with repeated&#xD;
      measures will be used to compare the mean difference of scores in the three time points&#xD;
      through Wilks's lambda test. The data will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Process evaluation A qualitative study using an individual, semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews will be used to explore students' perception of RISE. Approximately 20 students&#xD;
      will be recruited, and the final sample size will be determined based on data saturation.&#xD;
      Thematic analyses will be used to analyse the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential contributions This study will contribute by evaluating evidence-based user-friendly&#xD;
      RISE that may be effective for enhancing university students' resilience.&#xD;

    <description>Resilience will be measured using the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC, Connor &amp; Davidson 2003). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all the time), with higher scores indicating higher resilience. The CD-RISC has good psychometric properties (Windle et al., 2011) and validated among Singapore students (Chue &amp; Cheung, 2021).</description>

The following subscales from MSLQ will be used: (1) Control of learning beliefs, (2) self-efficacy, (3) test anxiety, (4) meta-cognitive self-regulation, (5) time and study environment and (6) effort regulation. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not true at all of me) to 7 (very true of me), with higher scores indicating better learning strategies.</description>

    <description>The RISE training was developed according to theory, empirical evidence and contextual information. The contents, components, pedagogy, and technical elements of RISE is established based on the resilience theory (Szanton &amp; Gill, 2010) systematic review and meta-analysis, meta-synthesis, and qualitative study (Ang et al., 2021). Ethical and quality standards was assessed using the Health on the Net code of conduct and the Health-Related Website Evaluation Form respectively. The overall rating of the designed RISE is more than 75% of the total possible points to ensure quality of website by three research team members.</description>
