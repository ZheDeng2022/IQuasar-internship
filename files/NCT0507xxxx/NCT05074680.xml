  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in&#xD;
      an ongoing global pandemic. It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases&#xD;
      of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or&#xD;
      whether pwCF have protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess&#xD;
      the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who&#xD;
      have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this&#xD;
      has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF&#xD;
      centres throughout the United Kingdom. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be&#xD;
      performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if&#xD;
      bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on, lung function, CF-related&#xD;
      medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination&#xD;
      receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations will be examined between socio-demographic and clinical variables and serologic&#xD;
      testing. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyse end-points will&#xD;
      be examined to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as subgroup&#xD;
      analysis of outcomes in lung-transplant recipients and pwCF receiving CFTR modulator&#xD;
      therapies. As pwCF receive COVID-19 vaccination a comparison of the development and&#xD;
      progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 over time will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) that&#xD;
      involves repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide&#xD;
      comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent&#xD;
      clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centres over a&#xD;
      3-year period. Study participants will include paediatric and adult pwCF. For the UK section&#xD;
      of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Network (ECFS-CTN) will be invited to participate. Participating investigators can enrol all&#xD;
      eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then followed up for 24 months.&#xD;
      Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic visits. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24 (to coincide with routine clinical&#xD;
      reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken opportunistically every time the participant&#xD;
      visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood samples could be related to, routine care,&#xD;
      annual review visits, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CF complications or when initiating new&#xD;
      treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast)&#xD;
      for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the blood samples the investigators will also collect clinical data from the&#xD;
      patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical&#xD;
      data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical&#xD;
      practice. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the&#xD;
      patients' medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, month 6, 12, 18 and 24 as per&#xD;
      the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling timepoints as previously explained&#xD;
      above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups&#xD;
      including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation&#xD;
      information, sputum microbiology and clinical and lung function parameters. Information on&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection history and vaccine receipt will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum follow-up duration of participation in the study for each patient will be 24&#xD;
      months. This study duration (24-month follow-up) is justified as it provides sufficient time&#xD;
      to observe changes in antibody prevalence over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as&#xD;
      sufficient time to determine long term clinical outcomes for pwCF who are SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      seropositive. Furthermore, we anticipate the 2-year study follow-up period will provide&#xD;
      sufficient time to observe the impact of vaccination on antibody levels given that a number&#xD;
      of vaccines are now commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the level of antibody responses between natural COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and vaccination in pwCF and how this varies over time. This will be achieved by&#xD;
      analyzing seroprevalence and antibody levels according to natural infection and vaccination&#xD;
      status and according to time of sample post infection or post vaccination, if known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Study sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who consent, a second blood sample will also be drawn into EDTA tubes&#xD;
      (plasma). Consent to this optional study sample would allow this sample and any remaining&#xD;
      serum (following antibody testing) to be stored for future analysis and allow further&#xD;
      research to be carried out on related studies to COVID-19 and CF.&#xD;
