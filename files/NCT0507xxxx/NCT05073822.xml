  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation provides the optimal form of kidney replacement therapy for the&#xD;
      majority of people with end-stage kidney disease, and has now become the commonest form of&#xD;
      kidney replacement therapy. However, donor and recipient demographics have changed&#xD;
      considerably over the past few decades: increasingly older donor kidneys are transplanted&#xD;
      into progressively older recipients with greater comorbidities. Increasing age remains a&#xD;
      major risk factor for death after kidney transplantation, with the commonest causes of deaths&#xD;
      for recipients aged 70 and over being cardiovascular, infection, and malignancies.&#xD;
      Immunosuppressant drugs which are critical for the maintenance of the transplanted organ can&#xD;
      contribute to increased morbidity and mortality, by direct effects or through lowered&#xD;
      immunity predisposing to infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common&#xD;
      opportunistic infections that affects renal transplant patient outcome and can be monitored&#xD;
      prospectively. Hence, minimising immunosuppression, especially in older recipients, may&#xD;
      result in better graft and patient outcomes as many side-effects are dose dependant. However,&#xD;
      to date drug doses have never been adjusted based on age, despite significant changes that&#xD;
      occur to immune responsiveness as patients grow older. In addition , researchers have not had&#xD;
      a biomarker to help define appropriate immunosuppressive levels for each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore aim to study the effect of reducing the target immunosuppression&#xD;
      drug levels( of tacrolimus and mycophenolate) in kidney transplant recipients &gt;60 years,&#xD;
      using CMV viraemia as a main outcome measure, and investigating rates of rejection and&#xD;
      development of de novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies. The investigators will assess the&#xD;
      clinical utility of donor-derived cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA) as a means to guide&#xD;
      immunosuppression minimisation. The investigators propose that the use of lower doses of&#xD;
      immunosuppression will result in fewer infection-related complications, translating to&#xD;
      improved patient outcomes. The research will be carried out in kidney transplant centres&#xD;
      where prospective CMV monitoring is practiced.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Older kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of infection and death from&#xD;
      infectious causes compared to younger transplant recipients, and despite knowledge of age&#xD;
      related immunological changes, the immunosuppressive protocol for older recipients was not&#xD;
      yet adjusted. Our provisional data suggest that standard dose immunosuppression in the older&#xD;
      patients results in more infections and fewer rejection episodes. Achieving a better balance&#xD;
      by reducing risk of infection would be highly desirable. Defining age-specific target drug&#xD;
      levels and doses should therefore be tested in a formal trial to establish its validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant recipients are especially at risk from viral and opportunistic infections; CMV is&#xD;
      a particular problem, as infections can be both donor-derived or due to re-activation of&#xD;
      latent virus in the recipient. In the transplant population, CMV infection can cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity, including bone marrow suppression, pneumonitis, colitis, retinitis and&#xD;
      encephalitis, and as a consequence, increased mortality. However, as this will be measured&#xD;
      prospectively, it can also be utilised as a marker of the degree of ( over) immunosuppression&#xD;
      in our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no current recommendations regarding optimal dose or target drug levels, and&#xD;
      importantly, no age-specific standards. This trial could provide some specific&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing body of evidence that demonstrates age-related changes to the immune&#xD;
      system, termed immunosenescence, characterized by reduced responsiveness to both newly and&#xD;
      previously encountered antigens. In transplantation, it is thought that such immunosenescence&#xD;
      may influence both the immune response of the recipient and the immunogenicity of the donor&#xD;
      organ. Understanding if this is in any way related to physical frailty may be helpful in&#xD;
      informing patients of risk of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) detected in the plasma of transplant recipients has&#xD;
      been increasingly reported as a noninvasive biomarker of acute rejection(AR)-with transplant&#xD;
      organ damage leading to release of more of the donor DNA into the bloodstream. A recent&#xD;
      systematic review showed that all but one of 48 relevant studies reported significant&#xD;
      elevations of dd-cfDNA at the time of biopsy-proven AR (BPAR), with successful treatment of&#xD;
      AR resulting in restoration of dd-cfDNA levels back to baseline. Furthermore, a rise in&#xD;
      dd-cfDNA can be detected before the clinical manifestations of rejection, with elevated&#xD;
      levels seen up to a month or more before diagnosis of BPAR in some studies. Using the&#xD;
      stability of the marker( a lack of rise) as a means of customising therapy has not been&#xD;
      attempted, and our study could provide the rationale for this strategy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators propose to conduct the study in two phases. Phase I will randomise renal transplant recipients over the age of 60yrs to either standard of care Immunosuppression (SOC-IS) or minimised immunosuppression (Min-IS) therapy, with monitoring of plasma dd-cfDNA levels over the first post-transplant year.&#xD;
There will be different target drug levels for tacrolimus: SOC-IS target levels of 8-12ng/ml in the first 3 months, 6-8ng/ml in months 4-12 and 4-8ng/ml after the 1st year; Min-IS levels 6-8ng/ml for first 3 months and 4-8ng/ml in months 4-12, For mycophenolate there will be two doses used: SOC-IS dose starting at 2g/day for 1 month, then 1.5mg/day between months 2-12, and then 1g/day after the 1st year; for Min-IS 1.5g/day in the first month and then 1g/day until 1 year post-transplantation. Outcomes will be assessed by the end of year 1</intervention_model_description>
