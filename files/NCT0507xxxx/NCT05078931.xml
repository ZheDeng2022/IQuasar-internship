    <textblock>
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard front-line treatment for patients with&#xD;
      EGFR sensitive mutations. Even though patients have a better response rate and longer PFS&#xD;
      comparing to chemotherapy, drug resistance have been an inevitable issue associated with&#xD;
      these drugs. The standard of subsequent treatment for TKI resistance at present is&#xD;
      chemotherapy (platinum doublet chemotherapy), which shows limited benefit with ORR 20-30% and&#xD;
      PFS nearly 4 months. Therefore, it is essential to develop the novel therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint therapy, which is based on negative regulatory mechanisms and targeted&#xD;
      enhancement of the anti-tumor immune response, is a novel and important therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      for lung cancer, especially for those patients with PD-1/PD-L1 positive advanced NSCLC. VEGF&#xD;
      signaling regulates immune suppression by promoting the expansion of suppressive immune cell&#xD;
      populations. Therefore, modulation of VEGF-mediated immune suppression could potentially&#xD;
      augment the immunotherapeutic activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Lenvatinib is a&#xD;
      multitargeted TKI with anti-tumor activity via inhibiting VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-4 and PDGFR. It&#xD;
      modulates the cancer immunity associated with a decrease in the population of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages and an increase in interferon-γ-producing CD8+&#xD;
      T cells. The combination of immune check point inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) and&#xD;
      lenvatinib could be a promising strategy to improve the immunotherapy outcome in lung cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Have undergone failure 1-2 prior EGFR-TKI (Osimertinib exposure required for T790M+)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1, as determined by the local site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: Lesions that appear measurable but are situated in a previously irradiated&#xD;
             area can be considered measurable (eligible for selection as target lesions) if they&#xD;
             have shown documented growth since the completion of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Tumor tissue that demonstrates PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumor cells (TPS ≥1%) as&#xD;
             assessed by IHC 22C3 pharmDx.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Assessment of PD-L1 expression must be made from provided archival tumor&#xD;
                  tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not&#xD;
                  previously irradiated. (A fine-needle aspirate, frozen sample, plastic embedded&#xD;
                  sample, cell block, clot, bone, bone marrow, cytologic specimen, or decalcified&#xD;
                  or formalin-fixed sample that was frozen at any point will not be acceptable for&#xD;
                  analysis). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks are preferred to&#xD;
                  slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has known untreated central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
             Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they&#xD;
             are radiologically stable (ie, without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by&#xD;
             repeat imaging (note: repeat imaging should be performed during study screening),&#xD;
             clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days&#xD;
             before first dose of study intervention.&#xD;

             tumor bleeding within 2 weeks before the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The degree&#xD;
             of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels should be considered because of&#xD;
             the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated with tumor shrinkage/necrosis after&#xD;
             lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a known history of an additional malignancy, except if the participant has&#xD;
             undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for&#xD;
             at least 3 years since initiation of that therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: The time requirement for no evidence of disease for at least 3 years does not&#xD;
             apply to the NSCLC for which a participant is enrolled in the study. The time&#xD;
             requirement also does not apply to participants who underwent successful definitive&#xD;
             resection of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer, or other in situ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (ie, with the use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is&#xD;
             not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; HIV testing is&#xD;
             not required unless mandated by the local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required systemic steroids or&#xD;
             current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             reactive or hepatitis B virus [HBV]-DNA detected) or known active hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV, defined as HCV-RNA [qualitative] detected or HCV antibody reactive, if HCV-RNA&#xD;
             is not the local SOC) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless mandated by the&#xD;
             local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has a history of a gastrointestinal condition or procedure that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator may affect oral study drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has significant cardiovascular impairment within 12 months of the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention, such as a history of congestive heart failure greater than New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Class II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident (CVA)/stroke, or cardiac arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has not recovered adequately from any toxicity and/or complications from major surgery&#xD;
             before starting therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the&#xD;
             participant's cooperation for the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with an mAb or has a&#xD;
             known sensitivity or intolerance to any component of lenvatinib or pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the first dose of&#xD;
             study intervention. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative,&#xD;
             a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Note: In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test&#xD;
             and the first dose of study intervention, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must&#xD;
             be performed and must be negative for the participant to start receiving study&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
