  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), or functional colopathy, is a chronic disease that affects&#xD;
      10% to 20% of the world's population.This syndrome is characterized by chronic abdominal pain&#xD;
      or discomfort as well as a change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) in the absence&#xD;
      of structural or metabolic abnormalities (e.g. celiac disease, Crohn's disease). These&#xD;
      symptoms have an impact on the quality of life of these patients who must therefore integrate&#xD;
      the management of their disease into their daily life.IBS is subdivided into 3 subtypes&#xD;
      according to the predominant symptom: the IBS-D subtype which groups together patients who&#xD;
      have a predominance of diarrheal episodes, the IBS-C subtype which groups together patients&#xD;
      who have a predominance of '' episodes of constipation and finally the IBS-M subtype which&#xD;
      includes patients whose two symptoms mentioned above are observed without predominance&#xD;

      In 2014, Fritscher-Ravens et al., Described for the first time the value of endomicroscopy in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of food allergies by observing the reaction of the duodenal mucosa to food&#xD;
      allergens in patients with IBS. They assessed the structural and functional changes that were&#xD;
      occurring in the intestinal lining in vivo and noted the following changes at the cellular&#xD;
      level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The layers of epithelial cells break down and are removed forming voids and inducing an&#xD;
           immediate increase in the fluid permeability of the duodenal mucosa. As a result, the&#xD;
           contrast agent penetrates the lumen, widening the space between the villi and changing&#xD;
           the appearance from black to white.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These changes were usually seen between 2 min and 4 min after exposure to the allergen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure, called FAST (Food Allergy Sensitivity Test), has since been used routinely in&#xD;
      certain centers in Germany. However, few studies have been published that have shown the&#xD;
      reproducibility of these results as well as the performance of this new test. The study that&#xD;
      the investigators propose to conduct is a prospective multicenter pilot study conducted in&#xD;
      the Trocadero Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Pre-test consultation The patients will first be seen by a nutritionist. During this&#xD;
      consultation, eligible patients will be offered, in addition to endoscopy performed in&#xD;
      current practice, the possibility of performing the FAST test during endoscopy. Up to 7 days&#xD;
      before the operation, a questionnaire allowing the assessment of the severity of symptoms&#xD;
      (IBS-SSS) will be provided to the patient who has agreed to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      answers to the questionnaire will be used as a reference to assess the evolution of symptoms&#xD;
      if a food exclusion diet were to be put in place following the procedure. Finally, two to&#xD;
      three days before the FAST test, the patient will be asked to follow an exclusion diet and&#xD;
      consume only hypoallergenic nutritional foods: rice, potatoes, olive oil, salt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Carrying out the test Before the start of the test, a standard high-end endoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed to look for any signs of structural mucosal abnormalities that suggest&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease. In the event of a mucosal abnormality observed on endoscopy, the&#xD;
      CLE FAST procedure will be canceled. In the case of mild reflux disease, the test may be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first challenge, 2.5 ml of 10% fluorescein (SERB) will be administered to the&#xD;
      patient intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before any challenge and after the fluorescein injection, to establish a comparison image, a&#xD;
      first acquisition with the endomicroscopy system of the duodenal mucosa will be carried out&#xD;
      on a minimum of 4 sites (approximately 20 seconds each) to verify the integrity of the&#xD;
      mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the acquisition of the reference sequences and during all subsequent acquisitions,&#xD;
      areas of the mucosa that show bleeding and other visible signs of inflammation will not be&#xD;
      imaged in order to avoid false positives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the reference images have been acquired, a first food allergen will be applied to the&#xD;
      duodenal mucosa starting with the most distal part of the duodenum. After 2 minutes following&#xD;
      the application of the allergen, observation using the endomicroscopy system can begin by&#xD;
      applying the GastroFlex ™ UHD probe to the duodenal mucosa where the allergen has been&#xD;
      projected. . Observation will last up to 3 minutes per site observed. If no reaction is&#xD;
      observed, the same manipulation will be carried out using a new allergen. If the observed&#xD;
      reaction is positive, the test will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test can be performed using up to 5 different allergens as long as the total time after&#xD;
      fluorescein injection does not exceed 30min.&#xD;
