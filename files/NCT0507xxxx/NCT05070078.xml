  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last several decades, many Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) have been&#xD;
      developed to provide assessment of patient health across multiple domains, as they relate to&#xD;
      various spine conditions. However, many of the available PROM surveys have many questions and&#xD;
      require substantial time to complete and/or assess one focal domain of health requiring&#xD;
      multiple tools to achieve an overall assessment of well-being. Thus, concerns have arisen&#xD;
      regarding patient survey fatigue and data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) is a single-question outcome measure that&#xD;
      asks patients to rate their function, as it pertains to the area being treated, on a scale of&#xD;
      0 to 100. The SANE score has excellent acceptance in some orthopedic surgery research, where&#xD;
      it has been shown responsiveness similar to more comprehensive legacy measures. The SANE thus&#xD;
      eliminates survey fatigue and has been validated across a spectrum of orthopedic&#xD;
      subspecialties. To our knowledge, however, the SANE has never been studied in a patient&#xD;
      population undergoing any type of spinal surgery. Thus, we set out to compare the SANE score&#xD;
      in patients undergoing lumbar discectomy to currently utilized PROM scores, including the&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Zurich Claudication Scale (ZCS), and short form-36 (SF-36).&#xD;

      Background/Rational: In the last several decades, many Patient Reported Outcomes Measures&#xD;
      (PROMs) have been developed to provide assessment of patient health across multiple domains,&#xD;
      as they relate to various spine conditions. When considered in concert, these instruments&#xD;
      quantify and stratify an individual's health state before and after surgery and can be&#xD;
      utilized to perform research as well as inform clinical practice. However, many of the&#xD;
      available PROM surveys have many questions and require substantial time to complete and/or&#xD;
      assess one focal domain of health requiring multiple tools to achieve an overall assessment&#xD;
      of well-being. Thus, concerns have arisen regarding patient survey fatigue and data&#xD;
      integrity. Ideally, a PROM would provide sufficient information to define health status&#xD;
      longitudinally, while requiring the least amount of time and effort to complete. The current&#xD;
      approach to PROMs in spine surgery research has been mostly to require an assessment of pain,&#xD;
      disease specific disability and general health, requiring answers for up to of 40 unique&#xD;
      questions, despite efforts to shorten the questionnaires in other neurosurgery and&#xD;
      orthopedics disciplines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score is one such example of a limited&#xD;
      question survey that aims to assess multiple domains. The SANE is a single-question outcome&#xD;
      measure that asks patients to rate their function, as it pertains to the area being treated,&#xD;
      on a scale of 0 to 100. The SANE score has excellent acceptance in some orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      research, where it has been shown responsiveness similar to more comprehensive legacy&#xD;
      measures. The SANE thus eliminates survey fatigue and has been validated across a spectrum of&#xD;
      orthopedic subspecialties. To our knowledge, however, the SANE has never been studied in a&#xD;
      patient population undergoing any type of spinal surgery. Thus, we set out to compare the&#xD;
      SANE score in patients undergoing lumbar discectomy to currently utilized PROM scores,&#xD;
      including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Zurich Claudication Scale (ZCS), and short&#xD;
      form-36 (SF-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Survey research design, prospective outcomes measure validation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: We hypothesized that the SANE score would correlate strongly and demonstrate&#xD;
      similar magnitudes of longitudinal responsiveness with the more lengthy and burdensome legacy&#xD;
      PROMs used in spine surgery research today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To correlate and confirm that SANE score to the more lengthy and&#xD;
      burdensome legacy PROMs used in spine surgery research today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: There are multiple secondary aims of this study as shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate patients' satisfaction after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess efficacy of treatment over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate patients' sense of functional improvement after lumbar disc procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gained from this study will greatly enhance our ability to know whether SANE&#xD;
      correlates with PROMS. Although the results of the trial will not directly benefit all the&#xD;
      individuals participating, information gathered from this study can help future patients by&#xD;
      reducing the burden of completing lengthy surveys and minimizing survey fatigue.&#xD;
