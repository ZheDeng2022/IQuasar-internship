  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of sleep is a large problem for many patients in hospitals. Common causes are nuisances&#xD;
      by light and sound. Especially with critically ill patients in the Intensive Care unit (ICU),&#xD;
      Medium Care Unit (MCU) and Cardiac Care Unit (CCU), who are are monitored intensively, a lack&#xD;
      of sleep often occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a lack of sleep more offer suffer from delirium, are more often anxious and&#xD;
      stressed, and have a longer length of stay in the hospital. Also, patients' lack of sleep&#xD;
      enhances nurses workloads during nightshifts. Because of this, there is a strong need for&#xD;
      innovative devices which aim to limit the light and sound nuisances and thereby enhance&#xD;
      patients' quality of sleep in the ICU, MC and CCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Maya is a special &quot;cover&quot; which can be placed over the head of the bed. As a result&#xD;
      patients are able to limit light and sound nuisances and enhance their privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this pilot-study we aim to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The feasibility and experiences of patients and healthcare professionals with the Maya.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect size of dependent variables which can be used in future studies.&#xD;

Half of the patients will use the Maya on the first, third and fifth day of their admission and will not use the maya on the second fourth and sixth day (group 1). The other half will use the Maya on the second, fourth and sixth day of their admission and will not use the maya on the first, third and fifth day (group 2).
