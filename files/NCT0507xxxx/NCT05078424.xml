      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      for youths in Hong Kong. It is to be carried out with 120 youths aged 12 - 24 recruited from&#xD;
      a series of community-based LevelMind@JC hubs, funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities&#xD;
      Trust. It is designed to improve the youths' abilities/ skills in handling moods to have&#xD;
      better emotional management. A written informed consent will be signed by participants.&#xD;
      Researchers will perform cognitive behavioural therapy on youths who agree to join the study.&#xD;
