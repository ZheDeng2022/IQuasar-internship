  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two commonly used treatments for latent tuberculosis infection are either 4 months rifampicin&#xD;
      or 6-9 months isoniazid. The invistigators will study the risk of acquisition of rifampicin&#xD;
      resistance in commensal Staphylococcus aureus in persons treated with rifampicin versus in&#xD;
      persons treated with isoniazide. Through repeated swab cultures before, during, and after&#xD;
      treatment the investigators will also investigate potential accumulation of mutations&#xD;
      associated with rifampicin resistance over time. Finally, household contacts to persons with&#xD;
      rifampicin-resistant S. aureus will be examined to investigate whether onward transmission of&#xD;
      rifampicin-resistant S. aureus occurs within households.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of rifampicin for treatment of latent tuberculosis has gained popularity due to a&#xD;
      shorter treatment course compared with isoniazide (4 versus 6-9 months) since this can lead&#xD;
      to a higher proportion of treatment completion. An estimated 25% of the global population is&#xD;
      latently infected with tuberculosis. Hence, a shift towards rifampicin instead of isoniazide,&#xD;
      which has a more narrow antibacterial spectrum, could have a large impact on the prevalence&#xD;
      of rifampicin resistance among commensal bacteria with pathogenic potential, such as&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the risk of acquisition of rifampicin resistance in&#xD;
      commensal S.aureus during out-patient treatment for latent tuberculosis using 4 months&#xD;
      rifampicin versus 6-9 months isoniazide at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs will be obtained from the nose, throat, groin and possible wounds for culture and&#xD;
      resistance testing before, during and after cessation of treatment for latent tuberculosis.&#xD;
      Whole genome sequencing will be used to analyze accumulation of mutations over time and to&#xD;
      determine if it is the primarily detected S.aureus that develop resistance or if the&#xD;
      individual is colonized by new, rifampicin-resistant S.aureus over the course of treatment.&#xD;
      Household contacts to persons with rifampicin-resistant S.aureus will be examined to&#xD;
      investigate onward spread of bacteria within a household.&#xD;
