      Measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid Sema4A levels in female subjects with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      and untreated relapsing multiple sclerosis, clinically stable relapsing multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      receiving disease modifying therapy, relapsing multiple sclerosis receiving disease modifying&#xD;
      therapy with breakthrough disease, or non-multiple sclerosis controls (patients without&#xD;
      inflammatory central nervous system disease).&#xD;

      This pilot study proposal will further investigate whether Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A) elevation&#xD;
      in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum is a potential disease activity biomarker in patients&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 female subjects between the ages of 18-55 who meet the criteria of one of the&#xD;
      following four groups will be enrolled to measure serum and CSF Sema4A levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Newly diagnosed/untreated Relapsing MS patients (RMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Clinically stable RMS patients receiving disease modifying therapy (DMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: RMS patients receiving DMT with breakthrough disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Non-MS controls (patients without inflammatory CNS disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide blood and CSF samples at baseline for Sema4A analysis. Follow up&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected at 6 months and 12 months as part of lymphocyte subset&#xD;
      analysis. Participation will end after 12 months of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected risks are related to blood draws and lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture will be&#xD;
      performed under fluoroscopy to decrease risks of pain from repeated needle punctures, injury&#xD;
      from incorrect placement of the needle, and post puncture CSF leakage.&#xD;

      Sema4A is measured in serum and CSF by a Sema-4A-specific ELISA (Biomatik). Frozen serum and&#xD;
      CSF samples will be sent to laboratory at Penn State for these measurements. Whole blood and&#xD;
      CSF will be obtained from each subject at the screening/baseline visit, with follow-up whole&#xD;
      blood at 6 and 12 months in patient Groups 1-3. We will also measure myelin basic protein&#xD;
      levels in the CSF and measure lymphocyte subsets in whole blood for Groups 1-3. These two&#xD;
      tests will be performed by the Providence clinical lab.&#xD;
