  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a pathophysiological process associated with aging and some metabolic&#xD;
      conditions characterized by progressive muscle tissue loss, which may lead to loss of&#xD;
      strength and performance and increased risk of falls and fractures, physical disability and&#xD;
      premature death. With the present project the investigator aim to assess the effect of a&#xD;
      feasible exercise program to improve muscle strength (primary outcome), and muscle volume and&#xD;
      performance and other measures potentially associated with sarcopenia (secondary outcomes) in&#xD;
      elderly and people living with HIV (PLWH) with sarcopenia. The investigators plan to enroll&#xD;
      98 elderly and 98 PLWH in a multicentric, 48-week, randomized, parallel-group, open label,&#xD;
      superiority trial comparing the effect of a home-based and app-monitored strength exercise&#xD;
      intervention versus no intervention. The investigators expect that participants who exercise&#xD;
      will improve strength and other parameters and that improvement at week 12 and week 48 will&#xD;
      be higher than in no-exercise controls.&#xD;
