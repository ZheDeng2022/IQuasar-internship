  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a parallel group randomized clinical trial of intrapartum nipple&#xD;
      stimulation versus exogenous oxytocin infusion for nulliparous women undergoing induction of&#xD;
      labor near term. The central hypothesis is that intrapartum nipple stimulation to induce&#xD;
      labor increases spontaneous vaginal delivery, improves patient-centered outcomes such as&#xD;
      childbirth satisfaction, labor agentry, and pain scores, and reduces adverse neonatal and&#xD;
      maternal outcomes in nulliparous women. The investigators will pursue the following specific&#xD;
      aims: 1) Assess the effectiveness of intrapartum nipple stimulation on the rate of&#xD;
      spontaneous vaginal delivery in nulliparous women (Primary Aim), 2) Determine the effect of&#xD;
      intrapartum nipple stimulation on the rate of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes&#xD;
      (Secondary Aim #1), 3) Determine the impact of intrapartum nipple stimulation on&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes (Secondary Aim #2) and 4) In a sub-cohort of women who are enrolled&#xD;
      in the trial, to measure the change in oxytocin concentration from baseline to time at which&#xD;
      patient achieves a regular contraction pattern, and to measure correlation between salivary&#xD;
      and serum oxytocin concentrations in patients undergoing induction of labor via intrapartum&#xD;
      nipple stimulation versus continuous exogenous oxytocin infusion. The investigators estimate&#xD;
      that randomizing a total of 562 women will provide adequate statistical power to detect&#xD;
      meaningful differences in the primary outcome.&#xD;
