  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, phase IV study, of real-life evidence destined to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of performing a treatment adapted to PET-CT in patients with stage I&#xD;
      and II DLBCL, without poor prognostic factors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients older than 17 years of age, with no upper age limit with a de novo histological&#xD;
      diagnosis of DLBCL, in stages I and II and without risk factors, will be included. All&#xD;
      patients will have a baseline PET-CT and will undergo 3 cycles of R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). A PET-CT will be performed on day 15-18 of the third&#xD;
      cycle that will be centrally reviewed. Those patients with negative PET-CT (Deauville 1, 2&#xD;
      and 3) will receive an additional cycle of R-CHOP and will finish treatment. Patients who&#xD;
      have PET-CT with a Deauville 4 score will complete a fourth cycle and then receive radiation&#xD;
      therapy to the compromised site. Those patients with a Deauville score of 5 should receive&#xD;
      rescue therapy, so they will be outside the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized follow-up of the patients included with tomographic controls will be carried&#xD;
      out, evaluating OS (overall survival) and PFS (progression-free survival) at 3 years as the&#xD;
      main objectives.&#xD;
