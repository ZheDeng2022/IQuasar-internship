      We aimed to describe the frequency; presentations, predictors, in-hospital outcome of&#xD;
      mucormycosis patients in the scope of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with COVID-19 associated Mucormycosis (CAM) admitted to Assuit University&#xD;
      Hospital between March 1, 2021, and July 30, 2021, were included in this study. The patient&#xD;
      characteristics, the site of mucormycosis, the comorbidities, the steroids usage, and the&#xD;
      outcome were analyzed in people with COVID-19.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:We recruited all cases admitted to Assuit University Hospital for the&#xD;
        management of COVID-19 and/or associated complications between March 1, 2021, and July 30,&#xD;
        2021, specifically those with probable mucormycosis based on clinical condition. At various&#xD;
        times, internists, intensivists, neurologists, and otolaryngologists were among the&#xD;
        specialists who assessed and treated them. Clinical; radiological and histopathological&#xD;
        confirmed cases of mucormycosis with coexisting or previous history of COVID-19 were&#xD;
        included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Participants with fungal infections other than mucormycosis or without a&#xD;
        confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (or serological evidence of preceding COVID-19) were&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
