    <textblock>
      The aim of the COVAG study (Covid-19 Antigen study) is to assess the diagnostic efficacy of&#xD;
      two of the most used rapid antigen tests (Roche &amp; Abbott).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at the Corona Test Center Stuttgart Cannstatter Wasen.&#xD;
      Approximately 2000 patients will be enrolled after having signed the Informed Consent Form&#xD;
      (ICF). Each patient will receive 3 nasopharyngeal swabs. Two for the rapid antigen tests from&#xD;
      Roche and Abbott and one for the RT-PCR. Furthermore an anamnesis, short clinical examination&#xD;
      and blood draw is done. The blood is examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and basic laboratory&#xD;
      tests to be communicated to participants.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread worldwide from Wuhan (China)&#xD;
           since December 2019. Reliable diagnostic technologies are pivotal to the fight against&#xD;
           COVID-19. While real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)&#xD;
           based testing of respiratory specimens remains the gold standard for COVID- 19&#xD;
           diagnostics, several commercial assays for antibodies against (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged&#xD;
           during the previous months (Stocking et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measuring the presence or absence of viral proteins (antigens), antigen tests may&#xD;
           provide results diagnosing an active SARS-CoV-2 infection much faster than RT-PCR or&#xD;
           equivalent tests. It has been argued that antigen tests may have a lower sensitivity&#xD;
           than RT-PCR or equivalent RNA-based tests, and as a result they are much more likely to&#xD;
           give false-negative results in individuals with lower amounts of virus. This may&#xD;
           possibly make them unreliable in individuals with an asymptomatic course of the disease,&#xD;
           in individuals in the first days of infection, and later than 5-7 days after onset of&#xD;
           symptoms (SYNLAB press release, 22.09.2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this non-interventional study is to demonstrate that rapid antigen&#xD;
           tests for SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott and Roche) provide fast results and perform equally well&#xD;
           than RT-PCR, at least in symptomatic patients with high viral loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be performed in at the Corona Test Center Stuttgart Cannstatter Wasen&#xD;
           operated by Dr. med. Hans-Jörg Wertenauer, Stuttgart, in close collaboration with the&#xD;
           SYNLAB MVZ Leinfelden-Echterdingen GmbH. Approximately 2000 patients will be enrolled at&#xD;
           after having signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Upon a scheduled study duration of&#xD;
           eight weeks, the investigators will be able to collect the required 2000 samples (50&#xD;
           patients per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
           One study visit is planned for data and blood collection (15,5 ml), antigen tests,&#xD;
           RT-PCR, serological tests, basic laboratory tests to be communicated to participants,&#xD;
           and ancillary blood tests (incriminated to be related to COVID-19 like inflammatory&#xD;
           markers, and micronutrients and vitamins). These will be performed at the at the SYNLAB&#xD;
           MVZ Leinfelden GmbH. Aliquots of the materials collected will be stored -20 degrees for&#xD;
           control measurements and ancillary tests, maximally for one year after the last patient&#xD;
           was enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the past weeks, there has been much discussion about rapid antigen tests for SARS-&#xD;
           CoV-2. The most recent generation of these tests, available from several different&#xD;
           suppliers, are expected to perform well in patients with high viral loads. This is&#xD;
           usually the case approximately 3-10 days after infection with the virus, when the person&#xD;
           is contagious, and may be asymptomatic or in the first days of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is therefore hoped that rapid antigen tests can support diagnosis of COVID-19 in&#xD;
           people who have the first symptoms. In the USA, some tests have received authorization&#xD;
           for diagnostic testing in symptomatic individuals, within 5-7 days from the onset of&#xD;
           symptoms (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Risks and benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three nasopharyngeal swabs and one blood sample will be obtained from each of the&#xD;
           participants. Antigen tests, RT-PCR and serological and ancillary laboratory tests are&#xD;
           performed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks from nasopharyngeal swabs: The biggest risk is discomfort. Rarely - 1 in thousands&#xD;
           - the person receiving the swab passes out from being super sensitive or gets a mild&#xD;
           nosebleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks from blood draw: The risks of venipuncture include being the most common reaction.&#xD;
           Significant complications (defined as cellulitis, phlebitis, diaphoresis, hypotension,&#xD;
           near syncope, syncope) are observed in Minor bruising at the site where the blood is&#xD;
           taken and hematoma (12 % approximately), with minor bruising approximately 3.5% of&#xD;
           patients. The most frequent single significant complication is hypotension at a&#xD;
           frequency occurred of approximately 2.6%. Syncope is seen in less than 1% of patients.&#xD;
           Other serious local reactions such as cellulitis or phlebitis are very rare (Galena HJ,&#xD;
           J. Fam. Pract. 1992 May;34(5):582-4). Blood sampling is therefore conducted in each of&#xD;
           the study sites under the surveillance of a board licensed physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Benefits to public health: Point of care antigen testing is an integral component of the&#xD;
           current national testing strategy serving for preventing of the spread of COVID 19&#xD;
           https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/Dateien/3_Downloads/C/C&#xD;
           oronavirus/Nationale_Teststrategie_kurz_041220.pdf There is, however, significant&#xD;
           uncertainty as to the reliability of antigen testing in comparison to the gold standard&#xD;
           of testing, rt-PCR. To the authors ́ knowledge a prospective, sufficiently sizeable and&#xD;
           challengeable evaluation of antigen testing under practice conditions has not been&#xD;
           completed so far. The current study is intended to close this gap. Its results are&#xD;
           urgently required and will have immediate impact on current recommendations for using&#xD;
           antigen testing. In particular, it will demonstrate weaknesses and strengths of antigen&#xD;
           testing and will allow to outweigh potential technical limitations of antigen testing&#xD;
           compared to rt-PCR against the advantage of short-term availability of test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further, the thorough recording of the clinical health status and the basic laboratory&#xD;
           analysis performed in this study, it will be able to get further insights into clinical&#xD;
           predictors for the susceptibility for COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Benefits to the individual. Participants will benefit in two ways. Other than with&#xD;
           rt-PCR, they will obtain the results of the antigen testing at once and on-site. In&#xD;
           addition, offering two antigen tests simultaneously, the results of the point-of-care&#xD;
           testing will be even more reliable than the result of a single test. Further, the&#xD;
           participants are offered a free of charge basic laboratory health check including the&#xD;
           following actionable health markers: basic blood cell count, C-reactive protein, HbA1c,&#xD;
           cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
           gamma-glutamyl-transferase, creatinine along with formula-derived creatinine, vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators conclude that benefits of this study to the healthcare system which is&#xD;
           faced with the life-threatening and to the individual study participants clearly&#xD;
           outweigh the minor and manageable risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include approximately 2000 consecutive male and female patients aged&#xD;
      18 years or above attending the Corona Test Center Stuttgart Cannstadter Wasen, in whom RT-&#xD;
      PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is medically indicated or requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects eligible for inclusion in this study must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to study participation. The patient must&#xD;
           be capable of understanding the nature, significance and implication of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age 18 years or more&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lack of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inability to understand the nature, significance and implication of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      7. Informed consent procedures Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after&#xD;
      providing IRB/IEC-approved informed consent. Informed consent must be obtained before&#xD;
      performing any study- specific procedures (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Assessment schedule and assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form, Collection of demographic data and X relevant Medical History&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche), PANBIO Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), RT-PCR&#xD;
      Serological test (blood sample, 15,5 ml) Ancillary testing 8.1 Demographics, Medical history,&#xD;
      sampling: Patient demographic data and other characteristic data to be collected on all&#xD;
      patients include sex, age, weight, height, relevant medical history, vital signs and symptoms&#xD;
      characteristic of COVID-19 including precise time specifications for onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No information about medication will be collected. Three independent nasopharyngeal swabs&#xD;
      will be obtained following standard procedures To avoid any bias due to the sequence of&#xD;
      taking the nasopharyngeal swabs, the investigators will randomly allocate the patients to&#xD;
      three sampling groups Group 1: RT-PCR - Antigen Test Roche - Antigen Test Abbott Group 2:&#xD;
      Antigen Test Roche - Antigen Test Abbott - RT-PCR Group 3: Antigen Test Abbott - RT-PCR -&#xD;
      Antigen Test Roche&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment of patients to each of these groups will be clearly specified on the case&#xD;
      record forms. There will be two forms for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Form 1: Routine analysis request sheet as used by the collection point for patient&#xD;
      identification which will be labelled with a bar code carrying the study number of a patient&#xD;
      Form 2: Study specific form containing a copy of the bar code with the study number, initials&#xD;
      of the patient and the year of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche): The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test is a rapid point&#xD;
      of care chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of specific antigens of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 present in the human nasopharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3 PANBIO Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott): Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is an in&#xD;
      vitro diagnostic rapid test for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) in human&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.4 RT-PCR: RT-PCR evaluates the presence or absence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in samples from&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and will be conducted according to the protocols&#xD;
      established at the SYNLAB MVZ Leinfelden GmbH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.5 Serological and ancillary testing: Blood samples (10 ml heparin plasma and 5.5 ml EDTA&#xD;
      plasma) will be collected to detect the presence of antibodies (specific immune response)&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic proteins (e.g. Roche, Abbott). Specifically, all participants&#xD;
      will be offered to receive the results for the following analytes in acknowledgment of their&#xD;
      participation in the study: blood cell count, C-reactive protein, HbA1c, cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, creatinine along&#xD;
      with formula-derived creatinine, vitamin D. Backup samples will be collected to determine&#xD;
      ancillary parameters like inflammatory markers, and micronutrients and vitamins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Observation Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIS schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start of the patient recruitment: February 1, 2021 End of the observation period: March 31,&#xD;
      2021 Final report: May 31, 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.Data analysis and statistical methods: A database of the pseudonymized data and results&#xD;
      will be generated. The investigators hypothesize that each of the antigen tests has a&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 in relation to RT-PCR which will be considered as the&#xD;
      reference test. A p value of less than 0.05 will be required to consider each of the two&#xD;
      rapid tests equivalent to RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aid of power calculations for chi-square tests for two degrees of freedom, required&#xD;
      type I error probability equal to 0.05, required (1-type II error probability)equal to 0.8&#xD;
      and required effect size equal to 0.1 (small effect size in the sense of (4)) the&#xD;
      investigators obtain a number of at least N=964 observations for consecutive testing of&#xD;
      incoming patients in order to fulfill our requirements on significance and power to answer&#xD;
      the first research question. Because of the expected number of around 10% positive out of&#xD;
      1000 cases, the assumption of a chi-square distribution is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also address the question whether different pre-test probabilities&#xD;
      will affect the sensitivity of the of the antigen tests. The investigators expect two major&#xD;
      indication groups with different pre-test probabilities contributing approximately 90 percent&#xD;
      of the rt-PCR positive samples: a) participants admitted for rt-PCR testing by a physician b)&#xD;
      participants seeking for rt-PCR testing upon recommendation my health care&#xD;
      authorities/contact persons. A total of approximately 200 rt-PCR samples will be required to&#xD;
      detect a statistically significant difference between these two groups at a type 1 error of&#xD;
      0.05 and a statistical power of 0.80. To answer this second question, the investigators will&#xD;
      extend the study to 2000 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Ethics: The study protocol will be submitted to the Ethics Committee the Medical Faculty&#xD;
      Mannheim, University of Heidelberg and the study will not begin until written permission is&#xD;
      obtained. The study will be conducted in accordance with German law, EU Clinical Trial&#xD;
      regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki on the ethical principles of clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 Patient information and Informed Consent: The objective, nature and extent of the&#xD;
      document must be explained in writing to every patient before he or she is included in the&#xD;
      study (Appedix 1). The patient must not be included unless he or she has given written&#xD;
      consent (Appendix 2). Patients will have the right to refuse to participate or to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study for any reason and at any stage without affecting the quality or accessibility&#xD;
      of their health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Data protection: The patient data collected for the study will be recorded in a&#xD;
      pseudonymised form (Appendix 4), with a patient number that cannot be attributed to the&#xD;
      identity of the patient. In the event of the study results being published, the personal data&#xD;
      may only be used if the patient's anonymity is upheld. The patient's data is guaranteed to be&#xD;
      always absolutely protected.&#xD;
