  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the preliminary efficacy of a lifestyle intervention including&#xD;
      low-carb/ketogenic diet and exercise, enhanced by self-monitoring through health technologies&#xD;
      on weight and diabetes outcomes (Glucose, HbA1c) and diabetic complications (cognitive&#xD;
      function, and renal function) in a 6-month randomized clinical trial in 60 overweight/obese&#xD;
      adults with or without T2D. Renal function will be assessed via both traditional and novel&#xD;
      biomarkers, including novel metabolites and mitochondrial function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in both groups will receive standardized health education sessions including&#xD;
      lifestyle management, blood glucose control, blood pressure control, and prevention of&#xD;
      diabetic complications from trained providers who are also investigators of this study. The&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention from the evidence-based Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program&#xD;
      (http://www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu/index.php/for-the-public/for-health-providers/group-l&#xD;
      ifestyle-balance-curriculum/) and Look AHEAD intervention (https://www.lookaheadtrial.org)&#xD;
      will be modified for this study. Goal for weight loss and physical activity will be set for&#xD;
      each participant based on recommendations from GLB and Look AHEAD. Lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      will be delivered through interactive digital lessons. Smart phone and mobile health devices&#xD;
      will be used for each participant to self-monitor diet, physical activity, weight, glucose&#xD;
      level, blood pressure, and blood ketone (if randomized to the low-car/ketogenic diet group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (mHealth+ low-fat diet group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low-fat group will be asked to restrict total calorie and total fat consumption according&#xD;
      to the Look AHEAD intervention and MyPlate guidelines, with 26-44% carbs, 10-30% protein, and&#xD;
      less than 30% fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group (mHealth+ low-carb/ketogenic diet group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low-carb/ketogenic diet group, will have total calorie set according to Look AHEAD&#xD;
      intervention, and carb consumption restriction will be set based on recommendations from&#xD;
      American Diabetic Association, National Kidney Foundation, and other evidence-based&#xD;
      resources. Participants in this group will be asked to consume a low-carb/ketogenic diet.&#xD;
      Specially, participants will receive a carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake goal based on&#xD;
      1.5 : 1 ratio (1.5 grams of fat to 1 gram of carbohydrate and protein combined). Daily&#xD;
      macronutrient and calorie consumption will be individualized for each participant using ideal&#xD;
      body weight as inferred from wrist circumference and activity level. Carbohydrate consumption&#xD;
      will be less than 10% (20~50 g), protein 10-20% (1.0~1.2g/kg ideal body weight), and fat&#xD;
      70-80% of total daily energy, respectively. Nutritional ketosis will be reached by consuming&#xD;
      such diet (0.5 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diet intervention materials will be developed by a registered dietitian according to the&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines. The dietitian will also be responsible to any study activities&#xD;
      relevant to diet. These activities include but are not limited to responding to some specific&#xD;
      diet questions to study participants and health related measurements relevant to diet&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interventionist, under supervision of a registered dietitian, will interact with each&#xD;
      participant from both groups at the beginning of the intervention as an introduction visit,&#xD;
      and three individual intervention sessions at month 1, 3, and 5. During the introduction&#xD;
      visit, the interventionist will set up a personalized weight loss goal and caloric intake&#xD;
      goal with the participants. The individual intervention sessions at month 1, 3 and 5 will be&#xD;
      arranged to solve the encountered problems regarding diet, weight loss, caloric intake and&#xD;
      action planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional communication through phone call will be used to support patient dietary changes&#xD;
      throughout the study based on their self-monitoring information.&#xD;
