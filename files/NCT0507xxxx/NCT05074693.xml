      The proposed research focuses on evaluating the mobile application, Easing Anxiety&#xD;
      Sensitivity for Everyone (EASE), to improve overall public health that concerns risks and&#xD;
      mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic and to minimize the existing health&#xD;
      disparities among Black, Latinx, and American Indian (BLAI) individuals during this time.&#xD;
      EASE provides COVID-19 symptom monitoring, exposure management skills, and psychoeducation on&#xD;
      stress and it's impact on infection and disease susceptibility. This study aims to compare&#xD;
      the effect of EASE to an empirical measurement of standard-of-care digital intervention and&#xD;
      to identify the effective mechanisms in EASE. The research hypothesizes EASE will facilitate&#xD;
      lowing anxiety and depression symptoms similarly across BLAI communities, will mediate&#xD;
      intervention effects by reductions in anxiety sensitivity and COVID-19 related stress and&#xD;
      fear, and will be able to assess potential moderators (perceived discrimination, social&#xD;
      support, socioeconomic status) of EASE effects.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited online via Facebook advertisements that target Oklahoma (OK)&#xD;
      and Texas (TX) residents. Individuals who click our Facebook ads will read the study&#xD;
      description and complete a brief study screener in REDCap. Those who initially meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will complete a phone call with study staff within 48 hours of completing&#xD;
      the REDCap screener. During this call, study staff will verify that each individual meets the&#xD;
      study inclusion criteria, staff will review study details with each individual; and&#xD;
      interested individuals will complete the informed consent process (signatures will be&#xD;
      collected digitally via REDCap). Participants will be randomized to either EASE or to a&#xD;
      series of educational videos covering topics like meditation, mindfulness, and stress&#xD;
      reduction techniques. The InsightTM app will be downloaded and activated using a unique&#xD;
      activation code to ensure that the participant is placed in their randomly assigned study&#xD;
      condition (EASE or Control).After downloading the InsightTM app, participants will use the&#xD;
      app to complete the baseline assessment (study staff will remain on the call to answer any&#xD;
      questions; we have used similar methods for multiple studies). Following completion of the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, the app will automatically begin prompting twice daily EMAs for&#xD;
      6-months. Participants will complete two scheduled daily ecological momentary assessments&#xD;
      (EMAs) during the intervention and continued assessment periods that will guide a&#xD;
      just-in-time approach to immediate, personalized behavioral health care. Assessments will be&#xD;
      completed remotely and no in-person study visits will be required. Participants will complete&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-month post-baseline (i.e., end-of-treatment and end of&#xD;
      3-month continued monitoring period) using the InsightTM app. Some will complete a&#xD;
      qualitative interview via phone or online platform (e.g., Zoom) at the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Racial/Ethnic Disparities. Significant racial/ethnic health disparities have emerged&#xD;
      in the United States (US)5 related to the novel 2019 SARS2-Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).17&#xD;
      Black and Latinx persons experience significantly higher rates of COVID-19 relative to their&#xD;
      proportion in the general population (19.9% and 31.4%, respectively),18 and the rate of&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases is 2.6 and 2.8 times higher among Black and Latinx persons, respectively,&#xD;
      relative to Non-Latinx White (NLW) persons.19 American Indian persons are 2.8 times more&#xD;
      likely to contract COVID-19 relative to NLW individuals19 and are approximately 5.2 times&#xD;
      more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 relative to NLW persons.5,8 Similarly, Black and&#xD;
      Latinx individuals are 4.7 times more likely to be hospitalized20 relative to NLW persons.&#xD;
      Indeed, proportionate prevalence rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations are highest among&#xD;
      American Indian, Black, and Latinx persons and lowest among NLW populations.20 Death from&#xD;
      COVID-19 is 2.1 times higher among Black, 1.1 times higher among Latinx, and 1.4 times higher&#xD;
      among American Indian relative to NLW individuals.19 These data highlight the&#xD;
      disproportionate, over-representation of BLAI individuals in COVID-19 infection rates,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and death relative to NLW individuals. Preexisting inequities related to&#xD;
      social determinants of health and the effects of racism have likely contributed to these&#xD;
      disparities.21 BLAI individuals are more likely to be affected by COVID-19-related stress&#xD;
      relative to NLW persons.9,10,22 Current rates estimate that 42.6% of Black and 46.3% of&#xD;
      Latinx individuals reported symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder between July 16-21,&#xD;
      2020.7 These estimates are in stark contrast to the estimated 11.3% of Black and 10.3% of&#xD;
      Latinx individuals who reported symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder from January -&#xD;
      July 2019.23 Although NLW individuals experience comparable, albeit slightly lower, rates of&#xD;
      anxiety or depression (38.8%), the racial/ethnic disparity gap for mental health outcomes is&#xD;
      widening. To illustrate, data from 2019 found 0.2-1.2% difference in elevated anxiety or&#xD;
      depressive symptoms between NLW and Black and Latinx persons, with NLW individuals evincing a&#xD;
      higher prevalence rate (11.5%).23 The inverse pattern is now true with Black and Latinx&#xD;
      persons reporting higher rates of these symptoms by 4-8 percentage points.7, 23 These data&#xD;
      offer valuable insight into the potential mental health disparities that are developing from&#xD;
      the pandemic. Additionally, although post-pandemic onset mental health data for American&#xD;
      Indians in the US is lacking, American Indian community leaders have expressed continued&#xD;
      concern for the mental health of their constituents given their propensity for worse physical&#xD;
      health outcomes if infected with COVID-19 and generally worse mental health outcomes,&#xD;
      including high rates of substance use and suicide.24,25 Further, BLAI populations have lower&#xD;
      access to mental health treatments and are less likely to engage with mental health&#xD;
      treatments,12,26 which may compound the severity of emerging COVID-19-related mental health&#xD;
      disparities.9,10 The pandemic has revealed changing mental health symptom patterns between&#xD;
      BLAI and NLW, and emerging COVID-19 disparities in mental health symptoms are likely to widen&#xD;
      without proper early intervention tactics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Stress and Health Disparities. Impediments to care for BLAI individuals (e.g.,&#xD;
      racism, discrimination, mistrust of medical providers) and social determinants of health that&#xD;
      make BLAI communities vulnerable to worse health outcomes (e.g., housing, income, access to&#xD;
      healthcare) are known factors for chronic stress. Stressors are events or conditions that&#xD;
      threaten, or are perceived to threaten, psychobiological equilibrium.27 From a&#xD;
      psychophysiological perspective, stress activates the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA)&#xD;
      axis.28 The HPA axis' main function is to regulate the stress response. Continued and&#xD;
      prolonged stress may disturb the HPA axis to the extent that negative feedback mechanisms are&#xD;
      disrupted and may contribute to poorer health outcomes.29 This perspective is in line with&#xD;
      the allostatic load theory, suggesting that continued stress can be associated with negative&#xD;
      physical and mental health outcomes.30 Notably, BLAI individuals are at increased risk for&#xD;
      high stress levels and greater chronicity of stress relative to NLW individuals, which&#xD;
      accounts for a substantial portion of racial/ethnic health disparities.31,32 In the US,&#xD;
      People of Color are more likely than NLW adults to report stress related to contracting&#xD;
      COVID-19 (71% vs. 59%), accessing healthcare (59% vs. 46%), and meeting basic needs (61% vs.&#xD;
      47%).33 Chronic or repeated activation of the HPA axis often corresponds to prolonged or&#xD;
      seemingly inescapable stressors, such as the present pandemic.34 As such, the additive effect&#xD;
      of COVID-19-related disease and stress burden exerted on stress responses systems saturated&#xD;
      with pre-existing chronic stress is likely to amount in worse short- and long-term mental&#xD;
      health outcomes among BLAI communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Stress Burden and Mental Health. Exposure to COVID-19 stress likely influences the&#xD;
      development, or exacerbation, of psychological and neurobiological processes that confer&#xD;
      vulnerability to multiple types of psychopathology, including anxiety and depression.3,4&#xD;
      Anxiety and depression represent two of the most commonly experienced mental health&#xD;
      conditions across race/ethnicity.35 In the following section, we describe a central&#xD;
      stress-based, transdiagnostic mechanism that may underlie the link between COVID-19 stress&#xD;
      and psychopathology, particularly anxiety and depression.36 Taking a transdiagnostic approach&#xD;
      allows the identification of core psychological and neurobiological processes that underlie&#xD;
      multiple forms of psychopathology.37 COVID-19 stress burden (accumulated impact of stress)&#xD;
      may have a particularly pernicious influence when it happens among persons already struggling&#xD;
      with greater stress exposure and pre-existing psychopathology. Specifically, higher degrees&#xD;
      of COVID-19 stress can influence patterns of social, emotional, and neurobiological&#xD;
      development in ways that facilitate the rapid detection of potential threats,38 and by&#xD;
      extension, may increase risk for multiple forms of psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of Stress and Stress Reactivity. Adverse life events increases the risk of&#xD;
      psychopathology, particularly disorders of emotion.39-41 Indeed, alterations in stress- and&#xD;
      threat-response systems may compromise emotion-and attention-regulatory systems.42 These data&#xD;
      have often been used to explain the heightened risk for behavioral and affective disorders&#xD;
      following exposure to adverse stressors in life.43,44 This transdiagnostic theoretical&#xD;
      framework also is at the crux of the assertion that increased rates of emotional disorders&#xD;
      are an inevitable consequence of the pandemic.45 After repeated exposure, a threat processing&#xD;
      system involving a rapid appraisal-response system develops that is capable of orchestrating&#xD;
      rapid reactions with little processing.46 Thus, individual differences in the tendency to be&#xD;
      'stress reactive' (i.e., appraise threat rapidly) provide a fertile theoretical and clinical&#xD;
      basis for understanding the nature of COVID-19 stress on emotional disorders among BLAIs&#xD;
      specifically (see A.4.b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety Sensitivity. Research in affective science has identified anxiety sensitivity (AS) as&#xD;
      an 'affect amplifier' because it represents a fundamental threat appraisal process.47&#xD;
      Specifically, AS refers to the fear of anxiety symptoms, including bodily sensations, which&#xD;
      results from beliefs about the harmful social, psychological, or physiological consequences&#xD;
      of such symptoms.48 AS has consistently been identified as a malleable risk factor for the&#xD;
      onset of panic attacks, panic disorder, generalized anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress, in prospective studies of adults across race/ethnicity.49-52 Specifically, AS has&#xD;
      been found to predict the development of panic attacks and has been linked to panic-like&#xD;
      symptoms, anxiety, fear, and clinical anxiety and depressive disorders across a range of&#xD;
      diverse community and clinical samples.52-56 It is important to note that AS predicts anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms above and beyond trait anxiety, demonstrating the incremental validity of this&#xD;
      construct.52,57 AS also has demonstrated strong racial/ethnic invariance across a range of&#xD;
      samples, including BLAI groups.14,54,55,58 Individuals with high AS may be more likely to&#xD;
      attend to bodily sensations that are associated with anxiety, such as respiratory symptoms,&#xD;
      stomach distress, fatigue, and body aches, and to misinterpret these symptoms as dangerous or&#xD;
      catastrophic.59,60 These interpretations of bodily sensations can lead to increased anxiety&#xD;
      and perpetuate a cycle of increased attention to and misinterpretation of bodily cues. This&#xD;
      process may eventually lead to avoidance and increased symptoms of anxiety, stress, and&#xD;
      depression, and it has the potential to exacerbate stress on the body systems, which, in turn&#xD;
      further compromises the immune system and places individuals at risk.61 This maladaptive&#xD;
      cycle may be particularly relevant to BLAI populations during the pandemic given their&#xD;
      increased likelihood of COVID-19 exposure, challenges with enacting behaviors to reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of infection, concerns about the increased likelihood of worse outcomes if&#xD;
      infected, and greater pandemic-related stress (e.g., job loss, income reduction, childcare&#xD;
      needs). Further, because some BLAI populations experience psychological distress&#xD;
      somatically,62-64 AS is particularly relevant to these groups because it amplifies threat&#xD;
      response to somatic perturbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS Relevance for BLAI Individuals. AS is highly theoretically relevant to BLAI individuals&#xD;
      based on several lines of work. First, BLAI individuals have increased awareness of the&#xD;
      negative outcomes of physical symptoms and illnesses.65-69 Second, BLAIs experience more&#xD;
      somatic symptoms, and are more distressed by these symptoms compared to NLW persons. Third,&#xD;
      BLAI individuals are more often diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric disorders than NLWs.70-72&#xD;
      Finally, affective disturbances are associated with an increased prevalence of comorbid&#xD;
      medical diseases, such as chronic pain, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease, and many of&#xD;
      these chronic medical conditions disproportionately affect BLAIs.73-75 Thus, interrelated&#xD;
      lines of work suggest that BLAI populations may be more apt to react to interoceptive&#xD;
      symptoms with heightened anxiety76,77 and mood disturbances. Yet, past work has not leveraged&#xD;
      the potential of AS to better address mental health inequalities in the context of the&#xD;
      pandemic which represents a unique and unprecedented period that may contribute to increased&#xD;
      mental health disparities.78-81&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS: Precision Medicine Treatment Target. Approaches to break the link between&#xD;
      AS-anxiety/stress/depression have been developed and have demonstrated strong efficacy.82-84&#xD;
      Indeed, AS is malleable in response to psychosocial intervention,85 making it a prime&#xD;
      mechanistic agent to target in prevention/intervention programs. Reductions in AS improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes among general clinical and nonclinical populations, highlighting the&#xD;
      relevance of this construct within the general population.85,86 AS reduction treatment can be&#xD;
      distilled in as few as 1-4 treatment sessions both in-person or via computer, with equal&#xD;
      success.83,87,88 AS treatment decreases AS by providing psychoeducation about the true&#xD;
      dangers of anxiety related bodily sensations; cognitive restructuring of catastrophic&#xD;
      appraisals of anxiety related bodily sensations and life experiences; and by helping&#xD;
      individuals develop greater tolerance to these sensations through interoceptive and in vivo&#xD;
      exposure exercises. Such decreases, in turn, result in reduced anxiety, depression, and&#xD;
      related conditions (e.g., stress burden).89 Thus, a cognitive-behavioral approach that&#xD;
      targets maladaptive cognitions about bodily symptoms (i.e., AS) may have significant clinical&#xD;
      utility in decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms in the context of COVID-19. Indeed,&#xD;
      COVID-19 stress and associated beliefs for exposure and health-risk associated with COVID-19,&#xD;
      which is likely to be elevated among BLAI persons, may motivate vigilance to internal&#xD;
      sensations. COVID-19 may thus serve as a context in which individuals learn to fear bodily&#xD;
      sensations because such sensations could potentially have harmful consequences.90 Yet,&#xD;
      intervention work to address the impact of AS on mental health outcomes among BLAI&#xD;
      individuals has not been leveraged in the context of COVID-19 stress.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in impairment in daily functioning due to the COVID-19 pandemic as measured by the Daily Activities scale from Baseline to subsequent follow-ups.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is comprised of three statements asking participants to rate the extent to which they feel impaired in their daily activities (i.e. feeling motivated, exercising, and feeling fatigued) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants are asked to rate the level to which they agree with each statement (e.g. &quot;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I am having trouble feeling motivated&quot;) using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all true) to 3 (Very true). Higher scores indicate higher levels of impairment in daily function due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

    <measure>Levels of perceived discrimination as measured by the Everyday Discrimination Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) is a six-item scale that assesses perceptions of discrimination or unfair treatment. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they've experienced discrimination or unfair treatment using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (At least once a week). Higher scores indicate higher, more frequent, levels of experienced discrimination or unfair treatment. The Everyday Discrimination Scale will be utilized to explore whether perceived racial discrimination functions as a moderator of the EASE effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in perceived racial bias/discrimination due to the COVID-19 pandemic as measured by the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale from Baseline to subsequent follow-up appointments.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale (CRBS) is a brief self-report questionnaire developed by Fordham University's Center for Ethics Education and Applied Developmental Psychology Program as part of the Pathways to Health Study. Questions include beliefs regarding Coronavirus-related increase in negative racial/ethnic public attitudes, racial/ethnic biases resulting in loss of employment and access to health services and increases in racially charged social media and cyberbullying. Each item on the CRBS is rated on a 4-point scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher score indicate higher levels of perceived racial bias/discrimination due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CRBS will be utilized to explore whether perceived racial discrimination due to the COVID-19 pandemic functions as a moderator of the EASE effects.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear of COVID-19 Scale is a self-report measure aimed at assessing fear of COVID-19, and emotional fear reactions towards the pandemic. Participants are requested to respond on a five-item Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with a higher sum score indicating a higher fear of COVID-19. The Fear of COIVD-19 scale will be used to explore whether Intervention effects on study outcomes are mediated by reductions in fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

    <measure>Levels of acculturation expressed by participants as measured by the Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale is a 12-item measure that assesses an individual's level of acculturation to a host culture. Participants are asked questions that assess whether they identify more with U.S. culture, or their culture of origin. Items are presented with a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely well). For questions that ask participants how strongly they feel apart of U.S. culture, higher scores indicate higher levels of acculturation. For questions that ask about their future of origin, higher score indicate lower levels of acculturation. This measure will be used to assess whether acculturation functions as a moderator of the EASE effects</description>

    <measure>The Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity Scale Assessing Pain Intensity and Interference will be used to gain a granular understanding of the health behaviors (i.e. pain experience) affected by COVID-19 among those who do and do not contract the virus.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The PEG Scale is a three-item scale assessing pain intensity and interference. Participants are presented with a 10-point likert scale ranging from 0 (No pain) to 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). Participants are asked about their experienced level of pain over the past week, and the extent to which their pain has interfered with their life. Higher scores indicate higher levels of pain related impairment.</description>

    <measure>The Employment Status questionnaire will be used to obtain a granular understanding of the sequelae (e.g., job loss, eviction, reduction of unemployment benefits) of the COVID-19 pandemic among those who do and do not contract the virus.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Employment Status questionnaire contains three items that ask about employment status during the 2020 &amp; 2021 COVID pandemic, current employment status, and levels of stress surrounding participants' current employment status. When asked about employment status, participants can chose from a list of statues (e.g., I was required to work from home, I lost a job, I was given paid time off, etc.). When asked about their levels of stress regarding their current employment situation, participants are presented with an 7-item Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (A great deal), with higher score inducing higher level of stress.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The COVID-19 Substance Use scale will be used to gain a granular understanding of the health behaviors (i.e. substance use) affected by COVID-19 among those who do and do not contract the virus.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The COVID-19 Substance Use measure contains 4 items that asked about changes in substance use (i.e. alcohol, marijuana, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes) from before the pandemic, to now. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which their use of each substance changed from before the pandemic to now using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (I am drinking a little more now) to 5 (I completely stopped drinking). Higher scores indicate less current substance use, while lower scores indicate in increase in substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
