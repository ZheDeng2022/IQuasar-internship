  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear, and the disease characteristics of IBD patients are&#xD;
      affected by genetic susceptibility genes. Therefore, this study aims to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between genetic susceptibility genes of IBD and the pathogenesis of IBD in&#xD;
      Chinese Han population, in order to clarify the pathogenesis of IBD and provide basis for&#xD;
      individualized treatment of IBD.&#xD;

      The pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear, and the disease characteristics of IBD patients are&#xD;
      affected by genetic susceptibility genes. Therefore, this study aims to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between genetic susceptibility genes of IBD and the pathogenesis of IBD in Han&#xD;
      Chinese, in order to clarify the pathogenesis of IBD and provide basis for individualized&#xD;
      treatment of IBD.In this study, 5ml peripheral venous blood was drawn from IBD patients and&#xD;
      normal controls for gene testing.To investigate the relationship between polymorphisms of&#xD;
      TRAIL, ITGA4, ICAM1, ITGA4, ICAM1, LTA, FCGR3A, TRAP1, TNFRSF1B, CDKN2B-AS1 and&#xD;
      susceptibility to IBD in Chinese Han population.&#xD;
