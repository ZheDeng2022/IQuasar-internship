  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many South African men do not visit clinics or get tested due to multiple real and perceived&#xD;
      barriers. Nkangala District has significant gaps to identifying PLHIV who are not on ART,&#xD;
      reaching their ART targets, especially in adult men. Over 65% of PLHIV not on ART are men,&#xD;
      which is a gap of over 39,000 men living with HIV needing to be tested and initiated on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve case finding among men in Nkangala we will evaluate how best to reach&#xD;
           partners of PLHIV (newly diagnosed or on ART) with index testing by using HIV&#xD;
           self-screening (HIVSS) and linkage to ART start.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary distribution of HIV self-screening kits (HIVSS), whereby clients bring HIVSS&#xD;
           kits to their partners, addresses barriers by enabling partners to screen themselves at&#xD;
           their convenience and in the privacy of their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: BroadReach in collaboration with UCLA, UCT and Nkangala DOH will pilot test&#xD;
      an innovative index partner HIVSS strategy in one urban and one rural clinic to evaluate&#xD;
      acceptability, barriers, and efficacy of secondary HIVSS distribution in a randomized control&#xD;
      trial enrolling women newly diagnosed with HIV or on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the intervention arm, women will receive counselling on how to use HIVSS, how to&#xD;
           encourage their male partner to screen, and 2 oraquick HIVSS with instructions and&#xD;
           invitation to return for confirmatory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the standard of care arm, index women will receive counselling on the importance of&#xD;
           disclosure to their family and partner(s) and referral for HIV testing (per South&#xD;
           African national guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized control trial of n=180 WLHIV (90 in each arm) in four facilities&#xD;
      (urban and rural) in the Nkangala district ensure that the results are generalizable.&#xD;

      Many South African men do not visit clinics or get tested due to multiple real and perceived&#xD;

           partners of PLHIV (newly diagnosed or on ART) with index testing by using HIV&#xD;
           self-screening (HIVSS) and linkage to ART start.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary distribution of HIV self-screening kits (HIVSS), whereby clients bring HIVSS&#xD;
           kits to their partners, addresses barriers by enabling partners to screen themselves at&#xD;
           their convenience and in the privacy of their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will partner with BroadReach Healthcare, a PEPFAR partner in South Africa, to pilot test&#xD;
      an innovative index partner HIVSS strategy in one urban and one rural public health clinic in&#xD;
      the Nkangala district of Mpumalanga Province to evaluate acceptability, barriers, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of secondary HIVSS distribution in a randomized control trial enrolling&#xD;
      women newly diagnosed with HIV or on ART. In the intervention arm, women will receive&#xD;
      counselling on how to use HIVSS, how to encourage their male partner to screen, and 2 HIVSSs&#xD;
      with HIVSS instructions and invitation to return for confirmatory testing. In the standard of&#xD;
      care arm, index women will receive counselling on the importance of disclosure to their&#xD;
      family and partner(s) and referral for HIV testing (per SA national guidelines). We will&#xD;
      evaluate the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a mixed-methods survey with N=180 HIV+ women to assess perceived acceptability&#xD;
           and barriers (including perceived safety, IPV) to secondary HIVSS distribution by women&#xD;
           to male partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of secondary HIVSS distribution through a&#xD;
           1:1 randomized control trial in n=180 HIV+ women to assess, comparing standard of care&#xD;
           to intervention arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. % of index women who self-report that they gave the HIVSS or standard of care&#xD;
                referral for testing to their male partner&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. % of male partners who either screened or tested for HIV assessed at 3 months after&#xD;
                randomization (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Measured via options of: index or partner self-report, SMS/WhatsApp of a picture of&#xD;
           the used HIVSS sent by partner or index, return of a used self-test to the facility by&#xD;
           either the index or partner, and/or partner coming into facility for with an invitation&#xD;
           for confirmatory testing or SOC counseling referral c. % of male partners with a&#xD;
           positive HIV screening/test result d. % of newly diagnosed male partners who initiate&#xD;
           ART within 3 months of diagnosis e. % of those on ART with viral suppression after 6&#xD;
           months on ART (index and partners)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the intervention arm, we will assess acceptability and barriers (including&#xD;
           safety/IPV) related to HIVSS distribution or use via surveys with all intervention&#xD;
           participants who return for the study endline survey and a convenience samples of n=20&#xD;
           male partners (n=10 men who used HIVSS and n=10 men who did not use HIVSS)&#xD;
