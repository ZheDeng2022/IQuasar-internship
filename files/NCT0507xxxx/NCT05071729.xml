  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have vasomotor symptoms (VMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms of VMS are hot flashes. These symptoms can be caused by changes in sex hormone&#xD;
      levels. An example of a change in sex hormone levels is when a woman reaches the time in&#xD;
      their life where they no longer have their period. Hormones are substances in the blood that&#xD;
      help body organs to work in specific ways. Women who no longer have their period may have a&#xD;
      protein called neurokinin sending more signals than usual to other parts of the body.&#xD;
      Researchers think that this may play a role in causing VMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about a new substance called elinzanetant.&#xD;
      Researchers think elinzanetant may help people with VMS. It works by blocking neurokinin from&#xD;
      sending signals to other parts of the body. There are treatments available for VMS, but these&#xD;
      do not work for all people and may cause medical problems for some people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to help the researchers learn more about how elinzanetant&#xD;
      moves into, through and out of the body in participants with kidneys that do not work as well&#xD;
      as they should compared to healthy participants whose kidneys work normally. To do this, the&#xD;
      doctors will take blood samples from the participants at different times during the study and&#xD;
      measure the levels of elinzanetant in the blood. This will help the researchers learn more&#xD;
      about whether elinzanetant could be given to treat VMS in people who also have kidneys that&#xD;
      do not work as well as they should.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include adult participants who have kidneys that do not work as well as they&#xD;
      should and participants whose kidneys work normally. The participants who have kidneys that&#xD;
      do not work as well as they should will be split into 2 groups based on how severe their&#xD;
      kidney problems are. All of the participants will take elinzanetant once as a tablet by&#xD;
      mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be in the study for about 1 month and will stay at their study site for&#xD;
      7 days in a row. During this visit, the participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have their overall health checked&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have scans of their heart taken using an electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood and urine samples taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  answer questions about how they are feeling, what medications they are taking, and what&#xD;
           adverse events they are having&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors will keep track of any adverse events. An adverse event is any medical problem&#xD;
      that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen&#xD;
      in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
