  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of ctDNA-MRD&#xD;
      based adjuvant furmonertinib therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage I lung adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      patients after complete surgical resection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite surgery provides the best chance for the cure of early-stage lung cancer patients,&#xD;
      20%-40% of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients still suffer from disease&#xD;
      relapse after R0 resection. One of the important strategies to improve survival is adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adjuvant chemotherapies are reported to improve outcomes of patients with stage II and&#xD;
      III lung cancer. However, for stage IA patients, adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended,&#xD;
      while its application in stage IB patients is still controversial. The adjuvant targeted&#xD;
      therapy has shown promising effectiveness which can lead to better RFS of EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patients than chemotherapy in according to several&#xD;
      phase III studies. According to the ADAURA study, stage IB NSCLC patients can benefit from&#xD;
      the third-generation EGFR-TKI. However, no available study has evaluated the effectiveness of&#xD;
      adjuvant targeted therapy in the overall cohort of stage I patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular residual disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) refers to residual tumor cells&#xD;
      or relative biomarkers that persist in the body after treatment and is below the conventional&#xD;
      detection limit. Several studies have confirmed that positive MRD was associated with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to reflect MRD at the molecular level can&#xD;
      overcome the shortcomings of conventional tests or radiological tests in the detection of&#xD;
      recurrence. ctDNA has been proven to detect MRD effectively in stage I-III lung cancer&#xD;
      patients and identifying MRD after surgery could facilitate the selection of patients for&#xD;
      customized adjuvant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators innovatively propose this study to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      adjuvant targeted therapy (furmonertinib, one third-generation EGFR-TKI) in stage I lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma patients and explore the role of ctDNA as an MRD monitoring marker in guiding&#xD;
      personalized adjuvant therapies.&#xD;
