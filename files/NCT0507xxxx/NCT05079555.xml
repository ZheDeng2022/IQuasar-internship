  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is one of the most common traumas associated with falls in the elderly, severely&#xD;
      affecting the patient's mobility and independence. The treatment involves hospitalization and&#xD;
      prolonged rehabilitation periods with high costs which are associated with an increased&#xD;
      mortality rate due to health complications. In recent years, the use of robotic applications&#xD;
      has proven to be effective in gait rehabilitation, especially for neurological disorders.&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of research in robotic rehabilitation focused on the hip fracture of&#xD;
      elderly people. This study presents the validation of a novel robotic platform for hip&#xD;
      rehabilitation called SWalker aimed at improving the rehabilitation of this condition in&#xD;
      comparison with conventional rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The performance of the SWalker platform was assessed at Albertia Servicios Sociosanitarios&#xD;
      S.A. nursing homes. Clinical validation was conducted with hip fracture patients. The control&#xD;
      group consisted of patients who followed conventional therapy, while the intervention group&#xD;
      consisted of patients rehabilitated using SWalker. Allocation to groups was according to the&#xD;
      choice of the participants. All patients had the possibility to use SWalker treatment.&#xD;
      Physiological parameters, and functional assessment scales such as FAC and Tinetti were&#xD;
      collected at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Gait recovery and&#xD;
      rehabilitation process indicators were also gathered. The total duration of the clinical&#xD;
      validation was 15 months. For each patient, the total duration of treatment was between 1&#xD;
      week and 1 month with the robotic platform. For those patients who received conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation, treatment duration was up to 6 months in the most severe case. Patient&#xD;
      follow-up was conducted in parallel with the clinical trials.&#xD;
