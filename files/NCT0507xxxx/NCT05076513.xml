  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 0 study with an expansion phase that will enroll up&#xD;
      to 24 participants with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma and up to 18 recurrent glioma&#xD;
      participants with IDH mutation and ATRX loss. The trial will be composed of a Phase 0&#xD;
      component (subdivided into Arm A and B) and a therapeutic expansion phase. Patients with&#xD;
      tumors demonstrating a positive PK Response (in Arm A) or a positive PD Response (in Arm B)&#xD;
      of the Phase 0 component of the study will graduate to a therapeutic expansion phase that&#xD;
      combines therapeutic dosing of niraparib plus standard-of-care fractionated radiotherapy (in&#xD;
      Arm A) or niraparib monotherapy (in Arm B) until progression of disease.&#xD;
