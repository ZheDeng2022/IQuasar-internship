  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MVX-ONCO-2 is a patient-specific, cell-based, active immunotherapy where the participant's&#xD;
      immune response to their own tumor cells is stimulated and/or increased. MVX-ONCO-2 is&#xD;
      composed of a cell suspension of irradiated autologous tumor cells and two capsules loaded&#xD;
      with allogenic genetically modified cells releasing an immunomodulator,&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). MVX-ONCO-2 is an evolution of&#xD;
      MVX-ONCO-1, which was approved for clinical investigation under the same category in a phase&#xD;
      I and a phase II clinical trials. The objectives of the trial are to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and signals of efficacy of MVX-ONCO-2 in participants with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

    <description>One administration of MVX-ONCO-2 (or vaccination) consists of the implantation of 2 capsules containing MVX-2 cells and 1 injection of 4 × 10^6 lethally irradiated autologous tumor cells. Tumor cells will have prealably been harvested from the participant through a surgical procedure.&#xD;
A full treatment course with MVX-ONCO-2 consists of a total of 6 vaccinations: 4 vaccinations 1 week apart, followed by 2 boosters 2 weeks apart. Capsules are removed 1 week after implantation.</description>
