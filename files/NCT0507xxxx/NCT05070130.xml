  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study it is aimed to determine the diagnostic value of physiological measurements in&#xD;
      the presence of aortic stenosis, and whether these are more accurate than angiographic&#xD;
      assessment. Post-TAVR FFR will be taken as the reference for predicting ischemic lesions, and&#xD;
      angiography and physiology - FFR and diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) - will be performed&#xD;
      immediately before and after TAVR, in an all-comer multicentric observational study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing, prospective, observational, single arm, multi-center, single&#xD;
      country study in Subjects who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis with a formal&#xD;
      indication for TAVR, and one or more intermediate coronary lesions in a relevant coronary&#xD;
      artery (&gt;2mm). This study aims to assess if OpSens non-hyperemic dPR (based on a proprietary&#xD;
      algorithm) and/or OpSens FFR are suitable methods for the physiological assessment and&#xD;
      prediction of ischemic coronary lesions in Subjects with aortic stenosis who are considered&#xD;
      for TAVR. This will be done by comparing pre-TAVR measurements of angiography, dPR and FFR&#xD;
      and placing them against the post-TAVR FFR, which is considered as the gold standard. Also&#xD;
      the post TAVR dPR will be compared with post-TAVR FFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 137 subjects will be enrolled in 5 to 10 sites in Spain to obtain the required&#xD;
      minimum of 137 lesions (see section 11.2 Sample Size Determination) The main hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the specificity to predict ischemic lesions in TAVR candidates based on a pre-TAVR dPR ≤&#xD;
      0.89 is superior compared to the specificity based on angiography alone (both QCA and visual&#xD;
      assessment of the stenosis &gt;50%), taking the post-TAVR FFR value of ≤ 0.80 as a reference for&#xD;
      positive lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pressure guidewire used to measure dPR and FFR during diagnostic angiography is the&#xD;
      commercially available (CE-marketed) OptoWire family of pressure guidewires from OpSens Inc.&#xD;
