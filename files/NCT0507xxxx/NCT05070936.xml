  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular hypofunction is a disease which emerge through a partial or total loss on a&#xD;
      vestibular organ or vestibular nerve. It can be seen unilateral or bilateral. Aim of the&#xD;
      study is to examine effects of vestibular rehabilitation on kinesiophobia, quality of life,&#xD;
      dynamic vision acuity and balance. The study was conducted with patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      vestibular hypofunction. 30 patients who are in the ages between 18 and 65 have participated&#xD;
      in the study. Exercise programs has given to patients to do at home. Patients were observed&#xD;
      every two weeks in the hospital. The following exercises were done with the patients: both&#xD;
      sitting and standing gaze stabilization exercises, neck joint range of motion exercises, 20&#xD;
      minutes walks outside, walking backwards both open and closed eyes, and walking on tandem&#xD;
      both open and closed eyes. Exercise program was applied for 8 weeks. Before and after the&#xD;
      treatment, Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Short&#xD;
      form in Turkish, Dynamic Visual Acuity Test, Balance Tests, Unterberger Test, Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale to measure dizziness and fatigue, for verticality and horizontality perception&#xD;
      Subjective Visual Vertical and Subjective Visual Horizontal tests have been applied. As a&#xD;
      result of the study, statistical correlations have been found except semi-tandem posture test&#xD;
      with eyes open and Romberg's test both with eyes open and closed. It can be said that&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation has improved quality of life, balance, dynamic vision acuity and&#xD;
      overcame kinesiophobia on the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular rehabilitation consisted of a total of 4 sessions, rearranged every 15 days. These&#xD;
      exercises were prepared gradually to increase the vestibulo-ocular reflex and vestibulospinal&#xD;
      reflex. The following exercises were done with the patients: both sitting and standing gaze&#xD;
      stabilization exercises, neck joint range of motion exercises, 20 minutes walks outside,&#xD;
      walking backward both open-and-closed eyes, and walking in tandem with both open-and-closed&#xD;
      eyes. The therapist gave the patients a home exercise program. It was emphasized that the&#xD;
      exercises should be applied as 10 repetitions. After the session, the exercises shown to the&#xD;
      patients were explained in written form and given as home exercises. They were also asked to&#xD;
      do home exercises 3 times a day, 10 repetitions, for 15 days. Evaluation of the patients was&#xD;
      done at the beginning of the first session and the 4th session. Thus, 3 separate exercise&#xD;
      sessions and a home exercise program were applied to the patients.&#xD;
