      Patients presenting to an musculoskeletal (MSK) outpatient clinic who fit the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria (low back pain, outer hip pain) will be randomized to receive an exercise&#xD;
      prescription with patient education alone, or in clinic patient education and access to the&#xD;
      Patient Education Tool (Series of videos). Weekly surveys will be done via email to assess&#xD;
      patient adherence: the main outcome. Two follow-up in-clinic visits at weeks 6 and 12 will&#xD;
      assess pain, function and exercise self-efficacy: the secondary outcomes. Comparisons will be&#xD;
      made between the group of the patients who received the videos and those who did not.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal conditions are a very common, if not the most common, reason to visit the&#xD;
      family doctor, comprising an estimated one-in-six to over half6 of all primary care visits.&#xD;
      Under this umbrella of musculoskeletal conditions fall many different aliments: this paper&#xD;
      will investigate chronic nonspecific low back pain and greater trochanter pain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boasting titles for greatest number of disability-years caused by a disease and most common&#xD;
      non-communicable disease, one would hope that researchers and clinicians would thoroughly&#xD;
      understand what causes this pervasive morbidity. Unfortunately, when it comes to chronic&#xD;
      nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP), no clear pathoanatomic cause is attributed to the&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low back pain is localized below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds and&#xD;
      is deemed chronic when it lasts for more than 12-weeks. Although most cases of low back pain&#xD;
      seem to resolve prior to the 12-week mark, chronic low back pain is responsible for the vast&#xD;
      majority of workers' compensation costs. In 90% of cases of chronic low back pain, clinicians&#xD;
      cannot pinpoint the etiology, hence the 'non-specific' modifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) boasts a slightly less impressive resume - affecting&#xD;
      a mere 10% to 25% of the general population. GTPS presents as lateral hip pain, specifically&#xD;
      over the greater trochanter, and is worse when lying or bearing weight on that side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It too has a plethora of potential aetiologies, and although it can be challenging to&#xD;
      elucidate lateral hip pain's true etiology this clinical diagnosis comprises of trochanteric&#xD;
      bursitis, gluteus medius and minimus tendinopathies, and external coxa saltans (commonly&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;snapping hip&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNLBP and GTPS seem to coexist in about a third of the time and general treatment&#xD;
      recommendations are similar. They range from analgesic medication to load management, though&#xD;
      because between CNLBP and GTPS, a wide demographic is affected, treatments should be&#xD;
      accessible and applicable to the wider population. Exercise therapies generally to meet these&#xD;
      criteria. Exercise has also routinely demonstrated to be efficacious, cost-effective and low&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multitude of different exercise modalities have routinely been shown to reduce chronic pain&#xD;
      and improve physical function. Furthermore, specific exercises can be leveraged to treat&#xD;
      chronic pain of broad aetiologies. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses alike have shown&#xD;
      these to hold true in the realm of chronic non-specific low back pain as well. Commonly&#xD;
      communicated is the relative paucity of research on GTPS, however, minimizing pain and&#xD;
      performing strengthening and stretching exercises for the region appears to be a mainstay of&#xD;
      the current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that exercise program adherence is a major issue when it comes to exercise&#xD;
      interventions. A minimum level of adherence must be obtained for an exercise intervention to&#xD;
      be efficacious. And when that level of adherence is attained in patients with CNLPB,&#xD;
      exercise-based programs have shown to decrease pain and improve function. Similar results are&#xD;
      show in the little amount of research on exercise therapies for GTPS, and in clinical&#xD;
      practice it is assumed to be true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence is higher when people are highly supervised. So it is unsurprising that patients&#xD;
      have higher rates of adherence after seeing their physiotherapist for extra 'booster'&#xD;
      sessions. However, additional sessions with healthcare providers is not always feasible, due&#xD;
      to high costs, poor accessibility, or unavailable providers, amongst other reasons. With the&#xD;
      ever-increasing use of technology, though, patients can have somewhat similar care - such as&#xD;
      guidance while doing exercises - through pre-recorded online videos. Some preliminary studies&#xD;
      suggest that these online videos are able to increase patient adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many YouTube exercise rehabilitation videos are of high quality, there are also many&#xD;
      that are not. This can leave the patient - even with an abundance of online resources -&#xD;
      paradoxically without answers: unsure and unable to know what is relevant. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients report better trust towards those who adequately understand their medical&#xD;
      conditions, such as their healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would then be conceivable that physician-produced videos that are endorsed by the&#xD;
      patient's healthcare team would alleviate this issue. Furthermore, it could circumvent the&#xD;
      challenges associated with in-person care as well as alleviate some of the pitfalls of&#xD;
      sifting through endless YouTube videos. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a&#xD;
      patient education tool - an accompanying set of explanatory videos - will increase patient&#xD;
      adherence when compared to prescribing an evidence-based, personalized set of exercises&#xD;
      without these videos.&#xD;
