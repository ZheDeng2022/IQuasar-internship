  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to determine if treatment with amivantamab will be efficacious in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent and metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ACC is a rare cancer of salivary glands and other glandular tissue. It is slow growing and is&#xD;
      usually treated with surgery and radiation. However, this type of cancer tends to have a high&#xD;
      rate of recurrence and metastatic spread, which develops over several years. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that amivantamab, a bispecific EGFR and MET inhibitor will be efficacious in ACC. Patients&#xD;
      will receive amivantamab at 1050mg weekly for the first cycle and biweekly thereafter (1400mg&#xD;
      for patients ≥80kg).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma. Non-salivary gland&#xD;
             primary sites are allowed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Presence of measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for&#xD;
             this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression in the&#xD;
             last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
             immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during&#xD;
             the first cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

             below the lower limit of quantification, per local testing. Subjects with a positive&#xD;
             HBsAg due to recent vaccination are eligible if HBV DNA (viral load) is below the&#xD;
             lower limit of quantification, per local testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV). Note: Subjects with a prior history of HCV,&#xD;

                  to the first dose of study drug: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke,&#xD;
                  transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension, or clinically significant&#xD;
                  cardiac arrythmia. Clinically non-significant thrombosis, such as non-obstructive&#xD;
