  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theoretical framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension during surgery directly impacts patients' postoperative outcomes and&#xD;
      complications. Decrease in blood pressure measurements secondary to anesthetic drugs is an&#xD;
      expected scenario in most surgical cases. Moreover, hypovolemia secondary to fast&#xD;
      pre-operative period may facilitate post-induction hypotension which can be compensated by&#xD;
      fluid bolus pre-operatively.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a randomized intervention cohort study using&#xD;
      pre-operative fluid therapy to assess its effect on blood pressure during the post-induction&#xD;
      period. The investigators are testing the hypothesis that preoperative Crystalloid bolus&#xD;
      decreases the risk of post-induction hypotension, specifically the time-weighted average&#xD;
      (TWA) mean arterial pressure (MAP) under 65 mmHg during the first 20 minutes after&#xD;
      anaesthetic induction or until surgical incision, whichever is first, compared to standard of&#xD;
      care, which is minimal fluid administration in the pre-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized intervention cohort study using pre-operative&#xD;
      fluid therapy to assess its effect on blood pressure during the post-induction period. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive a balanced crystalloid solution bolus within 20 to 40 minutes&#xD;
      before induction of anaesthesia. The control group will be treated according to the current&#xD;
      clinical standard of care. The investigators will compare the time-weighted average (TWA)&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) under 65 mmHg during the first 20 minutes after anaesthetic&#xD;
      induction or until surgical incision (whichever comes first).&#xD;

    <description>Post-induction hypotension is defined as TWA MAP under 65 mmHg during post-induction period. We will use non-invasive continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring.&#xD;
Anesthesia staff and nurses will be blinded, and standard of care will be provided. Data from the monitor will be recorded in the anesthesia record. We will be using standard intraoperative patient monitoring system. This system will measure 3 lead ECG (electrocardiogram), SpO2 (Arterial oxygen saturation), and number of respirations continuously. The primary outcome will be the TWA MAP under 65 mmHg during the post-induction period.</description>
