  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized controlled cross-over study is to investigate if an&#xD;
      acute, glycogen lowering exercise bout performed either in the morning or late afternoon&#xD;
      differentially affects the respiratory exchange ratio at night in men and women with&#xD;
      prediabetes. For this purpose, participants will stay in a respiration chamber and will be&#xD;
      subjected to either an exercise bout in the morning or late afternoon.&#xD;

      Appropriate timing of lifestyle interventions may facilitate healthy rhythmicity in&#xD;
      metabolism and optimize the effectiveness of such interventions in improving metabolic&#xD;
      health. In this context, exercise is well-known to improve (skeletal muscle) energy&#xD;
      metabolism and is an established intervention to improve muscle insulin sensitivity and to&#xD;
      counter the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). In addition, exercise may also have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on the immune response that is known to impact on insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      overall metabolic health. In this study it is hypothesized that exercise performed at&#xD;
      different times of the day exerts a differential effect on 24h metabolism in people at risk&#xD;
      for developing T2D. To test this, a randomized controlled cross-over study is conducted in&#xD;
      which participants are subjected to either an exercise in the morning or late afternoon while&#xD;
      staying in the respiration chamber. Main outcome is substrate utilization during the night as&#xD;
      measured with the respiration chamber, but 24-hrs blood draws will also be performed to&#xD;
      examine effect of exercise on circulating metabolites.&#xD;
