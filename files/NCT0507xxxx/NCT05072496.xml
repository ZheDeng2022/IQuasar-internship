    <textblock>
      The study describe 1 year durability of humoral and cellular immune responses in 150&#xD;
      individuals who received COVID-19 inactivated vaccine. all participants were recruited aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 59 years old. Every participant was familiarized with the aim of the study and&#xD;
      asked to sign an informed consent agreement, and be required blood sampling at the day 0 of&#xD;
      first dose vaccine and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after fully vaccination&#xD;
      separately. From every sample, 10 ml, 10 ml, and 5 ml were dispensed in three vacuum blood&#xD;
      collection tubes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes cell (PBMC) were isolated with the two 10 ml&#xD;
      samples contained heparin to detect immune memory cells and cytokines. RBD-IgG and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody be detected by 5ml sample from separating gel vacuum tubes. every&#xD;
      individual conducted a detailed analysis comparing neutralizing antibody, TEM, TCM , and&#xD;
      report on the cellular and humoral immunity 1 year after accept COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;

    <description>The humoral immunogenicity outcomes include the RBD-specific IgG titers and neutralising antibodies amounts at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the second shot. The positive cutoff for RBD-specific IgG antibodies was defined as the sample cutoff (S/CO) value ≥1.0. Seroconversion of neutralising antibodies was defined as a change from seronegative at baseline to seropositive or a four-fold titre increase. The positive cutoff of the titre for neutralising antibodies was 1/4.&#xD;
The cellular immune response outcomes measured by ICS assays across the blood collection time points.the percentage of RBD-specific CD4+ CD8+ memory T cells after vaccination.</description>
