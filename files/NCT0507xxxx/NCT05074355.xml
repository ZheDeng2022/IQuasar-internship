  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at how safe and useful a drug called&#xD;
      azacitidine in combination with a drug called venetoclax, is in people with accelerated or&#xD;
      blast phase BRC-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants in this study will receive azacitidine and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in multiple stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Run-In Period - 7 participants will receive the study drugs to ensure that the&#xD;
      combination is safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - About 15 participants will receive the study drugs and will be evaluated to see&#xD;
      whether they respond to the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - If enough participants in Stage 1 respond to the study drugs, then Stage 2 will&#xD;
      begin. During this stage, an additional 25 participants will take part in the study to&#xD;
      further see if participants respond to the study drugs.&#xD;

    <description>A treatment cycle is 28 days long.&#xD;
Azacitidine will be given by injection under the skin, once a day, for the first 6 days of every cycle.&#xD;
Venetoclax will be given orally, once a day, as follows at the discretion of their study doctors:&#xD;
Cycle 1:&#xD;
Day 1 - 100 mg&#xD;
Day 2 - 200 mg&#xD;
Days 3 to 28 - 400 mg&#xD;
Cycle 2:&#xD;
Participants with a response to the study drugs will continue taking 400 mg from Days 1 to 21, with no study drug from Days 22 to 28 during Cycle 2.&#xD;
Participants who have not yet responded to the study drugs will continue taking 400 mg from Days 1 to 28 during Cycle 2.&#xD;
Cycle 3 and subsequent cycles:&#xD;
Participants with a response to the study drugs will continue to take 400 mg from Days 1 to 21, with no study drug from Days 22 to 28.&#xD;
Participants whose disease has not worsened will continue taking 400 mg from Days 1 to 28.&#xD;
Participants have not responded to the study drugs will be withdrawn from the study.</description>

    <description>Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent that works by activating certain genes in the body to help cells mature and to kill abnormal bone marrow cells.</description>

    <intervention_name>Venetoclax</intervention_name>
    <description>Venetoclax is a drug that blocks a protein called B-cell lymphoma (BCL2) protein from working. BCL2 is a protein that helps control whether a cell lives or dies and is thought to help cancer cells to live. Blocking BCL2 is believed to help kill cancer cells.</description>
