      This study is a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of CT-1500&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses of orally administered CT-1500&#xD;
      compared to placebo. It is planned for 5 dose levels to be investigated in the single&#xD;
      ascending dose (SAD) part (Part 1) of the study, between 5 mg to 1250 mg. Three dose levels&#xD;
      are proposed for investigation in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) part (Part 2) of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
