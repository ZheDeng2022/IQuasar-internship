    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study was conducted to :1. explore the relative biomarkers of related&#xD;
      with the occurence and development; 2. develop a multiotimics prediction model for GDM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most complications during pregnancy and it&#xD;
      is associated with many adverse outcomes especially when the pregnant women can't control&#xD;
      blood glucose well. With economy develop rapidly, the occurence of GDM is about 15-20%.&#xD;
      Recently, the research on GDM has gone into the molecular level, which is beneficial to&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment on GDM. Besides, the cost of hospitalization and treatment for&#xD;
      adverse outcomes caused by GDM have caused a certain burden to pregnant women, their families&#xD;
      and the whole country. Lifestyle management has the first-line for treatment on GDM, however,&#xD;
      the situation of self-management on GDM isn't satisfactory. Therefore, our study aims to&#xD;
      explore a model to predict GDM in advance and reduce the adverse outcomes and economy&#xD;
      associated with GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plan to enroll 60 participants with hisk-risk of GDM and 40 normal participants.&#xD;
      They are required sign the inform consent after deciding to participate the research.&#xD;
      Furthermore, during early pregnancy (8-13 weeks), middle pregnancy (24-27 3 weeks) and late&#xD;
      pregnancy (32-36 weeks), 6-8 weeks after delivery, blood, feces, urine, saliva samples were&#xD;
      collected, and continuous blood glucose monitoring system were equipped, human component&#xD;
      testing was performed. Follow up was performed to collect the first stool sample of the&#xD;
      mother after delivery and faecal samples from the first to the fifth time after birth (the&#xD;
      first five times within one week after birth, including hospitalization and discharge) .&#xD;
