    <textblock>
      The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      cryoablation is a safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects in people with&#xD;
      mesothelioma. The researchers will also look at whether the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      cryoablation is effective against participants' cancer.&#xD;
