  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) was defined by The International Association for the Study of Pain&#xD;
      (IASP) as severe, sudden, usually unilateral, stabbing, brief, recurrent attacks of pain in&#xD;
      one or more distributional branches of the trigeminal nerve. The purpose of the current study&#xD;
      will to investigate the effect of Low level laser therapy versus electromagnetic therapy on&#xD;
      diabetic trigeminal neuralgia pain intensity and amplitude of the compound muscle action&#xD;
      potential of the masseter and temporalis muscles in diabetic TN patients.&#xD;
