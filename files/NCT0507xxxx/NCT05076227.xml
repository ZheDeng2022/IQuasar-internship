      Evaluation of the clinical tolerance after the first and second administration of an mRNA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Employees of the Helios Hospital Hildesheim received a vaccination offer from January 2021 in&#xD;
      accordance with the current prioritization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the national vaccination recommendation by the Ständige Impfkommission&#xD;
      (STIKO), the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech/Pfizer) and the vector-based vaccine&#xD;
      AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca) are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four vaccine-groups can be distinguished:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 received BNT162b2 with the boost vaccination 3 weeks after the initial vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees of groups 2 and 3 received AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S as prime vaccination and could choose&#xD;
      after 12 weeks whether boost vaccination with BNT162b2 or AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S should be carried&#xD;
      out. This results in homologous (prime: AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S, boost: AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S) and&#xD;
      heterologous (prime: AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S, boost: BNT162b2) vaccine combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 received BNT162b2 with the boost vaccination 6 weeks after prime vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects evaluate the vaccination reactions within one week using a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, demographic data (age, gender, occupational group, allergies) are collected,&#xD;
      local and systemic vaccination reactions are differentiated and the need for medication and&#xD;
      inability to work as a result of vaccination reactions are prospectively recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently of this, the vaccinees were offered serial blood samples by the company&#xD;
      physician to measure COVID-19-associated antibodies (anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three blood samples were taken at 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the boost vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can retrospectively access the data from these blood tests as well as PCR smear&#xD;
      results for COVID-19 during the observation period. A corresponding consent to the analysis&#xD;
      of the data, previously pseudonymized by the company physician, was given in advance by the&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospectively collected data of the questionnaires on reactogenicity are evaluated in&#xD;
      combination and relation to the additional and independent data of the company physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will allow for analysing associations between demographic variables, the reactogenicity,&#xD;
      the antibody levels and possible results of the nasopharyngeal swabs.&#xD;

    <description>The descriptive data are described by means of frequencies (%/n). The confirmatory analysis is performed using the Chi² test.&#xD;
Since the evaluation is performed at two points in time, the Bonferoni correction is applied here, so that the significance level is α/2=0.025.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks after boost vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive data are described by means of frequencies (%/n). The confirmatory analysis is performed using the Chi² test.&#xD;
The second primary endpoint is seen independently of the other two endpoints. Therefore, Bonferroni correction is not necessary.</description>

    <measure>Difference between the four cohorts regarding the antibody of the viral spike protein after 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after boost vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>A statistical evaluation with the continuous data on the antibody is aimed at. However, since it is not clear how many subjects will have a continuous value due to the prevailing Cuf-Off of 2500U/ml until June 30, 2021, the concrete evaluation will be decided by data base lock.&#xD;
The descriptive data are described by frequencies (%/n) and the continuous data by corresponding position parameters (median, interquartile range). The confirmatory analysis is performed by ANOVA with repeated measures and corresponding posthoc tests (for continuous data) or by McNemar-Bowker test for categorical variables (together for 3 and 6 months after the second vaccination).&#xD;
The second primary endpoint is seen independently of the other two endpoints. Therefore, Bonferroni correction is not necessary.</description>
