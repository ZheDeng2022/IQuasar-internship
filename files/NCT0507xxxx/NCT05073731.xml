  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this studly, the effects of an 8-week telerehabilitation-based upper extremity training in&#xD;
      persons with multiple sclerosis will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, progressive, and demyelinating disease of the central&#xD;
      nervous system that affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide and is more common in&#xD;
      young adults. The most common clinical signs and symptoms include motor dysfunction, fatigue,&#xD;
      spasticity, cognitive impairment, chronic pain, depression, decreased quality of life, and&#xD;
      bladder and bowel dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      66% of people with MS have impaired upper extremity function. As a result of the&#xD;
      deterioration in upper extremity function, the performance of many daily living activities&#xD;
      affects performance. In conclusion, there is a decrease in the functional independence of&#xD;
      individuals, quality of life, and participation in activities in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation has been defined as &quot;the delivery of rehabilitation services through&#xD;
      information and communication technologies.&quot; Synchronized telerehabilitation provides the&#xD;
      participant with advantages such as customized treatment, instant feedback, and a social&#xD;
      environment such as face-to-face training. Telerehabilitation has proven to be a valuable&#xD;
      modality for people with MS by increasing physical activity and reducing fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of telerehabilitation-based upper extremity exercise training results, the MS&#xD;
      population is deficient. Considering the importance of bilateral hand/arm function in daily&#xD;
      life, this deficiency in the telerehabilitation-based training effect is eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the results of this study, which will be created for the development of&#xD;
      upper extremity telerehabilitation strategies in MS patients, will aim to improve the&#xD;
      hand/arm function and fine motor skills of people with MS, aiming to increase the quality of&#xD;
      life of individuals and to participate more actively in society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons who followed by the outpatient Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Dokuz Eylül University&#xD;
      Hospital will participate in the study. A total of 30 participants will randomly be divided&#xD;
      into 2 groups as synchronized telerehabilitation group and asynchronous telerehabilitation&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physiotherapist will give physical activity training aiming to increase hand/arm function&#xD;
      and fine motor function to the Synchronized Telerehabilitation Treatment Group via&#xD;
      videoconference for eight weeks, two days a week, in 45-60 minute sessions. Exercise videos&#xD;
      and exercise tracking forms will be sent to the Asynchronous Telerehabilitation Treatment&#xD;
      Group, the control group, with the exercise intensity and intensity equalized and their&#xD;
      progression every two weeks. Assessments will done at baseline, after 8 weeks&#xD;
      (post-treatment) and at 8 weeks (follow-up). Assessments will be done by assessors who are&#xD;
      blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;

They will be asked to choose one of the options &quot;much improved, a little improved, no change, a little d e t e r i o r a t i o n, or much deterioration than before rehabilitation&quot;.</description>
