  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olaparib is a poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, originally used&#xD;
      for the maintenance treatment of women with platinum-sensitive relapsed breast cancer gene&#xD;
      (BRCA)-mutated high grade serious epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer,&#xD;
      who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Over the last two years, several&#xD;
      therapeutic indications have been added to the drug label, such as first-line&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive BRCA-mutated high grade serious epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer, germline BRCA1/2-mutated, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2-)negative,&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutated metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have progressed following prior therapy. Since&#xD;
      olaparib is very expensive, this increase of treatment population will have a significant&#xD;
      impact on health care expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To keep healthcare affordable and accessible for all patients, innovative strategies are&#xD;
      warranted to reduce the dose of expensive drugs, without reduction of efficacy. For olaparib,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) boosting can be applied. PK boosting is the lay term for administering a&#xD;
      non-therapeutic active strong inhibitor of a metabolic enzyme, for example the cytochrome&#xD;
      p450 enzym 3A (CYP3A), together with a therapeutic drug that is metabolized by the same&#xD;
      enzyme. Boosting thus increases the concentration of the therapeutic drug and allows lower&#xD;
      doses to be administered to patients. Hence, coadministration of a reduced dose of olaparib&#xD;
      with cobicistat, a non-therapeutic, strong inhibitor of the CYP3A can lead to equivalent&#xD;
      exposure to olaparib. Furthermore, inhibition of CYP3A could lead to less PK variability&#xD;
      since metabolic capacity is a prominent cause for (intra- and inter-individual) variability&#xD;
      in systemic exposure. Predictable olaparib exposure will reduce the number of patients who&#xD;
      are unintentionally under- or overtreated. Lastly, tumor tissue itself may express CYP3A as a&#xD;
      detoxification or resistance mechanism. Theoretically, PK boosting may also overcome&#xD;
      CYP3A-mediated drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy, safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      co-administering olaparib with the PK booster cobicistat with the aim to implement boosting&#xD;
      approach for olaparib in routine practice. The study is subdivided in two parts. In part A of&#xD;
      the study the equivalent exposure of boosted low dose olaparib is determined compared to the&#xD;
      normal dose. In part B of the study, non-inferiority of the boosted olaparib regimen will be&#xD;
      confirmed.&#xD;
