  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study, researchers let patients choose what medications to go home with after&#xD;
      endocrine surgery. This has not been done in outpatient breast surgery, though several&#xD;
      institutions have moved towards avoiding opioids altogether after breast surgery. These&#xD;
      institutions only prescribed rescue opioids upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to compare a similar &quot;opt-in&quot; protocol for narcotics to usual care&#xD;
      (where patients are routinely discharged with opioids) for outpatient breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be designed as a randomized, controlled trial. When adult patients consent for&#xD;
      outpatient breast surgery, they will be asked to participate in the study. Patients who are&#xD;
      currently using narcotics would be excluded. The investigators would then randomize&#xD;
      participants to the &quot;opt-in&quot; protocol versus being provided with a standard opioid&#xD;
      prescription after surgery. Patients in the opt-in protocol will be recommended a pain&#xD;
      treatment regimen with over-the-counter medications, acetaminophen or ibuprofen. These&#xD;
      patients will be reassured that if their pain is uncontrolled after discharge, a narcotic&#xD;
      prescription will be called in to their pharmacy if requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess patient pain scores and medication use in the recovery area&#xD;
      using the electronic medical record. The investigators will collect data on patient pain&#xD;
      scores and medication use after discharge on a daily basis via phone call or electronically&#xD;
      transmitted survey. The investigators will also evaluate patients at the time of their&#xD;
      follow-up visits. Any patient phone calls will be routed to study personnel who will fill&#xD;
      narcotic prescription requests if requested. Finally, among patients who do receive an opioid&#xD;
      prescription, the investigators will track their opioid consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the current opioid epidemic, there has been increased focus on the prescribing&#xD;
      patterns of physicians and greater incentive to reduce the amount of narcotic pain medication&#xD;
      prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recent publication in Journal of American Medical Association Surgery found that giving&#xD;
      patients the option of choosing to receive a narcotic prescription or not following endocrine&#xD;
      surgery significantly reduced opioid prescriptions and waste without increased pain or worse&#xD;
      quality of life. No patients called in to request narcotic pain medication after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current health care and political climate, there has been increasing focus on&#xD;
      reducing the amount of narcotics prescribed by health care providers. Based on the results of&#xD;
      the above cited study, the investigators believe implementing an opt-in program at University&#xD;
      of California at Los Angeles will also significantly decrease the amount of opioids&#xD;
      prescribed for postoperative pain following outpatient breast surgery as well.&#xD;
