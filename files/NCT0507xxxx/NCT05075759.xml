  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates several behavioral interventions for the improvement of&#xD;
      physical activity in cancer patients. Childhood and adolescent/young adult cancer survivors&#xD;
      have been reported to have poor diet quality and rarely meet recommended physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines. This trial aims to see whether a tailored intervention based on&#xD;
      self-determination theory may help to improve physical activity and dietary change.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to Arms 1, 2, or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive a personalized clinician-led self-management telehealth session at&#xD;
      baseline and 2 months. Patients with poor response at 3 months are randomized to Arm 2 or 4,&#xD;
      otherwise patients receive the same telehealth session at months 4 and 6. Patients may&#xD;
      receive 2 additional telehealth sessions after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive personalized goal setting for daily steps and activity (updated&#xD;
      weekly) and 3 dietary goals (updated monthly) with social media peer support for 6 months.&#xD;
      Patients with poor response at 3 months are randomized to Arms 1 or 4. Patients may receive&#xD;
      personalized goal setting for daily steps and activity (updated monthly) and dietary goals&#xD;
      (updated every 2 months) after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Patients receive no intervention for 12 months, and then receive their choice of&#xD;
      intervention for up to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 4: Patients receive remote sessions with a health coach every 1-2 weeks for 6 months.&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive remote sessions once a month after 12 months.&#xD;
