  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of QuitBet, a digital contingency&#xD;
      management program for smoking cessation. QuitBet combines social gaming elements with&#xD;
      participant-funded financial incentives in the form of a deposit contract. QuitBet &quot;players&quot;&#xD;
      deposit (called the &quot;bet&quot;) a specified amount of their own money into the game's &quot;pot.&quot; All&#xD;
      &quot;winners&quot; who achieve the game's goal split the pot equally, such that their bet is fully&#xD;
      refunded plus participants receive extra money from the forfeited bets of players who did not&#xD;
      meet the goal. Participants (N = 550) will be randomly assigned to QuitBet or QuitBet-NS&#xD;
      (deposit contract only, no social elements). All participants will be offered a second game&#xD;
      after their first game (up to 8 weeks total game duration) and will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      survey after each game and at 1 and 4 months after the end of the second game. The study will&#xD;
      compare QuitBet vs. QuitBet-NS on smoking behavior outcomes and examine potential mediators&#xD;
      of outcomes such as motivation, engagement, and satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>QuitBet is quit smoking game delivered via a smartphone application that lasts 28 days that includes contingency management in the form of a deposit contract, integrated exhaled breath carbon monoxide (CO) testing, a leaderboard to view CO test results for all participants, and a social feed (discussion board) in which participants can post and respond to messages. A game host will post educational information about smoking cessation and serve as a discussion moderator. Participants will deposit (&quot;bet&quot;) $30 of their own money at the start of the game. Participants who submit a CO test that is 6ppm or lower (indicating no smoking) on at least 25 of the 26 days between day 3-28 will be declared winners and will split the pot of money that was deposited. All participants who submit at least 21 CO tests during the 28 day game, regardless of the CO test result, will be entered into a lottery to win a prize worth $75.</description>

    <description>QuitBet-NS will include the deposit contract and integrated CO testing with identical rules to QuitBet for being a winner, the $75 raffle for submitting at least 21 CO tests, a display of the participant's daily CO test results that is updated in real time, and a game feed on which only the game host has the ability to post. Players will not be able to post on this feed or respond to the host's posts. At the beginning of the game, the host will post limited information, including the number of players in the game and a list of smoking cessation resources that includes some of the content that QuitBet hosts will post. QuitBet-NS will NOT include the leaderboard, social feed, or any other social features.</description>
