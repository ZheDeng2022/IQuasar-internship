      comparing retention and patient satisfaction of implant-supported mandibular overdentures&#xD;

      Background. Many patients suffer from lack of retention of conventional mandibular&#xD;
      overdentures due to loss of clip retention over time. Computer-aided design-computer-aided&#xD;
      manufacturing (CAD-CAM) milled polyetheretherketone PEEK materials may be used for&#xD;
      construction of retentive housing and clip for improving retention of implant-supported&#xD;
      overdentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective . To compare retention and patient satisfaction of implant-supported mandibular&#xD;
      overdentures retained by conventional nylon clip and metal housings for ball attachments&#xD;
      versus PEEK clip and housings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty-two participants were divided into 2 equal groups (n=11). The conventional&#xD;
      group received implant-supported mandibular overdentures retained by metal housings and nylon&#xD;
      retentive elements, while the PEEK group received implant-supported mandibular overdenture&#xD;
      retained by PEEK retentive element and housings.The PEEK retentive elements were made by&#xD;
      using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM).Evaluation included&#xD;
      measuring the retention by applying a gradual pulling up force by forcemeter and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with a 7-point visual analog scale (VAS) at overdenture insertion , 3,6, and 12&#xD;
      months subsequently by research interviewer.&#xD;
