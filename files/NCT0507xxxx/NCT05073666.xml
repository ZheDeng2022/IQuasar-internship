  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is a common clinical entity whose two manifestations are&#xD;
      deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). After an acute PE, almost half of the&#xD;
      patients complain residual dyspnea, despite well-conducted curative anticoagulation. Some&#xD;
      will present persistent defects on lung scan-scintigraphy, without pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
      This condition defines Chronic-Thrombo-Embolic Disease(CTED). The prevalence of CTED after PE&#xD;
      is poorly known as are its risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of CTED at 3 or 6 months, depending on&#xD;
      the provoked or unprovoked character, after a PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the potential risk factors for the occurrence of CTED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look for an association between the persistence of DVT and the occurrence of CTED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look for an association between the diagnosis of CTED and PE recurrence during the&#xD;
           12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the diagnostic performance of the clinician alone compared to the lung&#xD;
           scintigraphy (gold standard) for the diagnosis of CTED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the impact on the quality of life (QoL) with or without CTED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the correlation between impaired QoL and the degree of residual obstruction&#xD;
           on lung scintigraphy.&#xD;
