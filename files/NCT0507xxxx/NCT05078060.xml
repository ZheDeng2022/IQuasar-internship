    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the reporting rate of suspected Adverse&#xD;
      Drug Reactions (ADRs) occurring within 7 days following routine vaccination with&#xD;
      VaxigripTetra® and Efluelda®, respectively, during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) influenza&#xD;
      season 2021/22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the reporting rates of suspected ADRs occurring within 7 days following&#xD;
           routine vaccination with VaxigripTetra® according to the pre-defined age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the reporting rates of serious suspected ADRs after vaccination with&#xD;
           VaxigripTetra®, and Efluelda®, respectively, at any time following vaccination, within&#xD;
           the Enhanced Passive Safety Surveillance (EPSS) period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare vaccinees' reporting rates of suspected ADRs observed during the NH influenza&#xD;
           season 2021/22.&#xD;
