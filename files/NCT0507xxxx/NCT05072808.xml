  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic condition among children and many children seek emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) care. A key aspect of ED asthma management at the time of discharge is&#xD;
      appropriate outpatient referral. Part of the challenge for ED providers is determining which&#xD;
      patients require intensive outpatient support as ED providers often do not have the time or&#xD;
      familiarity with the asthma guidelines to appropriately stratify asthma severity. Thus, the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to determine whether the proportion of children referred to outpatient&#xD;
      asthma care can be improved by incorporating a previously validated tool [the Pediatric&#xD;
      Asthma Control and Communication Instrument for the Emergency Department (PACCI- ED)] into ED&#xD;
      clinical care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency department (ED) physicians play an important role in the management of pediatric&#xD;
      asthma through acute intervention, family education, and appropriate referral to outpatient&#xD;
      resources. However, time constraints in the ED limit physicians' ability to appropriately&#xD;
      stratify both asthma severity and outpatient referrals. The Pediatric Asthma Control and&#xD;
      Communication Instrument for the Emergency Department (PACCI-ED) improves ED providers&#xD;
      assessment of asthma control and disease burden. We hypothesize that implementation of the&#xD;
      PACCI-ED at the point of care may help to facilitate appropriate referrals to outpatient&#xD;
      asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED providers will be randomized to the control or intervention group. Providers in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the results of the parent-completed PACCI-ED accompanied by a&#xD;
      one page summary of referral recommendations aligned with asthma guidelines and based upon&#xD;
      asthma severity. Providers in the control group will not receive this information and will&#xD;
      provide 'usual care'. All providers will complete a brief demographic questionnaire.&#xD;
      School-aged children with a history of asthma presenting to the ED for an asthma exacerbation&#xD;
      and discharged home who consent to participate will be assigned to the control or the&#xD;
      intervention group based upon the ED provider caring for the patient during their ED&#xD;
      encounter. Parents will complete a brief demographic questionnaire, the PACCI-ED, and answer&#xD;
      two short qualitative audio-recorded questions about barriers to asthma care during their ED&#xD;
      visit. Following the ED visit, additional data will be abstracted from the electronic medical&#xD;
      record including outpatient referrals placed at the time of ED discharge and follow-up with&#xD;
      the referrals within a one-month time-frame.&#xD;
