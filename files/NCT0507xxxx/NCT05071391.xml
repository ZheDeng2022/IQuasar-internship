  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to determine the implication of autophagy and inflammasome in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of obesity and related comorbidities, and to explore in depth the mechanisms&#xD;
      associated with the activation of immune cells leading early stages of the atherosclerotic&#xD;
      process and metabolic disease. The hypothesis of the present study is that weight loss&#xD;
      mediated by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves the protein expression of markers of&#xD;
      autophagy and inflammation within immune cells. Moreover, the investigators will explore the&#xD;
      association of these mechanisms with the mitochondrial function and dynamics, Endoplasmic&#xD;
      Reticulum (ER) stress an intracellular nutritional status of leukocytes (measured by&#xD;
      fluorescence microscopy and western blot). Further, the potential relationship between&#xD;
      changes in the mentioned intracellular pathways and systemic pathological mechanisms&#xD;
      including oxidative stress, inflammation and glucose and lipid metabolism will be explored.&#xD;
      Hence, serum carbonylated proteins, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, antioxidant enzymatic&#xD;
      activities including SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and catalase, circulating cytokines, and&#xD;
      glucose and lipid metabolism parameters will be evaluated in a cohort of obese subjects&#xD;
      before and 12 months after RYGB intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Gastric bypass, also called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, is a type of weight-loss surgery that involves creating a small pouch from the stomach and connecting the newly created pouch directly to the small intestine. After gastric bypass, swallowed food will go into this small pouch of stomach and then directly into the small intestine, thereby bypassing most of your stomach and the first section of your small intestine.&#xD;
Gastric bypass is one of the most commonly performed types of bariatric surgery. Gastric bypass is done when diet and exercise haven't worked or when you have serious health problems because of your weight.</description>
