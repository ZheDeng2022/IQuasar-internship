  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective cohort study on patients with intertrochanteric fractures under direct oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation (DOAC) therapy undergoing early surgical fixation (within 24 hours). The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to evaluate the reduction of the peri operative blood loss. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to assess the influence of early surgical fixation of intertrochanteric&#xD;
      fractures in patients with DOAC therapy on the 30-day and 1-year mortality. Moreover, the&#xD;
      prospective cohort group of patients will be compared with a retrospectively analyzed age-,&#xD;
      gender- and fracture-type-matched control group of patients who underwent delayed surgical&#xD;
      fixation from January 2014 to December 2018 (≥ 48 hours).&#xD;

    <description>The main objective of this study is the evaluation of the perioperative blood loss in patients with intertrochanteric fractures with DOAC medication treated in a level I trauma center undergoing early surgical fixation (within 24 hours after the trauma). After routine surgical fixation of the fracture, patients will receive blood draws at day 3 according to standardized routinely performed clinical procedures. The perioperative blood loss will be calculated using the &quot;haemoglobin balance method&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the perioperative need for transfusions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of transfusion will be expressed as the percentage of patients who need at least one unit of red blood cells (RBCs) and the total number of transfused RBC units will be recorded. Only perioperative transfusion up to the third post-operative day will be considered.</description>

    <description>Coagulation parameters such as plasma DOAC concentrations and Clot Pro analyzes will be measured in accordance with routine clinical practice.</description>
