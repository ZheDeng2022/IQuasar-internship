  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a Discussion Prioritization Tool (DPT) for older adults&#xD;
      consider adjuvant chemotherapy that utilizes Conjoint Analysis (CA) methodology and the&#xD;
      objective of the current study is to assess usability of this DPT in the target population,&#xD;
      older adults with breast cancer and to adapt the tool to optimize usability for the target&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the complexity of adjuvant chemotherapy decision making for older adults with breast&#xD;
      cancer, enhancing support and promoting treatment discussions in the context of patient's&#xD;
      goals and preferences is an important need. With this need in mind, the investigators have&#xD;
      completed interviews with patients with cancer patients who are considering adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      As a result of these interviews, the investigators have developed a common list of attributes&#xD;
      (variables found to be important in decision making) that were used to create the Discussion&#xD;
      Prioritization Tool (DPT) using Conjoint Analysis (CA) methodology. CA which is a method that&#xD;
      can assess the relative importance that patients place on different aspects of care by asking&#xD;
      patients to make a series of trade-offs between competing options. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the usability of a Discussion Prioritization Tool, administered through a&#xD;
      tablet, laptop, or computer, for its ability to aid in treatment decision-making. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to gather feedback from individuals to improve and adapt the&#xD;
      communication tool.&#xD;
