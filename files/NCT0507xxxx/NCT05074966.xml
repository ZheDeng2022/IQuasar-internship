    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, randomized study in Chinese patients with RAS and BRAF&#xD;
      wild-type mCRC. Participants were randomly assigned to cetuximab + FOLFOX (group A) and&#xD;
      cetuximab + modified XELOX[mXELOX] (group B). All patients in groups A and B will be treated&#xD;
      until progression of disease(PD), death, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of informed&#xD;
      consent, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer is assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) CR29.

    <description>Quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer is assessed using 5-level EuroQol-5 Dimensions(EQ-5D-5L). EQ-5D-5L comprises a short descriptive system questionnaire and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions(MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN /DISCOMFORT and ANXIETY / DEPRESSION) , each dimension now has five response levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to /extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's overall current health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;. The EQ VAS provides a quantitative measure of the patient's perception of their overall health. One hundred means the best health you can imagine and Zero means the worst health you can imagine. It will be evaluated at Screening, Tumor Assessment Visit and End of Treatment visit.</description>
