  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD encompasses the entire spectrum of Fatty liver disease in individuals without&#xD;
      significant alcohol consumption, ranging from fatty liver to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis. A&#xD;
      high prevalence of NAFLD (62.5%) was observed in overweight/obese Indian adolescent.&#xD;
      Lifestyle modification consisting of diet, exercise and weight loss has been advocated to&#xD;
      treat patients with NAFLD. European association for study of liver (EASL) guidelines&#xD;
      recommends that the macronutrient in the diet should be adjusted according to the&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet for weight loss. Mediterranean diet helps to decrease hepatic fat by&#xD;
      decreasing lipogenesis, fibrogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress and by increasing fatty&#xD;
      acids beta oxidation.There are numerous studies in adults showing benefit of Mediterranean&#xD;
      diet in comparison with other diet in NAFLD, but data on children is very limited. There are&#xD;
      no studies in pediatrics showing the benefit of diet intervention in Indian NAFLD children.&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to compare the effect of Indo-Mediterranean diet and calorie&#xD;
      restricted on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in Overweight Indian children and adolescent&#xD;
      with Biopsy proven NAFLD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common&#xD;
      cause of chronic hepatopathies in children and adolescents. NAFLD is considered as the&#xD;
      hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and is defined as fat accumulation in the&#xD;
      liver of patients who do not consume excessive amounts of alcohol. The mechanism of liver&#xD;
      injury in NAFLD is considered to be a &quot;Multiple hit process&quot;. The first &quot;hit&quot; leads to an&#xD;
      increase in liver fat, while the next multiple factors lead to inflammation. In Developed&#xD;
      countries, 4 to 11% of the general pediatric population is affected by NAFLD, reaching a rate&#xD;
      of 70% among overweight and obese children. Lifestyle modification consisting of diet,&#xD;
      exercise and weight loss has been proven to treat patients with NAFLD. Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      (MD) has been largely evaluated for its beneficial effects in terms of prevention of obesity&#xD;
      and MetS. Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model which has its origins in stated&#xD;
      surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. MD patterns may vary among countries and regions owing to&#xD;
      the cultural, ethnic, religious and agricultural differences. MD usually consists of eating&#xD;
      primarily unrefined cereals, vegetables and fresh fruit, olive oil, nuts; eating fish, white&#xD;
      meat, dairy products in moderation; limiting red meat, processed meats and sweets. MD helps&#xD;
      to decrease hepatic fat by decreasing lipogenesis, fibrogenesis, inflammation, oxidative&#xD;
      stress and by increasing fatty acids beta oxidation. MD is based on compounds, such as&#xD;
      polyphenols, vitamins and other biomolecules that have anti inflammatory and antioxidant&#xD;
      effects. It also has carotenoids and lycopenes which act as antioxidants. MD is characterized&#xD;
      by high Mono unsaturated fatty acids content with a balanced Poly unsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      omega¬6 to omega¬3 ratio due to the abundance of vegetables, legumes, nuts, olive oil and&#xD;
      fish (instead of red meats). There are numerous studies in adults showing benefit of&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet in comparison with other diet in NAFLD, but data on children is very&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only two studies in children on the association between NAFLD and Mediterranean&#xD;
      diet. Cakir et al first analysed in obese youth the association between MD adherance {as&#xD;
      assessed by the Mediterranean diet quality index (KIDMED)} and NAFLD (as diagnosed by&#xD;
      ultrasound and /or elevated ALT levels, as well exclusion of other causes of fatty liver).&#xD;
      The authors evaluated overweight/obese children with (n=106) and without (n=21) NAFLD, as&#xD;
      well as children (n=54) with normal BMI and without known chronic disease.Subjects with a low&#xD;
      MD adherence were more likely to present with a higher BMI, though no correlation was found&#xD;
      with other parameters including steatosis severity. Another study by Della Corte et al&#xD;
      analysed the adherence to MD {as assessed by the Mediterranean diet quality index(KIDMED)&#xD;
      score} in 243 overweight/obese youths with and without NAFLD. Of these, 100 underwent live&#xD;
      biopsy. Poor adherance to MD was related to severity of liver damage as well as to higher&#xD;
      levels of C-reactive Protein, Insulin and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA IR) values, thus suggesting increased inflammatory potential of unhealthy diets. In the&#xD;
      Indian scenario, it will be very difficult to follow Mediterranean diet, so a concept of&#xD;
      Indo-Mediterranean was diet was introduced in a study by Singh et al. Total 499 patients were&#xD;
      allocated to a Indo -Mediterranean diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, walnuts,&#xD;
      and almonds. 501 controls consumed a local diet similar to the step I National Cholesterol&#xD;
      Education Program (NCEP) prudent diet. It was seen that there was significant reduction in&#xD;
      serum cholesterol concentration and other risk factors in both groups, but especially in the&#xD;
      intervention diet (Indo -Mediterranean) group. Indo-Mediterranean diet was shown to reduce&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death, Myocardial infarction, weight and BMI in Obese adults on follow up. In&#xD;
      a study by Bharti et al, it was seen that Olive oil and Mustard oil are comparable and infact&#xD;
      Mustard oil is suitable for Indian cooking settings, hence mustard oil can be used as instead&#xD;
      of olive oil in Indo -Mediterranean diet. In summary, MD diet has been shown to be useful in&#xD;
      NAFLD patients, also there is very limited data in pediatric literature about the advantages&#xD;
      of MD in NAFLD children. The investigators aim compare the effect of Indo-Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      and calorie restricted on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in Overweight Indian children and&#xD;
      adolescent with Biopsy proven NAFLD.&#xD;
