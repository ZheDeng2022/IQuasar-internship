  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADXS-504 is a novel Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) - based immunotherapy, bioengineered to&#xD;
      elicit T cell responses against 24 tumor antigens that include 1) 14 peptide antigens derived&#xD;
      from frequently occurring and commonly shared hotspot mutations in patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer and 2) 10 peptide antigens derived from sequence-optimized TAAs that are&#xD;
      differentially expressed or overexpressed in prostate cancer. ADXS-504 is designed to express&#xD;
      multiple tumor antigen targets to which patients may generate a broad set of effector T cells&#xD;
      for tumor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1 open-label study of ADXS-504 monotherapy in subjects with biochemically&#xD;
      recurrent prostate cancer previously treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation&#xD;
      therapy (external beam or brachytherapy) who are not currently receiving androgen ablation&#xD;
      therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary&#xD;
      clinical and immune responses following treatment with ADXS-504 monotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>ADXS-504 will be administered as monotherapy at 2 dose levels. Subjects who are assigned to receive DL1 will be administered ADXS-504 at a dose of 1×107 CFU q4 weeks (±3 days) from Week 1 to Week 21. Subjects who are assigned to receive DL2 will be administered ADXS-504 at a dose of 1×108 CFU q4 weeks (±3 days; Week 1 to Week 21). All 3-6 subjects must be enrolled in DL1, and DL1 must be confirmed safe, before enrollment for DL2 may begin. If DL1 is deemed to exceed the MTD, dose reduction of ADXS-504 to DL-1 (1×106 CFU) may proceed. Dose level -1, intermediate dose levels or expansion of a cohort may also be further evaluated if recommended by the Investigator and Advaxis in future amendments.</description>
