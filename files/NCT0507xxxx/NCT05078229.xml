    <description>Caregiver burden will be measured using the Zarit Burden Interview Short Form (ZBI). The ZBI is 12 items using a 5-point Likert scale assessing caregiver burden. Participants rate burden on a scale of 0 to 4, 0 indicating &quot;rarely&quot; an issue and 4 indicating &quot;nearly always&quot;. and The ZBI has been validated in populations of cancer caregivers and has demonstrated very good internal consistency and discriminative ability</description>

    <measure>Patient Distress at Baseline (CESD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient distress will be measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD). The CESD is comprised of 20 4-point Likert scale items and has been commonly used among cancer caregivers. Participants rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Patient Distress at Baseline (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patient distress will be measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is comprised of 8 items on a 4-point Likert scale and has been used extensively among cancer caregivers. Participants rate the severity of his or her symptoms over the past two weeks. The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; respectively, and then adding together the scores for the seven questions</description>

    <description>Focusing On mindfulness for Caregivers Under Stress (FOCUS)will consist of six one-on-one, 45-60 minute sessions delivered either in-person (sessions 1-3) or via video conference (sessions 4-6). The first few sessions will primarily focus on how to direct attention to the breath or some object of attention (e.g., parts of the body). As the program progresses, participants are asked to apply these skills to thoughts and emotions. Throughout the treatment, caregivers are reminded to utilize existing coping skills, as well as how to integrate the new skills learned throughout this program for managing stress. Formal mindfulness meditations are conducted within each session, lasting from 7-20 minutes; participants will be asked to practice mindfulness exercises daily.</description>
