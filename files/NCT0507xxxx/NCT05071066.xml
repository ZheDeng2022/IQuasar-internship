  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to be carried out in 2021 - 2024 with youths aged 6 - 15 in Hong Kong.&#xD;
      This is a randomized waitlist-controlled trial that aims to examine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      ADHD+ new service protocol. This ADHD+ new service protocol intervention will be delivered&#xD;
      for 6 months in the format of groups by frontline social workers trained by professional&#xD;
      clinicians including clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. It is designed to reduce ADHD&#xD;
      and related symptoms in individuals aged between 6 and 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core treatment components include internet use/addiction intervention, cognitive training,&#xD;
      emotion management, social skills training, occupational training, emotion&#xD;
      support/befriending, parenting training, and career guidance. It is hypothesized that youths&#xD;
      receiving the intervention will have reduced ADHD and related symptoms when compared with&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will allow the investigators to better understand the effectiveness of the new ADHD+&#xD;
      service; and in the long run, the service model can be generalized to community based early&#xD;
      interventions for other uncomplicated mental disorders.&#xD;
