    <textblock>
      Positioning of the patient with hyperacute large artery ischemic stroke (IS) is an important,&#xD;
      yet understudied aspect of care that could impact the course of treatment and ultimately&#xD;
      clinical outcome. Positioning with the head of bed (HOB) at 0-degree has been shown in small&#xD;
      studies to increase cerebral blood flow across arterial occlusion in hyperacute large artery&#xD;
      IS, leading to clinical improvement in stroke symptoms. However, this position is believed to&#xD;
      increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. In this randomised clinical trial, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate whether use of 0-degree HOB positioning is associated with&#xD;
      clinical stability in hyperacute IS. Investigators hypothesise that patients with large&#xD;
      artery occlusions placed in a 0-degree HOB position will experience less early neurologic&#xD;
      deterioration within the first 24 hours, than those in the 30-degree or more HOB elevation&#xD;
      group. The study aims to confirm the safety of 0-degree-HOB positioning in a large,&#xD;
      generalizable sample of hyperacute large artery IS patients. In this randomised trial,&#xD;
      patients presenting to the study centers and eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, with (if&#xD;
      presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom-onset) or without (presenting between 4.5 to 16 hours&#xD;
      of symptom-onset) mechanical thrombectomy. Eligible patients would be randomised to either a&#xD;
      zero-degree HOB or an HOB of 30-degree or more. Impact of HOB position on neurological status&#xD;
      would be evaluated with serial NIHSS scores. Cerebral hemodynamics would be monitored by&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Validated criteria would be used to diagnose pneumonia.&#xD;
      Functional outcome would be measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS) where the score of 0-2&#xD;
      describe good functional recovery. SPSS version 20 would be used to analyse the data. The&#xD;
      trial would provide clinical and hemodynamic data to determine the optimal HOB position in&#xD;
      patients with large artery acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Positioning of the patient with hyperacute IS is an important, yet understudied aspect of&#xD;
      care that could impact the course of treatment and ultimately clinical outcome. Positioning&#xD;
      with the head of bed (HOB) at 0-degree has been shown in small studies to increase cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow across arterial occlusion in hyperacute large artery IS, leading to clinical&#xD;
      improvement in stroke symptoms. On the other hand, small studies have also documented&#xD;
      clinical symptom worsening in IS patients when the HOB was elevated to 30-degree or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent large cluster randomized trial (HeadPoST) attempted to determine the optimal head&#xD;
      position in acute IS, but failed to enrol the patient cohort for which 0-degree head&#xD;
      positioning may be beneficial. Findings from HeadPoST have been debated by the stroke&#xD;
      neurologists due to some design flaws and enrolment of inappropriate patients to answer this&#xD;
      question. In fact, HeadPoST has become a catalyst for conducting a high quality head&#xD;
      positioning research in hyperacute large artery IS to definitively answer the question of how&#xD;
      best to manage these highly vulnerable patients to ensure stability and prevent symptom&#xD;
      worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms proposed for clinical improvement at 0-degree-HOB include favorable gravitational&#xD;
      arterial flow conditions, recruitment of collateral vessels, and in the case of intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis, improved clot-lytic interactions augmenting arterial recanalization.&#xD;
      Collectively, these mechanisms may support the argument that 0-degree-HOB positioning should&#xD;
      be among the first steps taken in large artery hyperacute IS patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This efficacy study aims to determine if 0 degree-HOB positioning in hyperacute IS prevents&#xD;
      neurological symptom worsening in large artery occlusion patients. The study will achieve&#xD;
      these goals through use of a novel protocol enabling enrolment of consecutive large artery&#xD;
      occlusion patients while maintaining compliance with management specified by the guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase III study will utilize a prospective randomized outcome-blinded evaluation (PROBE)&#xD;
      approach enrolling consecutive hyperacute large artery IS patients to determine if use of&#xD;
      0-degreeHOB positioning is associated with greater clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected acute IS patients admitted to the study center(s) will undergo guideline-supported&#xD;
      standard of care stroke team emergency response procedures, including assessment/&#xD;
      stabilization of airway, breathing, circulation with immediate transport for imaging.&#xD;
      Continuous portable ECG monitoring and nasal canula oxygen will be established in CT (or&#xD;
      MRI), and IV access will be obtained with STAT blood draw; point of care testing will be&#xD;
      conducted immediately before STAT non-contrast CT (or MRI) with CTA (or MRA). The NIHSS will&#xD;
      then be scored by the stroke team, followed by standard of care placement of a continuous&#xD;
      pulse oximetry sensor, and completion of a rapid/detailed history/physical exam. Patients&#xD;
      eligible for treatment with IV-tPA will have drug administered, and standard of care&#xD;
      admission upright chest x-ray (CXR) will then be performed. Subjects meeting inclusions&#xD;
      without exclusions will then be consented, randomized, and placed in the assigned HOB&#xD;
      position, signaling the beginning of the monitoring phase of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transferred to the catheterization lab for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) once&#xD;
      the team is ready for the procedure. Thrombectomy requires transfer from the ED to&#xD;
      catheterization lab, with 0-degree-HOB positioning commencing immediately prior to groin&#xD;
      puncture constituting the end of the head positioning phase of the protocol. Thrombectomy&#xD;
      patients are extremely likely to benefit from 0-degree-HOB positioning because the procedure&#xD;
      is only performed in patients without evidence of completed infarction. This novel protocol&#xD;
      will capture serial NIHSS over the period before thrombectomy begins, allowing us to better&#xD;
      understand how to maintain stability in this high risk vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either 0-degree-HOB or 30-degree (or more) HOB&#xD;
      positioning, and will undergo serial NIHSS assessments every 15mins +/- 5 mins while awaiting&#xD;
      start of the thrombectomy. The patients will also undergo 24-hour ± 6hrs, 72hrs ± 12hrs&#xD;
      discharge/7day, and 90-day +/- 14 days outcome monitoring, but these will be collected for&#xD;
      exploratory purposes only. The NIHSS and mRS will be performed by credentialed members of the&#xD;
      team. In addition to the chest X-Ray, blood will be drawn after obtaining the consent for&#xD;
      HSCRP and Procalcitonin levels, primarily to substantiate the diagnosis of pre-hospital&#xD;
      arrival chest infection, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure balance in the treatment group throughout the course of enrolment, the&#xD;
      investigators will use block randomization with a block size of 4 and an allocation ratio of&#xD;
      1:1. This scheme only shows the random assignment for a single given participant. Future&#xD;
      assignments cannot be predicted by study personnel, and this effectively mitigates the risk&#xD;
      for selection bias.&#xD;
