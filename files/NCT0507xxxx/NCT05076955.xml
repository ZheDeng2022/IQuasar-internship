  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a frequent clinical problem observed in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      Properly managed, most can be cured, but many patients needlessly undergo amputations because&#xD;
      of improper diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a compounded, anti-infective irrigation therapy to increase the healing&#xD;
      rates of diabetic foot ulcers and thereby provide a new therapeutic option for health care&#xD;
      providers treating high-risk patients with DFUs regardless if secondary fungal infections are&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants diagnosed with diabetes type 1 or 2 and with a documented open diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcer/wound with or without a secondary fungal infection will be included in this&#xD;
      prospective, active intervention pilot study. Healing rates will be evaluated every two weeks&#xD;
      following the initiation of study therapy up to three months. Participants with diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers will be treated with a compounded, anti-infective irrigation therapy daily until&#xD;
      closure of the ulcer or up to a maximum of 3 months. Participants will be asked to return to&#xD;
      clinic every two - four weeks for assessment of the ulcer and compliance with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of approximately 100 patients is estimated to have 90% power to detect 15%&#xD;
      improvement in ulcer healing rates to 45% and 35% compared to historical benchmarks of&#xD;
      approximately 30% for ulcers of &lt;6 months duration and 20% for ulcers ≥6 months duration&#xD;
      and/or prior treatment failure, respectively.&#xD;

    <description>Participants with diabetic foot ulcers will be treated with a compounded, anti-infective irrigation therapy daily until closure of the ulcer or up to a maximum of 3 months. This is an irrigating foot bath with a compounded medication of vancomycin-tobramycin-itraconazole. This medication with combined 3/4 gallon of water. Participant will soak foot in solution for 10 minutes per day. Daily until wound is healed for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 3 months.</description>
