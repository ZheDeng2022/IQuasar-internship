      To evaluate the efficacy of twin arch brackets compared to conventional brackets in the&#xD;
      control of orthodontic tooth movement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alignment and leveling of teeth generally constitute the most important preliminary clinical&#xD;
      phase of any orthodontic treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the leveling and alignment stage, tooth movement is directly affected by many factors,&#xD;
      such as interbracket distance, bracket width, archwire selection and the friction generated&#xD;
      between the bracket and the archwire. It is critical that the force moment which generated by&#xD;
      interaction between the bracket slot and the archwire to be transferred from the archwire to&#xD;
      the malpositioned tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is widely recognized that the geometric structure of the bracket, especially the&#xD;
      slot width, determines the efficiency of the force moment, the interbracket span, on the&#xD;
      other hand, remains another crucial factor affecting the effectiveness of tooth displacement.&#xD;
      It has been established that a sufficient interbracket span enables the flexible archwire to&#xD;
      activate its springiness caused by deflection. A wider bracket is favorable to develop an&#xD;
      adequate force moment, but the subsequent decrease in the space between the brackets will&#xD;
      reduce the effective length of the archwire segments between the supports. As a matter of&#xD;
      fact, the efficiency of treatment mechanics is a major focus in modern orthodontics.The&#xD;
      advancement of bracket design began with the vertically positioned slot in the ribbon arch&#xD;
      appliance to the pure rectangular horizontal slot in the traditional standard edgewise to the&#xD;
      modern preadjusted brackets in the straight wire technique, and to the current design of the&#xD;
      self-ligating brackets system. It is interesting to note that despite the numerous bracket&#xD;
      designs, one feature has remained unchanged: there is only one single horizontal slot on the&#xD;
      facial surface of the bracket. In some design variations, such as the Tip- Edge Plus,&#xD;
      In-Ovation and &quot; R &quot; brackets, an additional horizontal slot is enclosed within the bracket&#xD;
      base and is not open to the labial surface, therefore only allowing for engagement of&#xD;
      segmental auxiliary archwires. However some inventors design bracket system called &quot;the twin&#xD;
      wire appliance or twin arch wire appliance &quot; which can fit two archwires simultaneously by&#xD;
      incorporating two horizontal slots in the design of single brackets. In twin arch appliance&#xD;
      design, the bracket width is doubled without decreasing the interbracket span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment technique to work with two arch wires simultaneously is not new. The idea&#xD;
      behind the invention of twin arch appliance was to achieve a better control over orthodontics&#xD;
      tooth movements. In the orthodontic literature a very little knowledge and research can be&#xD;
      found concerning the use of Twin arch appliance in orthodontic treatment. In the 1930s&#xD;
      attempts were made to develop a new treatment method with this concept. Spencer Atkinson was&#xD;
      the pioneer, Spencer created a bracket with a vertical and a horizontal slot, positioned one&#xD;
      on top of the other. Then in 2008 an experimental study for the efficiency of double slot&#xD;
      brackets in correction of malposed teeth when placed in wax typodont was established. The&#xD;
      study revealed that twin slot bracket doubles the rate of teeth alignment. The reason behind&#xD;
      this phenomenon that the twin-slot bracket doubles the rate of alignment may be attributed to&#xD;
      fact that the force applied on the tooth bonded with the twin-slot bracket is doubled and the&#xD;
      rate of wax flow is likely to be proportional to load .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the promising results obtained from the previous experimental study and the lack&#xD;
      of clinical study results, it will be beneficial to study and compare clinically the&#xD;
      effectiveness of twin arch appliance in control of orthodontic tooth movements as well as the&#xD;
      comfort of patient during the initial leveling and alignment stage of treatment in relation&#xD;
      to other conventional bracket systems.&#xD;
