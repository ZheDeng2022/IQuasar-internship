  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of high-intensity laser therapy on&#xD;
      pain and lower extremity function in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants between the ages of 25-45 who were diagnosed with Unilateral patellofemoral pain&#xD;
      syndrome by the doctor will be included in the study. Also positive Clarke's test and&#xD;
      patellar compression tests will be determined as inclusion criteria. The 45 participants will&#xD;
      be randomly divided into three groups. Both groups will receive 2 weeks (5 sessions per week)&#xD;
      of therapy. First group patients underwent High Intensity Laser Therapy (HILT) and exercises.&#xD;
      Second group patients will be treated by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS),&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) and exercise for 10 sessions. Also In the third group patients will be&#xD;
      treated with ultrasound (US),interferential current stimulation and exercise. All groups&#xD;
      receive the same exercise exercise protocol including muscle strengthening and flexibility&#xD;
      training for 12 weeks. The outcomes will be pain intensity measured by visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) , knee flexion range of motion (FROM), timed up and go test (TUG),muscle strength&#xD;
      measured with handheld dynamometer, Pressure Pain Threshold with an algometry and&#xD;
      functionality of knee measured by the Lower extremity functional scale and Kujala&#xD;
      patellofemoral questionnaire. Statistical analyzes will be performed to compare amounts at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately after treatment, and after 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity was evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS) in two conditions during activity and resting time. This method, which is developed to determine the intensity of pain to indicate by numbers. It begins with the absence of pain (0) on numerical scale and ends the level of unbearable pain</description>

    <description>Universal goniometer will used to measure the joint position and joint range of motion measurements based on Kendall and American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons. The participant will in the sitting position and asked to perform active cervical region flexion, extension, right and left rotation, right and left lateral flexion of the neck movements and performed degrees will recorded</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will asked to start from a sitting position in a chair, to get up at the command given, to walk the predetermined distance of 3 meters as fast as they could, and to return to their seats. The time from the time they got up from the chair and sat down again will recorded with a stopwatch. Measurements will be repeated 3 times and the average will be recorded in seconds (sec).</description>

    <measure>Muscle stength assesment</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A myometer will be used to measure the strength of the hamstring and quadriceps muscle groups of all participants. Myometer is an evaluation method that objectively evaluates muscle strength and gives more sensitive results than manual muscle testing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain threshold assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold measurement will be measured with an algometer device. Algometers are a device that can be used to define pressure and pressure pain threshold.</description>

    <measure>Severity and function of patellofemoral pain</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated with the 'Kujala patellofemoral score' system. These scoring system values range from 100 (normal, pain-free, fully functional knee) to 0 (severe knee pain and dysfunction).</description>

    <measure>Function of lower extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A lower extremity function test will be used to measure lower extremity functionality. It is a test used to measure the functional status of the lower extremities.</description>
