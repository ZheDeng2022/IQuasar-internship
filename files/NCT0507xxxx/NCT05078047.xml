  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy (IO), such as treatment with anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 inhibitors, is a&#xD;
      rapidly expanding treatment for multiple metastatic cancers with improved survival for&#xD;
      certain cancers. However, the optimal duration of immunotherapies is currently unknown. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a reduced dose intensity of IO could be as effective as the current&#xD;
      standard treatment in term of prevention of the disease progression. If proved right, this&#xD;
      study will have a positive medico-economic impact by reduction of the costs associated with&#xD;
      the treatment and the toxicity, and an increase of the patients' quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy (IO) is a rapidly expanding treatment for multiple metastatic cancers with&#xD;
      improved survival for certain cancers. For currently approved immunotherapies such as PD-1 /&#xD;
      PD-L1 inhibitors and anti-CTLA-4, the rhythm and duration of treatment are recommended until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, the optimal duration of these&#xD;
      treatments is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No major dose-dependent effect of anti-PD-1 have been observed and whether the frequency of&#xD;
      infusion of IO could improve response or maintain efficacy. Moreover, phase I studies have&#xD;
      shown that saturation of the target (PD-1 or PD-L1) can persist far beyond the serum&#xD;
      half-life of the IO and 3-monthly infusions of an anti-PD-1 antibody could potentially&#xD;
      generate the same level of activity as infusions administered every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In silico modeling studies have suggested that alternate scheduling with IO couldn't&#xD;
      compromise the efficacy of the treatment. Indeed, prolonged half-lives of IO drugs,&#xD;
      time-varying clearance plus plasma concentrations far above the threshold associated with&#xD;
      maximal target-engagement, suggest that the rhythm of administration of IO could be slowed&#xD;
      down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without substantial international data for responding patients, apart metastatic melanoma in&#xD;
      complete response, patients and physicians are afraid of stopping treatment, by fear of&#xD;
      relapse. Over-treatment with IO may be toxic and inefficient. The rising cost of cancer care&#xD;
      in the era of immunotherapy is of great concern for public and private payers around the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic administration has important consequences for patients and health systems, with&#xD;
      multiple medical visits and the risk of chronic, progressive and sometimes fatal toxicities&#xD;
      induced by immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pragmatic and strategic study challenging the routine practice which compares for&#xD;
      the first time in a randomized phase III study, the standard administration of IO versus the&#xD;
      same agent administered each three months in patients with metastatic cancer in partial or&#xD;
      complete response after 6 months of standard IO ( except melanoma in CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our hypothesis of non-inferiority of PFS with a reduced dose intensity of IO is verified,&#xD;
      this could replace standard treatment and have a positive medico-economic impact, allowing,&#xD;
      on the one hand, a reduction of the costs associated with the treatment and the toxicity, and&#xD;
      on the other hand, an increase of the patients' quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <description>Developed by the EuroQol group, the self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials consists of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each dimension has 5 levels. This questionnaire provide a 5-digit score which generate a health state profile. The VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the score range from 100 (Best imaginable health state) to 0 (Worst imaginable health state). The VAS is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <time_frame>At inclusion visit (pre-randomization) and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 36 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14 items questionnaire: 7 items related to anxiety and 7 items related to depression scored on a scale. Scores for items in each subscale of the HADS are summed to produce an anxiety score (HADS-A) or a depression score (HADS-D), or can be added to produce a total score corresponding to emotional distress (HADS-T). Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), for a total score ranging from 0-21 for each subscale. The entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress.</description>

    <description>The Fear of relapse questionnaire is a self-reported questionnaire aiming to better understand how these concerns of fear of relapse by patients manifest themselves.&#xD;
The questionnaire contains 32 items rated on a five-point Likert-type scale (0 = &quot;never&quot;, 1 = &quot;seldom &quot;, 2 = &quot;sometimes&quot;, 3 = &quot;often&quot;, and 4 = &quot;always&quot;). For all items, higher scores indicate more severe fear of relapse.</description>
