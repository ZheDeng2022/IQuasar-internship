  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared with patients with philadelphia chromosome-negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia&#xD;
      (Ph- ALL), patients with Ph-positive (Ph+) ALL exhibit a comparatively poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Fortunately, significant improvements have been found in response rates, disease-free&#xD;
      survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) for patients with Ph+ ALL with the introduction of&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy to treatment regimens. Based on improvements in&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability, next-generation TKIs have been widely used in first-line treatment&#xD;
      for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Flumatinib, a TKI with more potent binding affinity for&#xD;
      BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase than imatinib, demonstrated higher rates of responses, faster and&#xD;
      deeper responses in FESTnd trial, which suggested that flumatinib might show improved&#xD;
      clinical efficacy for treating Ph+ ALL compared with imatinib. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      hypothesized that the addition of flumatinib to combinatorial chemotherapy regimen would&#xD;
      demonstrate greater efficacy compared with the prior use of imatinib in treating Ph+ ALL.&#xD;
      This study explored the safety and efficacy of flumatinib versus imatinib when combined with&#xD;
      multi-agent chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL.&#xD;
