  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study that is studying the rate of red blood cell (RBC)&#xD;
      transfusion rates after planned heart (cardiac) surgery. The study will be conducted at&#xD;
      Barnes-Jewish Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardioplegia refers to the method of stopping (arresting) the heart in order to perform heart&#xD;
      surgery. However, cardioplegia has also come to refer to the solution to achieve cardiac&#xD;
      arrest as well as the machinery in which to deliver the solution. This study will investigate&#xD;
      our current Standard Cardioplegia (diluted 4:1 blood cardioplegia) versus Microplegia&#xD;
      (undiluted blood cardioplegia) to determine if Microplegia reduces peri-operative blood&#xD;
      transfusion rates as compared to Standard Cardioplegia. All forms of cardioplegia will be&#xD;
      delivered using the MPS2 Microplegia delivery machine by Quest Medical, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive undiluted microplegia or standard 4:1 cardioplegia.&#xD;
      The patient and the surgeon will be blinded to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 30 days post-operatively (or until their initial standard of&#xD;
      care post-operative follow up visit with cardiac surgery if that appointment falls outside of&#xD;
      the 30 day post-operative window) for the development of any adverse events as well as&#xD;
      documentation of blood products given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will draw one tube of blood for troponin levels at four time points; 1 draw before surgery&#xD;
      (this may be done during the intraoperative period), and 3 draws post-operatively: ICU&#xD;
      arrival, 12 hours post-ICU arrival and 24 hours post-ICU arrival. This is to closely monitor&#xD;
      the patient for any heart tissue injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardioplegia was first introduced as a method to protect the heart during cardiac surgery in&#xD;
      the 1950s (1). Initially, it consisted of a crystalloid solution and in the 1970s Follette&#xD;
      and colleagues proposed that blood was the best mode of delivery of cardioplegia as it is&#xD;
      rich in nutrients and oxygen (2). Blood has better osmotic, buffering, and antioxidant&#xD;
      qualities that are needed by ischemic myocardium. More recent studies comparing blood and&#xD;
      crystalloid cardioplegias showed that there was less cardiac edema, and recovery of&#xD;
      ventricular function was more rapid with blood based cardioplegia (3). A meta-analysis of&#xD;
      over 5000 patients corroborated these findings and showed that blood based cardioplegia&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome and was associated with&#xD;
      less myocardial damage (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard diluted blood cardioplegia can also be modified to undiluted blood cardioplegia also&#xD;
      known as microplegia. To compare the cardioprotection of 4:1 blood:crystalloid cardioplegia&#xD;
      to microplegia, McCann et al randomized 20 pigs to either group. Cardiac edema was measured&#xD;
      using histologic morphometrics and echocardiogram. It was noted that both edema percentage&#xD;
      and left ventricular mass were significantly more decreased in the microplegia group.&#xD;
      Furthermore, all animals receiving microplegia were successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass, whereas only 40% of those receiving standard cardioplegia were successfully weaned&#xD;
      (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Algarni et al. showed decreased prevalence of low cardiac output syndrome in&#xD;
      patients who received microplegia (n=2,630) (6). Another study compared microplegia and&#xD;
      standard cardioplegia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and found that&#xD;
      the microplegia group had lower troponin levels during the post-operative course. Moreover,&#xD;
      microplegia resulted in lower transfusion rates and decreased length of hospital stay (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high rate of patients undergoing cardiac surgery require red blood cell transfusions (RBC).&#xD;
      Red blood cell transfusions are strongly associated with both infection and ischemic&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity, length of stay, increased early and late mortality, and overall&#xD;
      hospital costs (8). Given that previous studies have shown that microplegia is associated&#xD;
      with less transfusions, it would be reasonable to incorporate this into practice at&#xD;
      Washington University.&#xD;

    <description>To investigate the effects of microplegia on overall morbidity and mortality during the peri-operative period. We will assess operative mortality and 30 day mortality. We will examine intra-operative and post-operative complications. A complete list of variables to be examined can be found in table 1. We will determine if microplegia results in better myocardial protection than standard cardioplegia by assessing pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative serum troponin levels.</description>
