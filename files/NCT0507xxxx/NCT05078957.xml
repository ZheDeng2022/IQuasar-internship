  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of gut microbiota becomes more and more accessible in recent years. Experimental&#xD;
      data in both animal and human studies have demonstrated that imbalance of the gut microbiota&#xD;
      which is called symbiosis may participate in an accelerated procedure of ageing as well as&#xD;
      the expression of frailty phenotype. People living with HIV (PLHIV) present markers of&#xD;
      phenotypic frailty on average 10 years before uninfected people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this population structural and functional modifications of GALT (Gut Associated Lymphoid&#xD;
      Tissue) are observed early after HIV infection and persist despite virological suppression on&#xD;
      ART (AntiRetroviral Treatment). These GALT modifications are associated with microbial&#xD;
      translocation that is also correlated with immune activation and dysbiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of study is to explore gut microbiota of PLWH over 5 years, as well as to study&#xD;
      associations of its longitudinal evolution with frailty markers and burden of comorbidities.&#xD;
