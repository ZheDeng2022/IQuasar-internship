  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is the most unwanted response during bronchoscopic interventions for hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, hypoxemia, and interruption of interventions. In previous reports, there were&#xD;
      many drugs and techniques investigated for preventing cough during broncoscopic examinations.&#xD;
      As bronchoscopic interventions need more space and stability of airways to precisely operate&#xD;
      on, few studies have focused on the effects of different drugs for preventing cough. In this&#xD;
      study, Different intravenous drugs (lidocaine, etomidate, compared to normal saline) is&#xD;
      planned to be injected one minutes before bronchoscopic insertion, the responses to&#xD;
      bronchoscopicly spraying local anesthetic were recorded and analyzed.&#xD;

      Cough is the most unwanted response during bronchoscopic interventions. Cough could lead to&#xD;
      airway spasm, hemodynamic instability, desaturation, hypoventilation, and then interrupt the&#xD;
      following interventions. In previous reports, lodicaine and other drugs given intravenously,&#xD;
      inhalationally or trans-cricoidally have been investigated for preventing cough during&#xD;
      conventional broncoscopic examinations. As bronchoscopic interventions were goaled to precise&#xD;
      localization and operations with higher yield rate. Steady airways without endotracheal tubes&#xD;
      are usually required. There are few studies focused on the effects of different drugs for&#xD;
      preventing cough even bronchoscopic spary of local anesthetics has become the routine pratise&#xD;
      before interventions. In this study, different intravenous drugs (lidocaine, etomidate,&#xD;
      compared to normal saline) are planned to be injected one minutes before bronchoscopic&#xD;
      insertion, the responses to bronchoscopicly spraying local anesthetic were recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed. Besdies cough scores, the following changes are recorded and compared: (1) status&#xD;
      on visualization and the responses to sparying of vocal cords, (2) anesthetic depth (BIS&#xD;
      levels), (3) blood pressure and heart beats, (4) data of hemoglobin saturation (SPO2) and&#xD;
      Transdermal CO2. We goaled to compare the effects of intravenous lidocaine and etomidate on&#xD;
      cough intensity, hemodynamics, ventilation, and bronchoscopic withdrawl rate during&#xD;
      bronchoscopic interventions with intravenous anethesia.&#xD;
