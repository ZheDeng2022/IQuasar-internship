  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are aggressive complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) and affect&#xD;
      25% of these patients. DFU are associated with a high risk of amputations and early mortality&#xD;
      and significantly impact quality of life (QoL). The low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is an&#xD;
      important approach for the treatment of DFU, however there is a lack of data on its influence&#xD;
      on the QoL of patients with DFU. On the other hand, adherence to self-care is a factor&#xD;
      closely related to QoL. Therefore, this study is justified by the need to understand the&#xD;
      impact of LLLT on QoL and its relationship with self-care. Aim: To evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients with diabetic foot ulcers treated with different doses of LLLT (GaAs) 904 nm&#xD;
      and its association with aspects of adherence to self-care. Methods: This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the groups: control LLLT placebo (CG), LLLT 904 nm 10 J/cm² (LG1), LLLT 904 nm 8 J/cm² (LG2)&#xD;
      and LLLT 904 nm 4 J/cm² (LG3). QoL data, percentage of healing and pain will be assessed&#xD;
      before the start of the intervention, in 10th week and after one month to the end of&#xD;
      intervention, self-care will be assessed before the start of the intervention and at the end&#xD;
      of intervention. Eighty participants with DFU will be recruited who will receive intervention&#xD;
      twice a week for up to 20 visits (10 weeks).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty volunteers will be recruited through the Integrated Center of Medical Specialties&#xD;
      (ICMS) and the Center of Health Specialties (CHS) in Parnaíba-PI, Brazil, after thorough&#xD;
      examination of the feet and evaluation by a medical professional specializing in vascular&#xD;
      surgery. Volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have DFU without an infectious&#xD;
      process (Wagner's grade I and II) will be admitted, of both sexes aged 18 years and over.&#xD;
      Inclusion in the study will take place after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF). The&#xD;
      randomization will be of the simple type, a computer generated randomization list through the&#xD;
      website https://www.randomizer.org will be used to prepare sealed, opaque and sequentially&#xD;
      numbered envelopes. A collaborator, who will not participate in the study, will carry out the&#xD;
      randomization process, subsequently inserting the allocation data in the envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, volunteers will be evaluated individually in a reserved room, by a&#xD;
      previously trained evaluator and blinded to the allocation of volunteers in the groups.&#xD;
      Volunteers will provide their personal data, medical history and duration of T2DM.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the physical evaluation and application of the questionnaires will be carried&#xD;
      out: (1) application of the SF-36 (Short Form-36 Health Survey) and Summary of Diabetes&#xD;
      Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) questionnaires in the form of an interview; (2) vascular&#xD;
      evaluation; (3) neurological evaluation; (4) determination of the level of pain and (5)&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DFU will be located, recording the affected foot region, the duration in months and the&#xD;
      Wagner's classification. The healing process of DFU will be monitored. The total number of&#xD;
      LLLT applications performed until complete healing will be identified and the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who achieved healing in relation to the cutoff points of the fifth and tenth weeks&#xD;
      of intervention. The volunteers in the treatment groups will receive dosage as&#xD;
      pre-established (10, 8 or 4 J/cm²) and those in the control group (CG) will receive a placebo&#xD;
      application, that is, with the device turned off. For the treatment, the laser tip will be&#xD;
      positioned perpendicular to the DFU, the ulcer floor will be irradiated with a sweeping&#xD;
      application technique (1 cm away from the ulcer) and the edges with a punctual technique with&#xD;
      contact at equidistant points. The total duration of each application will be calculated by&#xD;
      the machine based on the selected energy density. Both the therapist and the participant will&#xD;
      use the goggles provided before the application. The four groups will receive conventional&#xD;
      treatment, cleansing the ulcers with saline solution and dressing with Helianthus Annuus oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the participants in the treatment groups will show significant&#xD;
      improvement in QoL and pain after the intervention, less time and a higher percentage of&#xD;
      healing compared to the CG. Differences in the improvement of QoL and pain and in the time&#xD;
      and percentage of healing between the LLLT dosages used are also expected. It is also assumed&#xD;
      that adherence to self-care is capable of predicting the time and percentage of healing and&#xD;
      QoL, in the perception that the improvement of the patient with LLLT is also influenced by&#xD;
      his attitudes and that self-care also has effects on QoL.&#xD;
