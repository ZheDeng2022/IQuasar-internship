  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flap reconstruction is performed increasingly for repair of skin and soft tissue defects&#xD;
      following pelvic exenteration as surgeons have embarked upon increasingly radical resections.&#xD;
      Many methods have been proposed but the outcomes associated with each remain largely unknown&#xD;
      and the choice dependant on surgeon preference and patient/ disease characteristics. This&#xD;
      review sought to assess the preferred methods for perineal reconstruction following pelvic&#xD;
      exenteration by retrospectively assessing the outcomes associated with each at an&#xD;
      international, multi-centre level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced pelvic malignancies pose numerous technical difficulties to oncological&#xD;
      surgeons, particularly where extended resections are performed. The repair of skin and soft&#xD;
      tissue defects after radical resections are among the most challenging. Complications related&#xD;
      to wound healing are among the most commonly encountered. They can increase rates of&#xD;
      infection in the short-term and often become chronic and difficult to treat. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant in the context of pelvic exenteration, where a larger dead space&#xD;
      confers a greater risk of deep perineal wound infection and prior (chemo)radiotherapy impairs&#xD;
      tissue quality with suboptimal healing. Primary closure may also lead to higher tension&#xD;
      closure where there is a bigger defect, further compounding risk. The first meta-analysis&#xD;
      comparing primary closure to flap closure noted a two-fold increased risk of overall wound&#xD;
      complications with primary closure (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increasingly extensive procedures being carried out in dedicated centres over recent&#xD;
      decades, the use of flap reconstruction for closure of pelvic oncological defects has&#xD;
      increased significantly. Perineal reconstruction has been shown to decrease the incidence the&#xD;
      wound of break-down as well as the need for a secondary repair of dehiscence (2). More&#xD;
      importantly, these complications have been shown to be decreasing over time, suggesting&#xD;
      improved techniques and/or better perioperative care. However, this is countered by an&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of overall minor complications and the possibility of flap failure&#xD;
      necessitating a return to theatre. Flap formation is a morbid procedure in its own right and&#xD;
      can involve more intensive nursing care and restrict a patient's mobility after pelvic&#xD;
      exenteration, further predisposing to post-operative complications and increasing&#xD;
      length-of-stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vertical Rectus Abdominis Muscle (VRAM) flap remains one of the most commonly used and is&#xD;
      considered by some to be the gold standard. However, a wide variety of methods for flap&#xD;
      reconstruction have been proposed but exactly how often each is employed and with what&#xD;
      outcomes remains largely unknown and is of great interest to surgeons involved in pelvic&#xD;
      reconstruction. This review sought to assess the preferred methods for perineal&#xD;
      reconstruction following pelvic exenteration by retrospectively assessing the outcomes&#xD;
      associated with each at an international, multi-centre level.&#xD;
