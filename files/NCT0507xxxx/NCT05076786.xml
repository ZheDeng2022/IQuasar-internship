      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of chidamide combined with&#xD;
      etoposide and cisplatin/carboplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced extrapulmonary&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinoma.&#xD;

      This study is a single-arm, multi-center, two-stage, phase II clinical trial conducted in&#xD;
      China. This study adopts Simon's two-stage design, and the inclusion criteria and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the two stages were consistent. Twelve patients with extrapulmonary&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinoma will be enrolled in the first stage. If more than four complete or&#xD;
      partial responses were seen at planned interim analysis, the additional 16 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited in the second stage and a total of 28 patients will be treated.&#xD;
