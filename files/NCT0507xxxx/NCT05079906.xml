      This study is intended to help establish standard procedures for use of FFR in the peripheral&#xD;
      arterial system and to evaluate the correlation of post-procedural FFR values and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in Superficial Femoral artery (SFA) interventions in subjects ages 18 to 79 with&#xD;
      PAD.&#xD;

      The ACIST Navvus Rapid Exchange FFR MicroCatheter is a rapid exchange catheter with a&#xD;
      pressure sensor located at the distal tip that allows the operator to use their preferred&#xD;
      standard 0.014-inch coronary guidewire for peripheral vascular intervention (PVI),&#xD;
      eliminating the need for a wire exchange. The fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements&#xD;
      obtained with Navvus represent the degree of stenosis in an artery via comparison of the&#xD;
      distal lesion value to the proximal lesion value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While FFR has evolved as the gold standard for identifying coronary stenoses that may cause&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia, it remains underutilized in the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral&#xD;
      lesions. FFR cutoff values which could guide PVI decisions are yet to be defined and&#xD;
      accepted. Routine use of FFR in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) may play an&#xD;
      important role in determining the appropriateness of interventions in the peripheral&#xD;
      vasculature by introducing a more objective assessment. Shishehbor and Agarwal further&#xD;
      highlighted the potential economic benefit of FFR use in peripheral vessels by stating &quot;The&#xD;
      Affordable Care Act and higher emphasis on quality rather than quantity should support the&#xD;
      use of [IVUS or FFR] to make peripheral interventions more accurate, safer, and better&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to help establish standard procedures for use of FFR in the peripheral&#xD;
      arterial system and to evaluate the correlation of post-procedural FFR values and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in Superficial Femoral artery (SFA) interventions in subjects ages 18 to 79 with PAD&#xD;
      (Rutherford Classification 2, 3, 4, or 5). FFR measurements will be collected using the&#xD;
      Navvus catheter pre- and post-PVI. A subset of study subjects will also have&#xD;
      post-intervention IVUS imaging performed with the Kodama catheter.&#xD;
