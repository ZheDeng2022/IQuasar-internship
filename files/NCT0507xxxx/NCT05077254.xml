    <textblock>
      This study will enroll individuals who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completed, at a minimum, a full 2-dose course of either the Moderna messenger RNA (mRNA)&#xD;
           based coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) vaccine or the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA&#xD;
           based COVID-19 vaccine, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A negative or indeterminate (&lt;0.8 U/mL) antibody response measured at least 30 days&#xD;
           after the last dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group of patients is at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease due to pharmacologic&#xD;
      immunosuppression and a high prevalence of non-transplant risk factors such as obesity and&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label multi-site trial designed to induce an enhanced&#xD;
      antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in&#xD;
      kidney and liver transplant recipients who have negative or indeterminate (&lt;0.8 U/mL)&#xD;
      anti-spike antibody (as measured by the Roche Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay) after at&#xD;
      least two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Receive an additional dose of mRNA based COVID-19 vaccine (booster) with no change in&#xD;
           their immunosuppressive regimen, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Undergo a temporary, prescribed reduction in their maintenance immunosuppression (IS)&#xD;
           regimen and receive an additional dose (booster) of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study participation for interested and eligible individuals: 13 months.&#xD;
