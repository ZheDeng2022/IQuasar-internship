      This study is an open-label, single-center, two-period, two-sequence crossover study to&#xD;
      assess the bioequivalence of SP-01 (Sancuso®: Granisetron Patch) manufactured at two&#xD;
      different sites. Either the test product, namely SP-01-K, or reference product, namely&#xD;
      SP-01-A, will be applied to the subject once in each period.&#xD;
