      The study aims to identify the Following: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. incidence and mortality of cardiac Surgery associated -AKI based on the new consensus&#xD;
           diagnostic systems of KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. use of biomarkers for the early detection of clinical and subclinical cardiac Surgery&#xD;
           associated-AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. risk factors and prediction models of cardiac Surgery associated-AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. optimal cardiac surgical procedures including conventional versus minimally invasive&#xD;
           approaches, on-pump versus off-pump, and optimal management of cardiac surgical support&#xD;
           including duration of CPB, perfusion pressure, hemodilution, and hypothermia during CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. controversial pharmacologic therapies for the prevention and treatment of cardiac&#xD;
           Surgery associated-AKI including statins, sodium bicarbonate, and N-acetylcysteine&#xD;
           (NAC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal injury (AKI) is a severe complication that occurs in 3.5-31.0% of patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery, making it one of the most common complications observed in this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that even slight postoperative increases in serum creatinine levels are&#xD;
      associated with a significant increase in the risk of death. Among individuals undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, mortality has been reported to be as high as 8% and postoperative AKI can&#xD;
      increase the mortality rate to over 60%. The occurrence of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery raises the mortality rate from 0.4-4.4% to 1.3-22.3%; when those same patients&#xD;
      require dialysis, rates range from 25% to 88.9%, making severe postoperative AKI an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for mortality that results in an 8-fold increase in the risk of&#xD;
      death. Therefore, cardiac surgery AKI is associated with serious complications as well as&#xD;
      with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays and with a worse quality of life. It also&#xD;
      increases early and late mortality and health care expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early identification of patients at risk of developing AKI after cardiac surgery is an&#xD;
      important strategy for improving the care of such patients during the intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative periods. Many factors have been found to facilitate the development of AKI&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery such as: age; obesity; female gender; valve replacement surgery;&#xD;
      myocardial infarction in the last 30 days; low cardiac output; blood transfusion; and many&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies of AKI in cardiac surgery patients are important because they allow&#xD;
      for better diagnosis of AKI and facilitate the prognosis estimation, as well as the&#xD;
      development of new, more effective strategies to prevent and minimize this complication, thus&#xD;
      reducing the associated morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
