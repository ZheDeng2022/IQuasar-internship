        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix A which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form&#xD;
             (ICF) and in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Aged 18 to 45 years (inclusive, at the time of signing the ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Healthy, non smoking Chinese participants. Definition of non-smoker: non-smoker for at&#xD;
             least the past 12 months with pack history ≤5 pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol and complete the&#xD;
             study until the end of the safety follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a body mass index between 19 and 24 kg/m2 , inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use a highly effective method of contraception from enrolment throughout&#xD;
             the study until their final follow-up visit. Cessation of contraception after this&#xD;
             point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence (calendar,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides&#xD;
             only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
             Female condom and male condom should not be used together. All women of child bearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a&#xD;
                  low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and&#xD;
                  correctly. Highly effective birth control methods include: a vasectomised&#xD;
                  partner, Implanon®, bilateral tubal occlusion, intrauterine device/levonorgestrel&#xD;
                  intrauterine system, Depo-Provera™ injections, oral contraceptive, and Evra&#xD;
                  Patch™, Xulane™, or NuvaRing®.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females not of childbearing potential who are either permanently sterilized&#xD;
             (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy), or who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrheic&#xD;
             for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment prior to the&#xD;
             planned date of randomization and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Nonsterilised males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use condom and spermicide from enrolment through the study period until&#xD;
             their final follow up visit. Because male condom and spermicide is not a highly&#xD;
             effective contraception method, female partners of a male study participants must also&#xD;
             use a highly effective method of contraception as defined above throughout this&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any active medical or psychiatric condition or other reason which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, may compromise the safety of the participant in the study or&#xD;
             interfere with evaluation of the investigational product or reduce the participant's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any clinically relevant abnormal findings on physical examination of the&#xD;

             resting ECG, and any clinically significant abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG, as&#xD;
             considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc&#xD;
             interval changes, including abnormal ST-T wave morphology, or left ventricular&#xD;
             hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any other clinically relevant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory&#xD;
             testing including haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry or urinalysis at&#xD;
             screening or randomization, which in the opinion of the investigator may compromise&#xD;
             the safety of the participant in the study or interfere with evaluation of the&#xD;
             investigational product or reduce the participant's ability to participate in the&#xD;
