      This is a prospective Single-arm Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment with trastuzumab and pyrotinib plus palbociclib and fulvestrant in HER2-positive,&#xD;
      ER-positive breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ER+HER2+ breast cancer have low response to single endocrine therapy, however the efficacy&#xD;
      was improved when treated with endocrine therapy combined with anti-HER2 target therapy.&#xD;
      Palbociclib, to be a CDK4/6 inhibitor, has synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in&#xD;
      ER+/HER2+ cells. In China, there is nearly 40000 new patients with ER+/HER2+ breast cancer&#xD;
      every year. The encouraging results in NA-PHER2 study suggested the triple targeting of ER,&#xD;
      HER2, and RB1 could be an effective chemotherapy-free treatment strategy in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. However, pertuzumab is very expensive. The investigators plan to replace pertuzumab&#xD;
      with pyrotinib. Pyrotinib, a new irreversible pan-Her inhibitor in China pharmaceutical&#xD;
      company. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Neoadjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      trastuzumab and pyrotinib plus palbociclib and fulvestrant (TPPF) in this target population.&#xD;
      37 patients will enter the single-arm treatment group. The participants will receive an&#xD;
      association of drugs (trastuzumab, pyrotinib, palbociclib plus Fulvestrant, TPPF) as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. Surgery will be performed not earlier than 14 days and not later than 28&#xD;
      days after the last dose of any of the drugs in the combination. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      rate of pathological complete response (pCR) defined as ypT0-ypTis ypN0 at surgery. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint include the change in Ki67 expression from baseline and at C2D15 of&#xD;
      treatment and at surgery, objective response rate and safety.&#xD;
