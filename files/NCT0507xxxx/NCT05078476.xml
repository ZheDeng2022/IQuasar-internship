      The primary objective is to compare the two different rehabilitation protocols relative&#xD;
      motion flexion and short splint regarding patients'satisfaction in patients with flexor&#xD;
      tendon injuries in Zone I and II after 13 and 26 weeks post-surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction with the outcome will be evaluated by asking the patient a Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) question: &quot;How satisfied are you with your hand on a scale from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (fully satisfied)?</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The MHQ is a hand specific questionnaire used to measure the ability in daily function. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disabilities of Shoulder, Arm and Hand Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH questionnaire is a region-specific outcome instrument. The patient will rate 30-items about disability or symptoms by rating the degree of difficulty in doing various activities. The scores of all items are used to calculate a score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The range of motion will be measured with a goniometry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>Grip Strength will be measured with the JAMAR Dynamometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to rate the pain from 0 to 10. 0 indicates no pain, 10 the worst possible pain. The patient rate the pain while relaxed and during exercises.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of therapy sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The number of therapy sessions will be counted after 26 weeks or at the end of of therapy if after 26 weeks measurement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ten Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The Ten Test is a measure of discriminative sensation, whereby the patient describes the sensation from no sensation &quot;0&quot; to normal sensation &quot;10&quot; on an 11-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients specific function scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The patient defines three to five activities that are difficult or that he/she is unable to perform due to the hand injury. The patient is asked to rate the difficulty associated with each activity from 0 to 10. 0 is defined as not able to do the activity and 10 is able to do the activity normally.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 13 and 26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI is a quantitative assessment of absenteeism, presenteeism, and overall productivity loss attributable to a specific health problem during the previous 7 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rupture rate/ Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>Tendon rupture will be documented</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks after tendon repair</time_frame>
    <description>complications will be documented (e.g. CRPS, infection)</description>
