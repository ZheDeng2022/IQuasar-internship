  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, open label phase II clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of OLR in the treatment of initially treated mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients initially treated with mantle cell lymphoma were screened for OLR regimen according&#xD;
      to study admission criteria. The study will accept up to 24 cycles of treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression or intolerable toxicity occurs and subjects voluntarily withdraw informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after complete remission&#xD;
      may begin stem cell collection after induction therapy for at least 6 months. Twenty-nine&#xD;
      patients are expected to be enrolled&#xD;
