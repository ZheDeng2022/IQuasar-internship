      Voed je Beter is a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial to examine whether a&#xD;
      personalized intervention to increase adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines, compared to&#xD;
      usual clinical care, improves health of cardiovascular patients on top of medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients previously diagnosed with cardiovascular disease are randomized into two parallel&#xD;
      groups: the intervention or the usual care group. The intervention consists of personalized&#xD;
      guidance from a dietician focussing on improving adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines&#xD;
      during a period of six months. The control group receives usual clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, three months, six months, and 12 months measurements will be performed. Primary&#xD;
      outcome data will be collected at 6 months. After 12 months, additional data will be&#xD;
      collected to assess the prolonged effects of the intervention. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      interest is the difference in SMART Risk Score between the intervention and usual care group&#xD;
      from baseline till six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are differences in SMART Risk Score at three months and twelve months;&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and cardiovascular parameters; diet&#xD;
      quality, salt intake, vitamin levels in blood; body weight and waist circumference; renal&#xD;
      function; quality of life; sleep; self-efficacy; mental health and medication use. In&#xD;
      addition, an economic evaluation is carried out.&#xD;
