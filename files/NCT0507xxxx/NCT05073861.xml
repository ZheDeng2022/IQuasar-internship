      The Effect of Blend-learning in STEM in Young Children's Affective, Cognitive, and Academic&#xD;
      Outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background of the Study Traditionally, research in science education has predominantly&#xD;
      focused on formal classroom learning. With the advancement of technology, Gilbert (2015)&#xD;
      argues that formal science curriculum is limited in its elaboration and use of interesting&#xD;
      scientific illustrations and equipment. Moreover, while this learning context facilitates&#xD;
      knowledge acquisition, it may not promote life-long learning nor motivation to learn&#xD;
      (Vedder-Weiss &amp; Fortus, 2011). Motivation for science learning may be enhanced through&#xD;
      informal learning contexts such as extracurricular science-related activities and programs&#xD;
      (Fortus &amp; Vedder-Weiss, 2014). In these contexts, experiences that focus on real-world&#xD;
      problems-outside of school-may help in turn strengthen reasoning skills and understanding in&#xD;
      science. The current study investigates the impact of blended learning approach in an&#xD;
      informal learning environment on children's affective, cognitive, and academic outcomes in&#xD;
      science. In particular, students' motivation, identity, reasoning, and performance in science&#xD;
      are considered holistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives The current study aims to implement an app-based intervention program&#xD;
      that focuses on STEM learning outside of a formal classroom environment. The overarching goal&#xD;
      is to examine the efficacy of blended learning that utilizes a combination of an app and lab&#xD;
      experiments in children's affective, cognitive, and academic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participants will consist of 400 primary school students aged 8-10 years from 3&#xD;
      school in Hong Kong. The schools will be selected based on several criteria: 1) English&#xD;
      Medium-of-Instruction (EMI) schools with 2) mixed-ability classes. The data will be collected&#xD;
      during the summer holiday in 2021 and will be anonymized before processing and used in the&#xD;
      analyses. The classes will be randomly assigned to the experimental condition or the control&#xD;
      condition based on the random sampling method. Recruitment letter and advertisement poster&#xD;
      will be published both online and offline through different platforms. Information sheet,&#xD;
      consent form, and assent form will be distributed to the principals of the schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedures Classes will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and to the&#xD;
      control group. As treatment,the experimental group will be assigned to an intervention that&#xD;
      uses a STEM blended learning app with gamified videos for content knowledge along with&#xD;
      hands-on experiments. The videos are fictitious educational narratives related to the content&#xD;
      knowledge and students were asked to &quot;step into the shoes&quot; of the cartoon scientist (a&#xD;
      chipmunk) to solve various problems during the stories. The science experiments will be&#xD;
      completed with step-by-step video guidance on the app. The control group will be assigned to&#xD;
      read the same content on an e-book and receive an arts-and-craft kit for each lesson that is&#xD;
      unrelated to the content knowledge. The content is designed to be curriculum aligned; both&#xD;
      groups will learn about the same topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Electricity (Physics): 4 lessons on topics such as an introduction to electricity,&#xD;
           simple and complex electrical circuits, renewable energy and static electricity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Body Parts (Biology): 4 lessons on topics such as the muscoskeletal system, lungs, heart&#xD;
           and brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Environmental Science: 4 lessons on topics such as an introduction to the rainforest,&#xD;
           classification, parts and stages of plant growth, photosynthesis and water transport in&#xD;
           plants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will receive a 2.5-month intervention with the blended&#xD;
      learning app while the control group receive e-book chapters during the same period. Five&#xD;
      assessments, each of which will last for about 20-30 minutes, will be conducted throughout&#xD;
      the study: (1) before the intervention (Time 1) and; (2) after the completion of the&#xD;
      intervention (Time 2). Regardless of the group assignment, both groups will complete the&#xD;
      pre-assessments a week before the intervention using the same set of assessments in the&#xD;
      classroom. Moreover, both groups will receive hands-on materials during the intervention&#xD;
      albeit the materials differ between groups. As part of the study, the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive a science experimental kit for each of the lessons they watch on the app. Each&#xD;
      experiment corresponds to the content knowledge they learn for a particular lesson. The&#xD;
      control group will receive an arts-and-crafts kit for each chapter they read on the e-book.&#xD;
      All students will engage in the same amount of time for each lesson (45 mins) for 12 lessons&#xD;
      over the 2.5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics variables Students 'age, gender, and academic grades will be collected via&#xD;
      teachers during Time 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre/post-tests Measures The study will consist of multi-measure self-reported questionnaires.&#xD;
      It will include the following questionnaires that measure science motivation, science&#xD;
      identify, science performance, and scientific reasoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Science motivation Science motivation will be assessed using the Expectancy-Value-Cost Scale&#xD;
      based on the expectancyvalue model (Kosovich et al., 2015). The questionnaire was designed to&#xD;
      measure students' motivation in STEM. It includes 10 items to assess 3 sub-domains: how&#xD;
      successful students think they can perform (expectancy); how worthwhile science is (value)&#xD;
      and; perceived effort in doing well (cost). Students reported their responses using a 6-point&#xD;
      Likert scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Instructions are&#xD;
      explained to students prior to the administration: &quot;This is not a test. It is a short survey&#xD;
      about how much you like your science class. You can respond openly and honestly. All of your&#xD;
      responses will be kept confidential. No one will see your individual answers (not your&#xD;
      teacher, not your classmates, not your parents).&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Science identity Science identity is arguably a multidimensional construct that involves many&#xD;
      aspects and context. In this study, we will focus on informal settings outside of the&#xD;
      classroom. That is, how students relate to science in general and in their everyday lives. A&#xD;
      subset of 8 items were adapted from the science attitude scale in (Pell &amp; Jarvis (2001) to&#xD;
      assess science identity. The items in the questionnaire focus on real world science rather&#xD;
      than science in the classroom context. The students reported the degree of their agreement&#xD;
      with each item on a 6-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree, 6= strongly agree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Science performance Science performance will be measured using a combination of a real-time&#xD;
      content knowledge quizzes designed as part of the app as well as a subset of items from the&#xD;
      Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The content knowledge quizzes&#xD;
      are designed to be interactive, immersive and real-time quizzes as part of the stories that&#xD;
      students engage with in the app. The questions are constructed to be curriculum aligned and&#xD;
      were reviewed by science teachers. Each topic has 40 questions; in total, there are 120&#xD;
      questions for the three topics covered in the app. The sum score is used to quantify science&#xD;
      performance in the app. The items selected from TIMSS will be used as a second measurement of&#xD;
      students' knowledge in science. A total of 12 multiple-choice items that are relevant to the&#xD;
      topics will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific reasoning Scientific reasoning will be assessed using the Science-P Reasoning&#xD;
      Inventory (SPR-I) 7-item version designed for primary school students (Koerber &amp; Osterhaus,&#xD;
      2019). The SPR-I is an inventory that is based on the conceptual model of scientific&#xD;
      reasoning that relies on the understanding of hypothesisevidence relation in multiple&#xD;
      non-exclusive levels (i.e., naïve, intermediate, and advanced). The 7 items include 3 items&#xD;
      on nature of science, 3 items on experimentation, and 1 item on data interpretation. All&#xD;
      items are scored using a partial credit scale (0,1,2), which represents the three levels of&#xD;
      scientific reasoning. A score of 0 indicates a naïve understanding; a score of 1 indicates an&#xD;
      intermediate understanding and; a score of 2 indicates an advanced level of understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be both employed in this study.&#xD;
      A reliability analysis will be first conducted using scores obtained from the pre and&#xD;
      post-assessments. Comparisons between the mean scores of the experimental and control group&#xD;
      on all the outcome measures are then performed by evaluating the pre-intervention equivalency&#xD;
      of the groups. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) will be used as the main analysis&#xD;
      with science motivation, identity, achievement, and scientific reasoning scores as dependent&#xD;
      variables and group assignment status as the independent variable. Assignment status had two&#xD;
      levels, experimental and control.&#xD;
