    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted with the randomized controlled experimental method. The children&#xD;
      who attended the pediatric emergency department will divide into two groups via randomization&#xD;
      in the computer environment. After the randomization, children in the experimental group will&#xD;
      play with finger puppets under the direction of the researcher during venipuncture. On the&#xD;
      other hand, no application will perform on the children in the control group during the&#xD;
      venipuncture. The parents will also be found next to their children in both groups during the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many different non-pharmacological methods are used to cope with negative situations such as&#xD;
      pain, fear and anxiety caused by invasive procedures in children. One of these&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods is the distraction. The American Pain Society recommends the use&#xD;
      of distraction for pain control in children. With the distraction method, the child's pain is&#xD;
      controlled and reduced by focusing the child's attention in another direction. Video games,&#xD;
      virtual reality glasses, listening to music, watching cartoons, blowing balloons, reading&#xD;
      books, playing with puppet/finger puppets are used as distraction methods. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the effect of distraction method applied with finger puppet on the&#xD;
      child's pain level and emotional indicators in children aged 3-6 years who applied to the&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department and underwent venous blood collection. The sample size of the&#xD;
      study has been determined by the power analysis (G*Power 3.1.9.2), in line with the results&#xD;
      obtained from the studies which have been conducted using a similar research method. The&#xD;
      sample size was found to be a total of 76 children including minimum of 38 children for each&#xD;
      group. It was estimated that case losses may occur and therefore, it was decided to conduct&#xD;
      the study with a total of 80 children including 40 children in two groups. Information Form,&#xD;
      Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Scale, and Children's Emotional&#xD;
      Manifestation Scale will use for data collection. Children and their parents who applied to&#xD;
      the pediatric emergency unit will inform about the study. Information about children and&#xD;
      their parents included in the study will ask by the researcher through face-to-face&#xD;
      interviews and these data will record in 'Information Form' five minutes before the&#xD;
      procedure. One minute before the procedure children in the experimental group will start to&#xD;
      play with finger puppets under the direction of the researcher. The researcher will continue&#xD;
      to distract the child's attention during the procedure with finger puppets. For distraction&#xD;
      the researcher will put finger puppets consisting of various animal figures on his finger,&#xD;
      and will ask the child to imitate these sounds by making animal-specific sounds that he moves&#xD;
      with his finger. The researcher will also draw the child's attention to finger puppets by&#xD;
      using methods such as making animals talk to each other and singing. Children in the control&#xD;
      group will be given routine practices and no distraction method will be applied. Before and&#xD;
      during venipuncture children's pain will evaluate with the FLACC Scale and their emotional&#xD;
      status will evaluate with the Children's Emotional Manifestation Scale by the healthcare&#xD;
      provider who performs the venipuncture procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Pain will assess by the healthcare provider who performs the venipuncture procedure with the FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) Scale. This scale was developed to evaluate the pain of children aged 2 months to 7 years. The child's facial expression, leg movements, activity, crying, and comfortability behaviors are evaluated in relation to pain. These five behaviors are rated with 0, 1, or 2 points. The total score of the scale ranges from 0 to 10, and a high score indicates that the child has more pain. '0' points from the scale indicate no pain, '1-3' points indicate mild pain, '4-6' points indicate moderate pain, and '7-10' points indicate severe pain.</description>

    <description>Children's emotional status will assess by the healthcare provider who performs the venipuncture procedure with the Children's Emotional Manifestation Scale. This scale was developed to objectively evaluate children's emotional behaviors towards medical procedures. In the scale, emotional indicators are evaluated according to 5 parameters (facial expression, voice, activity, interaction, cooperation level). These five parameters are scored from 1 to 5, with the lowest '5' and the highest '25' points. A high score on the scale indicates that the child displays more negative emotional behavior during the procedure.</description>
