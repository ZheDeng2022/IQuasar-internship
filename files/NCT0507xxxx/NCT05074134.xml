    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, Phase 1 study conducted at a single study center in the&#xD;
      United States (USA). This study will evaluate the absorption, metabolism and elimination&#xD;
      (AME), mass balance, safety and tolerability of a single dose of intravenously administered&#xD;
      [14C]-TNP-2092.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men aged 18 to 55, will be screened, and subjects who meet all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      and provide written informed consent will be enrolled into the study within 28 days of&#xD;
      Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the day prior to dosing (Day -1). Subjects&#xD;
      will fast overnight and then given a standard breakfast 30 min prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six subjects will be enrolled in the study and each will receive a single intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      dose of 300 mg/3 μCi [14C]-TNP-2092 administered over 60 minutes (±10 minutes).&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single dose, Phase 1 study conducted at a single study center in the&#xD;
      United States (USA). This study will evaluate the absorption, metabolism and elimination&#xD;
      (AME), mass balance, safety and tolerability of a single dose of intravenously administered&#xD;
      [14C]-TNP-2092 Healthy men aged 18 to 55, will be screened, and subjects who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
      within 28 days of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the day prior to dosing (Day 1). Subjects&#xD;
      will fast overnight and then given a standard breakfast 30 min prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six subjects will be enrolled in the study and each will receive a single intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      dose of 300 mg/3 µCi [14C]-TNP-2092 administered over 60 minutes (±10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain in the unit for 7 days after dosing (until morning of Day 8) for&#xD;
      observation and collection of whole blood, urine and fecal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (-30 minutes) and at 15 minutes, 30&#xD;
      minutes, 45 minutes, 1 h (end of infusion), and at 1 h 5 minutes, 1 h 10 minutes, 1 h 15&#xD;
      minutes, 1 h 30 minutes, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours&#xD;
      after initiation of the [14C]-TNP-2092 infusion (n=25 timepoints per subject). Depending on&#xD;
      14C radiolabel recovery, an additional whole blood sample may be collected on Day 15 (336&#xD;
      hours after initiation dosing) for a total of n=26 timepoints per subject. These samples will&#xD;
      be used to determine concentrations of TNP-2092 (in plasma), metabolite profiling (in&#xD;
      plasma), and total [14C] (whole blood and plasma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be continuously collected for [14C] recovery, and metabolite assessments from the&#xD;
      time of admission until immediately prior to dosing (pre dose) and over the following&#xD;
      collection intervals: 0-8, 8-16, 16-24, 24-48, 48-72, 72-96, 96-120, 120-144 and 144-168&#xD;
      hours (Day 8) after initiation of the [14C]-TNP 2092 infusion (n=10 timepoints per subject).&#xD;
      Depending on 14C radiolabel recovery, additional urine samples may be collected on Days 14&#xD;
      and 15 (312-336 hours after dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feces will be continuously collected for metabolite and [14C] recovery assessments from the&#xD;
      time of admission until immediately prior to dosing (pre dose) and over the following&#xD;
      collection intervals: 0-24, 24-48, 48-72, 72-96, 96-120, 120-144 and 144-168 hours (Day 8)&#xD;
      after initiation of the [14C]-TNP-2092 infusion (n=8 timepoints per subject). Depending on&#xD;
      14C radiolabel recovery, additional fecal samples may be collected on Days 14 and 15 (312-336&#xD;
      hours after dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by physical examination, vital signs (VS), 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry panel, hematology,&#xD;
      coagulation, and urinalysis), use of concomitant medications, collection of adverse events,&#xD;
      and by unscheduled assessments as needed for management of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the CPC on Day 8 after completion of all 168h timepoint&#xD;
      assessments. The Investigator will indicate whether ≥90% of the 14C radiolabel has been&#xD;
      recovered in samples collected through 168h; if so, Day 8 will be the final study visit. If&#xD;
      recovery of 14C in excreta is &lt;90% by the time of discharge on Day 8, subjects will return to&#xD;
      the site for an additional 24-hour PK confinement period on Days 14-15 (312-336h). The date&#xD;
      of study completion for each subject will be defined as the last day that PK samples are&#xD;
      collected. To avoid enrolling a participant with systemic 14C excess, samples of urine and/or&#xD;
      blood (either whole blood or plasma) obtained at Screening must show no significant excess of&#xD;
      14C over environmental background level.&#xD;
