  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that CV-19 is associated with joint symptoms, but there are no specific&#xD;
      data on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). It is also known that the systemic health status&#xD;
      can impact the immune system. Given all this, this study aimed to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      CV-19 and systemic health status, as determined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) Physical Status Classification System 12, on TMJ in patients with TMJ complaints using&#xD;
      the DC/TMD scale.&#xD;

      This study investigates the effect of systemic status, according to American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologist (ASA), and COVID-19 on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders using the&#xD;
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) scale, shown to be valid for&#xD;
      assessing TMJ disorders. The study included 76 patients who presented to our clinic with TMJ.&#xD;
      Participants were divided into two groups: those with COVID-19 (CV-19, study group) and those&#xD;
      without (non-CV-19, control group). These two groups were both further divided into subgroups&#xD;
      according to ASA 1 and ASA 2 classification. Power analyses were performed using G*Power&#xD;
      software to determine the required number of patients. Groups were compared using the Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire, a demographics survey, the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS), and the Jaw&#xD;
      Functional Limitation Scale-20 (JFLS-20) of the DC/TMD. The statistical software program&#xD;
      version 1.6.23 was used for statistical analysis. Although joint complaints were more common&#xD;
      in ASA 2 patients with CV-19, the groups were not significantly different. The CV-19 ASA 2&#xD;
      group had the highest JFLS-20 score (mean: 1.3±1.5) and the non-CV-19 ASA 1 group had the&#xD;
      lowest JFLS-20 score (mean: 0.7±0.8), but the differences were again not significant. Joint&#xD;
      complaints were more common and more severe in ASA 2 patients with CV-19, albeit not with&#xD;
      statistical significance. More studies are needed to better understand our results.&#xD;

    <measure>DC/TMD scale - Graded Chronic Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 8-item scale is graded on a scale of 0-10 points. It includes 3 questions on pain intensity, 4 questions on function, and 1 question on the number of days with facial pain. The GCPS consists of two subscales. As the first subscale, Characteristic Pain Intensity is measured, where a score of ≥50 out of 100 possible points indicates high-intensity pain. The Interference Score is then calculated as the second subscale based on scores concerning interference in daily activities and work and the number of days with interference</description>

    <measure>DC/TMD scale - Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-20</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of three subscales that address limitations of mastication, vertical mobility, and verbal and non-verbal communication. These three subscales are ideal for both research purposes and patient assessment of various functional limitations of the jaw. It is a global scale that consists of 20 items and the three aforementioned subscales (mastication, vertical mobility, and verbal and non-verbal communication)</description>
