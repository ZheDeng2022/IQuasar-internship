  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cancer patients, social support provided by partners, family and/or friends plays a key&#xD;
      role in coping with the disease and reducing treatment-related distress. However, research&#xD;
      indicates that some of the needs of patients, such as coping with the disease, reducing&#xD;
      isolation or managing guilt, often go unmet. With the aim of trying to meet these types of&#xD;
      needs of people with cancer, the present research will evaluate the effectiveness of a peer&#xD;
      support program in cancer patients, based on the support provided or exchanged by people who&#xD;
      have faced similar challenges or problems. The intervention will consist of 8 face-to-face&#xD;
      sessions of social peer support, involving a cancer patient and a volunteer who is in a&#xD;
      stable phase and who has undergone the same diagnosis and medical treatment. To evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the social support program, the immediate and long-term effect of&#xD;
      participation in the program on both psychological (anxious-depressive symptoms, quality of&#xD;
      life, perception of the disease, coping strategies, perception of social support,...) and&#xD;
      biological (endocrine and immune system) variables will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the present research will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer&#xD;
      social support intervention in cancer patients at the Onkologikoa Foundation of Guipuzcoa.&#xD;
      Specifically, the immediate and long-term effect that such intervention will have on symptoms&#xD;
      of psychological distress, quality of life, coping strategy, perception of social support,&#xD;
      perception of the disease and emotional regulation will be evaluated. As a secondary aim of&#xD;
      this study, we intend to evaluate the immediate and long-term effect of the peer social&#xD;
      support intervention on the immune system (through the determination of the levels of&#xD;
      cytokines IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-α), on the monoaminergic system&#xD;
      (through the determination of plasma levels of serotonin, tyrosine, phenylalanine,&#xD;
      tryptophan, quinurenine, quinurenic acid and 3-HK), on the HPA axis (through the measurement&#xD;
      of the diurnal cycle of cortisol), and on sex hormones (through the measurement of estradiol&#xD;
      and testosterone levels), systems that have been related both to the development of&#xD;
      anxious-depressive symptoms and to the development, progression and recurrence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it will be studied at what time the application of the program is most&#xD;
      effective, being applied in newly diagnosed patients (experimental group 1) and in patients&#xD;
      who have just finished medical treatment (experimental group 2).&#xD;
