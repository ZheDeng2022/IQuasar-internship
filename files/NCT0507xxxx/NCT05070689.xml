    <textblock>
      Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorders are rising in incidence due to increased rate of&#xD;
      repeat caesarean sections. Peripartum hysterectomy remains the only definitive treatment of&#xD;
      massive postpartum haemorrhage related to this condition. Researchers have described&#xD;
      conservative treatments in the form of pelvic devascularization under radiological control,&#xD;
      myometrial resection with placenta in situ, and various suturing techniques some involving&#xD;
      inversion of cervix. Variable success rates are described, but search continues for a simple,&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment. The objective of this study is to assess the simplicity, safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of A. Chohan Continuous Squeezing Suture (ACCSS) in the management of PAS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta spectrum has opened up a new era in the history of PPH, as forcible&#xD;
      separation of adherent placenta leads to massive bleeding from placental bed . Peripartum&#xD;
      hysterectomy has emerged as gold standard treatment for this variety of PPH (3 folds rise&#xD;
      over uterine atony) with its overall morbidity of 40-50%, and mortality of 7-10% in case of&#xD;
      placenta percreta . The fear of placental bed bleeding has led to the development of&#xD;
      conservative management like &quot;leaving the placenta in situ approach&quot; with its wide range of&#xD;
      mild to severe, and serious morbidities . The conservative surgical techniques (The triple P&#xD;
      procedure, one step conservative surgery approach) have also used the concept of&#xD;
      non-separation of placenta and have instead adopted resection of myometrium with placenta in&#xD;
      situ . These surgeries involve devascularisation of deep pelvic / major abdominal vessels and&#xD;
      ligation of complex arterial anastomosis making the procedure technically difficult.&#xD;
      Moreover, the devascularisation is done under extensive and expensive interventional&#xD;
      radiological equipment which places the procedures out of reach for the routine setups&#xD;
      particularly in the under developed countries. Another conservative surgical technique&#xD;
      (stepwise surgical approach) , which described separation of placenta also mainly relied upon&#xD;
      devascularisation of pelvic organs by bilateral ligation of anterior branch of internal iliac&#xD;
      artery rather than elaborating the details of technique of controlling haemorrhage at the&#xD;
      actual bleeding site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of ACCSS ACCSS is a novel suturing technique addresses the management of placenta&#xD;
      praevia and PAS following the orthodox approach of separation of placenta, taking the&#xD;
      challenge of controlling massive haemorrhage. The rational of ACCSS is; i. Placental bed is&#xD;
      the ultimate area of concern in women with placenta praevia and PAS, and it generally spreads&#xD;
      over the whole inner surface of lower uterine segment, but the placental attachment and&#xD;
      bleeding area upon its separation does not extend onto the internal os and into the vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Lower uterine segment is thin, flexible, squeezable and holds the suture well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Internal cervical os is a fixed structure, and has a ring with sufficient strength to&#xD;
      function as anchor to the suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Taking half thickness of internal cervical os into suture does not alter the anatomy and&#xD;
      uterine drainage remains unaffected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Deep pelvic devascularization by ligation or balloon tamponade occlusion (under&#xD;
      radiological control) of deep pelvic vessels was not the part of ACCSS procedure. Bilateral&#xD;
      uterine artery ligation was added to it because occlusion of the uterine artery or its&#xD;
      branches is useful procedure to stop upper uterine bleeding , it does not appear to affect&#xD;
      fertility or obstetric outcome and vascular occlusion is only temporary, as recanalization&#xD;
      soon ensures normal uterine circulation . The haemostatic effect of ACCSS is therefore&#xD;
      independent and does not rely upon supportive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL PROCEDURE The caesarean sections in this study will be performed between 37 and 38&#xD;
      weeks of gestation on all patients. Haematology department will be placed on alert with&#xD;
      availability of 4 units of cross matched fresh blood and fresh frozen plasma. All surgeries&#xD;
      will be performed by principal investigators (Prof Dr. Arshad Chohan &amp; Prof. Dr. Fauzia). A&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team comprising of experienced obstetricians, anaesthetist, and&#xD;
      paediatrician will be involved during the procedure. Prophylactic antibiotic (ceftriaxone 1gm&#xD;
      intravenously) will be administered to all patients before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At caesarean section Pfannenstiel incision will be used for all patients. After opening the&#xD;
      abdomen, a clinical assessment about the depth of invasion of the placenta will be made to&#xD;
      exclude the involvement of bladder and other pelvic organs. The features noted at this&#xD;
      assessment will be abnormal placental bulge and hypervascularity on uterine serosal surface,&#xD;
      and placental invasion into the urinary bladder and/or other pelvic organs. Prior to uterine&#xD;
      incision placental site will be gently reconfirmed with the examining hand to ascertain an&#xD;
      easy fetal access and to avoid cutting of placenta particularly in case of anterior dominant&#xD;
      placenta. A transverse incision will be given in the lower uterine segment (LUS) above the&#xD;
      insertion of placenta and the baby will be delivered. At delivery of baby10 iu of oxytocin&#xD;
      will be given intravenously, followed by 40 iu in 500 ml of normal saline at the rate of&#xD;
      125ml/hour for first 24 hours as per hospital policy for caesarean section for PAS. The&#xD;
      uterus will be exteriorized without making any efforts to remove the placenta. The bleeding&#xD;
      edges of the uterine incision will be held with Green-Armitage forceps to minimize bleeding.&#xD;
      The visceral peritoneum will be displaced downwards with sharp and blunt dissection to allow&#xD;
      suturing on the inner side of the LUS. Bladder will be dissected away only if found adherent&#xD;
      with the lower uterine segment from previous caesarean sections. Uterine arteries will be&#xD;
      ligated on both sides and any blood vessels on the way will be secured. The placenta will&#xD;
      then be removed to as close to complete as possible. The lower uterine segment will be packed&#xD;
      with sponge to arrest haemorrhage temporarily while preparing for the suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCSS Application The packing will be removed and the ring of internal os will be identified&#xD;
      with the index and middle finger of one hand and held with Babcock forceps with the other&#xD;
      hand. On the exposed inner surface of the LUS, suturing will be started from the left corner&#xD;
      of uterine incision, using half circle 40mm round body polyglactin 910 suture # 1 (vicryl&#xD;
      plus by Ethicon Â®) taking multiple half cm bites through half-thickness of the tissue at half&#xD;
      cm intervals to reach the outer half of ring of internal os. The suture will then tied and&#xD;
      first knot secured causing squeezing of uterine tissue. From here onwards similar sutures&#xD;
      will be placed continuously at 1 cm distance till the right corner will be reached, where the&#xD;
      second knot will be secured. During suturing the patency of the internal os will be ensured.&#xD;
      The continued pull on the suture is expected to cause squeezing of the LUS and arrest&#xD;
      bleeding from all sinuses present at the placental site . A similar suture will be applied on&#xD;
      the posterior uterine wall in case of bleeding from posterior uterine wall. The suture will&#xD;
      be started from the outer half of the posterior lip of the ring of the internal os and going&#xD;
      up to the highest bleeding point on the posterior wall of the uterus, continuing from the&#xD;
      left to right end of the uterine incision . Any leftover bleeding points will be secured with&#xD;
      separate sutures to ensure complete haemostasis. The uterine incision will be closed in two&#xD;
      layers as done in a routine lower segment caesarean section. Any additional medical or&#xD;
      surgical therapy instituted will be recorded.&#xD;
