  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed study is to evaluate an ecological momentary assessment plus an&#xD;
      ecological momentary intervention (EMA+EMI) for emerging adults in a psychiatric partial&#xD;
      hospitalization program who drink to cope with negative affect (NA) as compared to&#xD;
      personalized feedback only. This intervention combines a personalized feedback intervention&#xD;
      (PFI) with EMA technology and tailored EMI text messaging (PFICope+EMI). PFICope+EMI not only&#xD;
      aims to reduce drinking to cope, but also alcohol use and NA. This study consists of a 6-week&#xD;
      randomized controlled treatment trial to test the PFIcope+EMI intervention as compared to&#xD;
      personalized normative feedback only (PNF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the relationship between mental health and alcohol problems, there is a need to address&#xD;
      comorbidity among emerging adults (EAs) with anxiety and/or depression. The weeks after&#xD;
      psychiatric hospitalization are a risky time for problematic alcohol use and recurrence of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms. The delivery of tailored, coping skills-based, real-time messages could&#xD;
      have a significant impact on problematic drinking and depression/anxiety outcomes by reducing&#xD;
      the likelihood that an individual drinks to cope with NA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test a 6-week PFIcope+EMI intervention as compared to&#xD;
      personalized normative feedback only (PNF) for EA in a partial hospitalization program who&#xD;
      drink to cope and binge drink (n=60). The PFIcope+EMI includes: 1) an in-person personalized&#xD;
      feedback session to present feedback on problems with drinking to cope, discuss the&#xD;
      individual's use of alcohol to cope, and generate coping skills messages to be used in the&#xD;
      EMI intervention; 2) EMA to monitor affect, intention to drink, coping skills usage, alcohol&#xD;
      use, drinking to cope post-discharge; 3) tailored text messages (EMI) based on EMA&#xD;
      (individualized coping skills messages when NA and intention to drink are reported). The&#xD;
      Personalized Normative Feedback condition (PNF) will receive a personalized normative&#xD;
      feedback report but no EMA or EMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' alcohol outcomes and psychiatric symptomatology at 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and&#xD;
      6-months will be assessed to determine outcomes and feasibility/acceptability. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals in PFIcope+EMI arm will report between-subjects reductions in drinking to&#xD;
           cope, alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and NA as compared to PNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PFIcope+EMI will be feasible to implement and result in high rates of participant&#xD;
           satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of the intervention for the PFIcope+EMI group&#xD;
      utilizing the daily EMA data will be explored. It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In response to NA, participants will report an increase in coping skills utilization and&#xD;
           decreased intent to drink at the following EMA assessment point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NA reductions and increased coping skills utilization will be related to improvements in&#xD;
           alcohol use rates and problems at the following EMA assessment.&#xD;
