      The application of PEG in geriatric-palliative care has not been well discussed. With the&#xD;
      development of endoscopic procedures and PEG devices, we can perform this minimally invasive&#xD;
      method more safely, even in challenging cases. We should discuss the indications of PEG in&#xD;
      the field of palliative care of geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presented study evaluated geriatric (&gt; 65-year-old) palliative care patients to whom PEG&#xD;
      applied at our institution.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Palliative care is a treatment method that focuses on the patient and patient's family, aims&#xD;
      to minimize the complaints caused by chronic diseases that cannot be treated, and increases&#xD;
      life quality. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence defines palliative care&#xD;
      as; the active, holistic care of patients with an advanced progressive illness. Management of&#xD;
      pain and other symptoms and providing psychological, social, and spiritual support is&#xD;
      paramount. Anorexia, weight loss, and sarcopenia are highly visible and distressing reminders&#xD;
      of the life-limiting disease's influence on patients who require palliative care. Given this&#xD;
      multifaceted and significant role, it is not unexpected that nutritional treatment method&#xD;
      choices can be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a minimally-invasive endoscopic procedure that&#xD;
      creates a passage from the patient's stomach to the abdominal wall via a feeding tube and&#xD;
      provides a means of feeding if oral intake is not adequate. This safe and effective&#xD;
      minimally-invasive option has been utilized in medical practice for over 40 years. PEG has&#xD;
      advantages such as being minimally invasive, causing a low rate of complications and&#xD;
      morbidity, and providing a long-lasting and safe feeding route. It is currently the chosen&#xD;
      procedure for medium- and long-term enteral feeding in cases who need palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of PEG in geriatric-palliative care has not been well discussed. With the&#xD;
      development of endoscopic procedures and PEG devices, we can perform this minimally invasive&#xD;
      method more safely, even in challenging cases. We should discuss the indications of PEG in&#xD;
      the field of palliative care of geriatric patients.&#xD;

      The presented study evaluated geriatric (&gt; 65-year-old) palliative care patients to whom PEG&#xD;
      applied at our institution.&#xD;

        We retrospectively assessed the medical data of PEG applied &gt;65-year-old patients at our&#xD;
        institution between December 2017 and March 2021. And, we excluded the patients who were&#xD;
        not treated in our palliative care center. Table 1. shows the contraindications for PEG&#xD;
        placement.&#xD;
