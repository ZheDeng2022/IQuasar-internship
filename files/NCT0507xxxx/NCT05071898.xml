      Overweight/obese otherwise healthy volunteers will be recruited from the Old Order Amish&#xD;
      population in Lancaster County, PA. Lancaster County, PA. Pharmacodynamic responses to GLP1R&#xD;
      agonist will be assessed by conducting frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests&#xD;
      (FSIGT) both before and after semaglutide for six weeks. The proposal proposes two specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific Aim #1. To identify genetic variants associated with effects of a GLP1R agonist&#xD;
           to enhance glucose-stimulated first phase insulin secretion in the two FSIGTs (before&#xD;
           and after administration of drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aim #2. To identify genetic variants associated with the effect of a GLP1R&#xD;
           agonist to accelerate the rate of glucose disappearance as assessed in the two FSIGTs&#xD;
           (before and after administration of drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping will be conducted using a high-density array with comprehensive coverage of DNA&#xD;
      sequence variants. In addition, the analysis will leverage a global imputation panel&#xD;
      generated from 1,025 Amish individuals.&#xD;

      Overweight/obese otherwise healthy volunteers will be recruited from the Old Order Amish&#xD;
      population in Lancaster County, PA. In order to assess pharmacodynamic responses, research&#xD;
      participants will undergo two frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGT).&#xD;
      The first FSIGT will be conducted at baseline prior to administration of drug. The second&#xD;
      FSIGT will be conducted after six weeks of treatment with semaglutide (0.25 mg/wk X 4 wks;&#xD;
      0.5 mg/sk X 2 wks). The proposal proposes two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim #1. To identify genetic variants associated with effects of a GLP1R agonist&#xD;
           to enhance glucose-stimulated first phase insulin secretion in the two FSIGTs (before&#xD;
           and after administration of drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim #2. To identify genetic variants associated with the effect of a GLP1R&#xD;
           agonist to accelerate the rate of glucose disappearance as assessed in the two FSIGTs&#xD;
           (before and after administration of drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being determined to be eligible and after having given informed consent, participants&#xD;
      will undergo two frequently samples intravenous glucose tolerance tests conducted at two&#xD;
      clinic visits as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #1 - Research participants will be transported to the Amish Research clinic in the&#xD;
      fasting state (minimum of 8 hour, maximum of 24 hour fast) where height, weight, waist and&#xD;
      hip measurements, and vital signs will be measured. Women of child-bearing potential will&#xD;
      undergo a urine pregnancy test. An FSIVGTT will be conducted as follows: IV (intravenous)&#xD;
      access will be established in both arms of the research participant, one for glucose infusion&#xD;
      and the other for frequent blood sampling. NSS (normal saline solution) will be used to&#xD;
      maintain patency of IV. Intravenous glucose (0.3 g/kg) will be infused over 2 min at time=0,&#xD;
      and 31 blood samples will be obtained between -15 and +180 minutes. Approximately 180 ml (36&#xD;
      tsp.) of blood will be drawn. Upon completion of the FSIVGTT, the participant will be&#xD;
      instructed in the self-administration of subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of semaglutide. The&#xD;
      first dose of semaglutide .25mg will be administered at this time. The participant will be&#xD;
      provided with a post-fasting meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home self-administration of weekly semaglutide: The participant will self-administer s.c.&#xD;
      semaglutide weekly for 5 weeks (.25 mg for weeks 2,3,4 and .5 mg for weeks 5,6) A research&#xD;
      nurse may observe the participant self-administering the first home dose and will make&#xD;
      additional home visits as needed to ensure successful self-injection. The participant will&#xD;
      use the study provided scale to obtain and record daily weights in the morning before&#xD;
      breakfast throughout the medication weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #2 - This visit will be scheduled within 1 week of the final (6th) dose of semaglutide&#xD;
      +/- 5 days. The FSIVGTT will be conducted exactly as during the previous clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping will be conducted using a high-density array with comprehensive coverage of DNA&#xD;
      sequence variants. The project will leverage a global imputation panel generated from whole&#xD;
      genome sequence data on ~ 100K subjects including 1,025 Amish individuals obtained through&#xD;
      the NHLBI-sponsored Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.&#xD;
