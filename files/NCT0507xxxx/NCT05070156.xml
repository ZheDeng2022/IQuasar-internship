      This is an Open-label, Single Arm study to observe the safety and tolerability of B010-A in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects participating in this study will receive peripheral blood mononuclear cell&#xD;
      collection to produce B010-A injection products after enrollment. Subjects may receive&#xD;
      bridging anti-cancer therapy while waiting for the production of B010-A injection. All&#xD;
      subjects need to undergo baseline assessment before receiving cell infusion. For all&#xD;
      subjects, the baseline assessment includes weight, body surface area, vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examination, ECOG score, laboratory examination, coagulation function, etiological&#xD;
      examination, 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram, cytokine testing, Tumor marker detection and ICE&#xD;
      score, etc. Each subject will receive lymphodepletion prior to B010-A infusion, and&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment will be performed on D28 after the first infusion.&#xD;
