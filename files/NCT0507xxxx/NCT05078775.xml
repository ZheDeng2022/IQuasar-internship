    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study evaluating the tolerability and markers of pancreatic cancer with&#xD;
      a specially designed medical food restricted in specific amino acids for the dietary&#xD;
      management of subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects will be receiving&#xD;
      two FDA approved first line drug therapies, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (gem+nabP), that&#xD;
      are routinely prescribed in combination for metastatic pancreatic cancer as part of their&#xD;
      routine care.&#xD;

             or metastatic site that has been biopsied within the last 6 months and provide consent&#xD;

             having energy or appetite sufficient to reliably engage in a strict medical food&#xD;
             regimen for an extended time.&#xD;
&#xD;
