  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed this study to determine and compare frequency of induction of ovulation in women&#xD;
      with polycystic ovarian syndrome treated with Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate as&#xD;
      published literature shows variations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discrepancy between ovulation induction rate and pregnancy rate is related to anti-estrogenic&#xD;
      effects on cervical mucus and endometrium and long acting gonadotrophins are more effective&#xD;
      than clomiphene citrate. This study was aimed at comparing frequency of induction of&#xD;
      ovulation in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome treated with Letrozole versus clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate.&#xD;

    <description>A total of 39 women were given clomiphene citrate, 100mg from 3 to 7 days of menstrual cycle.

Induction of ovulation was assessed by TVS. If follicle of &gt;2cm is found on 12 days TVS and smaller/collapsed on 16 days TVS, ovulation induction was labeled.</description>
