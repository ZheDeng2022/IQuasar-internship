  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the Ministry of Health and Welfare promoted long-term care 2.0 in 2017, it has actively&#xD;
      flipped the concept of care. The long-term care professional service added the spirit of&#xD;
      self-care, emphasized the dignity and autonomy of the elderly, and provided professional&#xD;
      services (including reablement services) to enhance the individual's ability to live&#xD;
      independently. However, the use of professional services may be controversial due to unclear&#xD;
      understanding of the purpose and service mode of professional services and lack of&#xD;
      preparation, vertical (county and city governments, community integrated service centers&#xD;
      (A-level units), long-term care service units, etc.) and horizontal cross-professional&#xD;
      cooperation is rare, the effectiveness of professional services is unclear, and issues of&#xD;
      service quality management also need attention. Therefore, there is an urgent need to&#xD;
      integrate the current implementation content and service personnel qualifications of&#xD;
      professional services, improve the knowledge of professional service personnel, strengthen&#xD;
      the links between county and city governments, A-level units, and long-term care service&#xD;
      units, and improve the quality of professional services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this plan is to set up experts and working groups, revise the professional&#xD;
      service manuals, develop long-term professional service operation guidelines, review the&#xD;
      long-term professional service payment system, and develop professional service quality&#xD;
      management mechanisms to provide reference for policy planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will achieve their goals through the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish an interdisciplinary, academic and practical expert working group,&#xD;
           professional service manual/operation guide revising group, and hold meetings.&#xD;
           Researchers will also review professional service manuals and operational guidelines for&#xD;
           the drafts of professional services, and the payment system and the improvement&#xD;
           mechanism of service quality, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review domestic and foreign documents: four countries including Norway, the United&#xD;
           Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. Researchers will compare the long-term care professional&#xD;
           service or reablement service models of various countries, and serve as follow-up&#xD;
           experts to revise professional service manuals, operating guidelines, and basis for&#xD;
           professional service execution and quality management mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Achievement analysis of model cases: based on the extended case method of qualitative&#xD;
           research, it is expected to solicit high-quality model long-term care professional&#xD;
           service units, and in-depth collection of relevant information on the characteristics,&#xD;
           process and results of the case homes and service units of successful cases of long-term&#xD;
           professional services, conduct ethnographic research and benchmarking, understand the&#xD;
           operation of the domestic model, as a follow-up reference for the various tasks of this&#xD;
           project .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Based on the above-mentioned literature review, model case analysis, expert writing, and&#xD;
           multiple meetings, develop a long-term professional service manual/long-term&#xD;
           professional service operation guidelines, and propose an amendment draft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Suggestions for the review of the payment system for long-term care professional&#xD;
           services: methods include the above-mentioned literature review, establishment of an&#xD;
           expert group, case visits, analysis of results of typical cases, and discussions on the&#xD;
           draft and different payment methods of various care packages and classification of&#xD;
           different payment cases, obtain group consensus through the Delphi method, and conduct&#xD;
           pros and cons analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Conduct simulation verification for the service payment method draft and different&#xD;
           payment case classifications, visit cases (including cases with different disability&#xD;
           levels or characteristics), and analyze the verification results and make&#xD;
           recommendations for revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Based on the above literature review, analysis of the results of model cases and&#xD;
           discussions at expert meetings, develop professional service quality evaluation and&#xD;
           management mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Produce public version of long-term professional service manual/long-term professional&#xD;
           service operation guide for lecture notes and educational training media, and handle&#xD;
           seven sessions of education training in North, Central, South, and East of Taiwan.&#xD;
