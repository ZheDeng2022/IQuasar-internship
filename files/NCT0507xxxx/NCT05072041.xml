  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to prospectively collect clinical data from patients who&#xD;
      underwent hepatic artery chemoembolization using microspheres with different degradation&#xD;
      times (2 hours, 1 day, 2 weeks) based on standard treatment.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective study, and the purpose of this study is to investigate and&#xD;
      collect clinical information on the safety and efficacy of degradable microsphere for hepatic&#xD;
      artery chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The primary purpose of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the incidence of postembolism syndrome and liver function impairment&#xD;
      after hepatic artery chemoembolization, and the secondary purpose was to evaluate tumor&#xD;
      treatment response and hepatic artery damage after 1 month of hepatic artery&#xD;
      chemoembolization.&#xD;

    <description>Nexsphere™ is a yellow powder, made of 100% hydrophilic gelatin. It is used to make a suspension by mixing a contrast agent and physiological saline. The indications for spherical gel foam are hepatic artery chemoembolization, uterine artery embolization, prostate artery embolization, and treatment of various hemorrhagic diseases. It physically embolizes blood vessels and is decomposed within 4-8 weeks after intravascular injection.</description>
