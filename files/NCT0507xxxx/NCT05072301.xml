  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot test a novel reactive carrot approach for improving&#xD;
      individuals' ability to stick to a &quot;practice quit&quot; program in a smoking cessation context. In&#xD;
      this study, the treatment gives subjects an offer to forego a monetary incentive to forego&#xD;
      the opportunity to receive subsequent abstention (contingency management) rewards.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the subjects, treatment and control groups, would be given the opportunity to receive&#xD;
      attendance rewards for attending six CO testing meetings as well as abstention (contingency&#xD;
      management) rewards for abstaining from smoking. The only difference between the subjects&#xD;
      randomly assigned to treatment and control groups is that each member of the treatment group&#xD;
      would be tempted at the beginning of their program by being offered a one-time monetary&#xD;
      incentive to forego the opportunity to receive subsequent abstention (contingency management)&#xD;
      rewards. Treatment group subjects would, at their initial intake meeting after the attendance&#xD;
      and abstention rewards opportunity had been described, be given a one-time opportunity to&#xD;
      received $80 temptation payment to give up the opportunity to receive subsequent abstinence&#xD;
      (contingency management) rewards that could be worth as much as $165. Subjects who accepted&#xD;
      this one-time opportunity would remain enrolled in the practice quit smoking and they would&#xD;
      still be eligible to receive attendance reward compensation totaling up to $30 for showing up&#xD;
      to their six testing appointments. The purpose of the study is to test whether resisting the&#xD;
      temptation to accept the one-time payment helps steel the resolve of the treatment subjects&#xD;
      to follow through and make sure that they earn the subsequent contingency management rewards.&#xD;
      More specifically, an intent-to-treat design will allow us to test whether the temptation&#xD;
      causes treatment group subjects to have greater success than the un-tempted control group&#xD;
      subjects to abstain from smoking during the two-week practice quit period.&#xD;
