  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent for a series of&#xD;
      atypical respiratory diseases in Wuhan, China in December of 2019(.1) The disease termed&#xD;
      COVID-19, was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,&#xD;
      2020. SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by an&#xD;
      extracellular membrane containing a series of spike glycoproteins resembling a crown.COVID-19&#xD;
      infection results in diverse symptoms and morbidity depending on individual genetics,&#xD;
      ethnicity, age, and geographic location. In severe cases, COVID-19 pathophysiology includes&#xD;
      destruction of lung epithelial cells, thrombosis, hypercoagulation, and vascular leak leading&#xD;
      to sepsis.(2) COVID-19 risk factors include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and&#xD;
      diabetes.(2)&#xD;

      Notably, in several studies, diabetes is one of the most reported comorbidities with poor&#xD;
      prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19 due to Compromised innate immunity,&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system antagonists. (3) On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia&#xD;
      in people with diabetes mellitus by direct Î²-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin&#xD;
      resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids,&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir).(4) Nearly half of critically ill patients would develop AKI at some&#xD;
      point during their ICU admission.(5) Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported to be the&#xD;
      second observed complication in deceased patients after ARDS.it is reported that patients who&#xD;
      died with covid19 had different degrees of AKI .The pathogenesis of kidney injury in patients&#xD;
      infected with covid19 is multifactorial: (1) prerenal azotemia, ATN can occur owing to many&#xD;
      contributing factors including volume depletion, cytokine storm, hypoxia, shock, or&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis (2) proximal tubular injury, (3) glomerulopathy, (4) thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathy, and (5)complications from the treatment of COVID_19. (6)&#xD;
