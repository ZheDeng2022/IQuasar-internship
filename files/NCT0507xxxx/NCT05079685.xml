  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, single-center, prospective case-control study, in which each patient is his&#xD;
      own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It focuses on the study of tubal patency and establishing the agreement of results between&#xD;
      HyFoSy and HSG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational, single-center, case-control study in which tubal pathology is studied in the&#xD;
      context of a Basic Sterility Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the concordance of this new diagnostic&#xD;
      test (HyFoSy) with HSG, which is the common technique to visualize tubal patency. Once&#xD;
      demonstrated concordance, we also want to carry out a cost-effectiveness study and&#xD;
      demonstrate through different scales the greater ease of the test, less time to perform and&#xD;
      less pain for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a study in which the patients are women between 18-39 years old, undergoing study for&#xD;
      primary sterility, with a BMI &lt;30, AMH&gt; 0.6 (good ovarian reserve).&#xD;
