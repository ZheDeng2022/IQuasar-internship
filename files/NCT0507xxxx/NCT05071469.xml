  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of previous studies investigated the effects of kinesiotaping (KT) in subacromial&#xD;
      impingement syndrome (SIS). In recent studies, KT has been used for SIS to obtain an early&#xD;
      effect on decreasing pain and improved functioning. The efficacy of KT and physical therapy&#xD;
      modalities have been compared in patients with SIS and recommended KT as a treatment&#xD;
      alternative, especially when an immediate effect was desired. In similarly there are some&#xD;
      studies demonstrating that Mulligan Mobilization Technique (MMT) is effective in various&#xD;
      shoulder pathologies included SIS. According to our knowledge, there was no study in the&#xD;
      literature that compares the short-term effects of these two techniques on SIS. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of the present study is to investigate and compare the short-term effects of MMT and&#xD;
      KT on shoulder pain, limitation, disability and life satisfaction in patients with SIS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is characterized by shoulder pain that is exacerbated&#xD;
      with especially arm elevation or overhead physical activities. Epidemiological studies have&#xD;
      shown that the rate of shoulder problems in the general population ranges from 6% to 14%. SIS&#xD;
      constitutes 44-65% of all shoulder complaints. The etiology of SIS has number of factors. Two&#xD;
      primary contributing factors are narrowing of the subacromial space and enlargement of the&#xD;
      subacromial soft tissues such as bursae or tendons. SIS is defined as the mechanical pressure&#xD;
      of the rotator cuff, especially the supraspinatus tendon or the subacromial bursa in the&#xD;
      subacromial space between the humeral head and the acromion or coracohumeral ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment can be classified into conservative and surgical methods. The conservative&#xD;
      treatment options for SIS include rest, ice, physiotherapy, ultrasonic therapies,&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, oral medications, subacromial&#xD;
      injections, shock wave treatment, acupuncture. The surgical approach that objectives at&#xD;
      decompression of the subacromial space are mostly done arthroscopically. A combination of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rehabilitation is the most proven treatment&#xD;
      modality. Rehabilitation protocols for SIS are including stretching, strengthening exercises,&#xD;
      and sometimes manual therapy for soft tissues surrounding the shoulder complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mulligan Mobilization Technique (MMT) is a type of joint mobilization developed by Brain&#xD;
      Mulligan who is a physiotherapist from New Zealand, and the main purpose of this treatment is&#xD;
      to correct joint biomechanics. The basis of Mulligan's theory is the positional error that&#xD;
      develops secondary, causing incorrect displacement of the joint. The positional error can&#xD;
      occur as a result of deterioration of the surface of the joints, thinning of the cartilage,&#xD;
      and incompatibility in the ligaments and capsules. This technique was found by regulating the&#xD;
      Kaltenborn principles from the physiological joint motion component. The MMT is a treatment&#xD;
      method based on precise principles such as passive slipping that does not cause pain or&#xD;
      symptoms and providing normal movement and function restoration of joints and surrounding&#xD;
      soft tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesiotaping method (KT), developed by Dr. Kenso Kase who is a chiropractor, has been widely&#xD;
      used also for various musculoskeletal disorders including shoulder problems. Kinesiotape is&#xD;
      an elastic adhesive band that has the stretching ability to provide mobility of the performed&#xD;
      area of the body. KT has several effects such as reduce pain, muscle spasms, support weakened&#xD;
      muscles, improve soft tissues, ensure correct alignment, and enhance local blood circulation.&#xD;
      The KT applying method includes some properties such as percent of tension, applied tissue,&#xD;
      and applied directly. The effects of KT have also changed to depends on applying method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of previous studies investigated the effects of KT in SIS. In recent studies, KT has&#xD;
      been used for SIS to obtain early effect on decreasing pain and improved functioning. The&#xD;
      efficacy of KT and physical therapy modalities have been compared in patients with SIS and&#xD;
      recommended KT as a treatment alternative, especially when an immediate effect was desired.&#xD;
      In similarly there are some studies demonstrating that MMT is effective in various shoulder&#xD;
      pathologies included SIS. According to our knowledge, there was no study in the literature&#xD;
      that compares the short-term effects of these two techniques on SIS. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to investigate and compare the short-term effects of MMT and KT on&#xD;
      shoulder pain, limitation, disability and life satisfaction in patients with SIS.&#xD;

    <description>The first strip was a Y-strip for inhibition of the supraspinatus and was applied from its insertion to origo with paper-off tension. This strip was applied with the patient in a position of combining contra-lateral cervical side bending and the arm reaching behind the back.

It was applied from the coracoid process around the posterior deltoid with approximately 50% to 75% tension and downward pressure applied for a mechanical correction.</description>

    <description>The physiotherapist glided the humeral head in a postero-lateral-inferior direction with thenar eminence. The patient performed the offending movement while the glide was sustained. This movement should now become pain-free. Passive overpressure could be given by the patient at the end of the newly available range using his/her other hand. The hand of the physiotherapist should also move along with the movement in order to sustain the glide along the treatment plane. When the patient moved his/her shoulder, rotation of the scapula allowed upward. MT was applied 10 repetitions for each session, 30 sec rest period between sets, 4 sessions with 24 hours between 2 treatment seasons.</description>

    <description>Patients were instructed to keep the tape on for 72 hours and then to remove it and to come back to the clinic for second intervention. KT repeated every four days, twice times in two weeks. Two strips were used for KT procedure. The first strip was a Y-strip for inhibition of the supraspinatus and was applied from its insertion to origo with paper-off tension. This strip was applied with the patient in a position of combining contra-lateral cervical side bending and the arm reaching behind the back. The second strip was an I-strip with Y shape at the end of tape. It was applied from the coracoid process around the posterior deltoid with approximately 50% to 75% tension and downward pressure applied for a mechanical correction. For this technique, the shoulder was externally rotated while at the side and then moved into flexion and slight horizontal adduction as the end of the tape was applied with no stretch.</description>
