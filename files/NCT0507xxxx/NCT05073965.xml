      This study aims to evaluate the vitamin D supplementation effect to improve clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in children with pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. This randomized, double-blind control&#xD;
      trial with a cohort design was conducted in West Borneo from December 2020 - July 2021. A&#xD;
      Total 84 patients met the inclusion criteria; aged 6 to 18 years old, newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis with vitamin D insufficiency. Only 80 patients completed the six&#xD;
      months follow-up. The intervention was 1,000 IU vitamin D or placebo for six months&#xD;
      treatment. Comparison of clinical conditions and nutritional status are analyzed&#xD;
      statistically.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind control trial with a cohort design was conducted in Bethesda&#xD;
      Hospital West Borneo from December 2020 - May 2021. The inclusion criteria were children&#xD;
      between 6 to 18 years old, newly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis with vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficiency. Diagnosis of the tuberculosis case was based on The Indonesian Pediatric&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Scoring System. It consists of history taking and laboratory findings that&#xD;
      support tuberculosis common symptoms such as household contact, prolonged fever more than two&#xD;
      weeks, non-remitting cough more than three weeks, and decrease body weight, and lymph node&#xD;
      enlargement; laboratory findings include Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and chest X-ray (CXR).&#xD;
      Scoring ranges from 0 to 3 for each variable with a total score of more than six is&#xD;
      considered as tuberculosis diagnosis. Patients also collect the sputum for gram staining and&#xD;
      Xpert MTB/RIF examination. The isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not done in this&#xD;
      study because of limited resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection was determined based on consecutive sampling, namely the order of patients&#xD;
      who came to the clinic until the minimum sample size (84 subjects) met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The investigators excluded children with a history of liver or kidney&#xD;
      abnormalities, immunocompromised, and already received vitamin D supplementation. After&#xD;
      obtaining written consent, all subjects had their blood specimens drawn 3cc from the brachial&#xD;
      vein to measure alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum active&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D using the ELISA method. Vitamin D is categorized as deficiency if serum&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D is below 20ng/mL, insufficiency between 20-30ng/mL, and normal levels&#xD;
      above 30ng/mL. In this study, the 95% confidence level (Zα = 1.65 one-sided test) and 80%&#xD;
      power test (Zß = 0.84) were selected. The calculation of the sample size above obtained n =&#xD;
      35 people for each group. The total study subjects were added by 20% of the minimum number of&#xD;
      samples to compensate for loss-to-follow-up, so the total sample was 84, consisting of 42&#xD;
      patients in the intervention group and 42 patients in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, the following data were entered into the study database demographic data (&#xD;
      name, age, sex), signs and symptoms (fever, cough), Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), Chest X-Ray,&#xD;
      and also GeneXpert for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from gastric lavage or sputum induction,&#xD;
      liver function test and 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. All results were recorded in a study&#xD;
      database following international standards to protect the privacy and personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a 1000IU vitamin D supplement dose or a&#xD;
      placebo with an allocation ratio of one to one. Before starting recruitment, the project&#xD;
      manager prepared 84 packs of study preparation - 42 packs of the active study drug and 42&#xD;
      packs of a placebo, then generated a randomization sequence using a computer program&#xD;
      assigning the terms active or placebo to numbers 1 to 84. The packs were then assigned a&#xD;
      randomized number according to this computer-generated randomization sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At recruitment, study staff enrolled patients consecutively according to the order of arrival&#xD;
      of patients from number 1 to 84. Study staff who assigned patients to active drugs or placebo&#xD;
      did not know the following assignment in the sequence because they did not have access to the&#xD;
      study code. Treatment allocations were hidden from patients and research staff. Those who&#xD;
      analyzed the data were not covered for group assignments. Monitoring of subjects medication&#xD;
      adherence and daily symptoms conducted by using a checklist table filled out by the patient's&#xD;
      parents and confirmed check by the researcher during the patient follow-up schedule to the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects received antimicrobial treatment for tuberculosis drugs in the form of a&#xD;
      fixed-dose combination. Patients were reviewed monthly after starting antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment; body weight and height were measured at each time point. After the intensive phase&#xD;
      of antimicrobial treatment, patients were monitored monthly. A repeated vitamin D level by&#xD;
      ELISA and liver function test were done six months after starting the antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
