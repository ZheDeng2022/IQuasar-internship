  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a term specific to the geriatric period. It is used to describe weak, unstable,&#xD;
      frail patients and partially expresses the frailty of the elderly patient. Once the frailty&#xD;
      process begins, the risk of loss of mobility, dependency and mortality increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty is an important predictor of adverse outcomes after surgery. According to studies&#xD;
      conducted in various surgical situations, fragility is a major risk factor for morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and longer hospital stay. According to the available data, frailty has a sufficient&#xD;
      basis for determining the risks of patients before surgery, developing preventive methods and&#xD;
      making personal treatment decisions. As the frailty index increased, it was observed that the&#xD;
      duration of postoperative hospital stay was associated with the need for intensive care,&#xD;
      postoperative complications, and the rate of re-admissions within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification is widely used in order to&#xD;
      evaluate the physical condition preoperatively in geriatric individuals with multiple&#xD;
      comorbidities. Considering the fragility variable while creating the ASA score in the&#xD;
      preoperative period may be useful in determining the follow-up strategy during the operation&#xD;
      and postoperative period. For example, a patient who is evaluated as ASA 2 because he has no&#xD;
      problems other than simple 1-2 comorbid conditions, involuntary weakening of 5% in the last 1&#xD;
      year (not easily noticed), weakness (can only be detected with a dynamometer) and cessation&#xD;
      of going out of the house (can only be understood when asked privately). ) can be categorized&#xD;
      as at risk at ASA level 3-4, as it is understood to be fragile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to examine the frequency of frailty in elderly individuals who&#xD;
      will be operated on, and to examine the relationship between frailty and ASA score using the&#xD;
      anthropometry and comorbidity differences between frail preoperative patients and those who&#xD;
      do not.&#xD;
