    <textblock>
      Current exploratory single site open label unblinded trial, will assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      active tDCS in the home setting under caregiver and remote investigator supervision and&#xD;
      direction. The study population will consist of 10 children between ages 8 - 17 years and 365&#xD;
      days with a history of a brain bleed or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 3.6 per 1,000 births in the United States are affected by stroke or brain bleeds&#xD;
      which can lead to Cerebral Palsy (CP), a developmental disorder associated with motor&#xD;
      impairment. While, the majority of rehabilitation approaches focus on behavioral repetition&#xD;
      to improve gait and upper extremity function, these therapies can require extensive practice&#xD;
      times and extent of recovery is variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), specifically transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS), provides an approach for modulation of neuroplasticity that is safe, inexpensive, and&#xD;
      portable. Furthermore, rehabilitation approaches combined with tDCS have shown promise to&#xD;
      improve motor function recovery and quality of life after stroke in adults. Integrating the&#xD;
      application of NIBS may allow for enhanced rehabilitation during the enhanced neuroplastic&#xD;
      period of childhood and NIBS has demonstrated promising outcomes in increasing the rate and&#xD;
      extent of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gillick laboratory has shown that in children with CP the use of tDCS is safe, feasible,&#xD;
      and successful at modifying motor performance when in combination with other physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions. tDCS is not currently available to subjects without taking part in the study.&#xD;
      In this study, investigators plan to administer tDCS in the remote setting during a&#xD;
      synchronous zoom call with trained laboratory members. To ensure the device's is safely used&#xD;
      in the home setting only during designated times, a pre-set code will be required to&#xD;
      administer stimulation via the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention has the potential to improve motor rehabilitation outcomes and can offer&#xD;
      telehealth access, which may reduce treatment cost and improve access to limited access to&#xD;
      clinic or hospital facilities. Ultimately, this will contribute to a wider reach in improving&#xD;
      quality of life across the lifespan in children with CP.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Post stimulation on day 3, 4 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>In the adverse events safety survey, participants will be asked to report the severity of events they may experience. Since investigators are working with the pediatric population, the investigator makes the final decision on the likelihood of an event being related to the tDCS intervention versus the participant's environment. All adverse events, falling in 3-5 category (1-unrelated, 2- unlikely, 3- possible, 4- probable, 5- definite) will be considered related to the study. This determination is made with the parent/caregiver as witnesses and confirmed by the parent/caregiver.&#xD;
The number of participants who report an adverse event will be reported for each day of stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Change in time to complete montage setup</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre stimulation on day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate speed of device setup, time to complete montage set up will be measured.&#xD;
On the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) survey, participants will be instructed to click a &quot;now&quot; button that records the time to seconds at the beginning and end of montage set up. The lower time corresponds to ease in montage set up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in contact quality(CQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post stimulation on day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>SMARTscan™ contact quality is reported by the device throughout the stimulation and reflects quality of the stimulation delivery. Lower contact quality indicates the stimulation isn't being properly delivered. Changes in stimulation quality over the three active sessions using a Friedman test (non-parametric test for repeated measures) will be determined. Tests with a p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 20 minutes of 1.5 mA (Milliampere) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) via Soterix 1x1 tDCS mini-CT Stimulator device in the home setting under caregiver and remote investigator supervision and direction for three consecutive days. If at any time the child perceives discomfort while dosing to 1.5mA the investigators will adapt and modify the stimulation using a new pre-set activation code.</description>
