  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will examine the effects of opioid free anesthesia in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic gastrectomy. The investigator expect that opioid free anesthesia will reduce&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And investigator will analyze the association between postoperative pain and patient's&#xD;
      underlying psychological characteristics and pain sensitivity. The investigator anticipate&#xD;
      that psychological characteristics and pain sensitivity may be realted to postoperative pain&#xD;
      and opioid consumption.&#xD;

    <description>Dexmedetomidine and lidocaine are administered during anesthesia, and opioid is not used. For induction, 1 μg/kg of Dexmedetomidine is administered over 10 minutes and 1mg/kg of lidocaine is administered intavenously (bolus). This is followed by continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/h and infusion of lidocaine at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h.</description>
