      Study type : A 30 months, multicentre, open-label strategic randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population : Chron's Disease (CD) patients with an i2 endoscopic postoperative recurrence in&#xD;
      the year following ileocolonic resection (6-12months after ileocolonic resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification at inclusion according to prophylactic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status quo arm: if the patient received no prophylactic therapy, no treatment will be&#xD;
           started; if the patient received a prophylactic therapy, the same will be continued at&#xD;
           the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapy escalation arm: infliximab-CT-P13 will be started with two intravenous infusions&#xD;
           of 5 mg per kg bodyweight at week 0 and week 2 and subcutaneous injections of 120 mg&#xD;
           every 2 weeks from week 6 onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective : To evaluate the proportion of CD patients without endoscopic postoperative&#xD;
      recurrence (i0-i1) at 12 months in the arm receiving therapy escalation compared to status&#xD;
      quo arm in patients having an i2 endoscopic postoperative recurrence 6-12months after&#xD;
      ileocolonic anastomosis with restoration of faecal stream.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  OR increased fecal calprotectin compared to inclusion, at least + 250 μg/g&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical recurrence within 12 months: need for a new ileocolonic resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic dilatation within 12 months: need for a balloon insufflation at the&#xD;
           ileocolonic anastomosis during an ileocolonoscopy when a non-passable stenosis was&#xD;
           present in patient having obstructive symptoms (CDOS &gt; 4) before endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to clinical postoperative recurrence&#xD;
