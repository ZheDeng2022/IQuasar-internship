      The current study is part of a larger project called the CalGo-project. The overall purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to use bone meal from salmon to promote skeletal health. Specifically, the&#xD;
      potential for hydrolyzed collagen type II derived from salmon bone meal in ameliorating pain,&#xD;
      stiffness and function in participants diagnosed with osteoarthritis will be evaluated over a&#xD;
      time period of 6 months. Past literature indicates that collagen derivatives may be a&#xD;
      potential supportive strategy in people suffering from osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a&#xD;
      common but complex joint disease with significant unmet medical needs, as there are currently&#xD;
      no disease-modifying drugs available. Osteoarthritis represents a global health burden and&#xD;
      the only curative treatment when pain becomes unmanageable, is joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dimensions of pain, stiffness, and function will be evaluated using the Western Ontario&#xD;
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC 3.1). Plain x-rays with&#xD;
      Kellgren-Lawrence grading will be employed to classify the severity of osteoarthritis. 100&#xD;
      potential participants will be screened for eligibility. Participants who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized in a double-blind manner to receive 10 capsules daily&#xD;
      of hydrolyzed collagen type II (a total of 5000 mg), 10 capsules daily of salmon bone meal,&#xD;
      or 10 capsules daily of placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean change from from Baseline on the WOMAC pain subscale at Month 3 and Month 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months, and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is evaluated using the pain dimension of WOMAC 3.1, a disease-specific questionnaire. The pain subscale includes 5 items that assesses pain intensity. A score is produced when the value of each item is summarized. A higher score indicates worse pain.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on an 11-point likert Global Assessment Scale at Month 3 and Month 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months, and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A GAS scale gives an overall picture of an individuals' self-assessed effect of treatment. The individual is asked to compare the present health status with their health status at a previous point in time. The magnitude of this difference is scored numerically. In this study, we will use GAS on a 11-point Likert rating scale ranging from &quot;completely recovered&quot; to &quot;worse than ever&quot;, with 0 being &quot;unchanged&quot; status.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in pain intensity on a Numerical Rating Scale at Month 3 and Month 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months, and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, we will employ an 11-point (i.e., 0 to 10) Numerical Rating Scale as was recommended for use in chronic pain trials according to 2005 IMMPACT guidelines. 0 represents &quot;No pain&quot;, and 10 represents &quot;The most intense pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in number of rescue medications self-administered during the study period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medications that participants may use on an as needed basis include Paracetamol, typical NSAIDs, and analgesics containing opioids.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in self-assessed quality of life on the EQ-5D-3L instrument at Month 3 and Month 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months, and 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument used to measure generic quality of life based on five distinct dimensions. EQ-5D-3L contains two parts. The first part contains five questions that the individual must answer and includes mobility (walking), self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. For each item, there are three possible answers. Results are reported as a five-digit number ranging from 11111 (best health status) to 33333 (worst health status).</description>
