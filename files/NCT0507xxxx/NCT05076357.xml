    <textblock>
      This study is an 8 week weight loss intervention with 3 randomly assigned groups: DIET, cold&#xD;
      exposure (CE), and DIET+CE. The study will be a total of 13 weeks. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo a screening session, two experimental sessions at baseline and two experimental&#xD;
      sessions after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a control (ambient) experimental session and a cold exposure experimental&#xD;
      session These will be done in a randomized order both before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      Therefore, a total of 5 lab visits will be required for all participants regardless of group&#xD;
      outside of their assigned group intervention. Participants in the CE and DIET+CE groups will&#xD;
      report to the laboratory every 2nd day for the 8 week intervention to undergo cold exposure&#xD;
      as outlined below. The DIET and DIET+CE groups will have a weekly nutritional consultation at&#xD;
      the lab as well as a weekly check-in with the nutritionist via text, phone, or email.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned a group after completing the screening session and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an 8 week weight loss intervention with 3 randomly assigned groups: DIET, cold&#xD;
      exposure (CE), and DIET+CE. The study will be a total of 13 weeks. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo a screening session outlined below. There will be 4 experimental sessions, 2 before&#xD;
      and 2 after the intervention. There will be one week between each session. The timeline will&#xD;
      be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental session 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental session 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental session 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental session 4. There will be a control (ambient) experimental session and a&#xD;
           cold exposure experimental session (outlined below). These will be done in a randomized&#xD;
           order both before and after the intervention. Therefore, a total of 5 lab visits will be&#xD;
           required for all participants regardless of group outside of their assigned group&#xD;
           intervention. Participants in the CE and DIET+CE groups will report to the laboratory&#xD;
           every 2nd day for the 8 week intervention to undergo cold exposure as outlined below.&#xD;
           The DIET and DIET+CE groups will have a weekly nutritional consultation at the lab as&#xD;
           well as a weekly check-in with the nutritionist via text, phone, or email. Participants&#xD;
           will be randomly assigned a group after completing the screening session and prior to&#xD;
           the experimental session. Participants cannot be assigned prior to consenting, as this&#xD;
           will bias the randomization process and make it irrelevant. They will have all 3 groups&#xD;
           explained to them prior to consenting but will not be assigned until after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING Informed consent will be collected and verification of inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to rate the food items the most consume from different&#xD;
      categories: high fat sweet, low fat sweet, high fat savory, low fat savory. The results will&#xD;
      be used for the Leeds Food preference Questionnaire (LFPQ) that will be applied in the&#xD;
      experimental sessions. Measures of height and weight will be collected. Afterwards,&#xD;
      participants will be given an accelerometer (Actical-Mini Mitter Co. Inc.) to measure their&#xD;
      activity levels for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS 7h15 - Anthropometrics and DEXA. Participants will be asked to arrive&#xD;
      after a 12h overnight fast and having refrained from vigorous activities for 48h. Body weight&#xD;
      and height (HR-100 Height Rod and BWB-800AS Digital Scale, Tanita Corporation of America,&#xD;
      Inc. Arlington Heights, Illinois, USA) will be measured. A Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA) (Lunar Prodigy, GE Medical Systems).scan will be used to measure bone density, fat&#xD;
      mass and lean body mass. Participants will have to lie on an examination table, fully&#xD;
      clothed, while a low intensity x-ray will scan the entire body. The measurements take 15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7h30 - Insertion of catheter. A qualified nurse will place an intravenous catheter into the&#xD;
      ante-cubital vein distal to the elbow to take blood draws at various points outlined below. A&#xD;
      total of X collections will be done, with each collections being 10 mL for a total of 80 mL.&#xD;
      The first will be taken immediately after insertion. This will be followed by a short rest&#xD;
      period. Blood samples will be kept for 10 years after publication, and then will be destroyed&#xD;
      through the university biohazard waste disposal process. Blood draws will occur at the&#xD;
      following additional time points: 9h, 9h40, 10h20, 11h, 11h40, 12h20, 1h..&#xD;
&#xD;
      8h00 - Resting energy expenditure. Participants will be asked to undergo a shortened version&#xD;
      of the resting energy expenditure measurement outlined above, lasting approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8h30 - Appetite measurement. Participants will be asked to fill out visual analog scales&#xD;
      (VAS) at this point and various other points during the session. Briefly, desire to eat,&#xD;
      hunger, fullness and prospective food consumption will be rated. Questions will be asked as&#xD;
      follows: 1) &quot;How strong is your desire to eat?&quot; (Very weak- Very strong); 2) &quot;How hungry do&#xD;
      you feel?&quot; (Not hungry at all- As hungry as I have ever felt); 3) &quot;How full do you feel?&quot;&#xD;
      (Not full at all- Very full), and 4) &quot;How much food do you think you could eat?&quot; (Nothing at&#xD;
      all- A large amount). VAS will be completed at the following additional time points: 9h,&#xD;
      9h40, 10h20, 11h, 11h40, 12h20, 1h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8h35 -Participants will be served a standard breakfast including two pieces of toasts, jam,&#xD;
      peanut butter, orange juice . They will be served the same breakfast for each session. They&#xD;
      must consume the entirety of its contents within 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9h00 - Baseline measurements. Participants will be fitted with 4 surface electrodes (Delsys,&#xD;
      Boston, MA, 02215, USA) on their sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, pectoralis major, and rectus&#xD;
      abdominis to measure muscular activity during shivering. They will do 3 maximal contractions&#xD;
      of 5 seconds for each muscle to create a baseline measurement for comparison. They will then&#xD;
      be fitted with 12 thermocouples (Concept Engineering, Old Saybrook, CT) at the following&#xD;
      sites: forehead, upper back, lower back, abdominal area, quadriceps, hamstrings, front calf,&#xD;
      back calf, chest, biceps, forearm, and hand. These thermocouples measure skin temperature and&#xD;
      get an overall mean skin temperature (Tskin). They will then be fitted with a 3 piece liquid&#xD;
      conditioned suit (LCS: Three Piece, Allen Vangard, Ottawa, ON, Canada) that can be infused&#xD;
      with either cold or ambient temperature water to manipulate skin temperature. Tskin will be&#xD;
      measured at rest while participants lay down on a bed to determine ambient Tskin. During this&#xD;
      time the plexiglass hood will be placed over their head to measure energy expenditure. During&#xD;
      this measurement, participants will lie still on their back with a plexiglass hood over their&#xD;
      head in a quiet room using a flow controller and gas analyzer (FlowKit-500, FMS, Sable System&#xD;
      International, Las Vegas, NV, USA). The expired air will be sampled to determine oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and resting energy expenditure will be derived. This test requires that&#xD;
      participants lie quietly and relaxed for approximately 60 minutes. They will also be asked to&#xD;
      rate both thermal comfort and thermal sensation on scales of - to +5 during the exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10h00 - Exposure. Participants will then undergo either CE or AC. For CE, the suit will be&#xD;
      perfused with cold water (at 10°C) for 2h. For AC, the suit will be perfused with&#xD;
      thermoneutral (33°C) water to maintain Tskin. During this, Tskin will be continually&#xD;
      monitored, thermal comfort (i.e. how comfortable or uncomfortable you feel) and thermal&#xD;
      sensation (i.e. how warm or cold you feel) will be measured every 5 minutes. We have&#xD;
      previously shown that lean individuals in the suit with water at 5°C have no change in core&#xD;
      temperature (i.e. compensable CE), meaning although participants were cold and uncomfortable,&#xD;
      they were at no risk for freezing or non-freezing cold injuries. These general occur at a&#xD;
      Tskin below 15°C, whereas a study we conducted using 5°C water in the suit achieved a lowest&#xD;
      skin temperature of 24°C. The cold stimuli being used will make participants mildly&#xD;
      uncomfortable but pose minimal risk of adverse events, although extreme evens that occur&#xD;
      below the 15°C Tskin were listed for transparency. Participants are free to end the session&#xD;
      if necessary, and there are blankets and hot shower facilities should they be needed. Once&#xD;
      the exposure is completed, the suit, electrodes and thermocouples will all be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13h00 - Olfaction and food reward. Participants will be required to complete 3 different odor&#xD;
      tests using Sniffin' Sticks (Burghart Instruments, Wedel, Germany). This will test for odor&#xD;
      identification, detection threshold, and discrimination. It has been shown that these tests&#xD;
      are correlated with changes in food intake during weight loss, showing changes in the&#xD;
      desirability of food. For the food reward task, participants will do the Leeds Food&#xD;
      Preference Questionnaire. This is a computerized task that uses 16 foods in 4 different&#xD;
      categories: high-fat sweet, low-fat sweet, high-fat non-sweet, low-fat non-sweet. Explicit&#xD;
      values will be determined using a visual analog scale of 0-100, while implicit values will be&#xD;
      determined by having the participant choose a preferred of 2 options on repeat, until all 16&#xD;
      foods have been matched with each other food. This allows for preference fat and sweet&#xD;
      content of food to be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13h30 - Ad Libitum lunch. Participants will be given a food menu, from which they can choose&#xD;
      as many foods as they would like. They will all be served in ad libitum quantities, where&#xD;
      they can consume as much or as little of each food as they would like in the given time&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14h15 - Olfaction and food reward. The tasks listed above will be administered again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14h45 - Conclusion. At the end of the trial participants will be asked to select foods to&#xD;
      consume for the following two days from the validated food menu. They will be packed into&#xD;
      labeled lunch boxes (coolers) and provided in ad libitum quantities, meaning they can consume&#xD;
      as much or as little of each food as they would like, leaving any extra food, scraps, and&#xD;
      wrappers in the cooler. Ad libitum food will be provided at the conclusion of each of the 4&#xD;
      experimental sessions. Food is not provided during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIET Intervention A 30% dietary restriction will be determined using the participant's&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure (REE), accelerometer data (PA) and a coefficient of 1.10 for the&#xD;
      thermic effect of feeding to calculate the energy required to maintain current body weight.&#xD;
      This will be multiplied by a coefficient of 0.70. The formula will be: ((REE+PA)*1.10)*0.70.&#xD;
      The diet will be prescribed by a nutritionist using the Canadian Food Exchange System. This&#xD;
      will allow participants to select foods they enjoy during the weight loss, however in smaller&#xD;
      quantities. Exchange lists are groups of foods that contain a similar mix of carbohydrates,&#xD;
      protein, fat, and calories. The Canadian exchange system there are seven exchange groups:&#xD;
      Grains &amp; Starches; Fruits; Milk &amp; Alternatives; Vegetables; Meat &amp; Alternatives; Fats;&#xD;
      Unlimited consumption. Within any group, you can exchange one food serving for another. The&#xD;
      number of portions from each group will be recommended based on the macronutrient composition&#xD;
      evaluated in the preliminary session. This session will also be used to clarify any potential&#xD;
      questions regarding the project and the intervention. There will also be weekly sessions with&#xD;
      the nutritionist of roughly 30 minutes at the lab, as well as mid-week check-in via text,&#xD;
      email, or phone call to ensure compliance and provide support with the nutritionist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLD EXPOSURE Intervention Participants will come to the laboratory every second day during&#xD;
      the 8 week intervention for a 90 minute session in the liquid conditioned suit, where the&#xD;
      suit will be perfused with 10°C water. Again, this will be a compensable cold stimulus&#xD;
      meaning there are no changes to core temperature. Participants will be free to move and talk&#xD;
      during the intervention as EE is not being measured, although they will be either sitting or&#xD;
      lying down during each session. They will be allowed to bring their own entertainment and&#xD;
      Netflix will be provided. At the conclusion of the study there will be a consultation session&#xD;
      with the nutritionist to explain the Canadian Food Exchange System, as well as answer dietary&#xD;
      questions to provide balance with the DIET groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIET+CE Intervention Participants will undergo both the dietary restriction of the diet group&#xD;
      and the cold intervention of the CE group, described above.&#xD;
