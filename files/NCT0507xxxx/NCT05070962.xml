    <textblock>
      A better understanding of the Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder would allow a management&#xD;
      as close as possible to the specificities of this one, but also a better training of&#xD;
      professionals and adapted therapeutic indications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder manifests itself in a multitude of symptoms and&#xD;
      self-regulation difficulties in various domains (somatization and biological balance,&#xD;
      attention and consciousness, regulation of affects and impulses, interpersonal relationships&#xD;
      and relational capacities, perception of the aggressor and of the aggression, self-perception&#xD;
      and identity, sense and belief system) as well as profound changes in personality and various&#xD;
      comorbidities .In addition, dissociation, the origin and the resulting disorders also have&#xD;
      some similarities to Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Indeed, dissociation is thought&#xD;
      to have a traumatic origin and the symptomatology (eg hyperesthesia, dissociative amnesia,&#xD;
      anesthesia) is included in Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. We can then ask ourselves&#xD;
      the following questions: is Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder a dissociative disorder in&#xD;
      its own right causing difficulties with self-regulation? What is the share of dissociation in&#xD;
      Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?&#xD;
