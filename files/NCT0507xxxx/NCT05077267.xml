    <textblock>
      An open label phase 2 trial to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      ABNCoV2 vaccine after IM application. The trial will evaluate a homologous prime-boost&#xD;
      regimen with 100 µg ABNCoV2 in initially seronegative adult subjects (Group 1), as determined&#xD;
      by a qualitative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared to a single boost vaccination with&#xD;
      100 µg ABNCoV2 in initially seropositive subjects (Group 2), as defined by a positive&#xD;
      qualitative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or&#xD;
      previous COVID-19 disease at least 3 months prior to enrolment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a run in phase 6 adults (comprising of 3 subjects in each Group 1 and 2) will be&#xD;
      vaccinated at 1 clinical trial site in a consecutive manner, with an at least 48 hours&#xD;
      interval between the first and second subject of each group, then the second and third&#xD;
      subject dosed on consecutive days, before opening up to full enrollment in Group 1 and 2.&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be based on solicited and unsolicited AE data (first week after first&#xD;
      vaccination) evaluated by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). After a positive&#xD;
      DMC recommendation, enrollment to the rest of Group 1 and 2 of the trial will commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 trial will evaluate a homologous prime-boost regimen with 100 µg ABNCoV2 in&#xD;
      initially seronegative adult subjects (Group 1), as determined by a qualitative test for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared to a single boost vaccination with 100 µg ABNCoV2 in&#xD;
      initially seropositive subjects, as defined by a positive qualitative test for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antibodies and either a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or previous COVID-19 disease (Group&#xD;
      2) at least 3 months prior to enrollment&#xD;

        Seropositive (Group 2): Previous COVID-19 disease or previously completed vaccination&#xD;
        regimen with an authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at least 3 months before SCR, and a positive&#xD;
        qualitative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at SCR. &quot;Authorized&quot; SARS-CoV2 vaccine refers to&#xD;
        authorization status at SCR, i.e., subjects can be eligible if the subject previously&#xD;
        received investigational vaccines that have since been authorized for emergency use or&#xD;
        granted full market licensure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General good health, without acute medical illness, physical exam findings, or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormalities, as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
