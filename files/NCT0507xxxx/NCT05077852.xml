      In this study, investigators aim to determine the true positivity of bladder cancer&#xD;
      identified in the bladder base, trigone or neck on ultrasonography (USG) in patients&#xD;
      presenting with hematuria or lower urinary tract symptoms, by confirming with the gold&#xD;
      standard cystoscopy and biopsy results. It also aims to explore criteria that would allow to&#xD;
      differentiate between intravesical prostate protrusion (IPP) due to benign prostatic&#xD;
      hyperplasia (BPH) and bladder cancer indicated at the bladder floor, trigone and neck by&#xD;
      evaluating false positive results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common symptom in bladder cancer is hematuria, although the rate of bladder cancer&#xD;
      is 18.9% in patients presenting with gross hematuria and 4.8% in patients presenting with&#xD;
      microscopic hematuria. For this reason, unnecessary and invasive procedures are applied to&#xD;
      most of the patients investigated. USG is considered the first-line imaging technique in the&#xD;
      evaluation of upper and lower urinary tract disease. It is a non-invasive technique that does&#xD;
      not involve ionizing radiation, and can be used in the evaluation of kidney, prostate and&#xD;
      bladder anatomy. In addition, USG is used to evaluate malignant tumors of the urinary system&#xD;
      or benign causes such as BPH, urinary tract stones that may cause hematuria. Cystoscopy is&#xD;
      the gold standard test for diagnosing bladder cancer, but cystoscopy causes discomfort and&#xD;
      can carry risks such as infection and bleeding. Suspicious findings as a result of USG&#xD;
      imaging may lead to more invasive tests such as cystoscopy. An example of this is performing&#xD;
      a biopsy under general anesthesia to confirm a positive or negative finding. The annual costs&#xD;
      of these examinations, which emerge as further examinations as a result of incorrect&#xD;
      evaluations, are important. In England, patients with hematuria and normal investigation cost&#xD;
      the National Health Service Â£33.5 million in one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPP, or median lobe, is a phenomenon in which the prostate adenoma expands into the bladder&#xD;
      along the plane of lowest resistance. IPP originating from the base of the prostate may&#xD;
      enlarge and protrude into the bladder and form a regional lesion on the neck, trigone and&#xD;
      posterior wall of the bladder. IPP cannot be detected adequately by conventional digital&#xD;
      rectal examination (DRE), nor can it be diagnosed with sufficient accuracy by examinations&#xD;
      such as noninvasive USG. In the literature, some studies evaluated the diagnosis of IPP by&#xD;
      USG, and the full spectrum of IPP was not defined due to the scarcity of clinical series. IPP&#xD;
      is seen as protruding structures within the bladder in the coronal plane of USG and can be&#xD;
      easily misdiagnosed as a bladder-derived lesion. Thus, IPP, which is a manifestation of BPH,&#xD;
      located at the base of the prostate and extending into the bladder, can easily be&#xD;
      misdiagnosed as bladder cancer.&#xD;
