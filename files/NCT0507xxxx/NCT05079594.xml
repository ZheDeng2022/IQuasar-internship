    <textblock>
      The heel blood procedure for newborn screening is done for almost all babies within the first&#xD;
      48 hours of birth. It is stated that non-pharmacological methods in reducing pain during the&#xD;
      heel blood collection process are simple, effective, free, and very cost-effective. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that auditory interventions (such as mother's voice, white noise) used in invasive&#xD;
      procedures distract the infant and create a cognitive strategy for pain control. According to&#xD;
      this information, one aim of the study is to determine the effect of the mother's voice and&#xD;
      white noise, which are non-pharmacological methods, on the comfort level of the baby in the&#xD;
      heel blood procedure. It is thought that especially acute painful procedures applied to&#xD;
      infants will reduce the level of stress and anxiety in parents. Another aim of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the effect of a mother's voice and white noise, which are non-pharmacological&#xD;
      methods, on the state anxiety levels of mothers in the heel blood collection process.&#xD;

      The heel blood procedure for newborn screening is done for almost all babies within the first&#xD;
      48 hours of birth. The heel blood procedure, which is widely used for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      follow-up of various diseases, causes acute pain in infants. It is stated that&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods in reducing pain during the heel blood collection process are&#xD;
      simple, effective, free, and very cost-effective. For example, non-pharmacological methods&#xD;
      such as breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, oral sucrose, mother's voice, and white noise&#xD;
      are stated to be effective in reducing acute pain. Clinical practice guidelines recommend the&#xD;
      use of non-pharmacological methods in acute painful procedures. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      auditory interventions (such as mother's voice, white noise) used in invasive procedures&#xD;
      distract the infant and create a cognitive strategy for pain control. According to this&#xD;
      information, one aim of the study is to determine the effect of the mother's voice and white&#xD;
      noise, which are non-pharmacological methods, on the comfort level of the baby in the heel&#xD;
      blood procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have targeted parents of newborn infants, although studies to date have shown&#xD;
      that parents want to be more involved in their infants' pain management. Parents reported&#xD;
      that they wanted to learn more about pain management strategies, they wanted to play a role&#xD;
      in the relaxation of their babies, and they hoped for more opportunities to participate in&#xD;
      the care of their babies in the hospital. It is thought that especially acute painful&#xD;
      procedures applied to infants will reduce the level of stress and anxiety in parents. In&#xD;
      addition, one study reported that when parents are given information to help reduce their&#xD;
      baby's pain, they accept painful procedures such as heel prick more easily and feel calmer.&#xD;
      In the light of this information, another aim of this study is to determine the effect of a&#xD;
      mother's voice and white noise, which are non-pharmacological methods, on the state anxiety&#xD;
      levels of mothers in the heel blood collection process.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Neonatal Comfort Behavior Scale consists of 7 items: muscle tone, alertness, facial tension, calmness/agitation, body movements, respiratory response, and crying. Since &quot;respiratory response&quot; was scored in infants connected to mechanical ventilator and &quot;crying&quot; was scored in spontaneously breathing infants, the total score was calculated over 6 items. The lowest score that can be obtained from the Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale is 6, and the highest score is 30.On this scale, if the total score of the scale is between 6-13, the baby is comfortable. If the total score is between 14-30, the baby has pain or distress and needs interventions to relieve him.</description>

In the evaluation, 0-19 points are interpreted as &quot;no anxiety&quot;, 20-39 points as &quot;mild anxiety&quot;, 40-59 points as &quot;moderate anxiety&quot;, 60-79 points as &quot;severe anxiety&quot; and 80 points as &quot;panic value&quot;.</description>

    <description>Before the application, the families will be informed by the researcher and the 'Informed Consent Form' will be signed. After the heel blood procedure, when the baby starts to cry, comfort will be provided with gentle touches. For ethical reasons, routine care will be provided when the baby cries.</description>

    <description>Since white noise is a humming and continuous monotonous sound, it is similar to the sound in the womb. It will be explained that this sound is very similar to the sound that the baby hears in the mother's womb by making the white noise recordings listen to the mothers who will have their babies listen to white noise. by Orhan Osman; Dr. From the album 'Kolik', which was created by making use of the album 'The Happiest Baby' prepared by Harvey Karp, which consists only of uterus sounds; The song 'Don't Let Your Baby Cry, PT.2' will be played to babies. In addition, infants will be excluded from the study even though they meet the criteria, if they are not sedated, the procedure takes more than 2 minutes, the procedure is disrupted because someone enters the room loudly, or the mother changes the baby's position.</description>

Hearing is one of the first senses a fetus develops and is 24-33. can recognize and remember the mother's voice after weeks. The fetus memorizes the musical characteristics of the mother's voice, like tone, by listening to it. It is stated that newborns exposed to their own mother's voice have a lower heart rate, higher sucking rate, a more relaxed appearance, and less crying and body movements.</description>

    <description>Five minutes before the procedure, the mother's voice recording will be played to the baby and the speaker will be placed 30 cm away from the baby. The baby's comfort level will be evaluated by the researcher using the &quot;Neonatal Comfort Behavior Scale&quot; 2 minutes before the procedure begins. Physiological values of the baby will be noted by the researcher 1 minute before the procedure.As soon as the heel blood procedure is completed, the baby's physiological values and comfort level will be noted by the &quot;Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale&quot; by the researcher. After the procedure, the recording will continue to be played until the baby's mother's voice returns to the basal values. Physiological values and comfort levels of the baby will be noted by the researcher 1 minute and 2 minute after the procedure. 2 minutes after the procedure, the baby's comfort level will be evaluated by the researcher using the &quot;Neonatal Comfort Behavior Scale&quot;.</description>

Intervention in this group will be made at the elevation. White noise will be played five minutes before the procedure.The baby's comfort level and physiological values will be evaluated by the researcher using the &quot;Neonatal Comfort Behavior Scale&quot; 2 minutes before the procedure begins.&#xD;
Order of Operation As soon as the heel blood procedure is completed, the baby's physiological values and comfort level will be noted by the &quot;Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale&quot; by the researcher.&#xD;
Post-Processing After the procedure, white noise will continue to be listened to until the baby's physiological values return to basal values. Physiological values and baby's comfort level of the baby will be noted by the researcher 1 minute and 2 minute after the heel blood collection is completed.</description>
