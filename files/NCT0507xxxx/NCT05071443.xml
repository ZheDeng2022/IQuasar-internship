    <textblock>
      Intro: Necrotizing and soft tissue infections (NSTI) are life-threatening bacterial&#xD;
      infections characterized by subcutaneous tissue, fascia or muscle necrosis. The hospital&#xD;
      mortality of NSTI is high, comprised between 20 and 30%. NSTIs represent the 4th cause of&#xD;
      septic shock. Early management of NSTIs requires a coordinated and multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach, including broad-spectrum antibiotic administration, management of organ failures&#xD;
      and aggressive surgical debridement with excision of all necrotic and infected tissues. NSTIs&#xD;
      involve the lower limbs in about 70% of cases and lead in 15% of cases to limb amputation.&#xD;
      During the early post-operative phase, daily wound care is required using conventional&#xD;
      dressings. As soon as the infectious process is controlled, typically within 7 to 10 days of&#xD;
      the initial debridement, the main goal of wound dressing is to allow for a granulation tissue&#xD;
      to develop so that to perform a skin grafting. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), which&#xD;
      consists in applying a negative pressure on the wound surface, may be used to this effect. A&#xD;
      dedicated dressing is connected to a device that generates a negative pressure and collects&#xD;
      exudates. NPWT may have a positive effect on wound healing by removing exudate, increasing&#xD;
      regional perfusion and patient comfort and reducing infections. Beneficial effects of NPWT&#xD;
      have been suggested by case series. However, no randomized controlled trial are currently&#xD;
      available to adequately assess its efficiency and the 2014 guidelines of the Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on NSTI did not provide recommendations regarding NPWT use&#xD;
      for managing NSTI wounds. The study's hypothesis is that in patients managed for NSTIs, NPWT:&#xD;
      1) may accelerate skin grafting and complete wound healing; and 2) improve functional&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Hypothesis/Objective: To demonstrate in patients who underwent a surgical debridement of the&#xD;
      lower limb for NSTI a superiority of a wound dressing strategy using NPWT (intervention) as&#xD;
      compared with conventional wound dressing on local healing (complete) and the recovery of&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Open-label randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment of the primary end&#xD;
      point. Randomization in two arms: experimental group (NPWT) versus control group&#xD;
      (conventional dressing) until skin grafting (decided by the attending surgeon).&#xD;

    <masking_description>This committee comprises experts (a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, and a nurse specialized in wound care) tasked with validating in a consistent manner, blinded to the randomization arm, the aspect of the primary endpoint relating to cutaneous healing, based on standard photographs taken on a weekly basis by the clinical research nurse. Photographs will be made available to members of the adjudication committee through an online platform (Dispose AP-HP) or a digital support.</masking_description>

    <description>The therapeutic intervention being tested is the use of a negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) device. Several medical devices are currently being used and are based on the same principle. They involve applying negative pressure, generally between -100 and -150 mmHg, to a wound using a dressing (mostly a polyurethane foam dressing with hydrophobic pores), which hermetically covers the wound's surface and is connected to a container for collecting the fluids drained off. These devices are widely available and used to treat post-operative wounds.&#xD;
Duration of treatment: the use of NPWT will be maintained until the recovery of the skin has been achieved by the skin graft. An average duration of 3 weeks' treatment is expected in the intervention group.</description>

    <description>Conventional dressings will be performed from randomization to skin grafting and applied every day based on the methods normally used in the participating centres, and also until the recovery of the skin has been achieved by the skin graft.&#xD;
This generally involves local care provided on a daily basis, ensuring gentle mechanical and chemical debridement by covering the wound with alginate type or other dressings, according to the condition of the wound. The methods used to apply these conventional dressings will be recorded.</description>
