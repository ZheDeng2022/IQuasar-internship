      This study will be conducted as a single-blind randomized placebo-controlled experimental&#xD;
      study to determine the effect of therapeutic touch sleep quality and fatigue in women in the&#xD;
      menopausal period. The research is planned to be carried out between 15 November 2021 and 15&#xD;
      March 2022 in the Bornova gynecology oncology polyclinic of the İzmir Health Sciences&#xD;
      University Tepecik Training and Research Hospital affiliated to the Ministry of Health. The&#xD;
      population of the research consists of women application in the Gynecology Oncology&#xD;
      Polyclinic of the İzmir Health Sciences University Tepecik Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      affiliated to the Ministry of Health. The number of samples was calculated in G*power 3.1.9.6&#xD;
      program. Accordingly, 21 women were calculated for each group, with effect size (d=1.37), 5%&#xD;
      margin of error (α=0.05), and 99 % power (1-β=0.99). However, considering the possible&#xD;
      losses, the number of samples was increased by 15 % and the study was planned to be conducted&#xD;
      with 48 women, 24 in the intervention group and 24 in the placebo group. Data will be&#xD;
      collected through the Personal Information Form, the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS) and the&#xD;
      Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data analysis will be performed using the IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics 24.0 program. Statistical significance will be taken 0.05. Therapeutic touch is&#xD;
      thought to be one of the applications that can be used in improving women's health, as it is&#xD;
      a non-drug application that is easy to apply, has no side effects and can be applied&#xD;
      independently by midwives/nurses.&#xD;

    <description>We will use Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index was developed in 1989 by Buysse et al. (1989). Reliability and validity studies were conducted by Agargun and colleagues in Turkey, and Cronbach's alpha was 0.80. The scale comprised 18 items and 7 component scores. Every component was evaluated from 0 to 3. The total of these component points yielded the total score of the scale,which ranged from 0 to 21. A high score (5 or above) indicated poor sleep quality. Sleep quality was classified as good (0-4) and poor (5-21).</description>

    <description>We will use Piper Fatigue Severity Scale. This scale that was developed by Piper et al. (1998) consisted of 27items, and it evaluated fatigue of the patient with four subdimensions. Answers for every item were evaluated from 0 -10. The total fatigue score was calculated by adding points of 27 items and dividing the total score to the item number. A high score indicated a high perceived fatigue level. Reliability and validity studies for Turkish society was conducted by Can, and Cronbach's alpha was determined as 0.94</description>
