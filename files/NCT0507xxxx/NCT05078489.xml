  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the immediate effects of action observation therapy on the cervical&#xD;
      muscles' strength, pain intensity, tactile acuity and pain pressure threshold in individuals&#xD;
      with chronic nonspecific neck pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial with two arms: action observation group vs&#xD;
      control group. The action observation group will be asked to watch videos of neck exercises&#xD;
      with full attention and concentration and not perform any motion or execute any movement&#xD;
      during the observation time. The control group will be asked to watch videos of a landscape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and at post-intervention for muscle strength, pain&#xD;
      intensity, pressure pain threshold and tactile acuity.&#xD;
