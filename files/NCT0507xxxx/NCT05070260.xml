    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind, multicenter, multinational, placebo controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      single dose, adaptive phase II/III study (respectively Part 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of glenzocimab (1000 mg IV over 6&#xD;
      hrs including initial bolus of 15 minutes) on top of the best standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, thrombolysis (IVT with tPA: alteplase) should have been initiated prior to&#xD;
      randomization, within 4.5 hrs post onset of acute ischemic stroke symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized and the infusion of glenzocimab or of its matching&#xD;
      placebo should be administered (infusion initiation) ideally during the tPA infusion but no&#xD;
      later than one hour following the end of tPA administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 between groups (glenzocimab or placebo). A minimization&#xD;
      program will account for the following factors: type of SOC, (IVT alone vs. IVT + MT),&#xD;
      Baseline Severity (NIHSS &lt;10 vs. ≥ 10), age group (&lt;65, 65-79, ≥80 years) in order to balance&#xD;
      each group composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of each patient in any given center to an active treatment or placebo will&#xD;
      strictly follow a central randomization scheme. Clinical supplies allocation to centers&#xD;
      should provide the necessary material so that any eligible patient can receive the assigned&#xD;
      treatment. An IRT will be used to manage randomization and drug shipment. The whole process&#xD;
      will be handled in a manner that it is blinded for the treatment received to all involved&#xD;
      study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be composed of at least two clinicians&#xD;
      with expertise in the relevant clinical field (a neurologist and a neuroradiologists), and a&#xD;
      clinical pharmacologist. They will be supported by a dedicated independent statistician. The&#xD;
      statistician will be available to analyze the data for the IDMC (either blinded or&#xD;
      unblinded). All cases of intracranial hemorrhage (symptomatic or not) will be thoroughly&#xD;
      reviewed, including the radiological images and the pharmacovigilance data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDMC members will process the information and will issue their recommendations as per the&#xD;
      IDMC Charter. Specific Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) per each analysis (2 interim and one&#xD;
      final) will be made available to the IDMC for each of the 2 interim and final analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five IDMC meetings are pre-scheduled: 3 of them for a safety evaluation exclusively (after&#xD;
      100, 600 and 800 patients recruited) and 2 of them for efficacy and safety evaluation (after&#xD;
      200 and 400 patients recruited). In case of an urgent safety concern, ad-hoc meetings will be&#xD;
      triggered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding events are an integral part of these analyses, and a focus on&#xD;
      symptomatic/non-symptomatic intra-cranial bleeds is repeatedly considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competent Authorities / Agencies should be notified at the end of the Part 1 and regulatory&#xD;
      meetings, such as End-of-Phase II meetings should take place thereafter. Advice from these&#xD;
      agencies may be likely to alter Part 2 plans as presented here.&#xD;
