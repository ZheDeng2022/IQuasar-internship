    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;Much Improved&quot; to &quot;Much Worse&quot; and it is used for the assessment of the level of improvement to the subjects forehead contouring</description>
