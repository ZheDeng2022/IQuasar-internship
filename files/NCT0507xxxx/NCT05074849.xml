    <textblock>
      Novel approaches to promote adherence to diabetic footwear and prevent high incidence of&#xD;
      diabetes foot ulcers are urgently needed. Investigators propose to translate an innovative&#xD;
      and practical technology to supplement clinical and risk evaluation for patients with&#xD;
      diabetes through wearable insoles and smart watch, along with foot self-care education, to&#xD;
      improve adherence to prescribed footwear and reduce incidence of foot ulcers in those with&#xD;
      diabetes and at risk for foot ulcers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled diabetes is the cause of diabetes related limb amputations. Diabetes related&#xD;
      amputations are huge problems, expensive to manage and affects quality of life. Diabetes foot&#xD;
      ulcers (DFU) are foot related injuries to the foot that are direct result of neuropathy and&#xD;
      peripheral artery diseases and have been identified as major risk factors for amputations. To&#xD;
      prevent DFU, diabetic foot wears are recommended, however adherence is poor. Patients are not&#xD;
      routinely adherent to the recommended diabetic footwear. In addition, current diabetic&#xD;
      footwear is not effective in preventing most initial and recurrent DFUs. Although the causal&#xD;
      mechanisms for DFU are multi-factorial, evidence exists that elevated plantar pressure&#xD;
      contributes to the development of DFU, which is currently managed by devices ineffective in&#xD;
      reducing pressure in certain areas of the foot. Foot care education by clinicians regarding&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed footwear is not effective in reducing the initial and recurrent DFUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study by Najafi and colleagues demonstrated efficacy and feasibility of smart&#xD;
      insoles with real-time alerts for plantar pressure offloading, which causes more than 50% of&#xD;
      pressure ulcers in at-risk individuals with diabetes. The device was designed to cue&#xD;
      offloading to manage unprotected sustained plantar pressures to prevent foot ulceration.&#xD;
      Interestingly, their study suggested that, in the group with at least 1 alert every 2 hours,&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed footwear was increased or retained over time; whereas a lower number&#xD;
      of alerts reduced adherence. Authors speculated that reduced adherence in the low-alert group&#xD;
      may be linked to disengagement or reduced perception of benefit. It is unknown whether smart&#xD;
      insoles with alerts will improve the use of footwear and lower the incidence of DFU, compared&#xD;
      to usual care and the role of self-efficacy in mediating among performance, desired behavior&#xD;
      and desired outcomes (increase adherence to diabetic foot wear and decrease incidence of foot&#xD;
      ulcer) among participants in the proposed study. To fill the gaps, investigators aim to&#xD;
      examine whether an integration of a diabetes foot self-care education and smart insoles with&#xD;
      alerts may sustain adherence, irrespective of number of daily alerts, to prescribed footwear,&#xD;
      compared to usual care in those at risk for DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study (R21) phase, investigators are proposing a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of insoles with real- time alert and foot self-care education in&#xD;
      improving adherence to prescribed footwear in diabetes patients at risk for DFU. In Aim 1,&#xD;
      investigators will examine whether smart insoles with real-time alert component plus foot&#xD;
      self-care education compared to smart insole with alerts alone and usual care will improve&#xD;
      adherence to prescribed footwear in at high-risk individuals for DFU (history of neuropathy&#xD;
      and peripheral artery disease [PAD]). In the Aim 2, investigators will examine trends across&#xD;
      groups in the incidence of initial and recurrent DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to generate data for an R01 submission to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      combined smart insoles with real-time alert plus foot self-care education in preventing the&#xD;
      incidence of initial and recurrent DFU in those at-risk individuals with diabetes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months, 4 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Daily adherence will be track by Sensor Data and Self-Report Questionnaire. The real-time alert component of the smart insoles will be measured by the tagging of patients' diabetes shoes by Orthimeter (Germany). The system has 1-year battery life and enables continuous measuring adherence to footwear by measuring temperature. Participants will be required to record number of days adhered to footwear or alerts.</description>
