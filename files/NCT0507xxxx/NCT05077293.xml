    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study using a cross-over design to implement and compare a best&#xD;
      practice alert (BPA) with an automated in-basket message to inform providers when a patient&#xD;
      with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is not on appropriate medical&#xD;
      therapy. The data from this pilot study will lead to a randomized controlled trial to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the BPA versus an automated in-basket message, versus usual care (no&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 68,000 deaths per year nationwide can be attributed to gaps in care for patients&#xD;
      with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with the majority being due to lack&#xD;
      of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Despite proven benefits in randomized&#xD;
      trials, class I guideline recommendations, and published clinical performance measures,&#xD;
      patients with HFrEF are often not on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). While&#xD;
      successful interventions for improvement in prescription of GDMT have often included&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approaches with dedicated staff, the relatively high cost of hiring&#xD;
      additional personnel has led to an interest in electronic health record (EHR)-based&#xD;
      interventions. Prior studies on EHR-based interventions in this arena have mainly been&#xD;
      conducted in the inpatient setting, which is limited to one encounter during acute&#xD;
      hospitalization, a setting often complicated by renal dysfunction or hypotension that can&#xD;
      limit prescription of MRA. The development and study of outpatient EHR-based alerts for HFrEF&#xD;
      GDMT are needed. Two types of outpatient EHR-based interventions include best practice alerts&#xD;
      (BPA) and automated in-basket messages. Both of these methods have limited data, with some&#xD;
      studies showing benefit and others demonstrating provider fatigue and burnout. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no study that has directly compared these different types of EHR-based&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study using cross-over design at two outpatient clinics in a large&#xD;
      health system to implement and compare a best practice alert (BPA) and an automated in-basket&#xD;
      message to inform providers when a patient with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction&#xD;
      (HFrEF) is not on appropriate medical therapy. The data from this study will lead to a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of the BPA versus an automated&#xD;
      in-basket message, versus usual care (no intervention).&#xD;

    <description>Providers will receive a BPA at the time of visit for patients with HFrEF who are not on MRA (and who do not have contraindication to MRA). This alert will be visible on the first screen displayed in the electronic health record and will display the patient's current HFrEF therapies, EF, blood pressure, potassium, and glomerular filtration rate. The alert will give access to an outpatient heart failure order set, and also provide links to the most recent guidelines.</description>

    <description>Providers will receive a biweekly in-basket messages linking to a list of patients who have been seen in the past year with HFrEF who are not on MRA (and who do not have contraindication to MRA). This list will display each patient's current hFrEF therapies, EF, blood pressure, potassium, glomerular filtration rate, and date of last visit. From the list, providers can access the patient's chart, order medications, and document communication with the patient.</description>
