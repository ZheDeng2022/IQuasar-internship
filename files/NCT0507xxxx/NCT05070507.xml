      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of an enzyme containing lozenge on dental&#xD;
      plaque accumulation in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical effects of a lozenge containing enzymes&#xD;
      on dental plaque accumulation and oral microbiome composition after professional dental&#xD;
      cleaning, as compared to a placebo lozenge without enzymes. Furthermore, safety of the enzyme&#xD;
      lozenge will be assessed by clinical evaluation of the oral hard and soft tissues. The null&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the treatment with enzyme-containing lozenges do not affect plaque&#xD;
      accumulation, as compared to a placebo control.&#xD;
