  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide there is an increase in antibiotic resistance which may have fatal long-term&#xD;
      consequences. This is due to extensive use and sometimes misuse of antibiotics in the&#xD;
      treatment of harmless infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate if treatment with dicloxacillin can lead to&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions through induction of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In&#xD;
      this study it will also be investigated whether dicloxacillin induces its own metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is based on a previous in vivo study showing that rifampicin induces the&#xD;
      intestinal P-gp transporter, through activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR).&#xD;
      Dicloxacillin also activates the PXR receptor in vitro, which could result in an induction of&#xD;
      P-gp in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial subjects will ingest dicloxacillin for 30 days and at day 10 and 28 ingest dabigatran&#xD;
      etexilate to determine if the P-gp transporter has been induced. Plasma and urine will be&#xD;
      drawn over 32 hours to determine the concentration of dabigatran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in dicloxacillin concentration will also be measured at day 9 and 27 to establish if&#xD;
      dicloxacillin induces its own metabolism.&#xD;
