      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the&#xD;
      globe. A striking and consistent observation has been the difference in severity of COVID-19&#xD;
      at different ages: severity, the need for hospitalization and mortality rise steeply with&#xD;
      older age while severe disease and death are relatively rare in children and young adults.&#xD;
      Most children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, most commonly&#xD;
      fever, cough, pharyngitis, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of smell or taste.&#xD;
      Whether children are also less often infected by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing debate. Large&#xD;
      epidemiological studies suggest that children comprise only 1 to 2% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases.&#xD;
      However, these numbers heavily depend on testing criteria and, in many reports, testing was&#xD;
      done only in individuals who were symptomatic or required hospitalisation, which is less&#xD;
      often the case for children. Some studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults&#xD;
      to become infected with SARS-CoV-2.9 However, more recent studies report that children are&#xD;
      less likely to get infected after contact with a SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.10-14 It has&#xD;
      been suggested that children and adolescents have similar viral loads and may therefore be as&#xD;
      likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 as adults. In addition, the viral load may be similar in&#xD;
      asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. However, reassuringly, transmission in schools from&#xD;
      children either to other children or to adults has been rare. The observation that children&#xD;
      are less often infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that they have less severe symptoms is similar to&#xD;
      that reported for SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. However, this&#xD;
      pattern is strikingly different to that for infection with most other respiratory viruses&#xD;
      (eg, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza or influenza viruses),&#xD;
      for which the prevalence and severity are both higher in children. Dr Amr kamel khalil Ahmed&#xD;
      and Dr. Mahmoud Elkazzaz, the lead investigators of this observational study , recently&#xD;
      published a preprint that demonstrated Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had a high binding affinity&#xD;
      and greatest interactions with ACE2 active sites, as well as a moderate binding affinity and&#xD;
      moderate interactions with the active sites of IL-6. The Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) interacts&#xD;
      with different active sites of IL6 and ACE2 which are involved in direct or indirect contacts&#xD;
      with the ACE2 and IL-6 receptors which might act as potential blockers of functional ACE2 and&#xD;
      IL-6 receptor complex. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was detected in abundance in breast milk&#xD;
      and other algal sources milk supplement used for newborns and children's feeding. As a&#xD;
      result, we believe that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may protect children and newborns thorough&#xD;
      competing with COVID-19 for ACE2 receptors and inhibiting IL-6 activity and may possibly help&#xD;
      them avoid a cytokine storm and save their lives through inhibiting IL-6 and preventing&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 RBD attachment to ACE2&#xD;

      The study is configured as a retrospective and prospective observational study. The study&#xD;
      will be multi-center and will involve all Infants and Children feeding on breast milk or&#xD;
      Artificial milk formula that contained on DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human milk is the best form of infant nutrition providing significant protection against many&#xD;
      illnesses for term and preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was detected in abundance in breast milk and other algal sources&#xD;
      milk supplement used for newborns and children's feeding. DHA concentration in breast milk&#xD;
      varies more than 20-fold across human populations (0.06-1.4% by weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naturally, cow's milk does not provide a rich source of DHA however in most companies whole&#xD;
      milk and partially skimmed milk (2%) are fortified with DHA by adding DHA rich feed additive&#xD;
      to Market milk formula. Therefore, we will take a cohort of children and infants who feed on&#xD;
      natural cow's milk without any processing not breast milk or Artificial milk formula&#xD;
      contained on DHA additive as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent studies report that children are less likely to get infected after contact with a&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.10-14 It has been suggested that children and adolescents have&#xD;
      similar viral loads and may therefore be as likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 as adults.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will take a cohort of adults who did not feed on any Artificial milk formula&#xD;
      contained on DHA additive as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to investigate the possible protective role of DHA found in Breast Milk or&#xD;
      Artificial Milk Formula that are used for feeding of Children and Infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would examine the electronic patient record of Newborn from birth to about 2&#xD;

      2021 and compare their rates of Covid-19 infection, hospitalization and complications with&#xD;
      the rates of the local age-matched background population.&#xD;
