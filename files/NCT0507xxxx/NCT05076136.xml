      The SIJ has long been considered an important source of low back pain because of the&#xD;
      empirical ﬁnding that treatment targeting the SIJ can relieve pain.This study was be a&#xD;
      Randomized Clinical Trail conducted at Riphah Rehabilitation Centre Lahore. The study was be&#xD;
      completed within the time duration of Six months. Purposive sampling technique was be used.&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated by using the G power 3.1. The sample size of 64 patients was be&#xD;
      taken in this study to find the comparison of regional manual therapy and standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy intervention in females with sacroiliac joint pain. Patients was be divided&#xD;
      into two groups.. Patients was be divided into two groups. Group A was be treated with&#xD;
      regional manual therapy. In regional manual therapy patients was be given mobilization to&#xD;
      lumber region and SIJ, pelvic floor exercises and core strengthening exercises and Group B&#xD;
      was be treated with standard physiotherapy in which patients was be given SIJ mobilization&#xD;
      and Straight leg raise. Both groups was receive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator&#xD;
      and heating pad as a common treatment protocol. Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and oswestry&#xD;
      low back disability questionnaire was be used as Data collecting tools. Two session of&#xD;
      treatment per week for eight weeks was be given. Data was be analyzed on SPSS 21.&#xD;
