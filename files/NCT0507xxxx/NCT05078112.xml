  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants often have sleep challenges. Most of these challenges in otherwise healthy children&#xD;
      and due to behavioral insomnia. The goal for infants is to become independent sleepers by&#xD;
      learning the process of self-soothing. This study hopes to determine if technology based on&#xD;
      sensors is able to help teach self-soothing to infants.&#xD;
