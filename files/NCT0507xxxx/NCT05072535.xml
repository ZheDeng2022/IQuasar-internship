    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into 2 parts. The first part is a relative bioavailability study of&#xD;
      HA121-28 tablet A and HA121-28 tablet B, and the second part is a food effect study of&#xD;
      HA121-28 tablet B. Both Parts are single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover&#xD;
      study to evaluate relative bioavailability HA121-28 tablet B in healthy subjects and the&#xD;
      effect of food on pharmacokinetic profile of HA121-28 tablet B, respectively.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an IP, whether or not considered related to the IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures.</description>
