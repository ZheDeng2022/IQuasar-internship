    <description>The WI NRS is a scale that will be used by the participants to report the intensity of their worst pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. For maximum itch intensity: the scores are provided on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable'. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been on hemodialysis at least three times&#xD;
             per week for at least three months prior to the start of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hemodialysis participants meeting the Kidney Outcome Quality Initiative Guidelines of&#xD;
             hemodialysis adequacy within 45 days of screening, two single-pools of: -Kt/V at least&#xD;
             1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pruritus for &gt;= three months (documented pruritus with no etiology identified other&#xD;
             than CKD by medical record, previous physician's letter/statement, or a written&#xD;
             conversation of site investigators).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. WI NRS score &gt;= 7.0 at the screening and baseline visit. Screening WI NRS score will&#xD;
             be determined by a single WI NRS assessment (score ranging from 0 to 10) for the&#xD;
             24-hour period immediately preceding the screening visit. Baseline WI NRS score will&#xD;
             be determined based on the weekly average of daily WI NRS scores (score ranging from 0&#xD;
             to 10) during the seven days immediately preceding baseline (rounding is not&#xD;
             permitted). A minimum of four daily scores out of the seven days immediately preceding&#xD;
             baseline is required for this calculation.&#xD;

             injection, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             participant, or to use an adequate and approved method of contraception throughout the&#xD;
             study and for 12 weeks after the last study injection.&#xD;

             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of menstrual bleeding for one year prior to screening without any other&#xD;
                  medical reason, confirmed with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the&#xD;
                  postmenopausal range.&#xD;

             before the screening or baseline visit. Participants may be rescreened after the&#xD;
             infection has resolved. Resolution of COVID-19 infection can be confirmed by recovery&#xD;
             assessment methods, as described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

             baseline visit, or (2) actinic keratoses that have been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant women (positive serum pregnancy test result at any visits), breastfeeding&#xD;

             screening period that may put the participant at significant risk according to the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment, if he/she participates in the clinical study.&#xD;
