  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof of concept and feasibility study will adopt a mixed methods approach. The primary&#xD;
      objectives will be to assess participants' acceptance and usability of a package of self-help&#xD;
      videos for Plantar Fasciitis designed to be accessed shortly after suitable participants are&#xD;
      referred to the podiatry service, and also the feasibility of conducting a future randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial. The secondary objectives will be to assess the effects of the intervention&#xD;
      on pain and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proof of concept and feasibility project will investigate the use of a self-help package&#xD;
      of virtual resources for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. The research will involve a&#xD;
      small group of ten, shortly after participants are referred to Cardiff &amp; Vale UHB podiatry&#xD;
      service and join the waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virtual resources will include short videos demonstrating ways of managing symptoms, such&#xD;
      as gentle stretching exercises, and footwear recommendations. Participants will be given&#xD;
      access to these resources to watch at their convenience. Patient reported outcome measures&#xD;
      (foot pain, and quality of life) will be collated at baseline and periodically up to 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants' acceptability of these resources will be assessed through interviews at the end&#xD;
      of the six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of conducting a future randomised controlled trial will be assessed by&#xD;
      looking at recruitment rates, retention and any patient safety issues. It is hoped the long&#xD;
      term benefit will be that participants joining the waiting list can engage with these&#xD;
      resources at the earliest opportunity to help manage their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is important because it presents an opportunity to work with participants at&#xD;
      the start of joining a waiting list, and the benefits of early access to virtual resources&#xD;
      could be applicable to a number of different health problems.&#xD;
