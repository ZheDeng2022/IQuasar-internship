  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study is to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      preliminary clinical activity of ES002023 in patients with advanced solid tumors that are&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory to standard therapies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ES002023 is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically targets&#xD;
      the human ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPD1, CD39, UniprotKB: P49961).&#xD;
      ES002023 is generated using classic hybridoma technology with an attenuated effector domain&#xD;
      (Fc) based on human IgG1. ES002023 binding to CD39 inhibits the enzyme activity of&#xD;
      ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, which can result in the stabilization of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory extracellular ATP (eATP) and the restoration of antitumor immunity by&#xD;
      impairing the accumulation of immune suppressive adenosine within the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
