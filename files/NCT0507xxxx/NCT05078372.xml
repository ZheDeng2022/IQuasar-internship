      Compare of the effectiveness of the use of ropivacaine and midazolam by intraarticular vs&#xD;
      epidural administration on post-operative analgesia after isolated arthroscopic anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring autograft.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a common surgical knee procedure that&#xD;
      presents moderate to severe postoperative pain, additionally, an adequate control of the pain&#xD;
      is required to start intensive rehabilitation after the surgery, early hospital discharge and&#xD;
      reduction of the administration of oral and intravenous anesthetic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain is a common upsetting symptom following ACL reconstruction that delay&#xD;
      return to daily activity of the patient and leads to an increase in days of hospitalization&#xD;
      and early rehabilitation.(Harris et al., 2014) Therefore, pain is also mediated by free nerve&#xD;
      endings in the knee joint, which are located in the tendons of semitendinosus, gracilis and&#xD;
      sartorius muscles, associated with higher pain in comparison with ACL allograft.(Hong et al.,&#xD;
      2019) For effective, safe and longer post-ACL reconstruction analgesia, several analgesic&#xD;
      strategies such as systemic medication, central or peripheral blocks, and intra-articular&#xD;
      drug administration have been used to control the pain. (Baverel et al., 2016; Dauri et al.,&#xD;
      2003; Parker et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2016) Combined&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia is better option for knee surgery, it can reduce the disadvantages of&#xD;
      general and alone spinal or epidural anesthesia. Combined spinal anesthesia appears to be&#xD;
      effective and with lower toxicity than general anesthesia. (Baldawi et al., 2020; Johnson et&#xD;
      al., 2016; Moucha et al., 2016; Padwal et al., 2019) Moreover, reduce the hospital stay and&#xD;
      extends the analgesia into the postoperative period without increasing morbidity. (Johnson et&#xD;
      al., 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis was that there are differences in the quality and quantity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain in knee arthroscopy surgery when midazolam plus ropivacaine is&#xD;
      administered epidurally, in comparison to ropivacaine and midazolam by intraarticular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Controlled clinical trial. Study design: Experimental, longitudinal,&#xD;
      comparative, prospective and double blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate duration of the study: 12 months Population type and sample size: A total of 108&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective surgery for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction after&#xD;
      rupture Research Site: Patients will be recruited from Consultation No. 15 of the Orthopedics&#xD;
      and Traumatology Service of the University Hospital &quot;Dr. José Eleuterio González &quot;of the&#xD;
      U.A.N.L. Surgeries will be carried out in the Department of Surgical Therapeutics on the 5th&#xD;
      floor of the University Hospital of the U.A.N.L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization mode: 108 sealed envelopes are prepared prior to the start of the study, which&#xD;
      will include the group to which the patient will belong. The patient will not know the group&#xD;
      to which he will belong until the moment of revealing the final results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Methodology: Each patient who is admitted to the elective surgery of ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction will be invited to participate voluntarily in the study. The principal&#xD;
      investigator or one of the co-investigators will be responsible for thoroughly explaining the&#xD;
      details of the study, including the potential benefits and risks, as well as answering any&#xD;
      questions that may arise, if the patient agrees to participate, the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      sign the informed consent in the presence of two witnesses and a note will be made in the&#xD;
      clinical file where the inclusion in the study will be recorded, in the same way a copy of&#xD;
      the consent will be given to the patient. For the purpose of the study, the identification of&#xD;
      the patient will not be necessary only his gender, age, height and weight. The study&#xD;
      population will be divided into 2 groups: 1. Ropivacaine plus midazolam by intra-articular&#xD;
      application and Group 2: Ropivacaine plus midazolam epidural administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeries of all the groups will be performed with the same surgical technique, using a&#xD;
      total primary ACL reconstruction with TighRope ® Endobutton system. The patients will be&#xD;
      operated by 2 subspecialists in hip joint surgery, professors of the Orthopedics and&#xD;
      Traumatology Service of the University Hospital &quot;Dr. José Eleuterio González &quot;as the main&#xD;
      surgeon and as surgical assistants to the resident doctors of Orthopedics and Traumatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia protocol There were used combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The patient was&#xD;
      placed in lateral decubitus position. Under aseptic technique, the intervertebral space&#xD;
      between L2-L3 or L3-L4 was superficially infiltrated with 2% lidocaine. The lumbar spinal&#xD;
      level was identified with an 18-gauge Tuohy needle included in the spinal-epidural combined&#xD;
      kit (Espocan®, B Braun, Germany). After that, a Whitacre 25 spinal needle was placed and the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist confirmed the correct position by the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid. 7.5&#xD;
      mg (1.5 ml) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine were administered. Thereafter an epidural catheter&#xD;
      was introduced, about 4 cm into the epidural space through the Tuohy needle for maintenance&#xD;
      anesthesia and 60 mg (3 ml) of lidocaine with 2% epinephrine were administered to ensure the&#xD;
      correct position outside a blood vessel. In case of prolongation of the surgical time, the&#xD;
      anesthetic effect was extended through the epidural catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the surgical procedure was completed and depending on the group to which the patient&#xD;
      belongs, postoperative analgesia was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Ropivacaine with intra-articular midazolam. Ropivacaine 0.75% at 1.5 mg / kg&#xD;
      (Ropiconest®, PiSA, Mexico) was used with midazolam at 50 mcg / kg kg (Ralecum®, PiSA,&#xD;
      Mexico), to complete 20 ml of solution and was administrated on the knee articulation after&#xD;
      tourniquet release. And an elastomeric pump (Home Pump® of 5 ml / hr for 24 hours) was&#xD;
      prepared for epidural infusion, with 150 ml of physiological solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Ropivacaine plus epidural midazolam. An elastomeric pump (Home Pump® of 5 ml / hr&#xD;
      for 24 hours) was prepared for epidural infusion. This was prepared with 150 mg (20 ml) of&#xD;
      0.75% ropivacaine plus midazolam at 50 mcg / kg / 12 hrs. The solution was made up to 125 ml&#xD;
      with physiological solution. Moreover, 20 ml of physiological solution, was intraarticular&#xD;
      administered as placebo in the Ropivacaine plus epidural midazolam group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique All patients underwent an arthroscopic ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral&#xD;
      hamstring autograft. There were used tourniquet in all the procedures, with the patient in&#xD;
      supine position, with lateral positioner to perform valgus on the knee. Lateral and medial&#xD;
      standard portals were used. A diagnostic arthroscopy was realized in all cases to check the&#xD;
      menisci and the knee cartilage. After that the semitendinosus and gracilis tendon were&#xD;
      harvested by a 2 cm anteromedial incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repairable tears of meniscus were treated with all-inside an outside-in sutures technique.&#xD;
      Irreparable meniscal tears were managed with partial meniscectomy and were stabilized with&#xD;
      shaving and radio frequency cauterization of the meniscus remnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealed envelope will be opened on the preoperative day to identify which experimental&#xD;
      group the patient belongs In the first group will receive an elastomeric pump was prepared&#xD;
      for epidural infusion, with 150 ml of physiological solution and ropivacaine 0.75% at 1.5 mg&#xD;
      / kg was used with midazolam at 50 mcg / kg kg to complete 20 ml of solution and was&#xD;
      administrated on the knee articulation after tourniquet release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group An elastomeric pump was prepared for epidural infusion. This was prepared&#xD;
      with 150 mg (20 ml) of 0.75% ropivacaine plus midazolam at 50 mcg / kg / 12 hrs. The solution&#xD;
      was made up to 125 ml with physiological solution. Moreover, 20 ml of physiological solution,&#xD;
      was intraarticular administered as placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the pre and post-operative administration of the drugs will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one author knew about the drugs that were administrated. The drugs were prepared in&#xD;
      unlabeled syringes as the same volume and were recorded separately by a co-investigator who&#xD;
      was not involved in the analysis of the study. Also, this physician, were involved in the&#xD;
      surgery and performed anesthetic care. A blinded investigator, who was not involved in the&#xD;
      anesthetic care of the patients, collected all study data. Surgeon, anesthesiologist and&#xD;
      rehabilitator were blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrahospital follow-up Each patient was given a logbook and asked to self-evaluate and&#xD;
      record pain (according to the 10-point VAS) before and 15 min after an analgesic&#xD;
      administration. In case of pain with a VAS greater than 4, , 1g of acetaminophen and 30 mg IV&#xD;
      of ketorolac were administrated. For higher than 7 points 50 mg IV of Tramadol was indicated,&#xD;
      in any of the 2 groups, which could be repeated every 6 hours if required. In the case of the&#xD;
      need for rescue analgesia, tramadol 50 mg IV, 30 mg IV of ketorolac and 1 g of acetaminophen&#xD;
      were administered, the time in postoperative hours in which the first dose was administered&#xD;
      and the total number of doses administered in 24 hours was documented, as well as the&#xD;
      performance of equianalgesic conversion of opioids for the necessary dose used for rescue&#xD;
      analgesia, taking into account that 200 mg IV / day of tramadol is equal to 20 mg IV / day of&#xD;
      morphine, considered as the main reference for opioid analgesics. Tramadol 400 mg / day&#xD;
      should not have been exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who presented nausea received ondansetron 4 mg perioperative. Supplemental doses&#xD;
      of ondansetron 1 mg were administered at the first indication of moderate to severe nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's discharge It will be discharged by medical indication to the patient 48 hours after&#xD;
      surgery, if there is no type of contraindication, with indications of discharge in medical&#xD;
      prescription and follow-up by the external consultation after one week.&#xD;
