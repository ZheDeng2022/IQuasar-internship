    <description>The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory questionnaire is measured on two subscales for a series of phrases that describe a children's behavior. The first subscale is for indicating the frequency of the behavior using a scale of 1= never to 7 = Always; the second subscale indicates yes = 1 or no = 0 for whether the behavior is currently a problem for them. Reponses are total with a higher score indicating greater severity of child's behavior.</description>

    <description>A smartwatch device that measures subjects level of activity, heartrate, respirations and quality of your sleep at night. Artificial intelligence will be applied to analyze all the data over the course of 12 weeks to monitor and attempt to predict the onset of tantrums or disruptive behavior. Subjects are required to wear the watch at least 70% of the day and night each day for 70% of days during 12 weeks of treatment.</description>
