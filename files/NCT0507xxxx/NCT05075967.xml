  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPTN 096 is a community-randomized, controlled, hybrid-type III implementation effectiveness&#xD;
      study. It is designed to evaluate an integrated strategy approach to increase the uptake and&#xD;
      use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and viral suppression rates among Black MSM in the&#xD;
      southern United States. A status-neutral approach will be taken such that Black MSM,&#xD;
      regardless of HIV status (both those living with and without HIV), will be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>16 communities will participate in the study, each made up of one or more counties selected from the southern counties and states identified in the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan. The communities will be matched into 8 pairs based on population, HIV prevalence and viral suppression. Within each pair, one community will be randomized by public ceremony to receive the components of the integrated strategy, and the other will serve as the standard-of-care (SOC).&#xD;
A starfish sampling approach (the combination of venue-time-based and respondent-driven sampling) will be employed to recruit and enroll individual participants in both intervention and control communities for the cross-sectional assessments.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Black MSM living in intervention communities will have access to the HPTN 096 integrated strategy in addition to standard HIV prevention and care services available in their communities.&#xD;
The integrated strategy includes a combination of four community-, organizational-, and interpersonal-level components designed to impact individual-level outcomes.</description>

    <description>This community-level structural component will use a standardized, nationally replicable community coalition model (Black Treatment Advocates Networks [BTAN]) to implement an enhanced program model geared to 1) facilitate the effects of the other HPTN 096 interventions by minimizing barriers to HIV testing, PrEP use and viral suppression through sensitizing a local network of service providers (e.g., social, legal, economic sectors) to the needs of Black MSM and maintaining an online platform for exchanging information about the local network that can be used to link Black MSM to resources and services, and 2) amplify the effects of other HPTN 096 components by increasing Black MSM's receptivity to those activities through the integration and promotion of HPTN 096 into the activities of the community coalition model.</description>

    <description>In this community-level component, social media influencers (SMI) will be defined for the purposes of this study as users on social media who have established credibility, trust and access to a large audience of Black MSM, and who can persuade them by virtue of their authenticity and reach. SMI will provide tailored messaging for Black MSM in intervention communities on the topics of:&#xD;
HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing promotion&#xD;
PrEP (and general HIV prevention) awareness and promotion&#xD;
Definition and benefits of viral suppression.&#xD;
Messages may include direction towards health care facilities (HCFs) involved in the intersectional stigma reduction component and information about the virtual peer support platform or BTAN+ events.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intersectional Stigma Reduction</intervention_name>
    <description>This organizational-level component will take place in HCFs and is designed to improve cultural responsiveness in the provision of HIV prevention and health care services to Black MSM. It is expected to contribute to a reduction in HIV incidence by creating an affirming and autonomy-supportive healthcare environment that supports Black MSM engagement in HIV-related care and services and that promotes increased HIV/STI testing, PrEP uptake and viral suppression rates.</description>

    <description>Peer support workers will be trained and compensated to provide emotional and practical support services. These peer support workers will have shared lived experiences with those whom they are supporting, be self-reflective of those experiences, and know when to share those experiences with others in an appropriate and supportive manner. Once trained, the peer-support workers will have demonstrated competencies in the following domains:&#xD;
HIV, PrEP, nPEP, other HIV prevention options and ART education&#xD;
Adherence to PrEP, ART and medical care&#xD;
HIV/STI testing&#xD;
New HIV diagnosis&#xD;
Addressing intersectional stigma (anti-Black racism, sexual stigmas, HIV-related stigma)&#xD;
Self-care&#xD;
Information about national and local resources and assistance programs, Black MSM-centered health services, and the cost and insurance coverage of medications and medical care&#xD;
Multicultural competency (as it relates to the HIV epidemic for Black MSM in the southern US)</description>
