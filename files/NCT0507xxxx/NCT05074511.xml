  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global health problem. It changes the measurement of the human body and makes a&#xD;
      big change to move the body. The increased weight and mass change the way the limbs and whole&#xD;
      body generate and react to force Excess fat also interferes with joint-muscle interactions&#xD;
      that are important for functional capacity and postural balance The tendency to increase the&#xD;
      thickness of the abdomen contributes to anterior movement of the COM of the body. The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to investigate the biomechanical effect of weight on foot stability in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
