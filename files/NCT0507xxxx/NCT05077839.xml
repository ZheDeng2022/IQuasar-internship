  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-group, parallel, randomized, standard-control phase II study comparing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil combined with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab&#xD;
      versus XELOX plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. This&#xD;
      study was conducted in the Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, Tianjin Medical&#xD;
      University Cancer Institute and Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced colorectal cancer will be randomly assigned (1:1) to&#xD;
      trifluridine/tipiracil combined with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab (experimental group) or&#xD;
      XELOX plus bevacizumab (control group) after signing informed consent. In this study, 184&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled, 92 patients will receive trifluridine/tipiracil combined with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and bevacizumab and 92 patients will receive standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental group, the treatment regimen is trifluridine/tipiracil 35mg/m2 orally&#xD;
      taken on d1-5 and d8-12, oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 and bevacizumab 5mg/kg intravenously infused on&#xD;
      d1 and d15 every 4 weeks, up to 6 cycles. Then patients will be given trifluridine/tipiracil&#xD;
      and bevacizumab maintenance treatment. Patients enrolled in this group could acquire&#xD;
      trifluridine/tipiracil free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group was XELOX plus bevacizumab regimen, bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg, d1 oxaliplatin&#xD;
      130mg/m2, d1, capecitabine 1000mg/m2, orally, bid (half an hour after breakfast and dinner),&#xD;
      d1-14, every 3 weeks, up to 8 cycles. Then patients will be given capecitabine and&#xD;
      bevacizumab maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received regular and periodic reviews, with imaging evaluations every 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by AE and laboratory tests. All patients were followed up every 3&#xD;
      months until death according to the plan.&#xD;
