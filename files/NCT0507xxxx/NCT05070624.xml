  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people that use a ventilator (a machine that supports breathing) at home is&#xD;
      increasing in Canada and around the world. These individuals have complex health problems,&#xD;
      require a lot of care and they use the healthcare system often. Competent family caregivers&#xD;
      (FC) are essential for successful caring for individuals with NMD using HMV. However, family&#xD;
      caregiving is known to contribute to significant FC burden and social isolation, and&#xD;
      negatively affects FC health. COVID-19 physical distancing has increased the care burden and&#xD;
      social isolation for many FCs. Infrastructure to support FCs is paramount to ensure that&#xD;
      individuals with NMD using HMV can safely remain at home. Peer support includes emotional and&#xD;
      informational support by an individual that has experienced a similar health problem. It&#xD;
      improves health-related quality of life, increases self-efficacy and empowerment, and&#xD;
      decreases stress in various patient and caregiver populations. With our study we plan to&#xD;
      educate and empower HMV dependent individuals and their caregivers and develop a&#xD;
      comprehensive peer support program.&#xD;

    <description>Training: We have previously developed and beta-tested a virtual peer mentor training program adapted from the St. Jude's Research Hospital's (Memphis, USA) program for FCs of children with cancer for adults using HMV. Content &amp; Design of the Virtual Peer-Support Program: The program will be delivered by the aTouchAway™ App used for the LIVE program. Participants will be requested to access peer mentors ≥1 time/week. Participants can choose to interact with a peer mentor which will be assigned as well as other peer participants. Onboarding: Participants and mentors will create a personal profile of their caregiving situation (e.g., duration of care, family member age and diagnosis), to enable selection of mentors by the research team believed to be well suited to address support needs, questions, and concerns based on similar lived experience.</description>
