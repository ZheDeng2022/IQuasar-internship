  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of HB-1 versus placebo in&#xD;
      male and female adult patients aged 18 to 60 years, inclusive, with Panic Disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All patients with&#xD;
      Panic Disorder, with or without specified co-morbidities, who meet all of the inclusion and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible. Patients and researchers will be blinded to&#xD;
      their treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 80 adult patients who meet the diagnosis of panic&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated for 12 weeks including a 1 week safety follow up visit following&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
