  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though large body of evidence reported association between pain and kinesiophobia, there are&#xD;
      paucity of studies in associating kinesiophobia to muscle endurance and position sense in&#xD;
      patients with Chronic lower back pain [CLBP]. To the best of Investigator's knowledge, till&#xD;
      date there is no studies assessing the relationship between kinesiophobia and endurance and&#xD;
      position sense in subjects with CLBP. Therefore, the current study aims to compare the impact&#xD;
      of kinesiophobia on lumbar extensor endurance, position sense in patient with CLBP and&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) frequently present with kinesiophobia. Recent high&#xD;
      quality studies reported a moderate to strong evidence of associations between a greater&#xD;
      degree of kinesiophobia and greater levels of pain, greater levels of disability and poorer&#xD;
      quality of life. However, there are paucity of studies in associating kinesiophobia to muscle&#xD;
      endurance and position sense in patients with CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the impact of kinesiophobia on lumbar extensor&#xD;
      endurance, position sense in patient with CLBP and asymptomatic individuals. Secondarily, to&#xD;
      examine the association between kinesiophobia and lumbar extensor endurance, position sense,&#xD;
      pain intensity and functional ability in patients with CLBP. Thirdly to assess the degree of&#xD;
      association with various factors on CLBP, lumbar endurance and position sense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case-control study will have 200 patients with CLBP and 400 controls. Kinesiophobia will&#xD;
      be assessed with Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia. Lumbar endurance will be assessed with&#xD;
      Soren's lumbar extensor test and lumbar position sense with neutral and target lumbar&#xD;
      re-positioning tests. Secondarily, the pain intensity will be assessed with visual analog&#xD;
      scale, functional ability with patient-specific Functional Scale in patients with CLBP.&#xD;
      Kinesiophobia, lumbar endurance, and joint position sense will be compared between patients&#xD;
      and controls. Kinesiophobia scores will be correlated with lumbar extensor endurance and&#xD;
      proprioception joint position errors, pain intensity, and functional ability. Simple and&#xD;
      multiple binary logistic regression will be used to determine crude and adjusted Odd's Ratio&#xD;
      for kinesiophobia, lumbar position sense and kinesiophobia, lumbar endurance.&#xD;

    <description>Fear of movement/injury or reinjury will be assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), a 17 self-reporting items with scores ranging from 17 (absence of fear) to 68 (highest fear). Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia has been reported to have good reliability in patients with CLBP.</description>

    <description>measured with Visual analog scale (VAS). The visual analogue scale consists of a 10-cm line, with the left extremity representing (absence of pain) and the right extremity indicating (great pain). Participants were asked to indicate in the scale their current level of pain, higher values being related to more intense pain.</description>

    <description>Functional ability will be measured using Patient-specific Functional Scale. Patients are asked to rate (on an 11-point scale) the current level of difficulty associated with each activity, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;unable to perform&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;able to perform at prior level</description>
