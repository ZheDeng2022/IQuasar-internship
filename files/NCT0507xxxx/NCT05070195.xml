    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label phase I clinical study to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      SKLB1028 on the pharmacokinetics of Midazolam and its metabolite 1'-OH-midazolam in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. This study also aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SKLB1028 in the&#xD;
      presence of Midazolam.&#xD;

      This study aims to characterize the drug-drug Interactions (DDI) potential of SKLB1028 with&#xD;
      the sensitive index substrate drug (Midazolam) in Healthy Subjects. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening period (Day -14 to Day -2), a baseline period (Day -1), a treatment period, and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit period.&#xD;
