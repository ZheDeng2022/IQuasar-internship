  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether factors that lead Women of Color to decline&#xD;
      participation in the breast cancer screening trial EA1151 (TMIST) differ from non-women of&#xD;
      color.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a population of women who decline participation in TMIST (EAQ201 participants), we will&#xD;
      compare the proportion of WOC vs non-WOC with respect to who experience COVID-related&#xD;
      financial hardship, a composite endpoint defined as any psychological response (financial&#xD;
      distress, food/housing insecurity) or change in their material condition. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      COVID-19 related financial hardship and distress are more prevalent in WOC who decline TMIST&#xD;
      participation compared to non-WOC who decline participation.&#xD;
