  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial to evaluate whether the addition of ipilimumab prior to the current&#xD;
      standard treatment of surgery and chemoradiotherapy will improve survival in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 43 patients over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Subjects (patients) with newly diagnosed de-novo glioblastoma who are deemed eligible&#xD;
      for the trial will be recruited to the study to receive neoadjuvant ipilimumab. Patients will&#xD;
      receive 2 cycles of ipilimumab, administered intravenously at a dose of 3mg/kg on day 1 of&#xD;
      each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to trial entry the patient's treating multidisciplinary team (MDT) consisting of&#xD;
      oncologists, radiologists and surgeons must agree that the patient is a suitable candidate&#xD;
      for ipilimumab prior to surgery and that surgery may be delayed beyond usual standard of care&#xD;
      timelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed on a weekly basis, and disease assessments (including MRI scans)&#xD;
      will be performed after each cycle of ipilimumab. Patient responses and associated MRI scans&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the MDT to determine that it is safe for the patient to continue with&#xD;
      trial treatment. On completion of trial treatment patients will have a further disease&#xD;
      assessment (including MRI scan) which will be reviewed with the MDT before continuing to&#xD;
      standard of care treatment of debulking surgery and chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients demonstrating clinical or radiological deterioration (as determined by the MDT or&#xD;
      the principal investigator) at any point, either before starting or whilst receiving&#xD;
      ipilimumab, will stop trial treatment and proceed to debulking surgery and chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      as per local policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of trial will be declared when the final data item for the final patient is received i.e.&#xD;
      when the final patient completes their 2 year follow up visit.&#xD;
