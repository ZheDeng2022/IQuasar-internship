  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is going to test a cold atmospheric plasma device (CAP), in particular a floating&#xD;
      electrode-dielectric barrier device (FE-DBD), to treat warts and molluscum. The treatment&#xD;
      device in this study generates cold atmospheric plasma (gaseous ionized molecules) to rid the&#xD;
      virus from the body. Based on the successes of previous dermatologic studies, FE-DBD is being&#xD;
      tested for this study to treat warts and molluscum. Patients will be enrolled to test the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of this device. The duration of the study is 4-12 weeks depending on&#xD;
      treatment clearance. The number of lesions will be chosen by the dermatologist. Patients will&#xD;
      receive standard of care therapy and/or NTAP depending on the number of lesions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>During a clinical care visit, if a patient is eligible and agrees to participate, lesions will be selected by the dermatologist prior to procedure.The lesions will be marked randomly for a certain treatment regimen. The number of lesions treated will not exceed standard of care (SOC) recommendations. They will be determined by provider assessment and anatomical location. Participants with one lesion will receive either non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) or SOC. SOC is cryotherapy for warts and cantharidin for molluscum. Participants with greater than 2 lesions will receive equal treatment of NTAP and SOC. The number of lesions treated will be based off the providers assessment and anatomical location. Treatment of a single lesion or an odd number of multiple lesions will be based off a randomized list. All SOC lesions will be treated first to reduce the number of patients not wanting return to the more painful modality.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Absence of change in appearance of targeted lesion. Molluscum is defined as the visualization of a central umbilication with polylobular, white to yellow, amorphous structures. A peripheral crown of radiating or punctiform vessels may also be present. Warts are defined as grouped papillae, with dotted or loop vessels, and/or hemorrhagic points and lines often surrounded by a whitish halo.</description>

    <description>There is change in the size, dyspigmentation, or discomfort of the targeted lesion as compared to its appearance and symptoms at the initial visit, but the lesion remains grossly visible. Molluscum is defined as the visualization of a central umbilication with polylobular, white to yellow, amorphous structures. A peripheral crown of radiating or punctiform vessels may also be present. Warts are defined as grouped papillae, with dotted or loop vessels, and/or hemorrhagic points and lines often surrounded by a whitish halo. Changes in the characteristics of the targeted lesions will be evaluated by a dermatologist and documented via photographs at follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, with the final outcome measured at the 12-week visit.</description>

    <measure>Average score of standardized CAP Tolerability questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures tolerability of cold atmospheric plasma treatment. Assessment of dryness, peeling, scaling, erythema, edema, stinging, burning sensation, itching, scarring and dyspigmentation will each be assessed individually by means of a standardized grading scale (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average score of visual analogue scale associated with treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a validated subjective measurement of pain experienced by the patient. It consists of visual-numeric scale, numbered from 0-10. (0) indicate absence of pain or &quot;no pain at all&quot;, while (10) indicates severe pain or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. This is supplemented by six faces with different expressions, ranging from happy to extremely upset. Each facial expression is assigned a numerical scale from 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>We are proposing a clinical trial of a floating electrode-dielectric barrier device (FE-DBD), a Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) device for the treatment of Verrucae Vulgaris and Molluscum Contagiosum. While novel to the medical field, and especially to dermatology, there are already a number of publications regarding its use on human skin in adults and children. CAP devices utilize noble gases (such as helium) to deliver plasma state matter to the skin. As its name implies, the generated plasma stream is of near skin temperature and it exists on normal atmospheric pressure. During the generation of the plasma there is no electric contact with the patient. The treatment does not increase skin surface temperature and the used helium gas, the same as used for balloons, being a noble gas does not cause a chemical reaction with the skin. The flow of the gas is slow, thus there is no mechanical effect on the skin.</description>

    <description>The treatment device in this study generates cold atmospheric plasma. Cold atmospheric plasma has certain properties of plasma, such as ionized gas molecules. To create plasma, a pulse generator supplying 20 kilovolt pulse of 20-ns pulse width at 200 Hz (FPG10-01NM10, FID GmbH, Burbach, Germany) to a 5-mm diameter quartz-covered copper electrode of 10-cm length and 1 - 13mm quartz thickness. These nanosecond pulse parameters were chosen to provide sufficient treatment dose at the high level of plasma uniformity required to avoid any tissue damage. We will treat the lesions for approximately 1 to 2 minutes each, moving the electrode gently over the treatment area.</description>
