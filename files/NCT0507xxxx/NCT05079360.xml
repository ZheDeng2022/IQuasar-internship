      This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, two treatment arm, efficacy and safety&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be randomized to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be the median rPFS. Subjects will continue&#xD;
      study treatment until disease progression confirmed by blinded independent central reader&#xD;
      (BICR) is observed. A safety follow up visit will occur approximately 30 days after last dose&#xD;
      of study drug.&#xD;
