  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain effects more than 50% of general population. It's prevalence is higher&#xD;
      is young adults that are economically active adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its significance is often underestimated because usually young adults ignore these initial&#xD;
      episodes of low back pain due to their busy life style or life full of commitments.&#xD;
      Approximately 70% of adults have at least one episode of low back pain during their&#xD;
      lifetimes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be randomized control trial with 60 patients with chronic low back pain divided into&#xD;
      2 groups. One group will be given segmental stabilization whose purpose is to achieve&#xD;
      segmental control over primary stabilizers. Second group will be given just generalized&#xD;
      lumber stabilization exercises as it includes close chain exercises with low velocity as well&#xD;
      as low load. This study will be conducted in Rehabilitation setup of Benazir Bhutto hospital&#xD;
      Rawalpindi and IIRS that is Rehabilitation dept. at Al Nafees medical college and hospital,&#xD;
      Islamabad. Non probability Convenience Sampling technique will be utilized&#xD;

    <description>Segmental control over the primary stabilizers (TrA, deep multifidus, pelvic floor and diaphram) is maintained. Weight of body is minimized by using drawing in maneuver. Time duration will be of 30 to 40 mins, thrice a week for four weeks. Hot packs will be applied for 10 mins. In starting days, 8 to 10 reps with hold time 5 count. In later days, 12 to 15 reps with hold time increases up till 10 to 15 counts.</description>
