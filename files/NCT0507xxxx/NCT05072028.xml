    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label phase I clinical study to evaluate the mass balance and&#xD;
      biotransformation pathways of [14C]DBPR108 in Chinese healthy adult male subjects, to reveal&#xD;
      the overall pharmacokinetic characteristics of DBPR108 in human body, and to provide a&#xD;
      reference for the rational administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the mass balance and pharmacokinetics of DBPR108 in approximately 6&#xD;
      healthy male subjects receiving a single oral 100 mg dose of DBPR108 containing approximately&#xD;
      150 µCi of [14C]- DBPR108. This study consists of a screening period (Day -7 to Day -2), a&#xD;
      baseline period (Day -1), a treatment period, and a follow-up visit period.&#xD;
