  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma from donors who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contain&#xD;
      antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and may be a potential therapy for hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19. The efficacy of high-titer convalescent plasma for COVID-19, however, still&#xD;
      unclear. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using convalescent&#xD;
      plasma for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of using convalescent plasma for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Participants&#xD;
      must be adult hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and time Between&#xD;
      symptom onset and inclusion ≤ 7 days. Two hundred participants will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive either 200-400 mL of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma or standard&#xD;
      care. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with clinical improvement at day 14&#xD;
      following randomization, defined by an increase of two points in the 7-point ordinal scale&#xD;
      based on that recommended by the World Health Organization. Safety will be daily assessed by&#xD;
      monitoring the occurrence of adverse effects and reactions to convalescent plasma&#xD;
      transfusion. Study visits will occur on Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 or until hospital&#xD;
      discharge, whichever comes first.&#xD;
