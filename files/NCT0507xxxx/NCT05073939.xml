  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate whether orally administered oxytocin (24IU) could&#xD;
      modulate females' neural and behavioral responses to affective stimuli including emotional&#xD;
      faces and affective scenes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will complete a series of questionnaires firstly to control for possible&#xD;
      pre-treatment confounders in terms of personality traits and mood: Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory-II (BDI), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS),&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Second&#xD;
      Version of Social Responsiveness Scale(SRS-2), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).&#xD;
      PANAS is administered before and after oral administration and after functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. In the current double-blind, between-subject,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study 80 healthy female subjects will be recruited and receive oral&#xD;
      administration either oxytocin (24IU) or placebo. Blood samples are collected twice before&#xD;
      and 30 minutes after oral administration to assess the plasma OXT concentrations change. 45&#xD;
      minutes after oral administration subjects will be required to finish fMRI scanning including&#xD;
      resting-state fMRI task, emotional face task (happy, fear, angry and neutral faces),&#xD;
      affective scene task (NAPS, Nencki affective picture system, positive, neutral, and&#xD;
      negative-valence scenes). After fMRI scanning, subjects will be required to rate valence,&#xD;
      intensity, and arousal responses (Likert scale, 1-9 ratings) to the emotional and affective&#xD;
      stimuli are presented during fMRI scanning.&#xD;
