  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot feasibility study is to provide continued CGM access to youth with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and collect descriptive data about feasibility of use of CGM in youth with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes ages 4 years and older. From this study the investigators hope to learn if&#xD;
      CGM use in youth with type 2 diabetes can be tolerated and sustained with good adherence and&#xD;
      to describe blood glucose patterns in youth with type 2 diabetes. The primary aim will be to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of CGM start and continuation in youth with T2D and describe glucose&#xD;
      metrics and patient reported outcomes (PROs). The investigators will pilot and refine a&#xD;
      program to test the hypothesis that CGM start and continuation in youth with T2D is feasible&#xD;
      and then evaluate glucose metrics and PROs.&#xD;
