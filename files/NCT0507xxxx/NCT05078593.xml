      This study is a first-in-class open-label phase I human clinical study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of HLX26 with escalated doses in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. In this study, accelerated titration is&#xD;
      combined with a 3 + 3 dose escalation method, and the patients will be given different&#xD;
      doses(60mg, 150mg, 300mg, 500mg, 800mg Q3W) of HLX26 intravenously. Observation period of DLT&#xD;
      lasts for 3 weeks after the first administration of HLX26.&#xD;
