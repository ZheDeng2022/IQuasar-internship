  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, during Part 1, after a baseline gastroduodenoscopy, the investigators&#xD;
      will perform a gastroduodenoscopy twice, to take duodenal biopsies before and 2 hours after&#xD;
      administration of CRH/placebo. The investigators will measure mucosal integrity and markers&#xD;
      of immune activation as outlined in Parts A and B, and will use transmission electron&#xD;
      microscopy to evaluate mast cell and eosinophil degranulation. After an interval period of at&#xD;
      least 1 week, CRH or placebo will be administrated again in a crossover fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a complementary study, the investigators will also test the effect of ex vivo mast cell&#xD;
      blockade by lodoxamide to evaluate whether mast cells are involved in the hypothesized effect&#xD;
      of CRH on duodenal permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second part of this study, Part 2, the investigators will perform a gastric barostat, to&#xD;
      measure the gastric accommodation and sensitivity to distension, and a carbon-13-octanoic&#xD;
      acid breath test to measure the gastric emptying time after administration of CRH/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will have the option to choose to which part of the study (part 1 or 2)&#xD;
      they wish to participate. They can also choose to cooperate to both study parts if preferred.&#xD;
