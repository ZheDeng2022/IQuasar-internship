      In cardiac surgery, the establishment of Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) involves profound&#xD;
      changes that can alter the pharmacokinetics and clinical response to drugs. Methadone has&#xD;
      characteristics that make it attractive for the management of postoperative pain, however, to&#xD;
      date there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies that allow guidance on how to&#xD;
      perform the dosage and dose adjustment of methadone in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of methadone in adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic clinical study will be proposed. Drug concentrations will be measured at&#xD;
      different times, estimating how plasma levels vary before, during and after CPB. For the&#xD;
      plasma methadone analysis, 10 blood samples will be taken from each patient following a&#xD;
      pre-established schedule. They will be analyzed using a high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC) spectrofluorometric method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in volumes, clearance, and other covariates associated with CPB are not expected to&#xD;
      significantly affect methadone plasma concentrations.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics studies the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion&#xD;
      of a drug. There are multiple conditions that can affect the expected pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      behavior of a drug. In cardiac surgery, for example, most surgeries require stopping the&#xD;
      heart. For this, different cardioplegia solutions and an extracorporeal circulation machine&#xD;
      (ECC) are used to allow oxygenation and blood circulation to continue to the rest of the&#xD;
      body. The establishment of Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) involves profound changes that can&#xD;
      alter the pharmacokinetics and clinical response to drugs. An adequate knowledge of the&#xD;
      magnitude and direction of these changes is therefore necessary for each drug in particular,&#xD;
      in order to achieve an optimal dosage at the time of use. In order to optimize postoperative&#xD;
      pain management in cardiac surgery, other drugs have been used as an alternative to the usual&#xD;
      management of boluses of morphine or fentanyl. Methadone has pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic characteristics that make it attractive; however, despite being a relatively&#xD;
      old drug, its use in cardiac surgery is relatively recent. To date, few studies have been&#xD;
      published with the use of methadone in a single intraoperative bolus scheme, both studies&#xD;
      report positive results. However, to date there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      studies that provide guidance on how to dose and adjust the dose of methadone in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK Pharmacokinetics is the branch of pharmacology that studies the&#xD;
      relationship between the dose of a drug and its plasma concentrations, &quot;what the body does to&#xD;
      the drug.&quot; Pharmacokinetics studies the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and&#xD;
      excretion of a drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compartment pharmacokinetic models emerge as a way of conceptualizing this study. They&#xD;
      describe the organism as a set of compartments where each one represents a part of the&#xD;
      biological material in which the drug is supposed to be uniformly distributed and has the&#xD;
      same kinetic properties. It is possible to use 1 or more compartments to describe the&#xD;
      kinetics of a drug. For the estimation of population parameters, specific study methods are&#xD;
      required that allow the most accurate and precise estimation of population parameters, both&#xD;
      of fixed effect, as well as of inter and intra-individual random effect. Among the available&#xD;
      parametric methods, which assume a known probability distribution, one widely used is the&#xD;
      non-linear mixed effects model. Proposed by Sheiner and Beal, it is currently the reference&#xD;
      method in pharmacokinetic analysis in large population groups. This method allows estimating&#xD;
      inter individual variability without ignoring the large number of limitations present in&#xD;
      observational data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a clinical perspective, there are multiple conditions that can alter the expected&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic behavior of a drug; diseases, for example, can modify the physiological&#xD;
      functions of different organs, alter blood flow and alter the metabolism and elimination of&#xD;
      some drugs. Another example is the case of cardiac surgery where, for the realization of most&#xD;
      of the surgeries it is required to stop the heart. For this, different cardioplegia solutions&#xD;
      and an extracorporeal circulation machine (CPB) are used to allow oxygenation and blood&#xD;
      circulation to continue to the rest of the body during the surgical procedure. The&#xD;
      establishment of CPB involves profound changes that can alter the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      clinical response to drugs. An adequate knowledge of the magnitude and direction of these&#xD;
      changes is therefore necessary for each drug in particular, in order to achieve an optimal&#xD;
      dosage at the time of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of CPB, acute hemodilution can cause a decrease in the plasma concentration of&#xD;
      almost any drug. Hypothermia, frequently used in cardiac surgery, can also reduce metabolic&#xD;
      activity in the liver and thus decrease metabolic clearance. The oxygenator membrane,&#xD;
      reservoir filters, and ECC circuit can sequester varying amounts of some drugs. This occurs&#xD;
      with fentanyl, for which a 25% decrease in plasma concentration upon entering CPB was&#xD;
      initially described. A similar effect was described for sulfentanil. In the case of&#xD;
      remifentanil that is metabolized by plasma esterases, a decrease in clearance is observed&#xD;
      with hypothermia (6.3% per 1ÂºC). In this context, it has not been described how the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of methadone could change in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methadone is a synthetic opioid that has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics&#xD;
      that make it attractive for its perioperative use, both in acute pain and in chronic pain.&#xD;
      Its long half-life allows more stable inter-dose plasma levels. Administered in a single dose&#xD;
      of 0.2 to 0.3 mg / kg, it has not been associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects&#xD;
      (compared to short-acting opioids), reaching a duration of analgesia between 24 hours and 35&#xD;
      hours. It is highly bound to plasma proteins. Between 60 and 90% circulates bound to&#xD;
      proteins, mainly acid glycoprotein. Unlike morphine, it does not generate active metabolites&#xD;
      after its liver biotransformation and does not accumulate in kidney failure, which allows its&#xD;
      use in patients with chronic kidney disease or hemodialysis. It is inexpensive compared to&#xD;
      other opioids. In addition to its action on opioid receptors, it reduces the re-uptake of&#xD;
      serotonin and norepinephrine involved in acute and chronic pain processes. It also exerts&#xD;
      antagonistic activity at NMDA glutamatergic receptors. Glutamate is the main excitatory amino&#xD;
      acid of the central nervous system and participates in the processes of nociceptive&#xD;
      transmission at the spinal level. Its action on pain pathways is mainly mediated through&#xD;
      ionotropic receptors (AMPA, NMDA and Kainic) involved in the generation and maintenance of&#xD;
      states of hyperalgesia (exacerbated response to noxious stimulus) and allodynia (decreased&#xD;
      pain threshold). These properties give it potential effectiveness in relieving neuropathic&#xD;
      pain, also showing good results in the treatment of chronic pain and cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate control of postoperative pain is a relevant issue in cardiac surgery. Poorly treated&#xD;
      acute pain can produce serious deleterious effects, namely; activation of the sympathetic&#xD;
      system, tachycardia, arrhythmias and ischemia due to increased myocardial oxygen consumption.&#xD;
      Pulmonary adverse effects (atelectasis and pneumonia), gastrointestinal (ileus),&#xD;
      musculoskeletal (muscle weakness), endocrine (hypoglycemia) and psychological (depression).&#xD;
      The presence of these complications delays and makes recovery difficult. With current&#xD;
      techniques, incidences of acute pain between 30 and 75% are reported, with greater intensity&#xD;
      during the first 2 days. Patients with high levels of postoperative pain have 3.5 times the&#xD;
      risk of chronic pain and their inadequate treatment can lead to chronic or neuropathic pain&#xD;
      that is difficult to manage . The incidence of chronic pain after cardiac surgery can reach&#xD;
      up to 30-40% of patients during the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, the methadone use could confer certain advantages. Its long half-life would&#xD;
      allow the establishment of simplified dosage schedules with less variability in plasma levels&#xD;
      between doses than with the usual management that considers fentanyl or morphine in&#xD;
      intermittent boluses. Its pharmacokinetics allow its administration in one dose per day,&#xD;
      regardless of the need and cost of a continuous infusion pump. Methadone could reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of chronic pain by optimizing acute pain control and its anti-NMDA activity.&#xD;
      Finally, cardioprotective properties have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being a relatively old drug, the use of methadone as an alternative to short-acting&#xD;
      opioids (fentanyl or morphine) in cardiac surgery is relatively recent. Few studies have been&#xD;
      published with the use of intraoperative methadone in cardiac surgery and two report an&#xD;
      adequate clinical effect with positive results. Although the presence of an adequate&#xD;
      postoperative clinical effect suggests that exposure to cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass alone does not produce a significant change in postoperative methadone concentrations,&#xD;
      the actual pharmacokinetic behavior of methadone in these circumstances is unknown. To date,&#xD;
      there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies that provide guidance on how to dose&#xD;
      and adjust the dose of methadone in these patients.&#xD;
