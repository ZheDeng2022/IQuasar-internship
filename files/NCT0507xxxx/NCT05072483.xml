      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy) is a genetic disorder. It causes narrowing of the small blood vessels&#xD;
      and can lead to strokes and dementia. Researchers want to monitor people with CADASIL over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how CADASIL affects a person s blood vessels over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have CADASIL, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 study visits over 9 years. Visits will last 6 8 hours per day, for 2&#xD;
      4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and urine samples. They will have an electrocardiogram to record&#xD;
      their heart s electrical activity. They will fill out a family tree. They will have tests&#xD;
      that measure mental abilities like memory and attention. They may have a skin biopsy. They&#xD;
      may have a lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an eye exam. Their pupils will be dilated. They will receive a dye via&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) line. Pictures will be taken of their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an imaging scan of their brain. They may receive a contrast agent via&#xD;
      IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants blood flow and blood vessel flexibility will be measured. In one test, a probe&#xD;
      will be pressed against the skin of the their wrist, neck, and groin. In another test, they&#xD;
      will hold one arm still while a microscope makes videos of the blood flow through a&#xD;
      fingernail. In another test, they will perform light exercise or other activities while&#xD;
      wearing an elastic band around their head or probes placed on their arm or leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will complete some of the above tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Small vessel diseases are conditions characterized by the narrowing of small arteries leading&#xD;
      to an imbalance of blood supply upon demand. This results in a progressive chronic&#xD;
      hypoperfusion with detrimental outcomes for the affected organ system and for the patient.&#xD;
      Recent advances in genetic evaluation have identified several genetic variants causing&#xD;
      cerebrovascular small vessel diseases. These diseases have common clinical presentation&#xD;
      including recurrent strokes, progressive white matter degeneration, and debilitating&#xD;
      dementia. The link between these pathologies is defects in the tunica media of arteries,&#xD;
      which is composed mainly of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy) is caused by mutations in NOTCH3. The disease is of slow onset, with&#xD;
      initial clinical manifestations in the third and fourth decade of life, but progressive and&#xD;
      fatal. Predominant clinical features include migraine with aura (atypical or isolated),&#xD;
      strokes, memory loss, and multiple psychiatric symptoms including dementia. Currently,&#xD;
      CADASIL is considered the most common hereditary subcortical vascular dementia. However,&#xD;
      treatments are symptomatic therapyand there is little prospect of future therapies to&#xD;
      directly address causation and block progression. We propose to characterize the etiology and&#xD;
      natural history of CADASIL subjects through comprehensive clinical and molecular&#xD;
      characterizations. Subjects will be seen at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) every&#xD;
      three years for nine years for a total of four NIH Clinical Center visits.&#xD;

        We will follow 100 subjects with CADASIL (80 new CADASIL subjects and up to 20 CADASIL&#xD;
        subjects previously enrolled in our pilot study, if they would like to participate in this&#xD;
        study as well) and up to 40 healthy controls male and female, ages 18-100. Should anyone&#xD;
        from the original patient cohort decide not to participate in this new study, additional&#xD;
        patients will be recruited in order to meet our goal of having 100 CADASIL subjects&#xD;
        enrolled in the study.&#xD;
