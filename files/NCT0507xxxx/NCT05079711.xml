      The purpose of this study is to establish lay user performance criteria for the SavvyCheck&#xD;
      Vaginal Yeast Test in comparison to standard vaginal yeast culture and identification method&#xD;
      for Candida (the Reference Method). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of fungi&#xD;
      will be used as an aid to explain the nature of the discrepancy in the case of discordant&#xD;
      results between the lay user-performed SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test and standard vaginal&#xD;
      yeast culture and identification method for Candida.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to establish lay user performance criteria (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of the SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test in comparison to the Reference Method&#xD;
      (vaginal Candida yeast culture)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the lay&#xD;
           user-performed SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test in comparison to the Reference Method&#xD;
           (vaginal Candida yeast culture)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the concordance between the results determined by lay user-performed&#xD;
           SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test -vs. trained user-performed SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the concordance between the results determined by lay user-performed&#xD;
           SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test -vs. vaginal wet mount microscopy results&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the concordance between results determined by lay user-performed SavvyCheck&#xD;
           Vaginal Yeast Test -vs. PCR and sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the concordance between results determined by the Reference Method (vaginal&#xD;
           Candida yeast culture) -vs. PCR and sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Women, aged 18 years and older, symptomatic and asymptomatic for vaginitis will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. We estimate that it will require a total enrollment of up to 600 symptomatic&#xD;
      women at all four clinical sites combined, to achieve the target of at least n=216 Reference&#xD;
      Method (vaginal Candida yeast culture) positives. In addition, a combined total of 320&#xD;
      asymptomatic women will be enrolled in the study from the four clinical sites combined, to&#xD;
      achieve the target of at least n=170 Reference Method (vaginal Candida yeast culture)&#xD;
      negatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four, large, regional, DoD military treatment facilities (MTFs) representing two branches of&#xD;
      the U.S. military:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) at Fort Bragg; Fayetteville, NC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD); San Diego, CA&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test is a lateral flow immunochromatographic qualitative test&#xD;
      for the detection of Candida antigen in vaginal secretions sampled by a swab, as an aid for&#xD;
      identification of vulvovaginal candidiasis as a primary cause of vaginal yeast infections.&#xD;
      The SavvyCheck Vaginal Yeast Test is designed for use by women experiencing vaginal symptoms,&#xD;
      including: increased vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, vaginal soreness and irritation,&#xD;
      rash on the labia, and genital burning that may worsen during urination. The SavvyCheck&#xD;
      Vaginal Yeast Test is indicated for over-the-counter use.&#xD;
