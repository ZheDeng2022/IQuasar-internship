    <textblock>
      This clinical trial tests whether intensity modulated proton therapy after surgery works to&#xD;
      shrink tumors in patients with head and neck cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The primary goal is to evaluate the local-regional control among subjects in both arms at&#xD;
      2 years after study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine overall survival progression free survival local, regional, distant&#xD;
      recurrence risks, and infield and outfield recurrence in the trial at 2 years after study&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the rate and duration of grade 3+ acute adverse events from treatment start&#xD;
      to 30 days after radiation completion date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the incidence of secondary acute effects attributable to radiotherapy (e.g.&#xD;
      percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tube placement, duration and dose of narcotic&#xD;
      analgesia required, weight loss, and hospitalization days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the impact of treatment on patient reported quality of life. V. To&#xD;
      objectively quantify the severity of oral mucositis during and following radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate direct and indirect costs of the study regimen and compare these with standard&#xD;
      of care treatment techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate histopathologic, molecular, and tumor genetic/epigenetic alterations with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate circulating biomarkers (microribonucleic acid [miRNA], circulating tumor&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid [ctDNA]) with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine adverse events and patient reported outcomes related to abbreviated&#xD;
      concomitant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine incidence and severity of late effects attributable to radiotherapy at 1-3&#xD;
      years after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To qualitatively evaluate patient beliefs regarding tradeoffs of cancer control,&#xD;
      treatment time, cost, acute side effects, and late side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine cancer out comes, adverse events, and patient reported outcomes and compare&#xD;
      across head and neck subsites, between those aged 65 to those age &lt; 65 at date of enrollment,&#xD;
      between male and female, and in the adjuvant population between time to total package&#xD;
      completion (&lt; 9 weeks vs weeks, surgery day 0) and by treatment with and without&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate the predictive relationship of linear energy transfer (LET) weighted&#xD;
      modeling using an relative biologic enhancement (RBE) based model and RBE independent model&#xD;
      with grade 3+ acute and late toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients who already underwent surgical resection undergo intensity modulated proton&#xD;
      therapy (IMPT) for 18 sessions (Monday-Friday) over 24 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      1-2 hours per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo surgical resection and then IMPT for 15 sessions (Monday-Friday) over&#xD;
      19 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive&#xD;
      cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 21 days, every 3 months&#xD;
      for 2 years, and then every 6-12 months for 5-10 years.&#xD;
