  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, two-way crossover, phase Ib drug-drug interaction study in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisting of two lurbinectedin cycles, one cycle in combination with bosentan and&#xD;
      one cycle as single agent (in different order depending on the study sequence), and one&#xD;
      additional third cycle of lurbinectedin as a single agent for patients who meet the&#xD;
      continuation criteria and obtain a clinical benefit after the first two cycles.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive a maximum of three cycles: two consecutive cycles of lurbinectedin,&#xD;
      one cycle with and one cycle without bosentan co-administration (in different order depending&#xD;
      on the study Sequence 1 or Sequence 2 of treatment), followed by a third cycle with&#xD;
      lurbinectedin alone (this last optional for patients with clinical benefit). Lurbinectedin&#xD;
      will be administered as a 1-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion every three weeks (q3wk) via a&#xD;
      central or peripheral vein. The dose of lurbinectedin will be 3.2 mg/m² for all patients when&#xD;
      administered with and without bosentan. If toxicity occurs, the appropriate intra-patient&#xD;
      dose level (DL) reductions will be implemented in the subsequent cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Sequence 1 (TR: Test-Reference; lurbinectedin +&#xD;
      bosentan in Cycle 1) or Sequence 2 (RT: reference-Test; lurbinectedin + bosentan in Cycle 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive lurbinectedin until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent&#xD;
      withdrawal or while it is considered to be in their best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with lurbinectedin outside this study could be continued under a Compassionate Use&#xD;
      Agreement after the completion of the optional third study cycle.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Voluntary signed and dated written informed consent prior to any specific study&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female with age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumors [except for primary&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) tumors], for which no approved therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Recovery to grade ≤ 1 from drug-related adverse events (AEs) of previous treatments,&#xD;
             excluding alopecia and grade ≤2 asthenia or fatigue, according to the National Cancer&#xD;
             Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Laboratory values within fourteen days prior to registration: a) Absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count (ANC) &gt; 2.0 x 109/L, platelet count &gt; 120 x 109/L and hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
             (patients may be transfused as clinically indicated prior to study entry). b) Alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN). c) Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN. If total bilirubin is &gt; 1.0 x ULN,&#xD;
             but ≤ 1.5 x ULN, direct bilirubin must be ≤ 1.0 x ULN. d) Albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL. e)&#xD;
             Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;= 30 mL/min (using Cockcroft and Gault's formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
             f) Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography (ECHO) or multiple-gated&#xD;
             acquisition (MUGA) within normal range (according to institutional standards).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). WOCBP&#xD;
             must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive measure up to six months after&#xD;
             treatment discontinuation. As bosentan may render hormonal contraceptives ineffective,&#xD;
             and taking into account the teratogenic effects observed in animals, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives cannot be the sole method of contraception during treatment with&#xD;
             bosentan. Fertile male patients with WOCBP partners should use condoms during&#xD;
             treatment and for four months following the last investigational medicinal product&#xD;
             (IMP) dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concomitant diseases/conditions: a) History or presence of unstable angina, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, congestive heart failure, or clinically significant valvular disease&#xD;
             within last year. b) Symptomatic arrhythmia or any uncontrolled arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
             ongoing treatment. c) Known cirrhosis, alcohol induced steatosis, or chronic active&#xD;
             hepatitis. For hepatitis B, this includes positive test for both Hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg) and quantitative Hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR or&#xD;
             HVB-DNA+). For hepatitis C, this includes positive test for both Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             and quantitative Hepatitis C by PCR (or HVCRNA+). d) History of obstructive&#xD;
             cholestatic liver disease (suitable for stenting procedure) or biliary sepsis in the&#xD;
             past 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             e) Active COVID-19 disease (this includes positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
             nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs or nasal swabs by PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic, progressive or corticosteroids-requiring documented brain metastases or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease involvement. Patients with asymptomatic documented stable brain&#xD;
             metastases not requiring corticosteroids during the last four weeks are allowed.&#xD;

             inductor is contraindicated.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding and fertile patients (men and women) who are&#xD;
             not using an effective method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
