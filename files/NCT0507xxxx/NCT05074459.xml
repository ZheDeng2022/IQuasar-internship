  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eptinezumab is a preventive treatment for migraine. The drug is made from a process that&#xD;
      currently uses yeast cells for production of the drug. The trial researchers want to test&#xD;
      whether using a new production cell line to make eptinezumab will affect the way the drug&#xD;
      behaves in the body. To do this, the researchers will give a single dose of eptinezumab to&#xD;
      healthy participants. Some of the participants will get eptinezumab that has been made from&#xD;
      yeast cells. Others will get eptinezumab made with the new cell line.&#xD;
