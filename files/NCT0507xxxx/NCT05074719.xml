  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials of prevention modalities for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pneumonia are underway under&#xD;
      separate protocol(s) for close contacts (i.e., household contacts, [e.g.,3502]) of infectious&#xD;
      (index) individuals (3502-01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterizing the index individuals within households will ascertain the risk of exposure&#xD;
      for the contact participant. These data will be used to strengthen the precision of efficacy&#xD;
      estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ancillary observational study will assess the cofactors for infectiousness among index&#xD;
      individuals whose close contacts are enrolled in COVID-19 prevention clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will assess post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in index&#xD;
      individuals that are more than two weeks past their initial diagnosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within households, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 is high, but the risk of transmission is&#xD;
      characterized by exposure cofactors and transmission mitigation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure cofactors are defined as cofactors that influence infectiousness of the index&#xD;
      individual such as SARS-CoV-2 viral load, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and viable virus (as&#xD;
      characterized by subgenomic RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission mitigation strategies are defined as modifiable cofactors that influence&#xD;
      transmission and currently include physical distancing, social isolation, ventilation, and&#xD;
      handwashing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continued progression of the pandemic has seen an increase in reports of persistent&#xD;
      and/or delayed onset of symptoms and complications in patients well past the acute phase of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. The prevalence and impacts of these post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection (PASC), which may continue for weeks to months after the initial COVID-19 illness,&#xD;
      are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to approximately 2,000 eligible index individuals who have close contacts (e.g.,&#xD;
      uninfected household members) in COVID-19 prevention research studies will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Individuals that enroll within two weeks of their diagnosis will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a baseline mid-turbinate nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing and complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and on Days 7 and 14. Through these questionnaires, index&#xD;
      individuals will report on the clinical course of their illness and share information about&#xD;
      their household environment, including potential exposures there-in and any COVID-19&#xD;
      transmission mitigation strategies implemented (whether intentional or as part of standard&#xD;
      home routines). Individuals that enroll more than two weeks after being diagnosed will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a mid-turbinate nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing and to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire reporting retrospectively on their COVID-19 illness and household environment.&#xD;
      These individuals will also complete a questionnaire reporting on the persistence and/or&#xD;
      delayed onset of symptoms and complications that they associate with their COVID-19 illness.&#xD;
      Enrolled index individuals will also be invited to participate in the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody&#xD;
      Sub-study and provide a dried blood spot specimen (at baseline) for antibody testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working closely with prevention research studies, we propose to characterize the index&#xD;
      individual level cofactors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each contact between an index individual and close contact is the unit of analysis for the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 status among contacts/household members will be done through&#xD;
      the parent prevention research study, e.g., through an existing clinical trials agreement&#xD;
      with the CoVPN 3502/R 10933-10987-COV-2069 study.h&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across these studies, the investigators aim to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the close contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reported SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation strategies and exposures as assessed in the&#xD;
           index individuals (3502-01) and household contact protocols (e.g., 3502) and the&#xD;
           correlation between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association between the index individual SARS-CoV-2 viral load and subgenomic RNA and&#xD;
           infection in the contact participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of the duration of symptomatic COVID-19 in the index individual on the risk&#xD;
           of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Association of SARS-CoV-2 viral genotype in index individual to related SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           genotype infection in the contact participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) infection in individuals that are weeks to&#xD;
           months past their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these combined household data, effective, modifiable cofactors for household&#xD;
      transmission can be identified to inform future post-exposure interventions. With the&#xD;
      inclusion of data related to viral and host exposure cofactors, the investigators can&#xD;
      increase the precision of predictive models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, adjusted for exposure&#xD;
      and mitigation strategies. Data collected on PASC will contribute to the characterization of&#xD;
      the long term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome.&#xD;
