  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a life-threatening emergency for which provider-to-provider telemedicine has been&#xD;
      used to improve quality of care. The objective of this study is to measure the impact of&#xD;
      rural tele-emergency consultation on long-term health care costs and outcomes through&#xD;
      decreasing organ failure, hospital length-of-stay, and readmissions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is responsible for over 1.7 million hospitalizations at a cost of $26 billion&#xD;
      annually, making it the most expensive acute care condition in US hospitals. High-quality&#xD;
      early sepsis care has been associated with decreased organ failure, shorter ICU and hospital&#xD;
      length-of-stay, and improved survival. Rural sepsis patients are more likely to be&#xD;
      transferred to tertiary centers, and they also have higher mortality and health care costs.&#xD;
      ED-based telemedicine (tele-ED) consultation between a rural provider and a board-certified&#xD;
      emergency physician may deliver the expertise to reduce care delays and improve outcomes&#xD;
      while avoiding unnecessary costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, the study team partnered with Avera eCARE, the largest tele-ED provider in North&#xD;
      America, to implement a standard telemedicine-based sepsis care pathway. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      investigators showed (using patient-level primary data collection across several networks)&#xD;
      that tele-ED use was associated with improved adherence with international sepsis guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its association with short-term clinical outcomes, however, the study team&#xD;
      hypothesize that telemedicine may also decrease costs. The investigators have shown that&#xD;
      high-quality sepsis care is associated with decreased readmissions and post-discharge&#xD;
      mortality. High quality care may also prevent organ failure, avoid ICU admissions, reduce&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use, decrease ICU and hospital length-of-stay, and&#xD;
      decrease post-discharge care-primarily through reducing avoidable organ failure. All of these&#xD;
      factors are likely to have a significant effect in terms of reducing healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed project is to measure the effect of tele-ED consultation at&#xD;
      reducing healthcare costs and long-term outcomes in sepsis patients in rural EDs. The&#xD;
      following primary hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total healthcare expenses and 90-day mortality will be lower in patients treated in a&#xD;
           tele-ED hospital, with the effect primarily through reduced hospital length-of-stay and&#xD;
           fewer readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total expenses and mortality will be lower in cases where tele-ED is used vs. matched&#xD;
           controls in non-tele-ED hospitals.&#xD;

        Age-qualifying Medicare beneficiaries with at least one ED admission for sepsis in a cohort&#xD;
        of rural hospitals in the Avera service area between 2017-2019. Hospitals will be&#xD;
        stratified as tele-ED capable and a set of 2:1 matched control hospitals in the same&#xD;
        regions where tele-ED is not available. Sepsis cases will be identified according to the&#xD;
        International (ICD-10), with a discharge diagnosis of [(infection plus organ failure) or&#xD;
        explicit sepsis diagnosis], plus an ED diagnosis of infection, as we have done previously.&#xD;
