      Evaluate the implementation of a standardized mobile resuscitation model to manage SWOT&#xD;
      within a large acute care hospital setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immediately upon identification of SWOT, the SWOT Team will be activated by clinicians to&#xD;
      respond to the patient bedside. Clinicians on-site will initiate patient care as directed by&#xD;
      hospital protocol. Upon arrival, the SWOT Team will take over the management of patient care.&#xD;
      The team will include 1-2 intensivists and multiple clinicians with clearly defined roles,&#xD;
      dependent upon clinical presentation. The mobile resuscitative platform equipped with&#xD;
      critical care technology will be delivered to the bedside (refer to appendix for full&#xD;
      equipment content).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SWOT Team will implement goal-directed therapy using real-time monitoring and advanced&#xD;
      diagnostic point-of-care tools. ultrasound, arterial and central lines will be placed by the&#xD;
      intensivist(s) to monitor the physiology of the patient during treatment in real-time. Other&#xD;
      team members (RNs, Respiratory Therapist's, residents, anesthesiologists, and technicians)&#xD;
      will place the patient on continuous ECG and SPO2 monitoring, continuous capnographic&#xD;
      monitoring via nasal canula or Endotracheal tube, and continuous cerebral and regional NIRS&#xD;
      monitors. Point-of-care laboratory values will also be measured. Resuscitative interventions&#xD;
      will be performed as directed by team leader to target the following physiological target&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SpO2 &gt; 85%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PaO2 &gt; 50 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRS &gt; 65%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lactate normal or trending down&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EtCO2 &gt;20 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean Arterial Pressure &gt; 65 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SVO2 &gt; 60%&#xD;
