  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients post acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a high risk of mortality but the use of&#xD;
      an implantable defibrillator in the early aftermath of an AMI has not been shown to improve&#xD;
      patients' survival. The VEST trial recently demonstrated an improved overall survival in post&#xD;
      AMI patients with the use of a wearable defibrillator. The same improvement was not&#xD;
      demonstrated for the risk of sudden cardiac death. Monitoring patients after AMI using an&#xD;
      implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) may document findings that can impact patient management&#xD;
      and eventually improve their outcomes. We are therefore conducting the AID MI trial to&#xD;
      examine the impact of ICM on patient management in the post AMI setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who have ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation at least 48 hours after an acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (AMI) have a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, patients with left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% should wait at least 40 days post-AMI or 90 days post&#xD;
      revascularization prior to receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This&#xD;
      period of time potentially leaves a vulnerable population without protection from sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landmark MADIT I and MADIT II trials demonstrated that ICD therapy was associated with&#xD;
      significantly improved survival in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy at any interval of&#xD;
      time. The DINAMIT study demonstrated that ICD placement less than 40 days after AMI had a&#xD;
      reduction in arrhythmic mortality at the cost of an increase in non-arrhythmic mortality.&#xD;
      Results from these and other studies suggest that the risk of SCD after AMI may be&#xD;
      time-dependent and that patients at increased risk for SCD are also at increased risk for&#xD;
      death from other causes. Thus, there is a need for additional studies to identify subsets of&#xD;
      patients with arrhythmias that may benefit from other therapeutic interventions such as&#xD;
      ablations, anti-arrhythmic medications, implantable cardiac devices, or other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CARISMA study was the first study to document the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in&#xD;
      post-AMI patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF≤40%) using an implantable loop&#xD;
      recorder. Results showed high incidences of arrhythmias such as new-onset AF (27.6%) and&#xD;
      high-degree AV block (9.8%). Subsequent studies showed that these arrhythmias were associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart failure, ventricular&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias, stroke, reinfarction, or cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that utilizing remote monitoring as part of clinical care in patients with&#xD;
      cardiac implantable electronic devices is associated with improved all-cause survival; the&#xD;
      magnitude of survival increases with the degree of adherence to remote monitoring and the&#xD;
      timeliness to enroll and activate in remote monitoring shortly after device implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies suggest the need for further investigation and evaluation of acute and&#xD;
      long-term cardiac monitoring in post-AMI patients, in an effort to identify patients at&#xD;
      greatest risk, inform clinical decision making and potentially reduce the risk of all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. In addition, the ability to remotely monitor patients may minimize the time to&#xD;
      diagnosis and enable early intervention in this patient population.&#xD;
