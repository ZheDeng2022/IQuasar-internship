  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy for patients with hematopoietic malignancies. However, the therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits and wider application of allo-HSCT are limited by acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (aGVHD), the latter remains a major obstacle against long-term survival for this population.&#xD;
      New aGVHD prophylactic and therapeutic strategies that are superior in efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, and less technically demanding are still in desperate need. Hyperbaric&#xD;
      oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been confirmed as an effective and economical therapeutic modality&#xD;
      for hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) whether induced by infection or acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (aGVHD) for transplant recipients. However, little is known about its involvement in aGVHD.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators designed a randomized, controlled, and open clinical trial&#xD;
      to confirm the safety and efficacy of HBOT on aGVHD in patient underwent allo-HSCT.&#xD;

      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy for patients with hematopoietic malignancies. However, the therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits and wider application of allo-HSCT are limited by acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (aGVHD), the latter remains a major obstacle against long-term survival for this population.&#xD;
      New aGVHD prophylactic and therapeutic strategies that are superior in efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, and less technically demanding are still in desperate need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a variety of immune and non-immune cells are involved in the development of aGVHD,&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been proved as the primary triggers of the inflammatory&#xD;
      response and play a key role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD. Therefore, strategies targeting&#xD;
      ROS production are crucial for effectively managing aGVHD. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)&#xD;
      is a well-established treatment method, which is used to improve non-healing ulcers secondary&#xD;
      to aGVHD and hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) after allo-HSCT whether induced by infection or aGVHD.&#xD;
      Even the exact mechanism is not fully understood, HBOT was demonstrated to reduce a series of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines release and can improve the action of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to initiate a randomized, controlled, and open clinical&#xD;
      cohort study confirm the safety and efficacy of HBOT on aGVHD in patient underwent allo-HSCT.&#xD;
