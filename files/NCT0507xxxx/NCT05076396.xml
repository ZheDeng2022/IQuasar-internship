  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the treatment of solid tumors in general, advanced (metastatic)&#xD;
      disease remains mostly incurable and there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic&#xD;
      options for these patients, particularly investigational drugs with novel mechanisms of&#xD;
      action. The investigation of new combination regimens of non-crossresistant agents with&#xD;
      acceptable-and not completely overlapping-toxicities has been a major way to improve response&#xD;
      rate and outcome of patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      First-in-human, open-label, dose-finding, phase I trial, using a classical 3+3 design&#xD;
      followed by a continual reassessment method (CRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included in cohorts of a minimum of three or six patients to receive PM14 at&#xD;
      successively increasing dose levels, starting at 0.25 mg/m^2 for the Days 1 and 8 schedule.&#xD;
      For the Day 1 schedule, the starting dose will be 4.5 mg/m^2. Dose escalation will proceed&#xD;
      only after all the patients fully evaluable for DLT included at one dose level have completed&#xD;
      the first cycle (i.e., three weeks). Once the RD has been determined, expansion cohorts will&#xD;
      be included to have a minimum of 20 fully evaluable patients per indication (tumor type)&#xD;
      treated in the Expansion phase (regardless of the schedule administered), and thus have an&#xD;
      adequate number of patients to assess safety. The indications of these patients will be&#xD;
      chosen depending on the efficacy data obtained during dose escalation. Patients treated at&#xD;
      the expansion cohorts will be evaluable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST v.1.1) and/or by serum markers only in patients with prostate cancer (prostate&#xD;
      specific-antigen [PSA]) or ovarian cancer (carbohydrate antigen-125 [CA-125]) according to&#xD;
      the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group Recommendations (PSAWGR) and the Gynecologic&#xD;
      Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) specific criteria, respectively.&#xD;
