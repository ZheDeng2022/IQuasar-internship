  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current clinical study is to evaluate, for the first time in humans (FTIH),&#xD;
      the safety and immunogenicity of the altSonflex1-2-3 candidate vaccine against S. sonnei and&#xD;
      S. flexneri serotypes 1b, 2a, and 3a. The vaccine will be first administered in adults 18 to&#xD;
      50 years of age in Europe. Subsequently, the vaccine will be administered to a&#xD;
      shigellosis-endemic population in Africa, first in adults 18 to 50 years of age, then in&#xD;
      children 24 to 59 months of age, and finally in infants 9 months of age. Infants will also&#xD;
      receive a third vaccination. Three different doses of the vaccine [low (Dose A), medium (Dose&#xD;
      B), and high (Dose C) amounts of antigen] will be evaluated using an age de-escalation&#xD;
      approach (from least vulnerable adult population to most vulnerable paediatric population).&#xD;
      The results of this study will allow the selection of the most appropriate dose for further&#xD;
      vaccine development in infants 9 months of age, which is the main target age group for this&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
