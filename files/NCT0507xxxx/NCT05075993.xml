    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated industry-supported phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the&#xD;
      phase 1 clinic at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who will hold the&#xD;
      Investigational New Drug (IND). Lvygen Biopharma will provide as investigational supply&#xD;
      LVGN3616, LVGN6051 and LVGN7409 at no cost to the patients on this study. This study will&#xD;
      explore antitumor activity of four LVGN3616 and LVGN6051 based regimens in seven selected&#xD;
      tumor types:&#xD;
