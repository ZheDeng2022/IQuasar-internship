  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive care program for their return to&#xD;
      normal life and community among lung cancer survivors and evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients scheduled for curative surgery will be enrolled in this study. The&#xD;
      comprehensive care program will be developed, and provided to the intervention group before&#xD;
      and after surgery. Outcomes will be assessed 6 months and 1 year after surgery. To evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the program, a control group will be enrolled first and used as a&#xD;
      comparator.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental adjustment to cancer at 6 months after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer (Mini-MAC) scale, a short form instrument derived from the MAC and designed to measure coping with cancer. The scale consists of 29 items and 5 sub-dimensions as follows: Fighting spirit, helplessness/hopelessness, anxious preoccupation, fatalism and cognitive avoidance. The mini-MAC is a Likert type scale with four response options: (1) definitely does not apply to me (2) does not apply to me (3) applies to me (4) definitely applies to me.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life is assessed by the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire core30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The scale for quality of life is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, derived by 4-point Likert scale. Higher scores represent a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung cancer specific symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The symptoms are assessed by the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire lung cancer module 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The scale for symptom is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, derived by 4-point Likert scale. Higher scores mean a more burden of disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea (mMRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea is measured by the modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC). The mMRC scales grade 0 to grade 4, based on the severity of dyspnea.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea is also measured by COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Range of CAT scores from 0-40. Higher scores denote a more severe impact of COPD on a patient's life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unmet Needs</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Unmet needs are assessed by the Cancer Survivors' Unmet Needs (CaSUN). There are 5 domains; existential survivorship (14-item), Comprehensive Cancer Care (6-item), Information (3-item), Quality of Life (2-item), Relationships (3-item). It assesses the unmet needs and strength of needs. In this study, only the information domain is investigated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression are assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a 14-item instrument that reflects two dimensions; depression (seven items) and anxiety (seven items). Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, with a maximum of 21 for anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline) and 1, 6, 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity is assessed by International Physical Activity Questionnaire-7 (IPAQ-7). This questionnaire measures duration (minutes) and frequency (days) of physical activity in the last 7 days.</description>
