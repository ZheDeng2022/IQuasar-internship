  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced pelvic malignancy undergo radical procedures, necessitate&#xD;
      organ reconstruction. Little is known about the preferred methods of gynaecological organ&#xD;
      reconstruction in the context of pelvic exenteration. This review aims to identify which&#xD;
      methods are commonly used and what outcomes are associated with each technique in order to&#xD;
      further guide future practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mainstay of treatment for patients with locally advanced pelvic malignancy is radical&#xD;
      surgical excision combined, with (neo)adjuvant chemoradiotherapy where appropriate. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to obtain a negative resection margin (R0) in order to achieve long-term&#xD;
      survival. Centralisation of care and refinements in surgical technique have enabled surgeons&#xD;
      specializing in advanced pelvic oncology to embark upon more aggressive approaches to&#xD;
      accomplishing an R0 resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With improved oncological outcomes has come an increased focus on quality-of-life (QoL),&#xD;
      functional sequelae and patient experience and survivorship. Adequate experience and&#xD;
      proficiency with reconstructive techniques has become one of the key components for surgeons&#xD;
      practicing in pelvic oncology. Reconstructive procedures should be undertaken with the goals&#xD;
      of improving wound healing, reducing morbidity and restoring anatomic form and function.&#xD;
      These factors are of utmost importance in the context of pelvic exenteration, where wound&#xD;
      complications are prevalent as a result of a larger pelvic dead space and the potential for&#xD;
      contamination. Adverse impact on sexual function following pelvic surgery is also common&#xD;
      where the autonomic nerves are involved. This is further compounded by the need to resect&#xD;
      part or all of the vulvovaginar complex as part of an extirpative procedure, with resultant&#xD;
      declines in QoL and overall psychosexual wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of methods have been proposed for reconstruction of the pelvic floor and&#xD;
      vulva/vagina in females, including skin grafting, skin flaps, fasciocutaneous and&#xD;
      myocutaneous flaps, as well as the formation of a neovagina in specific circumstances.&#xD;
      Thereis a paucity of data with regard to the optimal approach to gynaecological organ&#xD;
      reconstruction, with the majority of the literature referring to single-centre, retrospective&#xD;
      series. This review sought to assess the preferred methods for gynaecological reconstruction&#xD;
      at an international level, the clinical and technical particulars leading to the choice of&#xD;
      each method and the short-term outcomes associated with each technique.&#xD;
