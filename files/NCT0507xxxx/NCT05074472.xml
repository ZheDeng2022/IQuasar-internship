    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, dose escalation study with&#xD;
      expansion at the RP2D, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      ZB131 in patients with solid tumors where prevalence of CSP expression is high. Approximately&#xD;
      12 to 24 patients will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Stage; the total number of patients&#xD;
      will depend on the dose level at which the RP2D is defined. Patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria during Screening will enter the treatment period. ZB131 will be given via IV every&#xD;
      week. Patients will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occur.&#xD;

      ZB131 in patients with solid tumors where prevalence of CSP expression is high. Approximately&#xD;

      week. Patients will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D has been established, the Dose Expansion stage will begin to enroll subjects by&#xD;
      cohort. For each expansion cohort, subjects will be enrolled in two stages. The first stage&#xD;
      includes an evaluation of 12 patients. If 1 or more of 12 patients have a CR or PR, then&#xD;
      accrual will continue until a total of 37 patients with measurable disease have been&#xD;
      enrolled. Additional patients may be added to ensure 37 subjects with measurable disease are&#xD;
      available for evaluation&#xD;
