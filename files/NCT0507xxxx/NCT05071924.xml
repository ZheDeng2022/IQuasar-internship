  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the implementation and effectiveness of the original version of&#xD;
      PLH Teens delivered in-person (PLH Teens-Original) and a hybrid in-person and remote delivery&#xD;
      of the programme (PLH Teens-Hybrid) as part of the Mothers2Mothers' (M2M) Children and&#xD;
      Adolescents are My Priority (CHAMP) project in Mpumalanga, South Africa. It will also examine&#xD;
      differential effects between PLH Teens-Original and PLH Teens-Hybrid on reducing risks of&#xD;
      violence against children using propensity score matching. Lastly, it will examine the&#xD;
      implementation feasibility of PLH Teens-Hybrid in terms of implementation fidelity;&#xD;
      recruitment, retention, and engagement of parents and adolescents; and the relevance,&#xD;
      acceptability, and satisfaction of the programme.&#xD;

      Study Design This study will use a mixed-methods approach to qualitatively and quantitatively&#xD;
      address the research aims. It will be implemented from May to July 2021 in the Mpumalanga&#xD;
      province of South Africa. The study design will involve a) pre-post quantitative analyses of&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes for both PLH Teens-Original and PLH Teens-Hybrid, b)&#xD;
      difference in analyses to compare effects between the two delivery modalities, and c)&#xD;
      qualitative interviews and quantitative analyses of programme feasibility and implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Recruitment of parents/caregivers and adolescents will be integrated into CHAMP's&#xD;
      current recruitment strategy which includes engaging with schools, faith-based organisations,&#xD;
      local NGOs, health facilities, United States Agency for International Development (USAID)&#xD;
      DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) partners,&#xD;
      door-to-door engagement and other contextually relevant approaches. CHAMP leverages its&#xD;
      partnerships for recruitment and the CHAMP partner, Grassroots Soccer, actively engages in&#xD;
      recruitment for the DREAMS programme. Participants enrolled into the hybrid PLH programme&#xD;
      will be screened using the USAID approved Vulnerability Assessment Tool to ensure that the&#xD;
      most vulnerable households are reached. The pilot will target caregivers in the Nelspruit&#xD;
      area to ensure adequate access to internet connectivity.&#xD;

    <measure>Child Maltreatment: ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tools-Trial Version - Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline and Post (approx. 4 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Child maltreatment will be assessed using a shortened version of the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tools-Trial Version (9-item subscale ICAST-T). Parent respondents will be asked to indicate the frequency of emotional and physical discipline practices over the past month using a 9-point frequency count scale (0 = never; 8 = 8 or more times). Items include, &quot;In the past 4 weeks, how often did you/your caregiver discipline your child/you by spanking, slapping or hitting with a hand?&quot; and &quot;In the past 4 weeks, how often did you/your caregiver shout, yell or scream at you?&quot; In the past 4 weeks, how often did you/your caregiver discipline your child/you with an object like a stick or a belt?&quot;. Items are summed, with higher scores indicating greater use of harsh parenting.</description>

    <measure>Risk Avoidance: Risk Avoidance Planning Scale - Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline and Post (approx. 4 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Risk Avoidance will be assessed using parent-report of the Risk Avoidance Planning Scale (5-item RAPS; Cluver et al., 2018). Caregivers will be asked whether they have spoken to their child about risks in the community including topics such as safe sex and community safety. This scale was developed specifically for the PLH for Teens programme in South Africa (Cluver et al., 2018). Caregivers will be asked to respond on a 3-point Likert-like scale as to whether they have spoken to their child about risks in the community (1 = No, I find it too hard to talk about this; 2 = We haven't made plans yet but I would like to talk about it; 3 = We have made a plan together). Topics will include safe sex and community safety.</description>

    <description>Economic Strengthening will be measured using a Family Financial Coping Scale (5-item FFCS; Lown, 2011). Caregivers will be asked to respond to household demographic items over the past month. These items cover a variety of financial matters including whether caregivers were worried about money, whether they managed to save money, and whether they ran out of money to buy certain items, including food, transport, and mobile data or airtime. Responses are coded on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = Never, 1 = Rarely, 2 = Sometimes, 3= Often). Items are summed, with a higher score reflected a greater number of financial challenges.</description>

    <measure>Demographics: Demographic Survey - Parent Report</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Basic demographic information will be collected at baseline and post-test for caregivers. Demographic information will include; age, gender, literacy, family structure and dynamics, and risk behaviours. During screening family risk will also be assessed using a Vulnerability assessment tool as a proxy assessment of vulnerability to understand the socio-economic needs of respondents (USAID, 2012). There are six questions that will be asked to respondents which are drawn from the topic of child protection, access to education, nutrition status, child's care and support, child social behaviour, and access to health. Each question will either be in a form of Likert or multiple choice question and have a maximum score of 4. Higher total score indicates lower vulnerability.</description>
