  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Licensed early learning and childcare centres (ELCCs) can provide children with rich&#xD;
      opportunities for outdoor play that they may not otherwise experience in their home or&#xD;
      community. However, many ELCCs struggle to provide high quality and stimulating outdoor play&#xD;
      time. The primary aim of our study is to develop, implement and test a comprehensive&#xD;
      multi-component intervention, the PROmoting Early Childhood Outside (PRO-ECO), to build&#xD;
      capacity for, and address the complexities of building support for outdoor play in early&#xD;
      childcare centre settings. This is to ultimately increase children's access to engaging&#xD;
      outdoor spaces for play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching goal is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive multi-component intervention,&#xD;
      called the PROmoting Early Childhood Outside (PRO-ECO). This intervention is to maximize&#xD;
      children's time spent in quality outdoor play in Canadian ELCC settings. The PRO-ECO&#xD;
      integrates development of policies and procedure, early childhood educator (ECE) training and&#xD;
      mentorship, outdoor space modifications and, parent/caregiver engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRO-ECO intervention will be co-developed, implemented and evaluated in partnership with&#xD;
      the YMCA of Greater Vancouver (YMCAGV). A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and how it can be modified to tackle barriers&#xD;
      in diverse settings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria is divided into three distinct sets of levels-&#xD;
      1) organization level, 2) adult individual participation, and 3) child participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Organization level Inclusion criteria of the ECECs include approving participation in&#xD;
           this study. Following this, sites will be selected based on geographic area and&#xD;
           demographics of neighbourhood served, physical characteristics of the ELCC outdoor space&#xD;
           (e.g., size, at grade or not), readiness of program (as assessed by YMCA senior staff),&#xD;
           and time spent participating in outdoor play. These variables will be measured based on&#xD;
           a pretrial inventory and infrastructure survey, and census subdivision. ECECs that do&#xD;
           not meet the inclusion characteristics based on these measurements may be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adult individual participation Inclusion criteria for adult participants include being&#xD;
           ECEs or staff (administrators, directors, and supervisors) at the participating YMCAGV&#xD;
           ECECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Child individual participation Inclusion criteria for child participation includes being&#xD;
           between the ages of 3-5 years, currently enrolled in one of the participating YMCAGV&#xD;
           ECECs, and obtaining parental consent for their participation in the study. Children&#xD;
           will be excluded from the measurement portion of the study if their parent does not&#xD;
           provide informed consent, however, all children attending the program will be exposed to&#xD;
           the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will include children aged 3-5 years at 8 selected YMCAGV sites as per&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. This also includes the engagement of ECEs, supervisors, and managers.&#xD;
      Parents of children will also be invited to participate in focus groups, consent provision,&#xD;
      and information sharing. ECECs will appoint a staff research lead to work closely with the&#xD;
      research team on all phases of the project. Recruitment of children and parents will occur&#xD;
      through the staff research lead at each ECEC. Letters and/or emails home and face-to-face&#xD;
      conversations will promote recruitment. The research team will be actively involved with&#xD;
      staff at each site to ensure they are provided information and direction on participant&#xD;
      recruitment policies and procedures. The staff research lead at each ECEC will administer&#xD;
      consent forms to families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will inform parents/caregivers of children enrolled in the participating YMCAGV ELCCs&#xD;
      about our study in various ways within the YMCAGV organization. This includes via online&#xD;
      communications and info sessions. Adult participants for the qualitative focus group be&#xD;
      recruited internally through the YYMCAGV. When contacted by prospective participants&#xD;
      including ECEs and staff, we will provide details of the study through phone or via email. On&#xD;
      the interview day, the consent and the overall interview procedure will be further explained&#xD;
      to participants. The focus groups will be conducted through Zoom. Once procedures are&#xD;
      explained and consent reviewed, we will invite participants to sign the consent forms and&#xD;
      complete the demographic survey, and email scanned copies to the UBC research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, child participation in outdoor free play by identifying the&#xD;
      prevalence of play will be assessed utilizing observational behaviour mapping methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct observational behaviour mapping, two research staff will be on site at each of the&#xD;
      8 ECECs to collect pre-determined data related to play behaviour during outdoor free play.&#xD;
      Behaviour mapping assessments will be performed through scanning identified quadrants&#xD;
      throughout the outdoor play space. Simultaneous to the in-situ coding, the research staff&#xD;
      will be taking video recordings of the quadrants they are observing. Videos will be coded at&#xD;
      15-second intervals for play type, including functional play, play with rules, imaginative&#xD;
      play, constructive play, exploratory play, restorative play, and non-play. Time spent in&#xD;
      outdoor play will consist of adding up all time in any type of play, aside from non-play. We&#xD;
      will compare time spent in play versus non-play at baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's play behavior when participating in outdoor play is a secondary outcome, and will&#xD;
      be coded in situ and via review of the videos. We will compare the diversity of types of play&#xD;
      occurring at baseline and follow-up by assessing the various play types, including physical&#xD;
      play, expressive play, play with rules, imaginative play, exploratory play, restorative play,&#xD;
      bio play, digital play and non-play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECEs' attitudes toward outdoor risky play is a secondary outcome, and will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Teacher Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale (T-TRiPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of outdoor spaces will be the last secondary outcome. The Seven Cs audit tool&#xD;
      will form the basis for the assessment of quality of outdoor space at all early childhood&#xD;
      education centre sites, guide development of the plan for modification of the outdoor&#xD;
      environment, and to reassess at intervention early childhood education centre sites after&#xD;
      implementation of the PRO-ECO intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures described above will be followed to collect post-intervention data. In&#xD;
      addition to data collected in Phase 3, we will also collect ECEs and staff's acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and economic analysis of the PRO-ECO intervention. This will be done utilizing a&#xD;
      combination of focus group discussion and administrative data.&#xD;

    <description>To assess children's participation in outdoor free play at ECECs, an observational behavior mapping (OBM) methodology will be used. OBM involves understanding how an environment supports movement through mapping, recording, and analyzing geographically located data.&#xD;
OBM involves trained research assistants taking observations at the 8 participating YMCA sites as children participate in designated outdoor playtime. OBM assessments will be performed by scanning designated observational zones throughout the outdoor play space. The observational data will be collected based on the 'space' of the ECEC, not by individual child. If there is no child in an observational zone, there will be no data collected at that point. Within each observational zone, children's play activities will be coded in 15-second increments.&#xD;
For the primary outcome measure, the categories being collected are 'play' (child observed for that data point is engaged in play) and 'non-play' (child is not playing).</description>

    <description>In addition to assessing time spent participating in outdoor free play, further detail on the type of play behaviour and movement is important to understanding children's outdoor free play in ECEC settings. OBM as described above will be used to assess the diversity of outdoor free play through 'play type'. Play types to be coded include physical play, expressive play, play with rules, imaginative play, exploratory play, restorative play, bio play, digital play and non-play.</description>
