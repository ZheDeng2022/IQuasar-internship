      This study evaluates what influences treatment decision-making in African American women with&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer. The study also aims to learn about the influence of&#xD;
      information sources that support this decision-making process.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the acceptance of treatment recommendations by African American women diagnosed&#xD;
      with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the association of beliefs about chemotherapy, self-efficacy, and cancer-specific&#xD;
      psychological distress with intention to follow through with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the association of intention, Reliance on Formal or Informal Resources, and&#xD;
      decisional conflict as predictors of final treatment decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the association of Reliance on Formal or Informal Resources as a moderator of&#xD;
      the relationship between intention and final treatment decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in a standard of care treatment planning meeting over 3 hours with&#xD;
      members of the multidisciplinary treatment team including, the oncologist, radiologist,&#xD;
      oncology surgeon, and social worker. Patients then complete surveys over 20 minutes and&#xD;
      within 30 days later. Some patients may participate in interviews over 30 minutes.&#xD;
