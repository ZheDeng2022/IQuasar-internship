  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature has shown evidence of the effectiveness of prehabilitation programs on&#xD;
      post-operative recovery for musculoskeletal conditions; however, evidence for prehabilitation&#xD;
      for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is limited. Investigators have found that there is very low&#xD;
      to low quality evidence for the effect of prehabilitation interventions for improving&#xD;
      outcomes following lumbar spine surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of a prehabilitation program for patients undergoing LSS surgery,&#xD;
      and pilot test the protocol to provide the foundation for future design of a larger,&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the most common degenerative condition among older adults,&#xD;
      and the leading reason older adults aged 65 and older undergo surgery. LSS is characterized&#xD;
      by degenerative changes that lead to loss of intervertebral disc spaces, joint thickening,&#xD;
      and enfolding of the ligaments surrounding the spine. These degenerative changes may cause&#xD;
      compression of lumbosacral nerve roots resulting in the narrowing of central and vertebral&#xD;
      canals known as neurogenic claudication (NC). The symptoms of NC include cramping, numbness&#xD;
      or tingling, and muscle weakness in the lower back, buttocks, or one or both legs, with&#xD;
      symptoms often intensifying with standing and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of individuals undergoing surgery for LSS are post-retirement age, have chronic&#xD;
      low back pain, without access to private rehabilitation. This population is often severely&#xD;
      deconditioned prior to surgery with weakness and atrophy of the muscles in the back, core,&#xD;
      and lower limb. These preoperative factors have been shown to be predictors for postoperative&#xD;
      LSS outcomes. Studies have shown evidence of the effectiveness of prehabilitation programs on&#xD;
      post-operative recovery for other musculoskeletal conditions such as total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
      However, there appears to be a lack of high-quality evidence for the effect of&#xD;
      prehabilitation interventions in improving outcomes for LSS surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of the program of care on a group&#xD;
      of patients with LSS undergoing surgery, and determine the feasibility of the protocol for a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed methods study will include a two-armed, pilot RCT evaluating an 8-week virtual&#xD;
      prehabilitation program for participants undergoing LSS surgery, with a longitudinal&#xD;
      qualitative study conducted parallel to the pilot RCT. The two groups in the RCT study will&#xD;
      be: 1) prehabilitation, and 2) usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 60 participants recruited from participating spine surgeons in 3 Canadian&#xD;
      cities - Hamilton, Edmonton, and Calgary. Participants will be included if 1) they are a&#xD;
      minimum 20 weeks prior to their date of surgery, 2) older than 55 years of age, 3) are&#xD;
      scheduled for first spine surgery , and 4) are English-speaking. Participants will be&#xD;
      excluded if 1) they have a known or suspected pathology (e.g., cancer, cauda equina&#xD;
      syndrome), 2) are unable to engage in exercise due to other comorbidities or cognitive&#xD;
      issues, and 3) if they do not have access to the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8-week prehabilitation program will be delivered online using synchronous and&#xD;
      asynchronous sessions delivered by either a physiotherapist, chiropractor or kinesiologist,&#xD;
      with a booster session at 6-weeks post-op. There will be 4 individual exercises sessions&#xD;
      (week 1, 2, 4 and 8) delivered synchronously using Zoom or Physitrack in which motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and graded activity exercises will be conducted. Participants will also be asked&#xD;
      to exercise at least 3 times a week using the asynchronous exercise videos. Participants will&#xD;
      receive short online educational videos (3-5 minutes). Educational sessions will include&#xD;
      information regarding the importance of exercise, pain education, self-management, exercising&#xD;
      despite pain, post-operative expectations, and information regarding their upcoming surgery.&#xD;
      The educational sessions will also include two online peer-support groups when they can&#xD;
      interact with a patient with a history of LSS surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive usual care for LSS surgery, which will consist&#xD;
      of one session with an anesthesiologist, a nurse and access to our online educational videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be evaluated at: baseline (~20 weeks before LSS surgery), immediately after the&#xD;
      intervention (8-weeks), 3 and 12 months post-operatively. Feasibility outcomes are: 1)&#xD;
      recruitment rate; 2) patient adherence to the program and attrition rates; 3) acceptability&#xD;
      of program content; and 4); acceptability of study procedures and completion of study&#xD;
      questionnaires. Patient reported outcomes will be used to inform feasibility, study burden&#xD;
      and sample size calculations. These outcomes include: pain and disability, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, psychological measures, and monitoring variables. Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Assessments using activity monitors will be used to evaluate walking ability and daily pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Methods A longitudinal qualitative study will be conducted parallel to the pilot&#xD;
      RCT. We will use purposive sampling to conduct in-depth semi structured interviews at&#xD;
      baseline (~20 weeks before LSS surgery), 8-weeks after the intervention, 3 months, and 12&#xD;
      months post-operatively. For the qualitative study, we will aim to recruit 12-15 participants&#xD;
      or until saturation is met. The longitudinal qualitative study will assess the barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators that influence engagement in prehabilitation, as well as the changes in pain and&#xD;
      health that occur over time and how these are related to the program, personal (e.g., sex and&#xD;
      gender, age, comorbid health, pain profile) or contextual factors (psychosocial,&#xD;
      environmental, health systems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be conducted using STATA 15. Descriptive statistics will be used to report&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes, as well as to identify trends in patient-reported outcomes. Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will be analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) informed by&#xD;
      the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies. Inductive thematic analysis will&#xD;
      be used to analyze the data and report the study findings.&#xD;
