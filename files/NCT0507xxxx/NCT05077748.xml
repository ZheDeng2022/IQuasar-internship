    <textblock>
      Our research team has established a polysomnography (PSG) quantified population-based&#xD;
      paediatric sleep cohort in 2003 for a childhood OSA prevalence study. Subjects were recruited&#xD;
      from 13 randomly selected primary schools. All subjects from this original cohort will be&#xD;
      invited to join this 18-year follow-up study to repeat the following data collection:&#xD;
      questionnaires, anthropometric measurement, sleep study, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      (ABP) measurement, echocardiography and neurocognitive assessment.&#xD;

      Our research team has established a polysomnography (PSG) quantified population-based&#xD;
      paediatric sleep cohort in 2003 for a childhood OSA prevalence study. Subjects were recruited&#xD;
      from 13 randomly selected primary schools. In each school, two randomly chosen classes from&#xD;
      each grade were invited to participate. In the first phase, all parents of children in the&#xD;
      randomly selected schools were invited to attend an education forum during which full&#xD;
      explanation of the purpose and flow of the study was given. An envelope containing a&#xD;
      validated parent proxy OSAS screening questionnaire and consent was then distributed to&#xD;
      parents within a week after the forum. From our previous research, a composite symptom score&#xD;
      (summation of the scores of these three questions) of 7 or more has 75.4% sensitivity and&#xD;
      80.5% specificity, compared with polysomnography, to detect OSAS among children aged 5-15&#xD;
      years who had attended our paediatric clinics. Children with a composite symptom score of&#xD;
      less than 7 were assigned a computer-generated random number and were invited as a control&#xD;
      group with a ratio of 1:2 in the second phase. All children belonging to the high risk of&#xD;
      OSAS group and the randomly selected subjects at low risk of OSAS were invited to participate&#xD;
      the baseline epidemiological study. In total 619 children aged 5-13 years underwent detailed&#xD;
      assessments including anthropometric measurements, airway examination, ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure recording and overnight PSG. 67 children had moderate-to-severe OSA (obstructive&#xD;
      apnoea hypopnoea index, OAHI ≥5/h), 199 had mild OSA (OAHI 1 to &lt;5/h), 103 were primary&#xD;
      snorers (OAHI &lt;1/h but snore ≥3 nights per week in the past 12 months) and 250 were normal&#xD;
      controls (OAHI &lt;1/h and snore &lt;3 nights per week in the past 12 months).(1) All subjects from&#xD;
      this original cohort will be invited to join this 18-year follow-up study to repeat the&#xD;
      following data collection: questionnaires, anthropometric measurement, sleep study, 24-hour&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurement, echocardiography and neurocognitive assessment.&#xD;

      Fasting blood samples will be taken from participants with venipuncture. The sample will be&#xD;
      sent for biochemical measurements including lipid profile (Total cholesterol, total&#xD;
      glycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and&#xD;
      serum glucose in the University Pathology Service. Plasma will also be collected in EDTA&#xD;
      anticoagulant tubes, pre-processed and frozen at -80 degree Celsius for future analysis.&#xD;
      Because of budget limitation, further blood test analysis is not included in the current&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
