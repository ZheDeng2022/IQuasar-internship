  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins have a protective effect in patients with established heart failure because of their&#xD;
      lipid-lowering and pleiotropic effects. There is no randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      lipophilic versus hydrophilic statins in these patients (head to head comparison). The best&#xD;
      evidence so far is from a meta-analysis in which the authors did an adjusted indirect&#xD;
      comparison between lipophilic statins and rosuvastatin and found that lipophilic statins were&#xD;
      associated with significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality, and hospitalization for worsening heart failure compared to rosuvastatin&#xD;
      (hydrophilic statin) among patients with heart failure. So, the investigators plan to conduct&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on&#xD;
      cardiac function in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HMG CoA reductase inhibitors or Statins have been widely used for primary prevention and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Also, the protective effect&#xD;
      of statins has been observed in patients with established heart failure because of their&#xD;
      lipid-lowering and pleiotropic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various randomized and non-randomized clinical trials have evaluated statins like&#xD;
      Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin, Pitavastatin and reported improved clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction as well as heart failure with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction. Similar benefits on improved cardiac function, reduced&#xD;
      inflammation, and improved mortality have been seen in small randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) with Atorvastatin. The two large RCTs - Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in&#xD;
      Heart Failure (CORONA) and Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza&#xD;
      nell'Insufficienza cardiac (GISSI-HF) - which compared Rosuvastatin versus placebo, failed to&#xD;
      show statistically significant benefits in mortality outcomes in heart failure patients&#xD;
      compared to placebo, although CORONA trial did show a significant reduction in hospital&#xD;
      admissions but not on mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these two large trials only compared one statin i.e rosuvastatin versus placebo;&#xD;
      which is a hydrophilic statin. Statin is not a uniform class of drugs. They differ in their&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects based on lipophilic nature. There is evidence that lipophilic statins&#xD;
      enter cells via passive diffusion and are widely distributed to various tissues including&#xD;
      cardiac tissues where it exerts pleiotropic actions whereas uptake of hydrophilic statins is&#xD;
      via carrier-mediated mechanisms and is restricted to the liver, thus reduced the capacity of&#xD;
      non-lipid effects on extra-hepatic tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no RCT comparing lipophilic statin versus hydrophilic statin (head to&#xD;
      head comparison). The best evidence so far is from a meta-analysis which is an adjusted&#xD;
      indirect comparison between lipophilic statins and rosuvastatin. They found that lipophilic&#xD;
      statins were associated with a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for worsening heart failure compared to&#xD;
      rosuvastatin (hydrophilic statin) among patients with heart failure. So, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of atorvastatin and&#xD;
      rosuvastatin on cardiac function and inflammation in patients with heart failure with reduced&#xD;
      ejection fraction.&#xD;
