  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that a single Intra-articular Injection of TTAX03, 100mg in 2mL of saline,&#xD;
      will have more benefit with respect to the proportion of responders 12 weeks post-injection&#xD;
      than an equal volume of saline, based on the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a Phase 2 randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded parallel&#xD;
      design to be conducted at multiple sites throughout North America. One dose level of TTAX03&#xD;
      (100 mg) will be tested against an equal volume of saline, which is the suspension vehicle&#xD;
      (i.e., excipient). Each subject will receive a single IA injection into the knee under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, with two safety follow-up visits in the first eight days and a third at the end&#xD;
      of two weeks post injection. Subsequent visits will occur at the end of 6 and 12 weeks for&#xD;
      evaluation of response, with the end of 12 weeks being the primary endpoint. Additional&#xD;
      visits will occur at 6, 9 and 12 months (end of weeks 26, 39, 52) to evaluate duration of&#xD;
      benefit and overall impression of change from baseline, as well as safety. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be assessed at 12 weeks post receiving the assigned Intra-articular injection.&#xD;
