  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this open-label, nonrandomized, 2-part Phase 1/1b study is to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of oral TACH101&#xD;
      in a 3 day on/4-day off weekly regimen (3/4 schedule) in participants with advanced and&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors. Each participant in the dose escalation phase will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of TACH101 and be followed for 48 hours in the single-dose lead-in period.&#xD;
