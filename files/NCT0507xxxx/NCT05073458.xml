  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of parsclisib compared with&#xD;
      placebo in participants with Primary Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (wAIHA),&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective participants must have primary wAIHA as well as other protocol-defined criteria.&#xD;
      After participants have been determined to be eligible for the study, they will be randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 treatment groups, with stratification for hemoglobin (Hgb &lt;9 g/dL or ≥ 9 g/dL).&#xD;
      Once a participant has completed the week 24 assessments, the participant will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to crossover to begin receiving parsaclisib in the open-label treatment which&#xD;
      will last up to another 24 weeks in duration.&#xD;
