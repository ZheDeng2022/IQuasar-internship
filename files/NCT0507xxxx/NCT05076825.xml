  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hamstring muscle are more likely to shorten among all biarticular muscles of human body. One&#xD;
      of the many factors of hamstring tightness is increased tension in the neural structure.&#xD;
      Apart from routine stretching techniques, mobilization of nervous system proves to be more&#xD;
      effective. There are lot of stretching techniques available but they are more effective after&#xD;
      multiple sessions. This study aims to cater the problem of hamstring tightness by neural&#xD;
      sliding and static stretching in minimum sessions and compare which technique is more&#xD;
      effective in resolving the issue.&#xD;

      Randomized Controlled Trials was used to collect data. Total patients were selected in two&#xD;
      group with each 31 subjects. Purposive sampling technique was used. Experimental group will&#xD;
      receive routine physical therapy along with TENS, Hot pack and Neurodynamic Stretching. (For&#xD;
      30 seconds, 3 times per session for 3 alternative days a week &amp; duration of 4 weeks). Outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the hamstring tightness value angle in degrees, which will be obtained with&#xD;
      the help of goniometer after performing active knee extension test and active straight leg&#xD;
      raise test&#xD;
