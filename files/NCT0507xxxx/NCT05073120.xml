      This is a multinational, non-interventional, cross-sectional survey conducted among HCPs&#xD;
      based in the EU/EEA who prescribe Piqray. The survey will assess the knowledge of HCPs&#xD;
      prescribing Piqray in relation to the management of hyperglycemia in patients treated with&#xD;
      Piqray. The survey will endeavor to collect a minimum to 30-50 completed surveys.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>assess HCPs' knowledge and understanding of the key information included in the Piqray Prescriber's/HCP Guide for hyperglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint based on the percentages of HCPs with correct responses to all questions included in the composite regarding the below information:&#xD;
Risk of hyperglycemia and its potential risk factors&#xD;
Signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia&#xD;
Recommendations for monitoring for hyperglycemia prior to, and during, treatment with Piqray&#xD;
Recommendations for managing hyperglycemia during treatment with Piqray. Specifically, the primary endpoint is a weighted composite knowledge score aggregated across the following survey questions: 4A, 5A-C, 6, 8A-C, 10, and 12-15. It is calculated as the number of all correctly answered questions divided by the number of all answered questions (i.e. questions that were answered either correct and not correct - unanswered questions are excluded).</description>
