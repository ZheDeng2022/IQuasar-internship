      The purpose of the Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology™ Post Approval&#xD;
      Study (PAS) (&quot;Pipeline™ Shield PAS&quot;) is to collect on-label use data in patients undergoing&#xD;
      treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IA) using the Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device with&#xD;
      Shield Technology™ (&quot;Pipeline™ Shield Device&quot;) in a real-world post approval setting within&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The INSPIRE Pipeline™ Shield Post Approval Study is an observational, prospective,&#xD;
      multi-center, single-arm registry to collect on-label use data in patients undergoing&#xD;
      treatment for intracranial aneurysms using the Pipeline™ Flex Embolization Device with Shield&#xD;
      Technology™ according to the intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the on-label use of the Pipeline™ Shield&#xD;
      Device in patients undergoing treatment for intracranial aneurysms per institutional routine&#xD;
      clinical care in a real-world post approval study setting in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted under the Product Surveillance Registry (NCT01524276) and is a&#xD;
      sub-study to the therapy specific Neurovascular Product Surveillance Registry (NCT02988128).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient or legally authorized representative (LAR) provides authorization and/or&#xD;
             consent per institution and geographical requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is intended to receive or be treated with an eligible Medtronic product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is consented within the enrollment window of the therapy received, as&#xD;
             applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient or patient's legally authorized representative (LAR) has provided written&#xD;
             informed consent using the IRB and Medtronic approved Informed Consent Form and agrees&#xD;
             to comply with the study requirements. HIPAA/data protection authorization has been&#xD;
             provided and signed by the patient (or patient's LAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has already been selected for endovascular treatment of the target aneurysm&#xD;
             with the Pipeline™ Shield Device as the appropriate treatment per the Pipeline™ Shield&#xD;
             Device Instructions For Use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient who is, or is expected to be, inaccessible for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participation is excluded by local law.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is currently enrolled or plans to enroll in a concurrent drug/device study&#xD;
             that may confound the PSR results (i.e. no required intervention that could affect&#xD;
             interpretation of all-around product safety and/or effectiveness).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female patient who is known to be pregnant or is breastfeeding or wishes to become&#xD;
             pregnant during participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is contraindicated for the device or procedure per the Pipeline™ Shield Device&#xD;
             IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The Investigator determined that the health of the patient may be compromised by the&#xD;
             patient's enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is enrolled or planning to participate in a potentially confounding drug or&#xD;
             device trial during the course of this study. Co-enrollment in concurrent trials is&#xD;
             only allowed when documented pre-approval was obtained from Medtronic.&#xD;
