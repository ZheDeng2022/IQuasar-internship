    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Solicited local AEs are used to assess the reactogenicity of the study vaccine and are pre-defined local (injection site) and systemic events for which participants will be specifically questioned and which will be noted by participants in their participant diary for 7 days post vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days). Solicited local AEs are: injection site pain/tenderness, erythema and swelling at the study vaccine injection site.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 days after each vaccination (Day 8 and Day 36)</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited systemic AEs include following events: fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia. Participants will be instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the participant diary on a daily basis for 7 days post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) for these events.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Until 6 Months After the Second Study Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after the second study vaccination (Day 211)</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Event of interest (AESI) Until 6 Months After the Second Study Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after the second study vaccination (Day 211)</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Seroconversion</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after first vaccination (Day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion is defined for each of the 4 influenza vaccine strains at 28 days after the administration of a quadrivalent high-dose seasonal influenza vaccine: 1) HI titer greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1:40 in participants with a pre-vaccination HI titer of less than (&lt;) 1:10, or 2) a &gt;=4-fold HI titer increase in participants with a pre-vaccination HI titer of &gt;=1:10.</description>
