      This Phase 2, open label, study with safety lead in of oral talazoparib in combination with&#xD;
      ZEN003694 given daily in 28-day cycles will enroll patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
      tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.&#xD;

      This study aims to determine how effective the combination of ZEN003694 and talazoparib is&#xD;
      based on how patients respond. ZEN003694 (and developed by Zenith Epigenetics Ltd.) has shown&#xD;
      promising activity in the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic (blood) cancers by&#xD;
      reducing the multiplication of cancer cells. Talazoparib is an extremely effective drug being&#xD;
      developed for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Talazoparib kills cancer cells by&#xD;
      inhibiting and trapping the enzyme PARP, which is known to be involved in the development of&#xD;
      many types of cancers. These two drugs are not FDA approved in the treatment of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
