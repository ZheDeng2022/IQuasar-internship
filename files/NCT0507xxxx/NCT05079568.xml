      After informed consent patients will be randomized to a 4 week treatment program comparing&#xD;
      active VR treatment to sham VR treatment. Symptoms will be measured at baseline and at 2 and&#xD;
      4 weeks using validated questionnaires. A short questionnaire will be answered daily to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in nausea.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients, men and women ages 18-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented gastroparesis (idiopathic or diabetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had an upper endoscopy within the past 3 years not showing evidence&#xD;
             of an organic disorder that could cause symptoms and a 4-hour scintigraphic gastric&#xD;
             emptying scan showing evidence of delayed gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be identified as direct referrals to the general GI clinic or the&#xD;
             motility clinic, and will undergo screening history and physical examination by the PI&#xD;
             or co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose symptoms are thought to represent an organic disorder (e.g., peptic&#xD;
             ulcer disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, a known&#xD;
             malignancy, radiation-induced injury, an active infection, vasculitis, celiac&#xD;
             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patients have known uncontrolled diabetes (HgbA1c &gt; 11), GERD, esophagitis,&#xD;
             eosinophilic esophagitis, H. pylori, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, celiac artery&#xD;
             compression syndrome, or SMA syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior surgery to the esophagus, stomach or duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking opioids will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol and tobacco use will be assessed, as will the presence of psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar&#xD;
             disorders, and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia. However, no&#xD;
             patient will be excluded based on reported substance use or presence of a psychiatric&#xD;
             comorbidity, unless their psychological status represents potential harm to&#xD;
             themselves, others, or represents an impediment to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient identified as having a significant problem with alcohol or anxiety or&#xD;
             depression will be referred back to their primary care provider for further evaluation&#xD;
             and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with motion sickness, vertigo, or a seizure disorder will be excluded to&#xD;
             prevent the theoretical risk of inducing or exacerbating symptoms related to the&#xD;
             aforementioned conditions with VR.&#xD;
