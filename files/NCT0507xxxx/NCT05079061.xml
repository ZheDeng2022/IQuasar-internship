      The objective of the randomized controlled study is to compare combination of sublingual&#xD;
      misoprostol and routine uterotonics versus routine uterotonics alone on PPH in low risk women&#xD;
      after vaginal delivery. The hypothesis is that combination of sublingual misoprostol and&#xD;
      routine uterotonics is more effective than routine uterotonics alone in reduction of PPH in&#xD;
      low risk women after vaginal delivery.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a multi-center randomized controlled trial. All women eligible for&#xD;
      the trial will be recruited at antenatal clinic or antenatal ward. Women with risk factors&#xD;
      for PPH and who are planning for Caesarean delivery will be excluded. Women are informed of&#xD;
      the study in the antenatal clinic between 36 to 40 weeks gestation. An information sheet will&#xD;
      be distributed and a written consent will be obtained. This trial will involve three&#xD;
      maternity units in Hospital Authority (Queen Mary Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital and&#xD;
      Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital) with total annual delivery of 11673 in 2018. Among&#xD;
      the annual delivery of 11000, 70% would be vaginal delivery and 60% of women with vaginal&#xD;
      delivery would be at low risk for PPH, about 4600 women per year will be eligible in the&#xD;
      three units. The investigators aim to recruit 400-500 women per year in total in the three&#xD;
      units and the sample size is 1300 women in total over three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by a computer-generated list to&#xD;
      misoprostol or control group when the women are in active labour. Women in misoprostol group&#xD;
      will receive sublingual misoprostol 600 micrograms in addition to routine uterotonics,&#xD;
      whereas women in control group will receive routine uterotonics. Central randomization will&#xD;
      be performed, generated by stratified block randomization, stratified by individual centers.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed when women are in advanced labour i.e. cervical dilatation at&#xD;
      8cm or more and will be stratified by centres and parity (nulliparous vs multiparous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal and intrapartum care of the women will follow routine care. A blood sample for&#xD;
      complete blood count will be taken when women are admitted in labour. Active management of&#xD;
      third stage of labour will be provided as routine postpartum care (including use of routine&#xD;
      uterotonics and controlled cord traction). Delayed cord clamping is allowed at discretion of&#xD;
      managing clinicians. Studies have shown the delayed cord clamping is beneficial to newborn&#xD;
      and it does not increase risk of maternal bleeding. At delivery of baby, routine uterotonics&#xD;
      (syntometrine 1ml intramuscular or syntocinon 5 units intravenous bolus followed by 40 units&#xD;
      in 500ml normal saline infusion over 4 hours in women contraindicated for syntometrine) will&#xD;
      be given as routine practice, and sublingual misoprostol will be given to women in&#xD;
      misoprostol group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood loss will be measured during vaginal delivery by direct collection of blood with a&#xD;
      calibrated obstetric drape. The calibrated under-buttock drape folds out into a 1x1 meter&#xD;
      sterile surface for delivery. The device allows for blood to be collected into a transparent&#xD;
      calibrated pouch with capacity up to 2500ml. There are markings on the pouch that aid blood&#xD;
      volume measurement. Immediately after delivery of baby and before delivery of placenta,&#xD;
      amniotic fluid will be drained and a surgical drape with a graduated bag will be placed under&#xD;
      women's buttock to collect the blood loss. The bag will remain in place for at least 15&#xD;
      minutes and until the birth attendants consider that the bleeding has stopped. Swabs and&#xD;
      drapes soaked with blood will be weighed using a standardized scale for blood loss&#xD;
      calculation (subtracting the known dry weight of the drapes and swabs) in addition to that&#xD;
      collected in the graduated bag. Clinicians who assess the blood loss will be blinded to study&#xD;
      group allocation. Maternal blood pressure, pulse and temperature will be recorded every 4&#xD;
      hours for one day after delivery. An observation form will be used to record maternal side&#xD;
      effects. Blood will be checked for complete blood count on day 2 after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to standardize various study procedures, training will be provided at individual&#xD;
      study sites by investigators. Training will include recruitment procedure, randomization ,&#xD;
      administration of study drug and blood loss measurement method. Research assistant will have&#xD;
      regular visit in various study sites to check consistency of the above procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will have regular communication and meetings with co-investigators at the study&#xD;
      sites to review study procedures and to review study progress and address potential problems&#xD;
      arising from the study.&#xD;
