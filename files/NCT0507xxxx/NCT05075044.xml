      The subjects aged 18 years and above with HIV-infected were recruited to receive three doses&#xD;
      of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine on day 0, day 21 and day 111, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected before the first dose, 28 days after the second dose, before the&#xD;
      third dose, 28 days after the third dose and 6 months after the third dose, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any local or systemic adverse events that occurred within 21/28 days after vaccination will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
