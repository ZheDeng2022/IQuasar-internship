    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective cohort of young Black MSM who are followed for 2 years either&#xD;
      in-person at the PRISM Health Research Clinic and/or virtually with telehealth study visits.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits occur as frequently as every 3 months, or as appropriate to clinical needs&#xD;
      of HIV PrEP or STI PEP. The investigators will enroll men who are not on PrEP at study&#xD;
      initiation and who may decide to start or stop PrEP, change from daily oral PrEP to on-demand&#xD;
      PrEP or from on-demand PrEP to daily PrEP, and/or start or stop STI PEP at any point in the&#xD;
      study period. If there is trouble enrolling men who are not currently on PrEP, the&#xD;
      investigators will expand enrollment criteria to include men currently on PrEP. All men will&#xD;
      be provided with the study's mobile smart phone app to support early identification of risks&#xD;
      for PrEP discontinuation, to provide information about STI PEP and document usage patterns of&#xD;
      on-demand PrEP and STI PEP, and to support easy linkage to support services for PrEP&#xD;
      counseling and addressing concerns or questions about STI PEP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young Black men who have sex with me (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by the U.S. HIV&#xD;
      epidemic. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a relatively newer HIV prevention strategy&#xD;
      that involves taking HIV antiviral medications either daily or on-demand to prevent HIV&#xD;
      infection following high risk sexual activity. Both daily and on-demand PrEP have been shown&#xD;
      to prevent infection if taken consistently and correctly. A prior research with this&#xD;
      high-risk population in Atlanta, where it was offered daily PrEP to study participants,&#xD;
      resulted in significant PrEP interest and initiation however high rates of PrEP&#xD;
      discontinuation throughout the study were of great concern and, in some cases, led to HIV&#xD;
      infection. Additionally, the study found high rates of bacterial sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infection (STI) diagnoses both independent of, and concurrent with, higher PrEP use leading&#xD;
      to concerns that condoms are not being used among young Black MSM on PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work will expand upon the previous study with an intervention focus for young&#xD;
      Black MSM in Atlanta with aims of (1) preventing daily PrEP discontinuation; (2) offering&#xD;
      on-demand PrEP as an alternative for MSM not interested in daily PrEP; and, (3) decreasing&#xD;
      the incidence of bacterial STIs by offering STI post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) which&#xD;
      involves taking doxycycline immediately following high risk sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a cohort of 300 Black MSM aged 18-29 in Atlanta who will be followed&#xD;
      for two years. Participants will be recruited online from social media and dating websites,&#xD;
      and in-person from different venues and events where young Black MSM are known to attend. Men&#xD;
      will take a short online eligibility screener either on a tablet, if recruited in-person, or&#xD;
      on their own device if recruited online. Participants will be compensated for the various&#xD;
      study activities (e.g., study visits, online behavioral surveys, weekly/monthly surveys).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If men screen eligible, they will be invited to a baseline study visit that will occur either&#xD;
      in-person at the research clinic or virtually. Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the&#xD;
      plan is to offer participants the option of conducting study activities virtually or&#xD;
      in-person. Consent will occur at the beginning of the baseline visit. Following the baseline&#xD;
      visit, all participants will have two more study visits at months 12 and 24. At the three&#xD;
      study visits, participants will be tested for HIV, STIs and drugs of abuse and take an online&#xD;
      behavioral survey. Participants will also take an online behavioral survey at months 4, 7 and&#xD;
      19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all study visits, participants will discuss with the study counselor the various&#xD;
      prevention options the study is offering-daily PrEP, on-demand PrEP and STI PEP. If a&#xD;
      participant elects to begin any of these, study staff will assist them in accessing PrEP from&#xD;
      a community pharmacy and STI PEP (doxycycline) from the Emory Investigational Drug Service.&#xD;
      Participants who start PrEP and/or STI PEP will take short weekly surveys for the first 2&#xD;
      weeks to monitor use and side effects. Following that 2-week period, daily PrEP users will&#xD;
      get a monthly survey to try and detect warning signs of discontinuation so that the study can&#xD;
      intervene to prevent that from happening. On-demand PrEP and STI PEP users will continue to&#xD;
      get weekly surveys to monitor use and side effects. PrEP and STI PEP users will have a&#xD;
      3-monthly visit-either in-person or virtually-to monitor their use and to test for HIV and&#xD;
      STIs. PrEP users will also have their kidney function monitored by creatinine testing.&#xD;
      Participants electing to do their study activities virtually will be sent specimen collection&#xD;
      kits so that they can self-collect specimens for all the required labs. They will mail back&#xD;
      the specimens to the lab in a pre-paid postage mailer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be required to download the study app at the baseline visit and will be&#xD;
      oriented to using it to retrieve study communication, surveys, lab results, etc.&#xD;
      Additionally, the app will be used to schedule and conduct video conferencing sessions&#xD;
      between participants and study clinicians/staff. If a participant reports warning signs of&#xD;
      PrEP discontinuation, a peer navigator on staff will reach out through the app to try and&#xD;
      schedule a counseling session that will use a motivational interviewing approach to support&#xD;
      PrEP persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work is of great significance for the field as novel approaches to preventing&#xD;
      early discontinuation of PrEP are of utmost importance for preventing HIV transmission among&#xD;
      young, Black MSM. If engaging with them frequently and assessing for warning signs of&#xD;
      discontinuation is shown to be an effective strategy for intervening and preventing stoppage,&#xD;
      then the implications for future interventions by community PrEP providers and clinicians is&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
