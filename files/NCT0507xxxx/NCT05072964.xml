    <textblock>
      The Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up trial is a prospective, multi-center, open-label,&#xD;
      single-arm clinical follow-up study designed to provide long-term safety feasibility,&#xD;
      effectiveness and performance of the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System for the treatment&#xD;
      of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary and secondary Safety, Feasibility, Effectiveness and Performance will be&#xD;
      evaluated against pre-specified criteria as determined by the Sponsor and FDA. The criteria&#xD;
      set in this study have been previously used to demonstrate Safety, Feasibility, Effectiveness&#xD;
      and Performance in FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation System for the treatment of Paroxysmal&#xD;
      Atrial Fibrillation (PAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the primary safety and performance objective will take place once all the&#xD;
      subjects with a study FARAPULSE Pulsed field ablation procedure attempt have reached 12&#xD;
      months of follow-up post-pulsed field ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses of the primary effectiveness objective will take place once all the subjects&#xD;
      with a study pulsed field ablation procedure attempt have reached 34 ~ 36 months of follow-up&#xD;
      post-pulsed field ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses for the secondary objectives will take place once all subjects with a study&#xD;
      pulsed field ablation procedure attempt have reached 34~36 months of follow-up post-pulsed&#xD;
      field ablation procedure.&#xD;
