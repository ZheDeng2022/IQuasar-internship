  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to systematically develop and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of a digitally delivered, graded exposure treatment for youth with chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, utilizing a sequential replicated and randomized single-case&#xD;
      experimental design (SCED). SCED provides the opportunity to rigorously evaluate treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness at the individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of iGET Living will be based on a series of short iterations, with alpha testing&#xD;
      (Aim 1) on a small sample of adolescents with chronic pain (N = 15) and their parents (N =&#xD;
      15). For Aim 1, participants will participate in three, two hour focus groups (one per week&#xD;
      over the course of three weeks), resulting in 6 total hours of participation per participant&#xD;
      for Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will involve a sample (N = 20 youth, N = 20 parents) of na√Øve end-users. Participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in a baseline period ranging from 7-25 days (done to support SCED&#xD;
      methodology) after which they will be enrolled in the online intervention program, lasting&#xD;
      6-weeks. Patients will be contacted 3-months post-discharge from treatment (week 22 of&#xD;
      enrollment) and will complete self-report outcome measures at this time.&#xD;
