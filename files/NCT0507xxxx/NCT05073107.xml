      Randomized Controlled Trial: to investigate the feasibility of the usage of a mobile dental&#xD;
      application in the self-administration of plaque control in a two (2) parallel arm study with&#xD;
      52 subjects (n = 52). The study will take place over 2 visits (within 35 days): Visit 1 and&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Open Cohort Study: Patients referred to the Periodontology Department will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study during the Oral Hygiene Phase. Routine clinical indices&#xD;
      will be recorded at Visit 1 and Visit 2 before active non-surgical periodontal treatment&#xD;
      commences.&#xD;

      Visit 1 (Week 0, Day 0): Start of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects: The periodontal patients who have a dental appointment scheduled in the&#xD;
           National University Centre for Oral Health, Singapore and fulfil inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will be recruited into the study by the delegated study team members. After&#xD;
           written informed consent has been obtained and all the standard dental practices such as&#xD;
           collecting the Routine Clinical Periodontal Parameters for evaluation and providing Oral&#xD;
           Hygiene Instruction are done by the blinded study team member(s) termed as the Examiner.&#xD;
           After which, the Participants will be randomized into 2 groups by delegated study team&#xD;
           members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test (n = 26): Dental Monitoring (&quot;DM&quot;) Kit + 2-month DM subscription&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control (n = 26): No DM Kit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Examiner will be either the Co-investigator or an oral hygiene therapist engaged to&#xD;
           be on the delegated study team. The same single blinded Examiner will examine all the&#xD;
           participants of the study at both Visits 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on the design of the study, there will be no deviation from the standard&#xD;
           periodontal treatment protocol and intervals between treatment for this group of&#xD;
           patients in the public healthcare setting with the exception for the test groups whereby&#xD;
           the usage of an additional DM application which will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Test group will receive DM as an additional monitoring aid. The delegated study team&#xD;
           members will guide the Test group to download the DM application onto their mobile&#xD;
           device, provide them with a DM Kit including full instructions (verbal and instruction&#xD;
           pamphlet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the Test group will be taught by the delegated study team members:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. How to pair up a DM Scanbox with your smartphone https://youtu.be/y-q9Z8JMbzo&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. How to perform DM Scans with ScanBox https://youtu.be/YT859VMGL18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Test group will be required to take intra-oral videos (which will be translated into&#xD;
           photographs) using the DM application weekly and it will be monitored by the delegated&#xD;
           team members:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 0 (To be taken at the clinic)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 7 (To be taken in the evening after brushing teeth)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 14 (To be taken in the evening after brushing teeth)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 21(To be taken in the evening after brushing teeth)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day 28 (To be taken before study Visit 2) *There is a window period of +1 day for&#xD;
                the intra-oral videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Control group will monitor their own oral hygiene without any additional aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be given a soft-bristled toothbrush, fluoridated toothpaste and&#xD;
           inter-dental aids by the delegated study team members. They will be instructed not to&#xD;
           use any forms of mouth rinse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Week 4, Day 28 to Day 35): End of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This visit will be between Day 28 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Test group will be given a short questionnaire by delegated study team members to&#xD;
           evaluate their perspective on the &quot;ease of use&quot; and &quot;satisfaction&quot; using DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same Routine Clinical Periodontal Parameters clinical parameters will be measured&#xD;
           again by the same blinded Examiner in Visit 1 and the clinical parameters evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of Visit 2, the subject will need to return the DM Kit during this visit.&#xD;
           There is no more post follow up for this study and patient will continue with their next&#xD;
           scheduled dental appointment by their primary care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The delegated study team will collect the data from the Routine Clinical Periodontal&#xD;
           Parameters (Full Mouth Periodontal Probing Depth, Bleeding on Probing, Recession and&#xD;
           Plaque Index) that have been recorded at Visit 1 and Visit 2 for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary Outcome: Difference in Full Mouth Plaque Score (%)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Outcomes: Participants' experience/feedback in the Test group on the use&#xD;
                of the Dental Monitoring application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The delegated study team will analyze the photographs taken by the DM application and&#xD;
           the data collected via the questionnaire.&#xD;
