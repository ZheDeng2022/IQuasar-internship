    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluable the safety and to demonstrate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost (mRNA-1273, MVC-COV1901), compared to homologous&#xD;
      prime-boost (mRNA-1273), with an interval of 8-12 weeks, This study also assesses the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the study intervention and explores the immunogenicity by the&#xD;
      antigen-specific immunoglobulin, the immunogenicity against the VoCs, the antigen specific&#xD;
      cellular immune response, as well as the potential efficacy of study intervention in&#xD;
      preventing COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-arm, single-center study&#xD;
      to be conducted in approximately 220 healthy participants aged 20 to 70 years who are&#xD;
      generally healthy or with stable pre-existing health condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants should previously have their first dose of mRNA-1273. The participants,&#xD;
      investigators, and the site personnel will be blinded to the study intervention assignment&#xD;
      until all the participants complete their Day 29. Preparation and administration of study&#xD;
      intervention will be performed by authorized unblinded site personnel who do not participate&#xD;
      in the evaluation of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either mRNA-1273 or MVC-COV1901 vaccine&#xD;
      at a 1:1 ratio. Randomization of participants will be stratified by the interval apart from&#xD;
      their first dose of mRNA-1273 (&lt; 10 weeks or ≥ 10 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 6 on-site visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -28 to Day 1, Visit 1 (Screening) Day 1, Visit 2 (study intervention) Day 15 ± 3 days,&#xD;
      Visit 3 Day 29 ± 3 days, Visit 4 Day 91 ± 14 days, Visit 5 Day 181 ± 14 days, Visit 6&#xD;
      Unscheduled visit(s) may be arranged when deemed necessary by the investigator.&#xD;
