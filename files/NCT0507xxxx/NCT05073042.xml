  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to learn more about people's experiences with being asked to exercise&#xD;
      consistently at a specific time of the day (e.g., in the morning) and whether a certain&#xD;
      exercise time is most helpful for becoming more active. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      walk for at least 15 minutes per day at a specified time of day (morning, evening, or time of&#xD;
      choice) for 3 weeks each (9 weeks of walking total). Each 3-week exercise period will be&#xD;
      separated by 2 weeks with no exercise goal. Participants will be emailed a brief survey about&#xD;
      barriers/facilitators to exercise each night during the exercise periods and will receive a&#xD;
      weekly email that provides support and encouragement for increasing physical activity.&#xD;
      Participants will also wear a physical activity monitor on their waist each day during the&#xD;
      study to measure physical activity. Participants will complete questionnaires about their&#xD;
      experiences at the end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Performing at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week is&#xD;
      associated with many health improvements. Some research suggests that people who exercise at&#xD;
      the same time day-to-day perform more physical activity than those who exercise at variable&#xD;
      times day-to-day, but it is not yet known if asking people to exercise at the same time&#xD;
      day-to-day is helpful for becoming more active and whether there is a specific time of day&#xD;
      (e.g., morning vs. evening) that is most helpful. Importantly, it is also not yet known&#xD;
      whether people are able and willing to exercise at a specific time day-to-day. This study&#xD;
      thus seeks to learn more about how feasible, acceptable, and helpful it is to exercise at an&#xD;
      assigned time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 4 months total. Interested participants will be asked to attend an&#xD;
      orientation visit at the research center to learn more about the study and will wear a&#xD;
      physical activity monitor for 1 week to verify eligibility. Participants who enroll in the&#xD;
      study will then complete a 45-minute session with study staff (in person or via&#xD;
      videoconferencing) to learn strategies for safely increasing physical and will be asked to&#xD;
      walk at a moderate intensity for at least 15 consecutive minutes every day during three,&#xD;
      3-week periods (9 weeks total). Each participant will be asked to perform this walking in the&#xD;
      morning (5:00-10:00 AM) for one of the 3-week periods, in the evening (5:00-10:00 PM) for one&#xD;
      of the 3-week periods, and at a time of their choice for one of the 3-week periods. Between&#xD;
      each 3-week period with a daily exercise goal, there will be a 2-week break period with no&#xD;
      exercise goal. Participants will be asked to wear a physical activity sensor on an elastic&#xD;
      band around their waist during all waking hours for the full study duration to monitor their&#xD;
      physical activity levels. They will also be emailed a survey about their physical activity&#xD;
      each night during each of the 3-week exercise periods. Participants will receive a weekly&#xD;
      email each week to provide support and encouragement for increasing their physical activity,&#xD;
      and to report on how many days they wore the physical activity sensor. Lastly, participants&#xD;
      will complete a visit at the research center at the end of the study to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about their experiences.&#xD;
