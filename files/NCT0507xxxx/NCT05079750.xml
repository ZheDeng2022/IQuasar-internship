      An open-label, non-randomised, dose escalation, first-in-human, single centre, phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a bivalent ChAdOx1 vectored&#xD;
      vaccine against Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus species in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate ChAdOx1 biEBOV vaccine in healthy UK volunteers&#xD;
      aged 18-55. The vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (IM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 3 study groups and it is anticipated that a&#xD;
      total of 26 volunteers will be enrolled. Dose escalation and sentinel participant procedures&#xD;
      will be implemented. Volunteers will be first recruited into Group 1 and subsequently into&#xD;
      Groups 2 and 3 following interim clinical safety reviews. Volunteers will be sequentially&#xD;
      allocated to a study group by selecting eligible volunteers for enrolment following&#xD;
      screening. Sequential allocation will occur based on the order in which volunteers are&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
