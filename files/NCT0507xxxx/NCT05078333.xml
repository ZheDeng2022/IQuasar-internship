      108 myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) diagnosed patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups.&#xD;
      To groups; exercise, exercise+high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) and exercise+dry needling&#xD;
      will be applied. Visual anolog scale (VAS) scores and neck range of motion (ROM) of the&#xD;
      patients before-after treatment will be recorded and will be evaluated statistically.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a very common disease in the population that seriously&#xD;
      affects the quality of life. Although many modalities are used in its treatment, there is&#xD;
      still no common protocol. In this study, the investigators aim to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of high-intensity laser therapy (HILT), which has been popular in recent years, with exercise&#xD;
      and dry needling options that have been used for years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study 108 myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) diagnosed patients will be randomly divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups. To groups; exercise, exercise+high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) and&#xD;
      exercise+dry needling will be applied. Visual anolog scale (VAS) scores and neck range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM) of the patients before-after treatment will be recorded and will be evaluated&#xD;
      statistically.&#xD;

    <description>High intensity laser therapy (HILT), one of the physical therapy methods, was approved by the FDA in 2002. Its beneficial and versatile effect has been proven in the treatment of many musculoskeletal diseases. In addition to the exercise program, randomly selected 36 case patients + HILT (BTL brand 6000 series, United Kingdom), to the cervical area, for the a period of 3 week-weekdays, 15-minute period and 15 sessions (1.02 minutes for each 25 cm² painful area, analgesic phase, with an anergy 8.0 W, a dose 5 J / cm², a frequency of 25 Hz and total 125 joules) will be applied.</description>
