    <textblock>
      Study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of multiple switches&#xD;
      between Humira® and ABP 501 (new high concentration formulation) compared with continued use&#xD;
      of Humira® in participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This multi-center study&#xD;
      is composed of two periods: A lead-in period of treatment with Humira® followed by a&#xD;
