      This study is a prospective, randomized, multinational, multicenter, double-blind trial in 2&#xD;
      parallel groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo screening examinations at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      to double-blind treatment with one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Acetylcysteine/Paracetamol/Phenylephrine: one sachet three times per day OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Paracetamol/Phenylephrine 500 mg/10 mg granules for oral solution: one sachet&#xD;
           three times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control visit (Visit 2) is planned on Day 3 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the double-blind treatment phase, the patients will undergo an&#xD;
      end-of-treatment (EOT) examination at Visit 3 on Day 6.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Score of 8 symptoms related to mucus production (SUM8) will be assessed by the patient in a patient's diary at screening (this will constitute the baseline value) and daily on each day of treatment until and including Day 5. For assessing SUM8 the patients will have to answer questions about their cough and phlegm status. The SUM8 consisted of the sum of the answers to the eight core questions. For calculating the SUM8 the lowest rating corresponds to 0 and highest rating corresponds to 4, with 4 representing the greatest severity of symptoms. The SUM8 thus had a scale range of 0-32 with 0 representing best possible symptoms, and 32 representing greatest severity of symptoms.</description>
