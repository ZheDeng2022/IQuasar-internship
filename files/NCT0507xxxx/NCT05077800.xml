      The purpose of this study is to find out if an experimental drug will prevent metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma from becoming resistant to standard treatment for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  9-ING-41&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Losartan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ferumoxytol&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, open label, four-arm, non-comparator Phase 2 study of&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX in combination with 9-ING-41 and losartan for the treatment of adult patients with&#xD;
      untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC). This research study will begin with a&#xD;
      Safety Run-In phase. The Safety Run-In phase will establish the side effects from the study&#xD;
      treatment to its safety before beginning the main part of the study. Once that is complete,&#xD;
      the main portion of the study will be a Phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved 9-ING-41 as a treatment for&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC). The FDA has not approved Losartan for pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PAC), but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX as a treatment option for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves giving participants an investigational drug called 9- ING-41&#xD;
      with standard anti-cancer drugs. 9-ING-41 stops an enzyme called GSK- 3β from working in&#xD;
      cancer cells. Enzymes are proteins that activate and accelerate chemical reactions. The&#xD;
      GSK-3β enzyme helps cancer cells to grow and to become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. This&#xD;
      study is trying to see if by stopping the activity of GSK-3β using 9-ING-41, it may be&#xD;
      possible for standard of care chemotherapy drugs to regain their effectiveness in treating&#xD;
      cancers in participants where they have stopped being effective or are effective in only a&#xD;
      minority of participants. FOLFIRINOX is a combination of 4 chemotherapy agents that may help&#xD;
      shrink pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) tumors. Losartan is a drug that is used to lower blood&#xD;
      pressure. In this setting, Losartan has also been demonstrated to suppress TGF-β function in&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Cytokines are molecules that help cells communicate and play a&#xD;
      role in immune response. Suppression of TGF-β function is believed to stop the cancer cells&#xD;
      from becoming resistant to chemotherapy. This study will evaluate if blocking of GSK-3β&#xD;
      activity using 9-ING-41 and blocking of TGF-β function using Losartan can inhibit cancer cell&#xD;
      resistance to FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits. Participants will receive treatment during three portions&#xD;
      of the study: Complete therapy, Maintenance therapy and Transition to complete therapy. After&#xD;
      treatment, participants will be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that up to 70 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuate Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by&#xD;
      providing the study drug 9-ING-41.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lustgarten Foundation is providing funding support for this study through a research&#xD;
      grant.&#xD;
