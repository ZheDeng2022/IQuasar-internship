    <textblock>
      The first objective of the study is to evaluate whether a novel bio-signature (derived from a&#xD;
      wide range of pro- and anti-nociceptive IL-1 family cytokine activity) will predict pain&#xD;
      experienced and also release of underlying endogenous opioid neurotransmitters during an&#xD;
      experimental nociceptive pain challenge, which will be performed while simultaneously&#xD;
      quantifying mu-opioid receptor activity in the brain via [11C]-carfentanil PET neuroimaging&#xD;
      in healthy subjects. Another objective is to evaluate whether an anti-inflammatory drug that&#xD;
      reduces activation of IL-1b (minocycline) will perturb the balance between pro- and&#xD;
      anti-nociceptive IL-1 cytokines and effect a reduction in pain experienced (and endogenous&#xD;
      opioids released) during the experimental, nociceptive pain challenge. A final objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate performance characteristics (sensitivity, accuracy, dynamic range) of the&#xD;
      biosignature for the purpose of predicting post-operative pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lack of precision in tools that quantify risk and assess presentation of post-operative pain&#xD;
      poses substantial burden to prevention and treatment and is a major contributor to the&#xD;
      nationwide opioid epidemic. Enhanced precision in post- operative pain care requires&#xD;
      quantitative tools that individualize assessment of widely variant human pain experiences,&#xD;
      accounting for variance in intensity, threshold, and in both affective and sensory components&#xD;
      of pain. No currently available measure is sufficiently sensitive, accurate, and reliable to&#xD;
      account for the wide variance in risk or clinical presentation of post-operative pain that is&#xD;
      required to impact best practices. To address this unmet need, we will discover (R61 phase)&#xD;
      and validate (R33 phase) a novel, fit-for-purpose, objective bio-signature that is sensitive,&#xD;
      accurate, and reliable in predicting risk (and presentation) of post-operative pain states&#xD;
      following a elective cosmetic surgery (e.g. abdominoplasty), a body contouring surgery&#xD;
      frequently performed and associated with post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests it is biologically plausible to develop a bio-signature of the human pain&#xD;
      experience that derives from IL-1 family cytokine activity. In animal models, imbalance&#xD;
      between pro- and anti-nociceptive IL-1 family cytokines is readily induced pharmacologically&#xD;
      and surgically, enhancing pain behavior, central endogenous opioid release, and tolerance to&#xD;
      opioid analgesics, all factors that contribute to chronicity. Pharmacologic blockade of&#xD;
      pro-nociceptive IL-1 cytokines with soluble IL-1ra reverses the pro-nociceptive effects.&#xD;
      Evidence suggests similar relationships exist in humans. Concentration of IL-1b sampled&#xD;
      intra-operatively from wound site blood revealed predicts surgical complications and&#xD;
      post-operative pain. However, IL-1b (on its own) has not proven sufficiently accurate,&#xD;
      sensitive, or reliable to account for the broad inter-individual variance in risk and&#xD;
      clinical presentation of human post-operative pain states. In preliminary data from separate&#xD;
      regression analyses, neither IL-1b nor IL-1ra significantly predicted pain (intensity or&#xD;
      threshold). However, regression models incorporating both IL-1b and IL-1ra showed that&#xD;
      imbalance between these 2 factors (pro-nociceptive IL-1bias) synergistically enhanced&#xD;
      prediction of pain (intensity and threshold) and underlying endogenous opioid release during&#xD;
      a standardized pain challenge, accounting for 20% of the pain variance. IL-1b&#xD;
      (pro-nociceptive) was a positive predictor and IL-1ra (anti-nociceptive) a negative predictor&#xD;
      of pain. Including additional variance factors (sex, mu-opioid receptor polymorphism,&#xD;
      neuroticism) in the model accounted for another 5% of the pain variance. Pain variance&#xD;
      factors can impact concentration of additional IL-1 cytokines that regulate IL-1 signaling,&#xD;
      suggesting it is both biologically and statistically plausible that incorporating a wide&#xD;
      array of IL-1 family cytokines (IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-1a, sIL-1r1, IL-1RAcP, IL-18, IL-18bp,&#xD;
      IL-18Ra, IL-18Rb, IL-36, IL-38, IL-33, sTLR4) into a broader bio-signature of IL-1 family&#xD;
      cytokine activity will perform superior to simple measures of IL-1bias (that include only&#xD;
      IL-1b and IL-1ra) in predicting the highly heterogeneous human post-operative pain&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study phase focuses on discovery (and analytic validation) of a novel, bio-signature of&#xD;
      risk for post-operative pain states and underlying opioid-cytokine interactions. Performance&#xD;
      (accuracy, sensitivity, dynamic range) in predicting experimental and post-operative pain&#xD;
      will be tested in n=70 healthy humans following elective abdominoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More Specifically, The first objective of the study is to evaluate whether a novel&#xD;
      bio-signature (derived from a wide range of pro- and anti-nociceptive IL-1 family cytokine&#xD;
      activity) will predict pain experienced and also release of underlying endogenous opioid&#xD;
      neurotransmitters during an experimental nociceptive pain challenge, which will be performed&#xD;
      while simultaneously quantifying mu-opioid receptor activity in the brain via&#xD;
      [11C]-carfentanil PET neuroimaging in healthy subjects. Another objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether an anti-inflammatory drug that reduces activation of IL-1b (anakinra) will perturb&#xD;
      the balance between pro- and anti-nociceptive IL-1 cytokines and effect a reduction in pain&#xD;
      experienced (and endogenous opioids released) during the experimental, nociceptive pain&#xD;
      challenge. A final objective is to evaluate performance characteristics (sensitivity,&#xD;
      accuracy, dynamic range) of the biosignature for the purpose of predicting post-operative&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
