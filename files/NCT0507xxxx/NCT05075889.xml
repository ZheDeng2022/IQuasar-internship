    <textblock>
      Patients with a biopsy-proven benign bone tumor for which standard of care is intralesional&#xD;
      operative management will receive a weight-appropriate IV dose of indocyanine green (ICG,&#xD;
      FDA-approved) the day prior to surgery during their standard pre-operative clinic visit. On&#xD;
      the day of surgery, fluorescence images will be obtained using a non-invasive fluorescence&#xD;
      camera.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICG fluorescence imaging has been used to assess tissue perfusion in vivo in real-time&#xD;
      intra-operative arterial and lymphatic perfusion imaging and osseous flap perfusion imaging.&#xD;
      Compared to the conventional medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ICG fluorescence imaging is nonionizing, low-cost, and&#xD;
      portable. ICG is a dye that absorbs near-infrared light in the wavelength range between 790&#xD;
      to 805 nm and has an emission at the peak of 835 nm. ICG is almost 98% plasma protein-bound&#xD;
      so that once it is received in the microcirculation, it remains within the lymphatic and&#xD;
      circulatory vasculature unless inflammation is present. ICG has been approved for clinical&#xD;
      use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1959. Since then, ICG has been used in&#xD;
      humans for angiography in ophthalmology and cardiology applications and is given routinely to&#xD;
      patients in these clinical settings. ICG fluorescence imaging has also been used to guide&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery, robotic adrenalectomy, assess tissue perfusion in vivo in real-time&#xD;
      intra-operative arterial and lymphatic perfusion imaging, and tissue flap perfusion imaging.&#xD;
      ICG is ideal to measure perfusion/blood flow because it binds efficiently to blood&#xD;
      lipoproteins and thus does not leak from circulation under normal circumstances. In addition,&#xD;
      the ICG half-life is short making repeated measures possible, and it is indirectly activated,&#xD;
      so that the dynamic fluorescence due to bone and tissue perfusion can be captured by a video&#xD;
      rate imaging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dynamic fluorescence imaging systems to be used in this study will be preferentially the&#xD;
      Pentero surgical microscope (Zeiss, Germany), Spy Elite Imaging System or SPY Portable&#xD;
      Handheld Imaging (SPY-PHI) System (Novadaq/Stryker), or another imager may be used. These&#xD;
      imagers are commercially available imaging systems that are used to assess tissue perfusion&#xD;
      in real time in the operating room. The systems have a multi-directional imaging arm which&#xD;
      contains a near-infrared light source that illuminates the fluorescent agent within the&#xD;
      tissues, a high definition (HD) video camera that captures the intensity of fluorescent&#xD;
      marker in real-time, and software that allows the user to capture relative and absolute&#xD;
      perfusion values within the surgical field. These products are FDA-approved for use to&#xD;
      monitor blood flow, plastic surgery, microsurgery, reconstructive surgery, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      imaging and coronary bypass surgery.&#xD;
