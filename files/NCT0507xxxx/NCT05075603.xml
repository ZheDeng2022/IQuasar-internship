      This is a phase 1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of NT-I7 (efineptakin alfa), a long-acting human IL-7, post-Tisagenlecleucel&#xD;
      (Kymriah®) in subjects with relapsed/refractory large B-cell Lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter Phase 1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of NT-I7 administration following SOC Kymriah CAR T-cell therapy for&#xD;
      eligible subjects with r/r LBCL. The study consists of a Dose Escalation phase followed by a&#xD;
      Dose Expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation phase The Dose Escalation phase is designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, including determination of the MTD and/or the RP2D, of NT-I7 when administered&#xD;
      after Kymriah infusion for r/r LBCL. Seven dose levels (DLs) are planned: the starting DL&#xD;
      (DL1) will be 60 mcg/kg, and the highest DL to be tested (DL7) will be 720 mcg/kg, as&#xD;
      outlined in the Treatment Schema. Other intermediate DLs between 60 mcg/kg and 720 mcg/kg may&#xD;
      be explored based on emerging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dose Escalation phase will begin with an accelerated phase with 1 subject per cohort at&#xD;
      the first 2 DLs (DL1 = 60 mcg/kg and DL2 = 120 mcg/kg), followed by a standard 3+3 design on&#xD;
      the remaining 5 DLs (see Treatment Schema), each with a cohort of 3 independent subjects each&#xD;
      time and with a maximum total of 6 subjects per cohort. If at least 2 Grade ≥ 2 AEs or any 1&#xD;
      Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) are observed in the single subject enrolled in either DL1 or&#xD;
      DL2, the accelerated phase will convert to a conventional 3+3 design at the DL where the AEs&#xD;
      or DLT are observed and remain so for all the DLs above. In addition to converting to the 3+3&#xD;
      design, the next DL will not exceed 50% of the previous DL. Similarly, if a 2nd DLT occurs in&#xD;
      a DL, the next DL in the escalation scheme will not exceed 33% of the previous DL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all DLs that followed the 3+3 design, subjects will be dosed in a 3-week staggered&#xD;
      fashion: the 1st subject in a DL will be monitored for 3 weeks; after 3 weeks, if the safety&#xD;
      is acceptable, the 2nd subject will be enrolled and treated at that same DL; similarly, the&#xD;
      3rd subject will be enrolled and treated only if the safety appears to be acceptable for both&#xD;
      the 1st and 2nd subjects after the 2nd subject has been monitored for 3 weeks. If additional&#xD;
      subjects are required for a DL, they will be enrolled and treated in similar 3-week staggered&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion phase Once RP2D has been determined from the Dose Escalation phase, up to 15&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase and treated at the RP2D to further&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of NT-I7 administration following SOC&#xD;
      Kymriah CAR T-cell therapy for eligible subjects with r/r LBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • NT-I7 (aka rhIL-7-hyFc, efineptakin alfa): NT-I7 will be administered as an intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) injection at the appropriate DL for each cohort. Each subject will receive only one&#xD;
      NT-I7 injection administered on Day 21 +/-2 days (post-Kymriah infusion). Subjects will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for NT-I7 injection and monitored for at least 24 hours after NT-I7 injection.&#xD;
      If subjects develop Grade 2 or higher AEs, subjects will remain hospitalized until resolution&#xD;
      of AEs to grade 1 or better. Subjects can be kept in the hospital longer at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physicians. Additionally, subjects will be asked to stay within 1-hour radius of&#xD;
      the location where they received treatment and will be closely monitored by appropriately&#xD;
      trained medical staff 2-3 times (or more often, as clinically indicated) during the first 1&#xD;
      week and at least weekly for at least 3 more weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®): Kymriah will be administered per manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations and in accordance with FDA prescribing guidelines and best institutional&#xD;
      practices for SOC use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Duration of Treatment, Study and Follow-up: The enrollment date is at the start of&#xD;
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy in preparation for infusion of the Kymriah product. The duration&#xD;
      on study will be approximately 3 months following infusion of Kymriah. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      followed up per standard of care and per the REMS program for Kymriah.&#xD;
