  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current state of knowledge shows the presence of respiratory sequelae after acute&#xD;
      infection with COVID-19 and the importance of these long-term respiratory dysfunctions have&#xD;
      to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of our study is describe diaphragmatic amplitude using diaphragm ultrasonography in&#xD;
      patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 3 and 6 months after the acute episode.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from CHRU Hospital in Limoges&#xD;
      (France) will be included to follow the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrom&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 on pulmonary function, diaphragm function and exercice capacity. Surviving&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. The assesment will&#xD;
      include diaphragm ultrasonography, spirometry (FEV1,FVC), carbon monoxide transfert (TLCO&#xD;
      adjusted for haemoglobin), inspiratory an expiratory respiratory muscle strength (Pimax and&#xD;
      Pemax) and 6 minutes walk distance (6MWD).The main outcome will be diaphragm excursion&#xD;
      assessed by ultrasound.&#xD;
