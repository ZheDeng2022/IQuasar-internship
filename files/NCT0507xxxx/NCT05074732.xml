      The DUNDRUM Forensic Redevelopment Evaluation study (D-FOREST study) is a multi-site&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of a complete National Forensic Mental Health Service. The study&#xD;
      will have a prospective, observational, longitudinal design which will permit the evaluation&#xD;
      of benefit over time for individual patients, groups of patients and the evaluation of the&#xD;
      benefit in terms of service based outcomes of the redevelopment of a complete National&#xD;
      Forensic Mental Health Service e.g. effects on waiting list times, length of stay. The study&#xD;
      will systematically evaluate multiple domains of recovery in a complete National Forensic&#xD;
      Service, including patients' physical health, mental health, offending behaviours and social&#xD;
      and occupational functioning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The DUNDRUM Forensic Redevelopment Evaluation Study (D-FOREST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forensic Mental Health Services have a dual role, to treat mental disorder and reduce violent&#xD;
      recidivism. Forensic mental health services are low volume, high cost services and therefore&#xD;
      it is vital to conduct robust outcome measure studies to demonstrate benefit and&#xD;
      effectiveness. D-FOREST is a study comprising the evaluation of a complete national forensic&#xD;
      mental health service at a time of significant change, that of the re-development of&#xD;
      Ireland's National Forensic Mental Health Service from a 19th century building to a complete&#xD;
      national service in North Dublin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that the redevelopment of the campus from Dundrum Hospital to a new 170-bed&#xD;
      hospital in Portrane will demonstrate improvements in two main areas, firstly service wide&#xD;
      improvements and secondly patient benefit related improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that the development of the new campus at Portrane will lead to reduced time&#xD;
      on the waiting list for admission and reduced length of stay in the hospital as well as&#xD;
      sustainable rates of admissions and discharges maintained over the five year period of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the newly expanded hospital will be able to facilitate the admission of&#xD;
      patients with higher security needs from the prison settings, and therefore there may be a&#xD;
      rise in the security needs profile of the group, while urgency of need for admission on the&#xD;
      waiting list will decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that patient engagement with group and individual therapy will improve with&#xD;
      greater access to therapists as the staff number will expand and therefore measures of&#xD;
      therapeutic programme completion and recovery and measures of risk in a broad sense should&#xD;
      improve across the patient group. We also anticipate finding improved measures of patient&#xD;
      ratings on environmental measures such as ward atmosphere on moving to the new campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures in the area of physical health, mental health and violence risk and&#xD;
      forensic recovery will be taken, at baseline (time of admission to the service) as well as at&#xD;
      six-monthly intervals throughout the patients admission journey. These main areas will&#xD;
      include structured interview measures of psychopathology e.g. SCID, PANSS, clinician rated&#xD;
      measures violence and self-harm risk assessment instruments e.g. HCR-20, SRAMM, and measures&#xD;
      of therapeutic programme completion and recovery (DUNDRUM-3 and DUNDRUM-4 scales) as well as&#xD;
      overall functioning MIRECC GAF. Physical health measures will include measures of BMI,&#xD;
      frailty and sedentary behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures including ward atmosphere scales ESSENCES and measures of quality of life&#xD;
      (WHO-QUOL) will also be offered to the patient group to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of both self-rated and interview based measures to engage patients, and&#xD;
      clinician rated measures will be used. This is due to the high rates of treatment resistant&#xD;
      psychoses in forensic hospital settings, and therefore to rely on self-rated or interview&#xD;
      rated measures along would mean that many of the most unwell patients may not be able or&#xD;
      willing to engage. Thus utilising this combination approach ensures that any bias in the&#xD;
      results and outcomes observed will be minimised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes. Time intervals (time in days to&#xD;
      admission from waiting list, length of stay) will be measured by median and 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval using Kaplan Meyer and Cox regression analyses. Survival analysis will be used to&#xD;
      assess factors affecting length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient level measures will be expressed as changes from baseline (typically from the time of&#xD;
      admission) using ANCOVA, MANOVA or logistic regression as appropriate with correction for the&#xD;
      effects of static baseline variables such as demographic characteristics (e.g. age, sex and&#xD;
      ethnicity) or diagnosis including multi-axial diagnoses, neurocognitive function, and legal&#xD;
      status. Measures of effect size will be used alongside measures of statistical significance&#xD;
      for primary and secondary outcomes. At the individual level measures of reliable and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful change will be calculated and proportions achieving this will be&#xD;
      expressed with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of repeated measures will be used to compare mean scores on measures of physical&#xD;
      health, risk of violence, therapeutic programme completion, recovery and overall functioning,&#xD;
      at time points in advance of the move of the NFMHS to the new Portrane Hospital Campus and&#xD;
      for five years after the move.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lagged causal model analysis will be used to assess the existence and significance of&#xD;
      potential directed relationships between the baseline measures of symptomatology of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and violence risk and final outcome namely length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lagged causal model approach will be used also to examine the relationship between amount&#xD;
      of 'treatment' received and change in outcome measures.&#xD;

        The NFMHS Ireland provides secure forensic mental health services for adult men and women,&#xD;
        who require care and treatment in conditions of therapeutic security.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients are over 18 years. The majority of patients will have a major mental illness,&#xD;
        most commonly treatment resistant schizophrenia, with high rates of polysubstance misuse,&#xD;
        personality co-morbidity and physical health issues such as obesity and type II diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients are deemed to pose a serious risk of violence towards others. All patients are&#xD;
        detained under mental health legislation, with over 40% having been found not guilty by&#xD;
        reason of insanity (not criminally responsible due to illness) of a serious offence.&#xD;
