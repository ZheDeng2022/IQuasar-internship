  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy to self-help Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on insomnia (CBT-I) in Chinese adult&#xD;
      population. Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback is a therapy training aiming at increasing&#xD;
      heart rate oscillations through real-time feedback and slow breathing training. Several&#xD;
      literature has found that HRV biofeedback training is effective in improving HRV and&#xD;
      improving sleep quality and sleep efficiency (Gevirtz, 2013; Lin et al., 2019). On the other&#xD;
      hand, self-help CBT-I is well-studied in efficacy of improving cognition and behaviors and&#xD;
      relieving insomnia (Ho et al., 2014). Rare research study HRV biofeedback as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy to self-help CBT-I (Lehrer, 2017). In the light of this, this study will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of combination of both treatments with that of CBT-I alone, examining whether HRV&#xD;
      biofeedback's focus on psychophysiological domain can help self-help CBT-I in more&#xD;
      significantly improving HRV and sleep quality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy to self-help CBT-I on insomnia. Potential participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from the community through posters, social media sites and/or emails. Prior to all study&#xD;
      procedures, the research purpose and data collection procedure will be given to the&#xD;
      participants and an informed consent will be obtained from potential participants. Around 44&#xD;
      eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either self-help CBT-I with HRV&#xD;
      biofeedback (combined group) or self-help CBT-I only group in a ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      randomization will be performed by an independent assessor using a computer-generated list of&#xD;
      numbers. No deception is necessary. Participants in combined group will receive a booklet&#xD;
      with content related to both self-help CBT-I and HRV biofeedback based on guidelines of&#xD;
      self-help CBT-I and protocol for HRV biofeedback training per week for 6 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
      Participants are required to use around 1 hour to read through the content. The combined&#xD;
      group is requested to perform the HRV biofeedback practice with a Bluetooth sensor connected&#xD;
      with Inner Balance mobile application for around 20 minutes a day, 5-7 days a week and record&#xD;
      their practice. Self-help CBT-I only group will receive a booklet with content related to&#xD;
      self-help CBT-I only per week for 6 consecutive weeks. Participants are required to use 30 to&#xD;
      40 minutes to read through the content. The combined group and self-help CBT-I only group&#xD;
      will complete a set of questionnaires and HRV measurement before the treatment commences,&#xD;
      immediately after treatment, and 4 weeks after the treatment sessions are completed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to wear an Inner Balance bluetooth sensor connected with a mobile application Inner Balance to practice HRV biofeedback for around 30 minutes a day, 5-7 days a week.</description>

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a widely used 24-item scale used to access the sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month interval. The 19 self-rated questions will be used, which is calculated by a seven-component score from: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.</description>
