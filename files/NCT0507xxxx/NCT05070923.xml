      HL is an 8-week, personalized health coaching program that includes a comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment made through a survey and a &quot;virtual' home visit (via video), a goal-directed&#xD;
      strengthening action plan developed by the participant with the guidance of the nurse, a&#xD;
      tailored daily planning guide to enhance action steps and goal attainment, and six weekly 30&#xD;
      minute nurse coaching sessions with participants the Healthie application technology via&#xD;
      their personal home computer, Tablet or Smartphone device. If a participant does not use a&#xD;
      personal device or the device cannot support the Healthie platform, the HL program will&#xD;
      provide a Tablet to them for their use during the program. All video sessions ( ie, home&#xD;
      visit, strengthening plan, and weekly coaching sessions will use a two-way video but only the&#xD;
      audio portions of the sessions will be recorded. The HL program, tailored to each&#xD;
      participant's need for strong and resilient function, encompasses the following key elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Health System Assessment (PHS Survey) - The foundational piece of HL is&#xD;
      strengthening the participant's existing personal health system (PHS) - which we define as&#xD;
      the network and interaction of an individual's strengths (such as beliefs, knowledge and&#xD;
      skill for self-care and independence), social determinants of health, caregiver supports, and&#xD;
      community resources, such as groceries, exercise, transportation, that the participant relies&#xD;
      on to sustain health and function. The survey asks questions in the following domains:&#xD;
      background information including income; social and spiritual network and support; personal&#xD;
      health rating; use of healthcare services (emergency room visits, hospitalizations, primary&#xD;
      care visits); lifestyle habits including use of tobacco, alcohol as well as diet, exercise,&#xD;
      sleep and sexual behavior; health impact on activities, function, and symptoms; and&#xD;
      self-efficacy in performing activities, in symptom management and in medication taking. The&#xD;
      PHS Survey is completed by the participant through the web application and takes about 16&#xD;
      minutes to complete based on pilot data obtained in a sample of community living adults 50&#xD;
      years of age and older with one or more chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PHS Survey results are reviewed by the UMSN Registered Nurse [either Advanced Practice&#xD;
      Registered Nurse (APRN) or BSN- Prepared Registered Nurse (RN)] prior to the virtual home&#xD;
      visit. During the virtual home visit, the nurse reviews the strengths of the PHS Survey,&#xD;
      clarifies any information on the Medical History and conducts a home environment assessment&#xD;
      completed by the participant under the guidance of the nurse. The nurse describes key results&#xD;
      from the PHS Survey particularly focusing on their own words that describe their priority&#xD;
      concerns and goals that they had expressed. The purpose of this is to maximize self-awareness&#xD;
      and bring into focus the individual's own goals, strengths and areas for improvement forming&#xD;
      the framework for beginning the PHS Plan process. The PHS Survey may reveal an individual's&#xD;
      PHS network capacity (family, friends, community-organizations, church groups) to meet the&#xD;
      person's need for additional in-home support for non-medical services such as housekeeping,&#xD;
      bill paying, grocery shopping etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Health System Strengthening Plan (PHS Plan) - The next step of the program includes&#xD;
      creation of an individualized plan to strengthen capacity of the participant for self-care&#xD;
      using the discussion of the PHS Survey and home assessments as a starting point for engaging&#xD;
      the participant. The PHS Plan will be developed with the participant in a 45 - 60 minute&#xD;
      video session the nurse. The PHS Plan assists the individual to set action steps to meet&#xD;
      goals that reflect concerns about managing their medical regimen, medication taking,&#xD;
      symptoms, daily living skills such as Activities of Daily Living (ADLs ) and Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and health behavior choices such as smoking, eating&#xD;
      habits, activity etc. The nurse uses health coach motivational and nursing interviewing&#xD;
      methods to support participant engagement, activation and self-efficacy in skills and&#xD;
      decision-making. Goals and action steps progress throughout the 8-week program, with the&#xD;
      guidance of the nurse, as the participant achieves success in reaching goals, making more&#xD;
      independent choices, and gains self-care efficacy. By the conclusion of the HL program the&#xD;
      participant is expected to have experienced the process of goal/action step/success so as to&#xD;
      have sustaining capacity to continue the process without requiring the intensive support that&#xD;
      HL provides.&#xD;
