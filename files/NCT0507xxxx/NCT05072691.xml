  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, usually presenting as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The course of MS following&#xD;
      first symptoms is unpredictable, as approximately 30% of patients with MS have a benign&#xD;
      course and don't develop significant disability while another 20-30% progress to severe&#xD;
      disability within a relatively short time period. In this context, it is difficult to counsel&#xD;
      an individual patient and choose the best treatment option at time of diagnosis. For these&#xD;
      reasons, prognostic markers that could be used to predict future disease course are extremely&#xD;
      useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prognostic biomarker currently used in clinical practice&#xD;
      are oligoclonal bands (OCB) that can predict conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS,&#xD;
      although this observation is not consistent. However, OCB analyses are qualitative with&#xD;
      issues in reproducibility and a limited dynamic range. CSF immunoglobulin (Ig) free light&#xD;
      chains (FLC) are a quantitative measure of humoral response in CSF that has showed greater&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity than OCB for confirming diagnosis of MS. Moreover, in few recent&#xD;
      studies they seem to have also a prognostic value, predicting conversion from CIS to&#xD;
      clinically definite MS and correlating with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optic Neuritis (ON) can be a first clinical relapse of MS and is particularly interesting&#xD;
      because it may constitute a suitable clinical model for neuroprotection studies, as visual&#xD;
      function can be measured with quantitative methods, including Visual Evoked Potential (VEP)&#xD;
      and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to better explore the utility of CSF Ig FLC as potential prognostic&#xD;
      biomarker for MS, and to predict the recovery of visual function after ON, as model of MS&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study its potential correlation with MS relapses, with changes in&#xD;
      several functional outcome scores, exploring physical disability, fatigue, behavior,&#xD;
      cognition, upper and lower extremity function, and with MRI disease activity. For a subgroup&#xD;
      of patient, the investigators aim to explore its potential correlation with in vivo measures&#xD;
      of demyelination and neuronal and axonal loss after ON, as model of potential recovery after&#xD;
      MS relapse. The investigators aim also to compare the prognostic value of Ig FLC with&#xD;
      Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a potential prognostic biomarker wider studied in MS.&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system, usually presenting as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The course of MS following&#xD;
      first symptoms is unpredictable, as approximately 30% of patients with MS have a benign&#xD;

      disability within a relatively short time period. In this context, it is difficult to counsel&#xD;
      an individual patient and choose the best treatment option at the time of diagnosis. For&#xD;
      these reasons, prognostic markers that could be used to predict future disease course are&#xD;
      extremely useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prognostic biomarker currently used in clinical practice&#xD;
      are oligoclonal bands (OCB), that can predict the conversion from CIS to clinically definite&#xD;
      MS, although this observation is not consistent. However, OCB analyses are qualitative, with&#xD;
      issues in reproducibility and a limited dynamic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF immunoglobulin (Ig) free light chains (FLC) are a quantitative measure of humoral&#xD;
      response in CSF that had shown greater sensitivity and specificity than OCB for confirming&#xD;
      diagnosis of MS. Moreover, in few recent studies, they showed to have also a potential&#xD;
      prognostic value, predicting conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS and correlating&#xD;
      with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a scale widely used in clinical practice as&#xD;
      marker of MS disability. However, this scale counts very close to ambulation abilities and&#xD;
      poorly correlates with other frequent MS symptoms, such as upper extremity disability,&#xD;
      fatigue, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most currently studied biomarkers of disease activity and treatment response in&#xD;
      MS, not yet widely available in clinical practice, is represented by Neurofilament light&#xD;
      chain (NfL). Elevated CSF and blood concentrations of NfL were found to correlate with an&#xD;
      increase in the number of relapses, disability worsening, MRI disease activity, and brain&#xD;
      volume loss in MS. Blood NfL was shown to strongly correlate with NfL in the CSF of patients&#xD;
      with MS and has been proposed as an easily accessible biomarker of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optic Neuritis (ON) can be a first clinical manifestation of MS and is particularly&#xD;
      interesting since it may constitute a suitable clinical model for neuroprotection studies.&#xD;
      First, visual function can be measured with quantitative methods, including low-contrast&#xD;
      acuity, visual fields, and color discrimination. Secondly, Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) with&#xD;
      the evaluation of P100 latency, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with the evaluation of&#xD;
      Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) and Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, represent in-vivo&#xD;
      measures of demyelination, and neuronal and axonal loss secondary to ON, respectively. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to better explore the utility of CSF Ig FLC as potential prognostic&#xD;
      biomarker of disease activity, disability worsening, and treatment response in patients with&#xD;
      MS, and as potential predictor of visual recovery after ON as model of MS relapse. To&#xD;
      investigate the prognostic value of CSF Ig FLC, the investigators evaluate the correlation of&#xD;
      CSF Ig FLC at the time of MS diagnosis with clinical relapse, with changes in several&#xD;
      functional outcome scores, exploring physical disability, fatigue, behavior, cognition, upper&#xD;
      and lower extremity functions, and with MRI disease activity. For a subgroup of patient, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to explore the correlation of CSF Ig FLC with in vivo measures of&#xD;
      demyelination, neuronal and axonal loss after ON, as model of potential recovery after MS&#xD;
      relapse. The investigators aim also to compare the prognostic value of Ig FLC with&#xD;
      Neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations in CSF and blood.&#xD;
