  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients for Covid-19 are extremely isolated from their families for a long and&#xD;
      uncertain period of time .This traumatic separation makes patients vulnerable to different&#xD;
      degrees of stress disorders as well as depression and anxiety , fear of the unknown and&#xD;
      dying, sleeplessness, agitation, discomfort, pain, immobility, frustration and inability to&#xD;
      relax .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MusicTtherapy has been shown to play a valuable role in the care of patients with serious&#xD;
      illness, helping to address physical symptoms and psychological distress .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of introducing Music therapy (MT) on&#xD;
      site with Covid-19 patients as a supporting complementary/non-pharmacological intervention,&#xD;
      to investigate the immediate effects a single MT session has on anxiety, heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (O2Sat) and satisfaction compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to verify the hypotheses of the study, an RCT (mixed-methods approach pre -post&#xD;
      design) will be carried out on patients diagnosed with SARS-COV2 admitted to Covid Hospital&#xD;
      Bari, randomized into two groups: control group (B) and treatment group (A). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study starts on 15th April 2021 and it is expected to run for 1 mounth (15th May 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funding by University of Bari.&#xD;

    <description>State Trait Anxiety Inventory Y-1(STAI-Y1) was used to measure how the subject felt in that moment. Subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their anxious feelings on 20 items on a four point scale: not at all, somewhat, moderately so, or very much so. STAI-Y values &lt;40 defined absence of anxiety, between 40 and 50 mild anxiety, 51-60 moderate anxiety, and&gt; 59 severe anxiety</description>
