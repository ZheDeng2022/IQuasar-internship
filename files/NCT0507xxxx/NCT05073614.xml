      Treatment of H.pylori may not be achieved in many patients with chronic gastritis.&#xD;
      Termination of the inflammatory respose produced by h.pylori may be useful in management of&#xD;
      difficult cases. Heparanase is a pro-inflammatory mediator. Blocking of heparanase may relief&#xD;
      the symptoms of chronic gastritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic gastritis (CG) is a very common disease. The incidence of CG is not accurately known.&#xD;
      However, it is clear that the incidence of CG is increasing by advancing age. CG is divided&#xD;
      into two main types; type A or immune and type B or non-immune gastritis. Both types of CG&#xD;
      share the same histological features. However, type A is less common, usually affects the&#xD;
      gastric fundus in a diffuse manner and separates the antrum. on the contrary; type B or&#xD;
      non-immune CG, which is by far more common, inevitably develops in the antrum and progresses&#xD;
      proximally. H. pylori-induced CG usually requires antibiotic therapy to eradicate the&#xD;
      causative organism and subsequently terminate the inflammatory response and the symptoms of&#xD;
      gastritis. However, eradication of H. pylori is difficult to be achieved in many patients.&#xD;
      Previous studies established that there is a vicious circle between H. pylori-infected&#xD;
      gastric epithelial cells and the gastric mucosal inflammatory cells. Heparanase (HPSE) is a&#xD;
      mammalian áµ¦-endoglucoronidase. HPSE plays a critical role in multiple inflammatory processes&#xD;
      by degrading and remodeling heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains in the extracellular matrix&#xD;
      (ECM). This leads to release of multiple cytokines and chemokines which are located in the&#xD;
      ECM. HPSE is a drug target, three inhibitors of this enzyme have been tested in early stage&#xD;
      clinical trials. Many studies reported that the expression of HPSE is up-regulated in a&#xD;
      variety of inflammatory conditions as ulcerative colitis, acute pancreatitis, acute&#xD;
      vasculitis and sepsis. The aim of this work is to evaluate the role of heparanase (HPSE) in&#xD;
      chronic gastritis (CG) by correlating the expression of HPSE to different histological&#xD;
      features of CG as presence of H. pylori, chronic inflammatory infiltrate, gastric atrophy,&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia and neutrophil infiltrate (activity), to detect new treatment&#xD;
      modalities in CG.&#xD;
