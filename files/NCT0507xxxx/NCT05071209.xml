  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial tests the safety, best dose, and whether elimusertib works in treating&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors that have come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Elimusertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAY&#xD;
      1895344 (elimusertib) administered as an oral tablet, twice per day for 3 days on and 4 days&#xD;
      off to patients &lt; 18 years of age with recurrent or refractory Ewing sarcoma, PAX3-FOXO1&#xD;
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and non-central nervous system (CNS) solid tumors or lymphoma with&#xD;
      specific deleterious deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response (DDR) pathway alterations.&#xD;
      (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II. To define the antitumor activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib)&#xD;
      in pediatric patients and young adults with recurrent or refractory Ewing sarcoma. (Phase 2)&#xD;
      III. To define the antitumor activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) in pediatric patients and&#xD;
      young adults with recurrent or refractory PAX3-FOXO1 fusion positive alveolar&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma. (Phase 2) IV. To define and describe the toxicities of BAY 1895344&#xD;
      (elimusertib) administered on this schedule. (Phase 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with recurrent or refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the biologic activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) by immunohistochemical&#xD;
      assessments of phosphorylated (p)ATR, pH2AX, and pKAP1 in paired tissue samples before and&#xD;
      after treatment with BAY 1895344 (elimusertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess whether the activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) is influenced by alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT), as well as tumor tissue expression of ATM, PGBD5, and/or R-loops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess whether the activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) is associated with tumor&#xD;
      mutational processes, as measured by whole genome tumor tissue sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To preliminary determine the anti-tumor activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) in children&#xD;
      &lt; 18 years of age within the confines of a phase 1 study (Part A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the antitumor activity of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      non-CNS solid tumors or lymphomas with specific deleterious alterations in DDR pathway genes.&#xD;
      (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II dose escalation&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive elimusertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and&#xD;
      22-24. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 26 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 24 months, and then annually for up to 60 months.&#xD;

             patients with tumors previously metastatic to the CNS (or other non-oncologic reasons)&#xD;
             must have been stable for at least 7 days prior to study enrollment. Patients who are&#xD;

          -  Patients with known or possible bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for&#xD;
             study provided they meet the blood counts in above inclusion criteria (may receive&#xD;
             transfusions provided they are not known to be refractory to red cell or platelet&#xD;
             transfusions). These patients will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. At least&#xD;
             5 of every cohort of 6 patients must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity for the&#xD;
             dose-escalation part of the study. If dose-limiting hematologic toxicity is observed,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of&#xD;
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies, OR because there&#xD;
             is yet no available information regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities.&#xD;
             Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Males or females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two&#xD;

             last dose of BAY 1895344 (elimusertib) on the study. Abstinence is an acceptable&#xD;
             method of birth control. Female patients must not breastfeed during treatment and&#xD;
             until 4 months after last study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroids: Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable or&#xD;
             decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not&#xD;

             must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 are not eligible. Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided&#xD;
             from 14 days prior to enrollment to the end of the study. Drugs that are considered&#xD;
             sensitive or narrow therapeutic range CYP3A4 substrates should be avoided for the&#xD;
             duration of protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dedicated CNS imaging is not required but patients with current active CNS metastasis&#xD;
             whether symptomatic or discovered incidentally without clinical symptoms, will be&#xD;
