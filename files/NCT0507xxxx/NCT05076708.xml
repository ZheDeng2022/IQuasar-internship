    <textblock>
      This within-subjects study aims to evaluate the effects of IQOS use on combustible cigarette&#xD;
      smoking behaviors among 100 cigarette smokers who completed the study. After measuring&#xD;
      baseline cigarette smoking rate, participants will receive an IQOS device and be instructed&#xD;
      to use it (versus cigarettes) over a 14-day period. The investigators will also examine which&#xD;
      objective and subjective effects of IQOS use predict a complete and incomplete switch from&#xD;
      cigarettes to IQOS.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the longitudinal daily count of cigarettes from Intake to the end of the IQOS switch phase. Daily cigarette consumption will be determined by counting the daily spent cigarette filters returned for each of the 14 days (days 8-21).</description>

    <measure>Motivation for smoking cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The contemplation ladder will be used to assess readiness to consider smoking cessation. The contemplation latter is designed to measure a smoker's position on an 11-point scale (0-10) range, from having no thought of quitting to taking action to quit, and has been successfully employed in several diverse smoking populations [60, 62]. We will assess changes in quitting motivation from baseline to day 21 (end of study).</description>
