  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive an infusion of both study drugs (3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS) and&#xD;
      will discontinue antiretroviral therapy (which is the treatment for HIV) two days later.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a second dose of the first study drug (3BNC117-LS) at week 12 if&#xD;
      the HIV infection is maintained and participants remain off of antiretroviral therapy. The&#xD;
      study hypothesizes that intravenous infusions (which means medication is delivered directly&#xD;
      into a participant's vein) of the combination of study drugs will be safe and well tolerated,&#xD;
      will maintain control of the HIV infection without antiretroviral therapy, and may be&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in HIV found in cells that were previously infected with HIV but&#xD;
      not actively producing HIV in the body.&#xD;
