  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avoidance of unnecessary blood transfusions has always been a focus of clinical research. The&#xD;
      rate of perioperative red blood cell transfusion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery under&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass reaches between 50-70%, and the intraoperative red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusion rate is 30-50%. Regarding whether and when to perform a blood transfusion, it is&#xD;
      necessary to comprehensively consider the benefits and risks brought by blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on blood transfusion strategies have mainly focused on the hemoglobin&#xD;
      threshold, but the hemoglobin level does not fully reflect the level of tissue oxygenation.&#xD;
      Mixed venous blood oxygen saturation has been widely studied as a valuable indicator&#xD;
      reflecting the balance of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. But due to the difficulty&#xD;
      of placing a pulmonary artery floating catheter for monitoring, its clinical application is&#xD;
      limited. Central venous oxygen saturation requires only a small collection of blood samples,&#xD;
      which can reflect the oxygen saturation of the superior vena cava, and studies have shown&#xD;
      that it can effectively guide the blood transfusion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Existing studies have shown that in critically ill patients, the use of arterial-venous&#xD;
      oxygen difference &gt; 3.7 mL as an indicator to guide blood transfusion can lead to a higher&#xD;
      90-day survival rate. However, the relationship between the arterial-venous oxygen difference&#xD;
      and the incidence of adverse events in cardiac surgery patients under CPB remains unclear.&#xD;
      Whether increasing the arterial-venous oxygen difference during surgery can reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative adverse events remains to be clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to collect intraoperative arterial blood and central venous blood samples&#xD;
      from cardiac surgery patients undergoing CPB, and analyze the relationship between&#xD;
      arterial-venous oxygen difference and the incidence of postoperative adverse events.&#xD;

      The &gt;18 y/o patients who undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and with a&#xD;
      preoperative additive EuroSCORE Iâ‰¥ 6 are enrolled. Blood samples will be collected through&#xD;
      arteries and central venous at the following intraoperative time points: before CPB, during&#xD;
      CPB, after CPB, before transfusion, and after transfusion. The observation will end by&#xD;
      hospital discharge or 28 days after surgery, whichever came first. The follow-up will&#xD;
      continue to one year after surgery.&#xD;
