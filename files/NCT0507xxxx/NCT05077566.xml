      The main objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the immediate hypoalgesic effect of an aerobic exercise session of different&#xD;
      intensities in patients with chronic low back pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To explore whether pain intensity, level of physical activity, functionality,&#xD;
      catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, anxiety and depression interfere with the immediate&#xD;
      hypoalgesic effect of exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 3 groups of participants, an asymptomatic control group that will not perform&#xD;
      any exercise and two groups of individuals with low back pain. One group will perform&#xD;
      exercise at 90% VO2máx and the other at 60% VO2máx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the three groups will be assessed at baseline for pressure pain threshold, pain&#xD;
      intensity, pain phenotype, disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression, physical activity, and aerobic capacity. In addition, pressure pain threshold and&#xD;
      pain intensity will also be assessed at post-intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Chester Step Test (CST) which gives aerobic capacity and allows the calculation of percentage of VO2 max.</description>

    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results can be reported in categories (low activity levels, moderate activity levels or high activity levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. This scale has 2 subscales, one for Anxiety and one for Depression both scored 0 to 21 and higher values represent higher levels of anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Catastrophizing Scale (range 0-52 and higher values are indicative of higher pain catastrophizing)</description>

    <measure>Fear of movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the TAMPA Scale of Kinesiophobia (range: 13-52 and higher values are indicative of higher levels of fear of movement)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Base</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (range: 0 to 24, with higher values indicating higher disability)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain phenotype</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Pain DETECT Scale. The final score between -1 and 38, indicates the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component. A score of ) 12 indicates that pain is unlikely to have a neuropathic component (&lt; 15%), while a score of * 19 suggests that pain is likely to have a neuropathic component (&gt; 90%).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms of central sensitization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Central Sensitization Inventory. Score ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate higher symptoms of central sensitization.</description>
