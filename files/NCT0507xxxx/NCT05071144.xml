  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Creation of a pediatric robotic spine surgery Registry will allow for data collection and&#xD;
      analysis on the coupled use of robotics and navigation in pediatric spine deformity surgery&#xD;
      across participating study institutions. Eventually, an educational and informative framework&#xD;
      for this technology will be established.&#xD;
