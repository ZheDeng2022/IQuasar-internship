      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a clinical trial with control group, blinded, randomized with block method&#xD;
      that was done at Kamali hospital, Karaj, Iran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was carried out between October 2019 and June 2021. At first, the researchers&#xD;

&#xD;
      A written consent form was obtained from all patients and ethics committee of Alborz&#xD;
      University of Medical Sciences confirmed the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size that require to compare the mean of the two groups, with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval and 90% test power and considering the technical difference of 0.5 hours, was&#xD;
      estimated to be 84 people. Then patients, randomly assigned using block method with&#xD;
      statistician help, was divided into two groups of 42 case and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was performed on 82 full term pregnant females (38 weeks or more).they had&#xD;
      indication for termination of pregnancy, by accident and based on the coding done by a&#xD;
      statistician to identify groups of users of pill A or pill B, 14 pills are used vaginally .&#xD;
      The client and the researcher are blinded and the pharmacist delivers the dexamethasone and&#xD;
      placebo tablets with codes A and B to the researcher. Group A received 14 dexamethasone&#xD;
      tablets with a dose of 0.5 mg for vaginal use and also group B received 14 placebo tablets&#xD;
      for vaginal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were Iranian, Prim gravid pregnancy with Normal of Body Mass Index (BMI), Single&#xD;
      Pregnancy presentation cephalic in Sonography, Age 18 years old to 35 years old, Gestational&#xD;
      age 38 weeks, Bishop score 2 and less, with Normal Non Stress Test (NST), Estimate of Fetus&#xD;
      Weight 2500-4000 gr and didn't take hormonal, herbal and chemical drugs and having a healthy&#xD;
      water bag were enrolled to this Study.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects are assigned to two groups by randomization block balanced method allocation and using quadruple blocks. In this case, there are 6 modes And in each case, 2 people will be in the control group and 2 people will be in the intervention group. Thus, by using the table of random numbers and assigning the numbers 1 to 6 to groups of 4 people, people are finally assigned to two groups of intervention and control.</intervention_model_description>
