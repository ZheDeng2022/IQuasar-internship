    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of scleral contact lens wear on a DE&#xD;
      population using coated (Hydra-PEG) and uncoated (control) lenses. Symptoms of DE, quality of&#xD;
      the tear film, quality of life, epithelial and overall corneal thickness, vision and comfort&#xD;
      will be assessed before and after dispensing and wearing the lenses for four weeks.&#xD;

    <description>he CLDEQ-8 is a validated questionnaire used to quantify symptoms experienced by the contact lenses (CLs) wearer. The participants were asked to respond to 8 questions about how their CLs performed over the preceding 2-week period. 4 questions (Eye discomfort, Eye dryness, Changeable blurry vision and Closing your eyes) answered on a scale of 0=Never to 4=Constantly; 3 questions about the end of wearing time (Discomfort, Dryness, Changeable blurry vision) answered on a scale of 0=Never have it to 5=Very Intense and 1 question (Removing your lenses) on a scale of 1=Never to 6=Several times a day for a total possible score of 1(best) to 37 (worst).</description>
