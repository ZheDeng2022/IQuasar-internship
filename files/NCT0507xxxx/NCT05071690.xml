      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the&#xD;
      globe. A striking and consistent observation has been the difference in severity of COVID-19&#xD;
      at different ages: severity, the need for hospitalization and mortality rise steeply with&#xD;
      older age while severe disease and death are relatively rare in children and young adults.&#xD;
      Most infants and children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms,&#xD;
      most commonly fever, cough, pharyngitis, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of&#xD;
      smell or taste. Whether infants and children are also less often infected by SARS-CoV-2 is an&#xD;
      ongoing debate. Large epidemiological studies suggest that infants and children comprise only&#xD;
      1 to 2% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases. However, these numbers heavily depend on testing criteria&#xD;
      and, in many reports, testing was done only in individuals who were symptomatic or required&#xD;
      hospitalization, which is less often the case for children. Some studies suggest that infants&#xD;
      and children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2.9 However, more&#xD;
      recent studies report that children are less likely to get infected after contact with a&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.10-14 It has been suggested that children and adolescents have&#xD;
      similar viral loads and may therefore be as likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 as adults. In&#xD;
      addition, the viral load may be similar in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. However,&#xD;
      reassuringly, transmission in schools from children either to other children or to adults has&#xD;
      been rare. The observation that children are less often infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that&#xD;
      they have less severe symptoms is similar to that reported for SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. However, this pattern is strikingly different to that for&#xD;
      infection with most other respiratory viruses (eg, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),&#xD;
      metapneumovirus, parainfluenza or influenza viruses), for which the prevalence and severity&#xD;
      are both higher in children.Dr Amr kamel khalil Ahmed and Dr. Mahmoud Elkazzaz, the lead&#xD;
      investigators of this observational study , recently published a preprint that demonstrated&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had a high binding affinity and greatest interactions with ACE2&#xD;
      active sites, as well as a moderate binding affinity and moderate interactions with the&#xD;
      active sites of IL-6. The Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) interacts with different active sites of&#xD;
      IL6 and ACE2 which are involved in direct or indirect contacts with the ACE2 and IL-6&#xD;
      receptors which might act as potential blockers of functional ACE2 and IL-6 receptor complex.&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was detected in abundance in breast milk and other algal sources&#xD;
      milk supplement used for newborns and children's feeding. As a result, we believe that&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may protect children and newborns thorough competing with COVID-19&#xD;
      for ACE2 receptors and inhibiting IL-6 activity and may possibly help them avoid a cytokine&#xD;
      storm and save their lives through inhibiting IL-6 and preventing SARS-CoV-2 RBD attachment&#xD;
      to ACE2&#xD;
