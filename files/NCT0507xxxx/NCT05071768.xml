  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a transdiagnostic intervention whose aim is to&#xD;
      reduce experiential avoidance and promote psychological flexibility, which involves engaging&#xD;
      in values-based behaviour while accepting painful internal experiences with openness and&#xD;
      awareness. A growing body of research supports the efficacy of brief ACT for a variety of&#xD;
      issues, including depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and stress. Given that ACT is a&#xD;
      transdiagnostic intervention that targets the core processes related to human suffering, this&#xD;
      treatment may be particularly useful for implementation in primary care with diverse groups&#xD;
      of individuals and presentations. The objective of this study is to develop and pilot test a&#xD;
      brief, virtual, group-based ACT intervention for depression and anxiety delivered in primary&#xD;
      care settings to determine if a future randomized controlled trial of this group treatment is&#xD;
      both warranted and feasible. The investigators will examine (1) the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the study procedures, (2) clinician adherence to the treatment protocol, and&#xD;
      (3) a preliminary analysis of the treatment effectiveness. A total of 3 groups (N = 30-45)&#xD;
      will be conducted via three primary care clinics in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The group&#xD;
      treatment will be delivered over four 90-minute sessions. Participants will complete&#xD;
      assessment measures at pretreatment, post-treatment, and at two follow-up time points&#xD;
      (1-month post-treatment and 3-6-months post-treatment). All assessments and treatment&#xD;
      sessions will be conducted virtually via videoconferencing platform.&#xD;
