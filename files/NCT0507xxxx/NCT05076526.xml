  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent chronic condition which most commonly affects the knee.&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of OA involves initial mechanical stress resulting in cartilage lesions,&#xD;
      leading to inflammatory processes causing joint degradation. Numerous pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies have been employed, including hyaluronic acid (HA)&#xD;
      supplementations to alleviate the joint damage from mechanical load by acting as a shock&#xD;
      absorber which provides lubrication, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections to reduce&#xD;
      inflammation. However, HA is unable to facilitate cartilage regeneration and corticosteroids&#xD;
      has numerous undesirable side effects which render them unsustainable treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, many studies worldwide have demonstrated that platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) stimulates&#xD;
      cartilage repair by actively secreting growth factors which activate cell proliferation and&#xD;
      differentiation thereby promoting tissue regeneration. However, there has been varying&#xD;
      results across various RCTs due to the heterogeneity of studies, with inconclusive&#xD;
      recommendations on the treatment regimen for PRP-HA. Currently, PRP treatment is also not&#xD;
      formally recognized as a treatment modality for knee OA in many countries, including&#xD;
      Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of Cellular Matrix (CM) PRP-HA&#xD;
      versus HA (Synolis VA) intra-articular injections in knee OA through quantifying the&#xD;
      improvement in long-term treatment outcomes such as pain, stiffness, and functional&#xD;
      impairment, potentially improving the quality of life for many patients with knee OA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro experimentations have also established the efficacy of PRP, where chondrocytes&#xD;
      stimulated with PRP has shown to increase proteoglycan and collagen synthesis which bears&#xD;
      similar biochemical qualities to that of hyaline cartilage. PRP has also shown to provide&#xD;
      more critical growth factors (including PDGF, TGF-beta, IGF, EGF, VEGF, FGF) than&#xD;
      conventional culture media, increasing the synthesis of major cellular proteins and collagen&#xD;
      in the extracellular component of intervertebral disc cells, potentially enhancing the&#xD;
      functional properties of joint cartilages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, cellular matrix (CM) remains as the only device which allows for the combination&#xD;
      of PRP and HA to be delivered to patients within a single intra-articular injection. However,&#xD;
      there are insufficient large-scale studies to reliably evaluate the efficacy of PRP-HA on&#xD;
      knee OA and formulate a universal recommendation on its treatment regimen. There are also no&#xD;
      RCTs conducted on our local population to explore the effects of CM-PRP-HA on knee OA.&#xD;
