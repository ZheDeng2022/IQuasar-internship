  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emphasis on this study is to review the use of PBMT as a potential treatment modality to&#xD;
      improve both sleep symptoms and consequent neuropsychological functions affected by sleep&#xD;
      disturbances in a cohort of post-mTBI patients with sleep issues not secondary to sleep&#xD;
      apnea.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an acute neurophysiological event related&#xD;
      to blunt impact applied to the head and/or neck due to sudden acceleration, deceleration or&#xD;
      rotational forces. It can happen due to motor vehicle accidents, sport or recreational&#xD;
      injury, falls, workplace injury or assault. mTBI can be differentiated from moderate and&#xD;
      severe traumatic brain injuries by having negative imaging or laboratory results and a&#xD;
      Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15. Current treatment modalities for the various&#xD;
      symptoms associated with mTBI are mostly supportive: pain medication, antidepressants,&#xD;
      psychotherapy, physiotherapy, vision therapy and referral to sleep clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mTBI symptoms are usually divided into four groups: cognitive symptoms, physical symptoms,&#xD;
      emotional symptoms and sleep symptoms. Although most of these symptoms resolve or improve&#xD;
      with or without treatment within 3 months following injury there is a significant population&#xD;
      of post-mTBI patients who continue to suffer from symptoms 3 months to years after their&#xD;
      injury. Previously called Post-Concussive Syndrome (PCS) most groups now classify PCS as a&#xD;
      neurological disorder with persistent post-concussive symptoms. Insufficient and disturbed&#xD;
      sleep are reported by half of all patients and are among the most common complaints following&#xD;
      mTBI, and can develop during the early to chronic post-mTBI phases. Various sleep&#xD;
      abnormalities, including post-TBI insomnia, hypersomnia, and sleep apnea are frequently&#xD;
      observed. Most cases of sleep symptoms associated with mTBI that are diagnosed during sleep&#xD;
      studies tend to be apnea related, although the cause of this is still unknown. Sleep apnea&#xD;
      can be obstructive or central sleep apnea, but both types tend to respond well to Continuous&#xD;
      Positive Airway Pressure. For other types of non-apneic sleep related symptoms post mTBI&#xD;
      though, treatment can vary from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to various sleep&#xD;
      medications. However, it is noted that despite an improvement in objective sleep symptoms&#xD;
      with conventional approaches to patients with mTBI, there continues to be a lack of&#xD;
      improvement in terms of subjective sleepiness or neuropsychological functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is an innovative modality for the stimulation of neural&#xD;
      activity in order to improve brain function and is currently under investigation as a&#xD;
      treatment for several diverse neurological disorders, including concussions. Noted among the&#xD;
      effects of PBMT among post-mTBI patients in the clinical setting is a subjective improvement&#xD;
      in sleep, sometimes described by patients as &quot;the best sleep they've ever had.&quot; The emphasis&#xD;
      on this study is to review the use of PBMT as a potential treatment modality to improve both&#xD;
      sleep symptoms and consequent neuropsychological functions affected by sleep disturbances in&#xD;
      a cohort of post-mTBI patients with sleep issues not secondary to sleep apnea.&#xD;

    <measure>Statistically significant changes in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores from baseline and at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 19-item, self-rated questionnaire designed to measure sleep quality and disturbance over the past month in clinical populations. The 19 items are grouped into 7 components, including (1) sleep duration, (2) sleep disturbance, (3) sleep latency, (4) daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness, (5) sleep efficiency, (6) overall sleep quality, and (7) sleep medication use. Each of the sleep components yields a score ranging from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating the greatest dysfunction. The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality.</description>

    <description>The short 10-item version of the original 30 item FOSQ using selected items from each subscale and providing the same definition of sleepy and tired. Items for the FOSQ-10 are distributed among the same subscales as follows: 1) activity level (3 items), 2) vigilance (3 items), 3) intimacy and sexual relationships (1 item), 4) general productivity (2 items), and 5) social outcomes (1 item).</description>

    <measure>Statistically significant changes in the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) scores from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. Respondents use a scale ranging from 1 to 7 to indicate how aptly certain statements regarding fatigue represent their experiences. Several positively phrased items are reverse scored. Higher total scores correspond with more acute levels of fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Statistically significant changes in the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) scores from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RPQ is a self-report scale to measure the severity of post-concussive symptoms following a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). It is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of 16 different PCS symptoms that typically follow TBI. Patients are asked to rate their symptoms before and after their injury and also to rate the severity of their symptoms in the last 24 h. Items follow a 5-point ordinal rating system where 0 = never experienced at all, 1 = no more of a problem, 2 = a mild problem, 3 = a moderate problem, and 4 = a severe problem. Thus total scores using the sum of all items can theoretically range from 0 to 64.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overnight measurement of sleep stage duration in minutes utilizing 3 studies: electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and surface electromyography (EMG). Other parameters that may also be monitored to measure sleep stage duration include the following: Electrocardiography, Pulse oximetry, Respiratory effort (thoracic and abdominal), End tidal or transcutaneous Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Sound recordings to measure snoring, Surface EMG monitoring of limb muscles (to detect limb movements, periodic or other). These studies are consolidated by a sleep physician to examine and assess each sleep stage for breathing and movement during sleep.</description>
