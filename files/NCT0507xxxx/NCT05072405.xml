  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project includes two separate pharmacokinetic studies with simvastatin and rosuvastatin,&#xD;
      respectively. Each study is an open-label, single-dose, randomized, three-phase (no herbs,&#xD;
      with green tea, with soy isoflavones) clinical pharmacokinetic study design with a wash-out&#xD;
      of at least 4-weeks between phases. The aim is to examine whether green tea extract and soy&#xD;
      isoflavones affect the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and rosuvastatin in healthy subjects&#xD;
      and whether these interactions are influenced by polymorphisms in the relevant drug&#xD;
      transporters, solute carrier 1B1 (SLCO1B1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette&#xD;
      G2 (ABCG2) and to identify whether polymorphisms in drug transporters influence the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and rosuvastatin. After informed consent is obtained,&#xD;
      subjects are required to abstain from any prescription or non-prescription medications 2&#xD;
      weeks before and throughout the study. Subjects are given a single dose of simvastatin 20 mg&#xD;
      (Zocor®, MSD) or rosuvastatin 10 mg (Crestor®, Astra Zeneca) on 3 occasions: 1. without&#xD;
      herbs; 2. with green tea extract; 3. with soy isoflavones extract. The green tea extract and&#xD;
      soy isoflavones extract are given at a dose containing epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 800 mg&#xD;
      once daily or isoflavones 120 mg once daily for 14 days before statin dosing with at least&#xD;
      4-week washout period between phases. Blood samples are taken at intervals from 0 to 24 hours&#xD;
      on the statin dosing days. During the study, subjects are reminded frequently of the&#xD;
      requirements on diet.&#xD;

      Healthy Chinese male subjects aged 18-45 years are recruited from a pool of over 200 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers who had been genotyped for the SLCO1B1 388A&gt;G, 521T&gt;C and ABCG2 421C&gt;A&#xD;
      polymorphisms. All subjects are required to abstain from any prescription or non-prescription&#xD;
      medications 2 weeks before and throughout the study. They are not allowed to take alcohol,&#xD;
      tea, grapefruit juice, caffeine, soybean milk or dietary supplements and herbal products 2&#xD;
      weeks before and throughout the entire study period. They are also not allowed to smoke 2&#xD;
      weeks before and throughout the study. Subjects are requested to fast for 10 h before and 4 h&#xD;
      after drug administration during the blood sampling sessions. Meals are standardized and&#xD;
      consumed at 4 h and 10 h post dosing. Drinking water are not allowed from 1 h pre-dose to 1 h&#xD;
      post-dose except that needed for drug dosing at the time of blood sampling sessions. Subjects&#xD;
      are given a single dose of simvastatin 20 mg (Zocor®, MSD) or rosuvastatin 10 mg (Crestor®,&#xD;
      Astra Zeneca) on 3 occasions: 1. without herbs; 2. with green tea extract; 3. with soy&#xD;
      isoflavones extract. The green tea extract and soy isoflavones extract are given at a dose&#xD;
      containing EGCG 800 mg once daily or isoflavones 120 mg once daily for 14 days before statin&#xD;
      dosing with at least 4-week washout period between phases.&#xD;
