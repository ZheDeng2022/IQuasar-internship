  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection through regular diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) is an effective method&#xD;
      of preventing vision loss by enabling earlier intervention and timely treatment. It is&#xD;
      recommended that all people with diabetes receive regular DRS, either annually or&#xD;
      bi-annually. Current DRS practice in Canada, however, falls remarkably short of recommended&#xD;
      DRS rates resulting in preventable vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators use population health-based approach to diabetes care.&#xD;
      Linked provincial administrative data will be leveraged to consistently identify all those&#xD;
      that have not had DRS in 425 days with the goal to improve outcomes, equity and potentially&#xD;
      reduce the cost of care delivery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in working age Canadians. Canada&#xD;
      fall remarkably short of this recommended rate resulting in many Canadians with preventable&#xD;
      vision loss, despite the availability of ophthalmology and/or optometry services covered by&#xD;
      provincial health insurance plans. It is estimated that in Ontario alone that up to 40% of&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes have not had their eyes screened for retinopathy. To address the&#xD;
      low rate, tele-ophthalmology or Tele-Retina, using telemedicine resources, has been an&#xD;
      approach used in a variety of primary health care settings in urban, rural and remote areas&#xD;
      across Canada. In the United Kingdom, a population-based approach to this issue have been&#xD;
      taken and have lowered the unscreened rate, resulting in diabetic retinopathy no longer being&#xD;
      the leading cause of blindness in working age individuals. New strategies are required to&#xD;
      identify, engage, and provide ongoing monitoring to those requiring DR screening in Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic medical records in doctors' offices do not receive information about the&#xD;
      status of patients with diabetes retinopathy screening status. This information only exists&#xD;
      through provincial data and public insurance system billings. Using administrative health&#xD;
      data, the investigators developed a population-based approach to DR screening at community&#xD;
      health centres (CHCs). Patients with diabetes who have not had DR screening in 425 days have&#xD;
      been identified using linked provincial and community-based datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the linking of the Alliance for Healthier Communities dataset with other Ontario&#xD;
      healthcare administrative databases held at Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences&#xD;
      (IC/ES), the investigators have identified clients within the CHC that have not had eyes&#xD;
      checked for signs of retinopathy by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within the previous 425&#xD;
      days. This data is transferred to the CHC and the identified clients will then be called to&#xD;
      let them know about the importance of having their eyes examined and to see if they are&#xD;
      interested in participating in the study. Through the Diabetes Eye Screening Program,&#xD;
      Tele-Retina will be made available through referral. If individuals are not interested in&#xD;
      this program, patients will be encouraged to seek alternate ophthalmology or optometry&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative semi-structured interviews examining diabetic retinopathy screening and the&#xD;
      Tele-Retina process at the CHC, including facilitators and barriers towards diabetes care,&#xD;
      specifically eye care, will be conducted. The investigators will be interviewing patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, healthcare practitioners, CHC staff, management and policy decision-makers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention of providing provincial-level diabetic retinopathy status to primary health&#xD;
      care settings will be evaluated using a mixed-methods implementation-effectiveness hybrid&#xD;
      approach. Evaluation will be conducted concurrently with the study intervention to evaluate&#xD;
      its effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, implementation barriers and key success factors. The&#xD;
      evaluation will consist of 4 main components of 1) an implementation study, 2) a policy&#xD;
      study, 3) clinical evaluation and 4) economic evaluation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall objectives for the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase the number of screened individuals who are at risk for DR within the primary&#xD;
           care settings, and to refer to treatment those at risk of vision loss;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate implementation and policy barriers associated with the transfer and use of&#xD;
           healthcare administrative data related to DR, at a primary care level and DR screening&#xD;
           in general;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate patient and provider experience and attitudes with the initiative, including&#xD;
           sex and gender and socioeconomic factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe the severity of diabetic retinopathy in those individuals who agree to be&#xD;
           screened;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examine the healthcare resource utilization and costs and cost-effectiveness associated&#xD;
           with the intervention.&#xD;
