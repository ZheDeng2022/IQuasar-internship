  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with a run-in period with controlled diet and no drug for 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days. This is to accustom the subjects to the standardized diet and also to determine&#xD;
      baseline fecal fat excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After run-in period, subjects will be randomized to receive either test or reference orlistat&#xD;
      formulations (60 mg or 120 mg) thrice daily under fed conditions for 10 consecutive days.&#xD;
