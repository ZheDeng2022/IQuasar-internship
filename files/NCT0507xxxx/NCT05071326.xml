  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HealthyLifetime (HL) is a person-centered program that enables older adults to maximize&#xD;
      health and optimize functioning - the necessary requisite to successfully remaining&#xD;
      independent in their preferred home setting as long as possible, i.e., to age in place.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HL seeks to intervene early in the aging process when individuals have the best chance for&#xD;
      longer term benefits of changing their health behavior, as a means to stave off functional&#xD;
      decline, and minimize the onset or exacerbation of chronic conditions. And, for individuals&#xD;
      who are experiencing any of the barriers described above, our HL program's Nurse Coaches are&#xD;
      prepared and experienced in helping them achieve their highest level of functioning and&#xD;
      self-care capacity, while integrating and collaborating with, but not duplicating, their&#xD;
      medical services such as primary care, specialty care, and case management or medical social&#xD;
      services. While the latter medically oriented services support clinical management, they do&#xD;
      not focus on helping older adults maximize health and function by building self-care&#xD;
      capacity, long term health behavior change capacity and the functional resilience necessary&#xD;
      to sustain or regain independent living.&#xD;
