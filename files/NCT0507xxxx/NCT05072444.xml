  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      QPX7728 is an ultra-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor, with activity against numerous&#xD;
      beta-lactamases, including class A extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs), class C&#xD;
      cephalosporinases, and extended spectrum class D oxacillinases (OXA) that can hydrolyze&#xD;
      cephalosporins and can be found in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa). QPX7728 is also a potent inhibitor of carbapenemases from all molecular classes,&#xD;
      such as class A Klebsiella pheumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), class B New-Dehli&#xD;
      Metalo-beta-lactamase (NDM) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-betalactamase (VIM), and&#xD;
      class D OXA-48 that are found in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and also class D&#xD;
      carbapenemases such as OXA-23 that are found in carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has listed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and&#xD;
      Acinetobacter as urgent threats and multidrug resistant Pseudomonas, and extended spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae as serious threats [CDC, 2019]. Consistent&#xD;
      with the global nature of these resistant bacteria, the World Health Organization (WHO) has&#xD;
      designated carbapenem-resistant, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa as pathogens for&#xD;
      which new agents are critically needed [WHO, 2017]. Qpex Biopharma is developing a fixed&#xD;
      combination antibiotic of QPX2014 plus an ultra-broad spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor,&#xD;
      QPX7728.&#xD;
