      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by the partial or complete absence of one of the two X&#xD;
&#xD;
      chromosomes in all cells or a portion of cells. Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with TS&#xD;
      and their families are not routinely counseled about fertility issues and options.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about the attitudes of AYAs with TS and their parents or&#xD;
      guardians regarding future fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create and distribute a survey for AYAs with TS and their parents or guardians that will&#xD;
      improve understanding about their attitudes toward fertility, fertility preservation, and&#xD;
      options for building a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female AYAs aged 12-25 years with TS, and parents or guardians of AYAs with TS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into 3 focus groups: females ages 12-17 with TS; females ages 18-25&#xD;
      with TS; and parents or guardians of AYAs with TS. Each focus group session will be held via&#xD;
      Zoom. Participants can use video or just audio for the session. They will use their first&#xD;
      name. If they prefer, they can use a pseudonym. Each group will meet once. The session will&#xD;
      last 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a draft of the survey. The survey questions ask about fertility and&#xD;
      pregnancy. Participants will evaluate the usefulness and relevance of each question. They&#xD;
      will be asked if any question should be changed. The survey will be finalized based on their&#xD;
      feedback. The final survey will be distributed through TS groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 1 day....&#xD;

      This study aims to improve our understanding of attitudes of adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      (AYA) with Turner Syndrome and their parents/guardians towards fertility, fertility&#xD;
      preservation, and options for building a family through development and dissemination of a&#xD;
      fertility attitudes questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To compare differences in attitudes between AYA with TS and their parents&#xD;
      regarding survey content area (i) medical/surgical fertility preservation procedures with&#xD;
      unknown outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare differences in attitudes between AYA with TS and their parents regarding&#xD;
           survey content areas (ii) interest in understanding the effects of TS on fertility and&#xD;
           pregnancy and (iii) opinions of having children that are genetically similar and&#xD;
           alternative methods of building a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare differences in attitudes between adolescents aged 12-17 years and young&#xD;
           adults aged 18-25 years with TS regarding survey content areas (i) medical/surgical&#xD;
           fertility preservation procedures with unknown outcomes, (ii) interest in understanding&#xD;
           the effects of TS on fertility and pregnancy, and (iii) opinions of having children that&#xD;
           are genetically similar and alternative methods of building a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Difference in response scores between AYA with TS-parent dyads to the&#xD;
      survey questions addressing survey content area (i) interest in medical/surgical fertility&#xD;
      preservation procedures with unknown outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Differences in response scores between AYA with TS-parent dyads to the survey questions&#xD;
           addressing survey content areas&#xD;
&#xD;
           (ii) interest in understanding the effects of TS on fertility and pregnancy, and (iii)&#xD;
           opinions of having children that are genetically similar and alternative methods of&#xD;
           building a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Differences in response scores between adolescents with TS ages 12 to 17 years and young&#xD;
           adults with TS ages 18 to 25 years to the survey content areas addressing (i) interest&#xD;
           in medical/surgical fertility preservation procedures with unknown outcomes, (ii)&#xD;
           interest in understanding the effects of TS on fertility and pregnancy, and (iii)&#xD;
           opinions of having children that are genetically similar and alternative methods of&#xD;
           building a family&#xD;
