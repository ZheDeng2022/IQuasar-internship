  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of weekly iron and&#xD;
      folic acid (IFA) supplementation and one-time deworming treatment at the community level in&#xD;
      improving hemoglobin levels among adolescent girls in Liberia, West Africa, and to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of a targeted nutrition education program in improving&#xD;
      nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and practices in the same population.&#xD;

    <description>This group will receive a structured nutrition education package provided by Community Health Assistants (CHAs) based on a handbook on nutrition education developed by UNICEF with collaboration from the Liberia Ministry of Health. The structured nutrition education package will focus on four key areas: causes and prevention of anemia, healthy eating and food choices, hand washing, and physical exercise. Participants in the intervention group will also receive IFA supplementation on a weekly basis for the duration of the study, and a one-time oral deworming treatment (mebendazole), which will be administered once at the beginning of the study.</description>
