    <textblock>
      Attending physicians often supervise novice junior residents in a direct one-to-one format.&#xD;
      Alternatively, a senior resident can be paired with a new trainee under the non-direct (but&#xD;
      immediately available) supervision of an attending physician. Resident supervision has been&#xD;
      considered an important step towards independent practice. Both models are ubiquitous in the&#xD;
      United States, but no study to date has been performed if one model is better than the other&#xD;
      with respect to supervision scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supervision of residents is a cornerstone of ACGME accreditation and a critical focus of any&#xD;
      training program. A nine-faceted, validated survey has been used to assess quality and&#xD;
      effectiveness of supervision in training environments. Residents that assign poor scores for&#xD;
      faculty members also tend to poorly evaluate the department-at-large. Further, residents that&#xD;
      evaluate supervisors unfavorably also tend to report more patient safety mishaps in the&#xD;
      context of a less safe work environment. Previous literature that used this supervision scale&#xD;
      concluded that residents who reported mean department-wide supervision scores less than 3&#xD;
      (frequent) reported significantly more frequent occurrences of mistakes with negative&#xD;
      consequences to patients and medication errors.&#xD;

    <description>A series of questions pertaining to planning perianesthesia care, feedback, availability, opportunities, stimulating patient based learning, professionalism, interpersonal skills, presence, and safety. It questions are scored using a 4-point Likert scale (never = 1, rarely = 2, frequently = 3, and always = 4). A score less than 3 is associated with more frequent occurrences of mistakes.</description>
