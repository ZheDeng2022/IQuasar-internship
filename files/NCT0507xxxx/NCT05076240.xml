  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAPs) are a very common side effect in intensive care units.&#xD;
      They are the leading causes of nosocomial infections and excess mortality in intensive care&#xD;
      units: associated with a controversial death rate of around 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAPs complicate about 40-50% of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the&#xD;
      mortality would be twice higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in this context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this represents a considerable rate of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the risk factors for VAPs are poorly understood and the bacterial ecology&#xD;
      varies around the world. Also, facing a high prevalence of multi-resistant bacteria in this&#xD;
      population, the choice of probabilistic antibiotic therapy is complex and represents a&#xD;
      considerable impact for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New microbiological rapid diagnostic techniques have appeared in recent years, among them the&#xD;
      FilmArray® seems to present interesting diagnostic performances with the ability to detects&#xD;
      resistance to antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has been studied in acute community pneumonia but has not been validated in&#xD;
      VAP and even less during the COVID-19 period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators decide to conduct this study to investigate if the early identification of the&#xD;
      pathogens and their mechanism of resistance using FilmArray® would improve the relevance of&#xD;
      the antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the contribution of a rapid diagnostic technique to&#xD;
      the management of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia during COVID-19 acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome before an interventional study.&#xD;
