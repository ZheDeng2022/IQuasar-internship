  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild to moderate hearing loss remains undertreated, largely because of the high cost of&#xD;
      hearing aids. A promising and much less expensive alternative is the use of personal sound&#xD;
      amplification products (PSAPs), which are electronic, portable, over-the-counter devices that&#xD;
      amplify sound. Studies have shown that the use of PSAPs provides significant hearing benefits&#xD;
      and improves the quality of life for older adults with mild to moderate hearing loss.&#xD;
      However, there is insufficient data to determine the impact of PSAPs use on speech processing&#xD;
      in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to assess the&#xD;
      neurobiological and behavioral effects of PSAPs on speech perception in noise in individuals&#xD;
      with mild to moderate hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the PSAPs use will result in an immediate improvement in the&#xD;
      ability to perceive speech-in-noise, supporting that these hearing devices may be a means of&#xD;
      restoring communication skills in people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Behavioral&#xD;
      benefits will be associated with increased brain activity in auditory regions and&#xD;
      connectivity between auditory and speech regions in the brain.&#xD;

      This study will consist of two sessions of 3 hours each. On one session, participants will&#xD;
      perform the speech-in-noise task without hearing devices and on the other session,&#xD;
      participants will perform the speech-in-noise task while wearing personal sound amplification&#xD;
      products. The order of the sessions will be counterbalanced across participants. The&#xD;
      speech-in-noise task consists in a word discrimination task in babble noise at three&#xD;
      signal-to-noise ratios. On each trial, the task is to determine whether two words are&#xD;
      identical or different.&#xD;
