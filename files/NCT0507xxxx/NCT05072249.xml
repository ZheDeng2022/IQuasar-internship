      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of take-home naloxone (THN) to reverse opioid&#xD;
      overdose when administered by lay persons in a real world setting. This multicentre,&#xD;
      prospective, observational cohort study will be conducted across Europe using a mixed method&#xD;
      approach. Recruiting 6000 individuals to whom a supply of THN has been provided, for n=600 to&#xD;
      witness an opioid overdose. The co-primary outcomes are to determine the rate of&#xD;
      administration of naloxone and frequency of deaths in the 24 hours subsequent to the&#xD;
      administration of naloxone. This will be captured through structured interviews with those&#xD;
      who report witnessing an opioid overdose in the 6 month study period, approximately n=600, to&#xD;
      elicit further information on the overdose and any naloxone administered. Naloxone training&#xD;
      materials and education provided will be examined through questions in the structured&#xD;
      interview. In-depth qualitative interviews will also be conducted with 60 participants who&#xD;
      have witnessed an overdose, in order to better understand the use, safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of different naloxone products (particularly Nyxoid). As part of the qualitative analysis,&#xD;
      interview transcripts will be assessed by an expert clinician panel for accuracy of&#xD;
      diagnosis, actions taken and aftercare. Routine data from national health registers will be&#xD;
      used to gather mortality data. This study will report on the use of different formulations of&#xD;
      naloxone. In addition, this study serves as a Post Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) for&#xD;
      the intranasal (IN) naloxone, Nyxoid developed by MundiPharma and focuses on drug safety and&#xD;
      training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accidental opioid overdose is a global crisis. Naloxone is an accessible, safe and effective&#xD;
      antidote for this preventable cause of mortality. While it has been used to treat opioid&#xD;
      overdose in hospital and pre-hospital settings since the 1970s, take home naloxone programmes&#xD;
      have been introduced more recently after opioid users were recognised as potential first&#xD;
      responders. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of take-home naloxone (THN) to&#xD;
      reverse opioid overdose when administered by lay persons in a real world setting. This&#xD;
      multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study will be conducted across Europe using a&#xD;
      mixed method approach, recruiting 6000 individuals to whom a supply of THN has been provided&#xD;
      (comprising four groups:1. patients in treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), 2.&#xD;
      Individuals using opioids but out-of-treatment, 3. family members, friends and other close&#xD;
      carers, and 4. staff working with individuals with OUD) for n=600 to witness an opioid&#xD;
      overdose. The co-primary outcomes are to determine the rate of administration of naloxone and&#xD;
      frequency of deaths in the 24 hours subsequent to the administration of naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be captured through two stages and two sub-studies. Main study stage 1: All&#xD;
      consenting participants (n=6,000) will be asked to complete an enrolment questionnaire with&#xD;
      the member of staff recruiting them into the study. In addition, the staff member will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a brief record of the naloxone and training provided to the participant.&#xD;
      Participants will be texted monthly to prompt them to contact research staff if they have&#xD;
      witnessed an opioid overdose. Staff who have frequent or regular contact with participants&#xD;
      (including instances when a replenishment of naloxone is given) will also prompt participants&#xD;
      to make contact with research staff to notify them of a witnessed opioid overdose. All&#xD;
      participants will be contacted at six months and asked to take part in a structured&#xD;
      interview. In addition, national/regional death registers will be probed to confirm mortality&#xD;
      data for study participants who are at risk of experiencing an opioid overdose themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study, Stage 2: Participants who report that they have witnessed an opioid overdose&#xD;
      during the six-month follow-up period will be asked to take part in a structured interview&#xD;
      with a researcher about this witnessed overdose to capture our primary outcomes&#xD;
      (approximately n=600).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study A: comprises two structured surveys incorporated into a) the Enrolment training&#xD;
      information form (to examine naloxone training and materials provided) and b) the Stage 2&#xD;
      Interview completed by participants who have witnessed an overdose (to ask about the extent&#xD;
      they followed the nasal naloxone Nyxoid Quick Start Guide (QSG) (or equivalent instructions).&#xD;
      The questions are designed to better understand the effectiveness of the Nyxoid nasal&#xD;
      naloxone educational and training materials delivered to participants who were provided with&#xD;
      Nyxoid nasal naloxone and who were subsequently present at an overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study B: comprises qualitative interviews with 60 UK participants who witness a diverse&#xD;
      range of overdose events of the approx. n=600 (Main Study Stage 2). The aim of sub-study B is&#xD;
      to better understand the use, safety, and effectiveness of different naloxone products.&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be guided by a topic guide and conducted by telephone. The topic&#xD;
      guide will capture details of any overdoses experienced or witnessed since the study started&#xD;
      before focusing in more depth on the most recent overdose witnessed. Participants will also&#xD;
      be asked about any training they have had, or need, in naloxone administration. In addition,&#xD;
      a clinical expert assessment of the accurate identification of an opioid overdose and the&#xD;
      participant's response to the opioid overdose (as detailed in the transcribed interviews)&#xD;
      will be performed and documented. Answers will be assessed by an expert clinician panel for&#xD;
      accuracy of diagnosis, actions taken and aftercare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will report on the use of different formulations of naloxone, and different&#xD;
      national systems of training and provision. In addition, this study serves as a Post&#xD;
      Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) for the intranasal (IN) naloxone, Nyxoid developed by&#xD;
      Mundipharma and focuses on drug safety and training.&#xD;
