  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a BlueDop Vascular Expert System (BVE) Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF) study.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical applicability and diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of the BVE device in subjects who require an arterial duplex test due to suspected&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BVE device is intended to assess mean peripheral pressure, vascular reserve, Cuff free&#xD;
      Ankle Brachial Index (ABIm), and assess the presence or absence of hemodynamically&#xD;
      significant arterial disease. By converting Doppler shifts to a blood pressure measurement,&#xD;
      BVE can be used to monitor PAD in a non-invasive manner without confounding by arterial&#xD;
      calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a post-market, interventional, prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      single-arm clinical investigation designed to evaluate the clinical equivalence of BVE to&#xD;
      arterial Duplex in a group of patients referred for evaluation of PAD of the limbs when&#xD;
      performed by a vascular specialist. Moreover, the evaluation of the clinical performance&#xD;
      including inter-operator variability and BVE non-diagnostic rate will be also carried out as&#xD;
      exploratory variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluate the clinical equivalence (assessment of accuracy) of BVE as binary result&#xD;
           (either presence or absence of significant peripheral arterial disease) compared to&#xD;
           arterial duplex ultrasound in a group of patients referred for evaluation of PAD of the&#xD;
           lower limbs when performed by a vascular specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluate the clinical equivalence (assessment of accuracy) of BVE as binary result&#xD;
           (either presence or absence of significant peripheral arterial disease) compared to&#xD;
           ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) in a group of patients referred for evaluation of&#xD;
           PAD of the lower limbs when performed by a vascular specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assess the safety of the BVE device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the BVE System for clinical performance including time needed to perform BVE,&#xD;
      inter-operator variability and number of BVE non-diagnostic tests.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of clinical equivalence through a binary result (either presence or absence of significant PAD) in BVE compared to a binary summary of the arterial duplex.&#xD;
Significant PAD is established with Duplex ultrasound when peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) is greater than 3 for any one level, or, if patients have multi-level disease, PSVR ≥ 2 at more than one level (i.e. sfa, pop)</description>
