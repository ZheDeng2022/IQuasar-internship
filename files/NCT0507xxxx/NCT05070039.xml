  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urothelial carcinoma is the ninth most common malignant neoplasm worldwide. nearly in all&#xD;
      human tumors, actin filaments are involved in lamellopodia or cellular extensions. Cortactin&#xD;
      is involved in fixing the actin assembly to enhance cellular penetration. Assessment of&#xD;
      Cortactin expression in invasive and non-invasive urothelial carcinoma and recording any&#xD;
      significant different expressions may have benefits in developing more effective anticancer&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder carcinoma is the 9th most prevalent cancer worldwide. Approximately three quarters of&#xD;
      all cases are diagnosed in men. Bladder carcinoma is divided clinically into three&#xD;
      diagnostically different categories; non- muscle invasive, muscle invasive and metastatic&#xD;
      bladder carcinoma. About 90% of all bladder carcinomas are diagnosed as urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      (UC). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma and other rare types represent the&#xD;
      remaining 10%. In Egypt, there are some differences in incidence, histological phenotypes and&#xD;
      risk factors of bladder carcinoma. Bladder carcinoma is considered the most frequently&#xD;
      occurring cancer in the last five decades. The most important risk factors of bladder&#xD;
      carcinoma in Egypt are infection by S. haematopium and Cigarette smoking. Cortactin is a&#xD;
      63-65 kDa protein, encoded by gene located on 11q13. Cortactin activates and binds to Arp2/3&#xD;
      and stabilizes the branched Actin networks. Invadopodia are Actin-rich cellular protrusions,&#xD;
      associated with enhanced proteolytic activities in the invasive regions of carcinomas.&#xD;
      Cortactin is also involved in invadopodia, many studies have proved that Cortactin is&#xD;
      recruited simultaneously with or rapidly following recruitment of transmembrane&#xD;
      metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP. Extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation occurs shortly after&#xD;
      recruitment of MT1-MMP and Cortactin. Over-expression of Cortactin was proved in many human&#xD;
      malignant neoplasms, including melanoma, breast, pancreatic, hepatic and colorectal&#xD;
      carcinomas.&#xD;
