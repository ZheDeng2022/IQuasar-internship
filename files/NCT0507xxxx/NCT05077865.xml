  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending and multiple dose study. Approximately 32&#xD;
      healthy adult male and female subjects will be given a single capsule of MYMD1 to determine&#xD;
      its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties. The study data will guide the&#xD;
      establishment of an optimum therapeutic dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending and multiple-dose study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of MYMD1&#xD;
      capsule in healthy male and female adult subjects. Each subject will participate in the study&#xD;
      for approximately 7-8 weeks, including a Screening period of up to 30 days, a confinement&#xD;
      period of 2 or 5 days, and a follow-up period of approximately 5 days. In each of Cohorts&#xD;
      1-3, 8 subjects will be administered a single dose of either MYMD1 (N=6 in each cohort) or&#xD;
      Placebo (N=2 in each cohort), under fasted conditions. Subjects in Cohort 4 will be&#xD;
      administered either MYMD1 (N=6) or Placebo (N=2) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in only 1 of the 4 cohorts during the study. Anticipated dosing levels will be&#xD;
      150mg (Cohort 1); 300mg (Cohort 2); 250mg (Cohort 3); and 600mg (Cohort 4).&#xD;
