      The purpose of the study is to pilot a new training which aims to foster resilience to some&#xD;
      of the clinical and workload pressures that nurses encounter on a daily basis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many nurses are exposed to challenges in their clinical setting on a daily basis, which often&#xD;
      results in them experiencing stress, burnout and decreased satisfaction with their work; this&#xD;
      can have a long term impact on the recruitment and retention rate of these nurses. This&#xD;
      stress has intensified over the last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online training&#xD;
      being piloted in this trial has been adapted from a recent face-to-face resilience&#xD;
      enhancement programme developed for nurses in the UK. By creating an online training, it is&#xD;
      hoped that this intervention will be accessible to more nurses, particularly in the context&#xD;
      of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to understand whether the online training can improve levels of&#xD;
      resilience, psychological, and wellbeing, and whether or not it has changed the way nurses&#xD;
      experience in their work environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All registered nurses working at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic will be invited. We intend to recruit 100 nurses who are currently working at Oxford&#xD;
      Health NHS Foundation Trust to participate in the pilot study. Recruited nurses will be&#xD;
      randomised to the intervention group or the control group. Nurses who are randomised to the&#xD;
      intervention group will be invited to do the online training over a four week period. There&#xD;
      will be the opportunity to participate in four 2 hour online facilitated sessions during the&#xD;
      four-week training period. Nurses will also be asked to complete 30 minutes of independent&#xD;
      pre-work ahead of each of the facilitated sessions. The sessions will cover a range of topics&#xD;
      and will tackle areas such as building hardiness and maintaining a positive outlook;&#xD;
      emotional intelligence and intellectual flexibility; reflective and critical thinking;&#xD;
      enabling spirituality and achieving work-life balance. The training also involves twice&#xD;
      weekly mentorship sessions ranging between 30 and 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses will be invited to complete two surveys (pre- and post- intervention) which will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the trial outcomes and feedback on training. On completion of the&#xD;
      post-intervention survey, nurses will receive a certificate for 10 hours of CPD. Nurses&#xD;
      randomised to the control group will only be invited to take part in the pre- and post-&#xD;
      intervention surveys, but will not use the online training. However, after completing the&#xD;
      survey, nurses will be given the opportunity to complete the pre-work and access the online&#xD;
      facilitated sessions so they can receive their CPD certificate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the training has been piloted, the effectiveness of the online training will be&#xD;
      evaluated at national level.&#xD;
