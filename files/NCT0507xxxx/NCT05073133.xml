      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of intravenous administration of OAV101&#xD;
      (AVXS-101) in patients with SMA with bi-allelic mutations in the survival motor neuron 1&#xD;
      (SMN1) gene ≤ 24 months and weighing ≤ 17 kg, over a 18-month period post infusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of IV OAV101 in SMA participants. The study will enroll participants ≤ 24 months&#xD;
      that weigh ≤ 17 kg. Participants will receive a single administration of IV OAV101 at the&#xD;
      approved dose of 1.1e14 vg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet eligibility criteria at screening and baseline visits will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of IV OAV101 on Day 1 (Treatment period) and will be followed for a period of 18&#xD;
      months. The study will include a standard screening period that can last up to 20 days,&#xD;
      during which eligibility will be assessed and baseline assessments will be performed prior to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study duration, participants will complete visits as defined in the Schedule of&#xD;
      Assessments (SoA). Prednisolone treatment will be given per study protocol. On Day -1,&#xD;
      participants will be admitted to the hospital for pre-treatment baseline procedures. On Day&#xD;
      1, participants will receive a 1-time IV infusion of OAV101 and will undergo in-patient&#xD;
      safety monitoring over the next 48 hours, after which the participant may be discharged,&#xD;
      based on Investigator judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring will be performed as per study schedule and protocol requirement. Safety&#xD;
      for the participants enrolled in the study will be evaluated by the study team together with&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) as described in the charter. An interim analysis for safety&#xD;
      and efficacy maybe performed once the last participant completes 6-months of follow-up and&#xD;
      will include all available data up until that data cut-off. Final analysis will be planned&#xD;
      after the 18 month visit end of study (EOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study completion eligible participants will be invited to enroll into a Registry study&#xD;
      (RESTORE) study to collect additional safety and efficacy data.&#xD;

    <description>The World Health Organization-Multicentre Growth Reference Study (WHO-MGRS) will used to measure developmental motor milestones. This will be assessed via the milestone checklist. The 6 developmental milestones are: sitting without support, hands-and-knees crawling, standing with assistance, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone. A yes response indicates that the patient reached a particular development milestone.</description>
