  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is designed as an open-label, dose escalation trial of MEM-288 monotherapy&#xD;
      in which investigators aim to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). Subjects with selected solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      who have a tumor lesion which is accessible for injection will undergo intratumoral injection&#xD;
      of MEM-288. The study rationale is that the oncolytic effect of MEM-288 combined with the&#xD;
      presence of CD40L and type 1 interferon (IFN) in injected tumors will provide a strong signal&#xD;
      for dendritic cell (DC)-mediated T cell activation leading to generation of systemic&#xD;
      anti-tumor T cell responses with broad specificity akin to what is observed in the abscopal&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MEM-288 is a conditionally replicative oncolytic adenovirus vector encoding transgenes for&#xD;
      human interferon beta (IFNβ) and a recombinant chimeric form of CD40-ligand (MEM40). MEM-288&#xD;
      was developed as an immunotherapy for cancer and was engineered to selectively replicate in&#xD;
      cancer cells leading to cancer cell lysis but not cytotoxicity towards normal cells.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, MEM-288 is designed to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response through&#xD;
      expression of its encoded immune agonist transgenes. MEM-288 is designed to provide both&#xD;
      antitumor activity as a standalone monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor(s) to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I trial is an open-label, dose escalation trial of MEM-288 monotherapy in which&#xD;
      investigators aim to find the MTD and recommended phase II dose for the planned combination&#xD;
      of MEM-288 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Patients (≥ 18 years old) eligible for study&#xD;
      enrollment include those with either advanced/metastatic NSCLC, cutaneous squamous-cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (cSCC), Merkel cell, melanoma, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, or head and neck cancer, who progressed following previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy,&#xD;
      with a tumor lesion which is accessible for injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEM-288 will be administered via intratumoral injection once every 3 weeks (planned 2 doses,&#xD;
      maximum 6 doses) at an assigned dose cohort level (from 1x10^10 to 1x10^11 viral particles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of intratumoral administration of MEM-288 as a single agent. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      will assess efficacy overall response rate, as well as disease control rate, progression free&#xD;
      survival, duration of response, and anti-tumor immune responses.&#xD;
