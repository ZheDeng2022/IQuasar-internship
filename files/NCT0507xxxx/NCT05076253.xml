  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The newly emerged corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to all over the world, with&#xD;
      recent estimates of more than 236 million cases diagnosed and led to 4.8 million deaths as&#xD;
      November 20211 .Therapeutic approaches are needed to improve outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 since no antiviral agent has yet been proved to be conclusively beneficial in&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection,especially in patients with mild to moderate degree of severity There has&#xD;
      been growing interest in the anti-parasitic drug,ivermectin, which previously was studied as&#xD;
      an antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer actions2 .It was also reported to have an&#xD;
      in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-23 .Its antiviral properties was due to the action on&#xD;
      importin 2/1 mediated nuclear transport. Ivermectin prevents the binding of viral proteins to&#xD;
      importin 2/1 rendering the viral proteins unable to enter the nucleus and cause infection4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have found a beneficial effect of ivermectin in COVID-195-9 However,&#xD;
      some study did not find significant difference between the patient group receiving ivermectin&#xD;
      and control group10 .Until now, the controlled trials evaluating ivermectin in COVID-19 are&#xD;
      lacking. Ivermectin is safe, with reported side effect of less than 1%. Hence it is essential&#xD;
      to conduct a clinical trial with ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 .The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to establish the efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      disease, compare to usual case alone.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial conducted at Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine, Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University from September 2021 to the end of&#xD;
      November 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomized in permuted block of four in a randomized sequence prepared by&#xD;
      the unblinded pharmacist in Microsoft excel12 .Allocation assignment was concealed from&#xD;
      investigators and the patients. The patients were allocated into two groups : either to group&#xD;
      A (Ivermectin arm) or to group B (control arm) as shown in Fig 1. The patients were&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio .Group A received ivermectin 12 mg per day for 5 days as&#xD;
      recommended by previous studes13,14 plus standard care. Group B was to receive standard care&#xD;
      alone which included favipiravir or andrographolide, corticosteroids, cetrizine and&#xD;
      paracetamol.&#xD;
