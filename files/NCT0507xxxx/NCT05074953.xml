  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 infection was in 2020 responsible for new disease related chronic conditions&#xD;
      which have been referred to as Post-COVID. To date it is still unknown how common this&#xD;
      condition is and which symptoms are related to it. The aim of the study is to monitor the&#xD;
      onset of these conditions in a large observational study consisting of German health&#xD;
      insurance data.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is a virus of the coronavirus family, which includes a large number of viruses&#xD;
      that can cause a wide variety of diseases in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes acute&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the infection and can cause chronic conditions known as Post-COVID.&#xD;
      To understand the prevalence and variety of Post-COVID a large observational study of health&#xD;
      insurance data from Germany was set up. The exposed patients were identified by a diagnosis&#xD;
      indicating a confirmed laboratory test for COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic question concerns the burden of the Post-COVID condition. The study investigate&#xD;
      which symptoms are more common in humans after the exposure to the virus compared to a&#xD;
      matched unexposed cohort. Further will this be investigated in the subgroup of children and&#xD;
      adolescents and those who have been hospitalized due to the virus infection.&#xD;
