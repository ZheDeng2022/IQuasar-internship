    <textblock>
      The ACHIEVE Hearing Intervention Follow-Up study is a randomized trial of a telehealth versus&#xD;
      conventional clinic-based hearing healthcare (HHC) delivery model among older adults who are&#xD;
      existing hearing aid users to determine if a telehealth HHC model improves hearing aid use&#xD;
      and other communication outcomes compared to clinic-based HHC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site randomized efficacy trial of a telehealth versus conventional&#xD;
      clinic-based hearing healthcare (HHC) delivery model among older adults who are existing&#xD;
      hearing aid users to determine if a telehealth HHC model improves hearing aid use and other&#xD;
      communication outcomes compared to clinic-based HHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the ongoing Aging &amp; Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders&#xD;
      (ACHIEVE) randomized trial in which the investigators recruited 977 adults ages 70-84 with&#xD;
      untreated mild-to-moderate hearing loss from January 2018 to October 2019 who were randomized&#xD;
      to a hearing intervention (i.e., conventional clinic-based delivery of hearing services and&#xD;
      technologies) versus a successful aging education control intervention (i.e., one-on-one&#xD;
      sessions with a health educator on topics important for healthy aging). From 2021-2022, as&#xD;
      participants in the hearing intervention group (fixed sample, n=490) complete the&#xD;
      pre-specified three years of follow-up in the ACHIEVE trial, the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      these existing hearing aid users and randomize the participants 1:1 to receive continued&#xD;
      conventional clinic-based delivery of hearing care services versus a model that incorporates&#xD;
      telehealth. Accounting for loss to follow-up and death, the investigators conservatively&#xD;
      estimate that n=400 participants currently in the hearing intervention group will be&#xD;
      recruited into this two-year follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analyses will be conducted at one-year post-randomization when hours of hearing aid&#xD;
      use (primary outcome) and patient-centered hearing and communication, social functioning, and&#xD;
      quality of life secondary outcomes will be contrasted between the two intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one year of follow-up, participants randomized to the conventional HHC arm will&#xD;
      cross-over and also receive telehealth HHC, while participants randomized to the telehealth&#xD;
      HHC arm will continue to receive telehealth HHC. All participants will continue to be&#xD;
      followed for 2 years post-randomization for observational analyses, with data collection&#xD;
      follow-up visits occurring every 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Participants' scheduled clinic-based visits will be complemented with asynchronous and synchronous telehealth that will allow for routine troubleshooting of communication challenges, hearing aid technical issues, and reinforcement of self-management support strategies. At an initial session, participants will be instructed in the use of a study-provided, internet-enabled tablet device for telehealth sessions, re-introduced to the hearing loss toolkit for self-management and C2Hear Reusable Learning Objects within the context of the telehealth platform, re-evaluated on the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) goals. Two remote follow-up sessions will be scheduled 3 and 6 weeks later to confirm participants' comfort with the telehealth platform and then completed every 6 months, in addition to scheduled 6-month clinic-based visits.</description>
