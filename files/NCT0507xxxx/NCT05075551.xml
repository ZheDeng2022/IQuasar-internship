  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is one of the most common diseases&#xD;
      in urology, but its pathogenesis remains unclear and the effective therapy lacks. As a kind&#xD;
      of chronic pain which the patients suffered for more than 3 months, CP/CPPS could be&#xD;
      alleviated by acupuncture. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and higher magnetic&#xD;
      field strengths could enable scientists to investigate the brain accurately and&#xD;
      non-invasively during every stage of chronic pain.To avoid placebo effect, sham acupuncture&#xD;
      would be also enrolled.Herein, by the utilization of fMRI in resting-state, we investigated&#xD;
      the influence on patients' brain alterations after the patients accepted the treatment of&#xD;
      acupuncture.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two (participant and assessor) blind, two-arm parallel, randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      conducted. Sixty patients with CP/CPPS will be recruited from Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, and&#xD;
      thirty healthy volunteers will be recruited as the healthy control group by advertisement.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned into one of two intervention groups: acupuncture group and&#xD;
      sham acupuncture group. The ratio of healthy control (n = 30), acupuncture group (n = 30) and&#xD;
      sham acupuncture group (n = 30) will be 1:1:1. Sanyinjiao (SP6), Zhibian (BL54), Shenshu&#xD;
      (BL23), and Huiyang (BL35) are chosen as acupoints for both acupuncture group and sham&#xD;
      acupuncture group (Park sham device). The course of treatment is 2 times a week in three&#xD;
      months (totally 24 times). The group of healthy control will get only once fMRI scan while&#xD;
      the group of patients will get fMRI scan week 0 (before treatment), week 12 (after treatment)&#xD;
      and week 36 (following up). Every time the participants receive the fMRI scan, they will be&#xD;
      asked to finish the clinical scales. The primary outcome will be the change in the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) total score from baseline&#xD;
      to week 12 and week 36. Secondary outcomes will include the changes of Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale, International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile&#xD;
      Function, Self-Esteem Scale, Social Support Rating Scale and Numeric Rating Scale and brain&#xD;
      functional activated or inactivated regions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The eligible participants will receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture randomly assigned at the ratio of 1:1 after signing the Informed consent. Before they accept the treatment, they are acquired to finish the clinical scales and get the fMRI scan. Sanyinjiao (SP6), Zhibian (BL54), Shenshu (BL23), and Huiyang (BL35) have been chosen as acupoints. In the group of both acupuncture and sham acupuncture, the course of treatment is 2 times a week in three months (totally 24 times). There are 3 clinic visits and 3 telephone contacts for emergency. At the ending of the treatment, all the volunteers will be asked to finish the clinical scales and get the fMRI scan again. As the step of following up, all the patients will be asked to finish the clinical scales and get the fMRI scan again to evaluate the efficacy of avoiding the recurrence of acupuncture.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>The change in the NIH-CPSI total score at the end of week 12 and week 36</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 12 and week 36</time_frame>
    <description>The responder is defined as who has a decline of 6 or more than 6-point from baseline measured by using the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) , compared with the baseline in week 0.It is because a decline of at least 6 points in NIH-CPSI is acknowledged as the minimal clinically important difference. The NIH-CPSI is a self-assessment form with nine items, which the main components encompass pain with 4 items focused on location, severity and frequency, urinary function embracing one irritative item and one obstructive item, and quality of life impact with 3 items about the effect of symptoms on daily activities. The NIH-CPSI provides a systematized and unanimously accepted outcome measuring tool, and it is widely used in clinical trials, along with in the evidence-based evaluation of treatment effects.</description>

    <time_frame>week 0, week 12, week 36</time_frame>
    <description>These changes will reveal the efficacy of acupuncture in the aspect of lower urinary tract symptoms.To detailly describe the symptoms of lower urinary tract, except for the NIH-CPSI, we will independently apply the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The IPSS covers seven symptom questions and one health-related quality of life (QoL) question.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the change from baseline in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 12, week 36</time_frame>
    <description>These changes will reveal the efficacy of acupuncture in the aspect of pain.For pain assessment, the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0 -10 integers) that best reflects the intensity and severity of pain.</description>

    <measure>the change from baseline in the Self-Esteem Scale (SES).</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 12, week 36</time_frame>
    <description>These changes will reveal the efficacy of acupuncture in the aspect of internal self esteem. In 1965, the Self-Esteem Scale (SES) was initially designed to assess adolescents' overall feelings of self-worth and self-acceptance by Rosenberg. The SES contains five positive and five negative items, which is a widely used and well validated measurement with good psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>the change from baseline in the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 12, week 36</time_frame>
    <description>These changes will reveal the efficacy of acupuncture in the aspect of external social support.The Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) is a questionnaire with 10 items which consists of objective support (3 items), subjective support (4 items) and the utilization of social support (3 items), which assist to evaluate the characteristics of social support and its association with mental health level, mental illness and various physical diseases. The higher score, the more social support.</description>

    <measure>the change from baseline in the Quality of Life（QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0, week 12, week 36</time_frame>
    <description>These changes will reveal the efficacy of acupuncture in the aspect of subjective life quality feeling. In patients with prostatic diseases, this score is mainly used to evaluate the impact of urination symptoms on quality of life, ranging from very good to very painful, with 0-6 points, to understand the subjective feelings of patients on the level of lower urinary tract symptoms, mainly concerned with the degree of distress caused by lower urinary tract symptoms and whether they can tolerate them. This score is always used within IPSS.</description>

    <description>Both two group will get fMRI scan week 0 (before treatment), week 12 (after treatment) and week 36 (following up). The resting-state fMRI data will be obtained by using a 3.0T GE MR 750 MRI scanner with an eight-channel phase array head coil at the Huashan Hospital, Shanghai. The high resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images will be collected by a three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo dual-echo sequence [repetition time (TR) = 8100 ms; echo time (TE) = 3.1 ms; FA = 8 deg; matrix=256 × 256; field of view (FOV)=25.6× 25.6 cm2; slice thickness=1 mm; no gap and 156 slices]. The whole resting state fMRI data will be acquired by using a gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging pulse sequence (TR/TE = 2,000/30 ms; FA = 90°; acquisition matrix = 64×64; FOV = 22×22 cm2; slice thickness= 4 mm; 43 slices and total 240 time points; no gap).</description>
