  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People affected by multiple chronic diseases have a greater chance of hospitalization, longer&#xD;
      hospital stays, worse general health, worse physical and mental function and lower functional&#xD;
      capacity, with an average risk of 50% of functional decline with each additional condition.&#xD;
      The frequency of multimorbidity is higher in older, inactive women, who live in urban areas&#xD;
      in low- and middle-income countries, the most affected by multimorbidity. The practice of&#xD;
      physical exercise is an important component in the prevention of multiple chronic diseases,&#xD;
      in which lower levels of physical activity were associated with an increased prevalence of&#xD;
      multimorbidity in women aged 16 to 24 years. And regardless of the presence of&#xD;
      multimorbidity, engaging in a healthier lifestyle, including regular physical activity, was&#xD;
      associated with up to 7.6 more years of life for women, improving the individual's general&#xD;
      health status even when multimorbid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that multimorbid women have a worse general health status when compared to&#xD;
      women without multimorbidity, but aerobic exercise will be able to improve health parameters&#xD;
      in 12 weeks of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a quasi-experimental clinical trial with a 12-week aerobic training intervention in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with and without cardiometabolic multimorbidity. Participants were&#xD;
      allocated into groups according to the amount of cardiometabolic diseases, with the Morbidity&#xD;
      group (MORB) being composed of women with one or no chronic cardiometabolic disease and the&#xD;
      Multimorbidity group (MULTI) with two or more chronic cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments of arterial stiffness, 24-hour ambulatory pressure, blood pressure&#xD;
      variability, heart rate variability, lipid and glucose profile, body composition and&#xD;
      climacteric symptoms were performed before and after the training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out at the Laboratory of Cardiorespiratory and Metabolic Physiology at&#xD;
      the Faculty of Physical Education of the Federal University of Uberlândia, Uberlândia, Brazil&#xD;
      and approved by the Ethics Committee for studies in humans (CAEE: 12453719.1.0000.5152). All&#xD;
      participants signed a consent form. The experiments followed the principles of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program consists of aerobic physical exercises performed three times a week on&#xD;
      non-consecutive days for 12 weeks with an intensity of 65% to 75% of the reserve heart rate.&#xD;

      The sample size was classified using the G * Power 3.1 software (University of Dusseldorf,&#xD;
      Dusseldorf, Germany), adopting an α error of 5%, 80% power analysis, 0.5 correlation between&#xD;
      repeated measures and a correction of non-sphericity of 1, in an F-family of intra-between&#xD;
      analysis. Changes in serum triglycerides were evaluated as the primary study endpoint. The&#xD;
      investigators did not not found the in literature the study with design and calculation&#xD;
      prediction according to the calculation of this study with the effect size of f = 0.24 for&#xD;
      the sample calculation. Thus, was found a minimum required sample of 38 subjects (19 per&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results were found as mean ± standard error. Unpaired testing was used to compare baseline&#xD;
      characteristics between groups. Comparison between groups and duration of arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      lipid profile, glucose profile, climacteric symptoms, body composition and ABPM were made by&#xD;
      Generalized Equation Estimates (GEE) of two factors (time, group and their interaction) with&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction. The analyzes were performed by intention-to-treat (including those who&#xD;
      did not complete the study: MORB n = 18; MULTI = 24) using the last-observation carried&#xD;
      forward method. A p value &lt;0.05 was used for statistical significance and all statistical&#xD;
      analyzes were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software&#xD;
      v26.0 (IBM, New York, USA).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Arterial stiffness in 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 12 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial stiffness was assessed by measuring the Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) through the applanation tonometry method, performed on 3 measurements and the average of the three was performed to obtain the final value. It is a non-invasive, painless method with instantaneous results and considered the gold standard for determining arterial stiffness. This method is based on the principles of ocular tonometry used to measure intraocular pressure by &quot;flattening&quot; the surface of the eyeball.</description>

    <description>The blood samples were collected after an overnight fast, five days before, and 72 h after, the last exercise training session to eliminate the acute effects of the exercise. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) (mg/dL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mg/dL) were determined by enzymatic colorimetric methods.

    <time_frame>Before and after 12 weeks of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (Systolic, diastolic, mean) (mmHg) was assessed before and after 12 weeks of training through ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) using the Dyna Mapa+ device (São Paulo, Brazil). The monitor was programmed with measurements every 30 minutes for 24 hours, standardizing the start of monitoring in the morning between 7 am and 8 am. Along with the monitor, the participants filled out a daily record of activities (sleep, food and work) or events that could interfere with blood pressure or measurements, with sleep and wakefulness periods being individually determined according to the time reported in each diary. Measurements obtained 24 hours of monitoring and with at least 70% of measurements valid in this period were considered valid.</description>

    <time_frame>Before and after 12 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) will be analyzed in the frequency and time domain, using a specific software for such analysis. In the time domain, the following indexes will be calculated: interval between two consecutive R waves (RR), (RMSSD) square root of the mean of the sums of the squared differences of the adjacent RR intervals; (SDNN) standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a time interval; (pNN50) Percentage of adjacent RR interval pairs that are at least 50 ms apart during recording.&#xD;
For frequency domain analysis: the series of RR intervals, to calculate the power density of the spectrum, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) will be used. The high (HF) and low (LF) frequency spectrum zones will be calculated from the integral of the spectrum power density curve in their respective zones.</description>

    <description>The program consists of aerobic exercise performed three times a week on non-consecutive days for 12 weeks at an intensity of 65% to 75% of the reserve heart rate. During the first 4 weeks of training, the exercise duration was 40 minutes (5' warm up + 30 minutes in the intensity zone + 5' cool down). From the fifth week onwards, there was only an increase in volume to 50 minutes in duration (5'warm-up + 40 minutes in the intensity zone + 5'warm-up). The aerobic fitness assessment was performed on a maximal effort ergospirometric treadmill under the supervision of a qualified physician, using the Bruce protocol (adapted) to assess cardiopulmonary capacity (to assess possible cardiovascular capacity that prevents the proposed training) and for individualized training prescription.</description>
