      An experimental study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of dry needling on the M.&#xD;
      Obliquus capitis inferior on rotational mobility and headache realted outcome measures in&#xD;
      patients with cervicogenic headache.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headache is a common and disabling condition. Several primary and secondary headache forms&#xD;
      have been described, such as migraine, tension-type headache and cervicogenic headache (CH).&#xD;
      In patients with CH; we can see a reffered pain pattern to the head, possibly originating&#xD;
      from a source in the (upper)cervical spine. It has been described that nociceptive input,&#xD;
      originating from the C1-C3 nervous system may be responsible for pain referal to head and&#xD;
      neck regions. Recently, the flexion-rotation test (FRT) has been described as one of the most&#xD;
      usefel clinical tests in the clinical testing and research of CH. Other literature showed&#xD;
      that the rotational movement during the FRT was diminished in patients with CH and these&#xD;
      results were correlated to headache intensity. 5,6&#xD;
&#xD;
      To treat this disabling condition, manual therapy is already known to be an effective&#xD;
      treatment strategy. However, the additional value of dry needling is still to be discussed.&#xD;
      Since the M. Obliquus capitis inferior (M. OCI) finds its origin on the apex of the spinous&#xD;
      processus of C2 and inserts on transverse processus of the atlas (C1); this muscle might be&#xD;
      anatomically very relevant to influence rotational mobility in the upper cervical spine.&#xD;
      Additionally, this muscle is responsible for proprioception and accurate positioning of the&#xD;
      head and neck, due to the presence of a large amount of Golgi bodies and muscle spindles in&#xD;
      the muscle. Considering the myofascial pain referal pattern of the M. OCI, a referred pain&#xD;
      pattern to the temporal region may be present when active triggerpoints are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research already showed some preliminary evidence for positive treatment effects by&#xD;
      dry needling of the M. OCI in patients with cervicogenic dizziness and headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single dry needling intervention of the&#xD;
      M. OCI on rotational mobility and headache related parameters, in a group of cervicogenic&#xD;
      headache patients with a positive flexion-rotation test (articular mobility test on level&#xD;
      C1-C2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experimental study, 40 patients with cervicogenic headache will be recruited.&#xD;
      Participants are required to have complaints for at least 3 months. Participants are included&#xD;
      based on online questionnaires, a clinical examination of neck and shoulder, and the&#xD;
      identification of a MTrP in the M. OCI muscle. All participants will receive information and&#xD;
      have to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be subjected to baseline assessment, which involves questionnaires and&#xD;
      measurements of the cervical spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, participants will be randomly allocated to either the dry needling group or a sham&#xD;
      needling group. The dry needling group will receive a dry needling treatment at the&#xD;
      identified trigger point location (M. OCI - heterolateral to the restricted rotationside)&#xD;
      whereas the sham needling group will receive an intervention in which the needle only&#xD;
      penetrates the skin but not the fascia and muscle tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotational mobility will be evaluated after the needling intervention, afterwards all&#xD;
      patients will receive a standardized manual therapy treatment (Muscle Energy Technique).&#xD;
      Afterwards, all baseline measurements will be conducted again. This testing will be repeated&#xD;
      one week after treatment as well.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in pain score after dry needling, compared to sham needling, as assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
Subjects will have to report their actual pain complaints on a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) at baseline, immediately after dry or sham needling + manual therapy and 1 week after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in neck related disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention (needling + manual therapy), 1 week after the needling intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in neck disability scores after dry needling, compared to sham needling, will be assessed by the Neck Disability Index. The Neck Disability Index consists of 10 questions, each with 6 answer options with concomitant scores ranging from 0 to 5, which makes the total score of the NDI on 50. A score between 5 and 14 represents a mild disability, whereas a score between 15 and 24 is interpreted as a moderate disability. NDI scores of 25 or higher reflect a severe disability. Subjects will have to report their actual disability complaints at baseline, immediately after dry or sham needling + manual therapy and 1 week after the intervention.</description>

    <description>Changes in headache disability scores after dry needling, compared to sham needling, will be assessed by the Headache Disability Index. The Headache Disability Index consists of 25 questions which can be answered with yes (4 points), sometimes (2 points) and no (0 points). A total score of 10-28 is considered to indicate mild disability; 30-48 is moderate disability; 50-68 is severe disability; 72 or more is complete disability. Subjects will have to report their actual disability complaints at baseline, immediately after dry or sham needling + manual therapy and 1 week after the intervention.</description>

    <description>Changes in global cervical mobility after dry needling or sham needling will be assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention (needling + manual therapy) and 1 week after treatment. Measurements will be registered with the digital EasyAngle Goniometer (Meloq).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Pain Pressure Thresholds (PPTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention (needling + manual therapy), 1 week after the needling intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in PPTs after dry needling or sham needling will be assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention (needling + manual therapy) and 1 week after treatment. Measurements will be registered with the digital hand-held pressure algometer (Wagner FPX 25 Force Gage). The change in PPTs will be expressed in Newton.&#xD;
To standardize the pressure applied by the investigator, the same investigator always stabilized his wrist with his other hand. The PPT assessment was performed two times with a 30-second break between each application and the pressure was increased by 1N/s until the patient reported the pressure as unpleasant. This pressure was taken as PPT expressed in Newton (N); and the average will be taken of the three measurements on the spinous process of C2 and the Upper Trapezius Muscle.</description>

    <measure>Changes in joint position error</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention (needling + manual therapy), 1 week after the needling intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in joint position error after dry needling or sham needling will be assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention (needling + manual therapy) and 1 week after treatment. Measurements will be registered with the digital Motion Guidance Laser.&#xD;
The Cervical Joint Position Error (JPE) Test is a measurement tool used to clinically assess an individual's cervicocephalic proprioception ability. Cervicocephalic proprioception describes one's sense of position of their head and neck in space. The Cervical JPE Test measures the ability of a blindfolded patient to accurately relocate their head position back to a predetermined neutral point after cervical joint movement.</description>
