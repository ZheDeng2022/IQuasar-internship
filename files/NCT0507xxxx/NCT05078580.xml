             laboratory evaluations not consistent with known liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         40. Clinically significant illness within 2 weeks prior to initial dosing that may&#xD;
             jeopardize safety of the study participant and/or alter the study results as judged by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             Group 4 (participants with severe hepatic impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
         41. Participants with hepatic impairment with abnormal laboratory values for the following&#xD;
             parameters at Screening or Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &lt; 30 × 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cell count &lt; 2.5 × 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 8 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum amylase &gt; 5 × ULN with no abdominal symptoms (&gt;2 x ULN with abdominal&#xD;
                  symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  International standardized ratio (INR) &gt; 2.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
         42. Severe complications of liver disease within the preceding 3 months prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         43. Hospitalization due to liver disease within the preceding 1 month prior to dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
         45. Participants requiring paracentesis more than every 3 weeks for the management of&#xD;
             ascites are excluded. Participants who are receiving diuretics to manage ascites can&#xD;
             be enrolled and will be assigned the Child-Pugh score for the degree of ascites while&#xD;
             on diuretic treatment. The diuretic dose must have been stable for 7 days prior to&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         46. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and/or have undergone portacaval&#xD;
             shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
         47. Clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, ECG, or laboratory&#xD;
             evaluations, not consistent with known clinical disease. Participants having&#xD;
             myocardial infarction ≥ 5 years ago are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         48. Use of any prescription medications that have the potential to interact with iptacopan&#xD;
             during the study from dosing until the EOS visit (Day 11) has been conducted.&#xD;
             Participants with hepatic impairment should be excluded if there have been changes in&#xD;
             the dose or schedule of medically-required medication within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Screening or if there has been a change or addition to their routine medication&#xD;
             (prescribed) within 1 month prior to drug administration, except for changes to&#xD;
             medication that require frequent dose adjustments, such as insulin or analgesia, which&#xD;
             can be made within 2 weeks prior to drug administration, as agreed between the&#xD;
             Investigator and Novartis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         49. Presence of moderate to severe impaired renal function as indicated by any or all of&#xD;
             the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min as calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula&#xD;
                  or eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on MDRD calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         52. History of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization within the past 3&#xD;
             months prior to Screening.&#xD;
