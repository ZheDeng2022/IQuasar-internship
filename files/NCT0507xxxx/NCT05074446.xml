  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotype threat (ST) is an important issue that has been studied repeatedly in the&#xD;
      psychology literature. ST is the thought that a person will be negatively evaluated and&#xD;
      judged regarding a negative stereotype that belongs to the group to which he/she belongs.&#xD;
      Most people are members of a social group associated with at least one negative stereotype.&#xD;
      Therefore, many people in society may be the target of stereotype threat. Previous research&#xD;
      has shown that the individual performance of people in groups identified with negative&#xD;
      stereotypes, who are exposed to stereotype threat, decreases. The ST may arise when there is&#xD;
      an environment in which the skills of the person that may be affected by a stereotype&#xD;
      associated with his/her group can be measured, or if this stereotype has become evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Covid-19, there has been a rapid increase in the number of intensive care patients in our&#xD;
      country and around the World. Due to this rapid increase, the number of intensivist&#xD;
      physicians is insufficient, and non-intensivist physicians from various branches are assigned&#xD;
      to intensive care units. In social media and newspaper reports, it was stated that&#xD;
      non-intensivist physicians have insufficient knowledge and skills in intubation and in the&#xD;
      treatment of lung infection, and the public was asked to take precautions. However, these&#xD;
      physicians were expected to treat lung infections and intubate the patients in intensive care&#xD;
      units during pandemics. It is unknown to what extent such negative stereotypes, established&#xD;
      or already existing, affect the performance of non-intensivist physicians during their&#xD;
      appointment to the intensive care units during the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in all other departments, the most basic task expected from doctors in intensive care&#xD;
      units is effective basic life support applied for the treatment of cardiopulmonary arrest.&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a basic life support model that is mandatory taught in&#xD;
      medical schools. For this reason, it is expected that all doctors, regardless of their&#xD;
      specialties, will be able to perform CPR effectively. The use of manikins is quite common in&#xD;
      order to standardize CPR training and performance measurement. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate how non-intensivist physicians assigned to intensive care units during the pandemic&#xD;
      are affected by stereotype threat and to investigate the necessary conditions to prevent a&#xD;
      possible decrease in performance in these physicians.&#xD;

    <description>Stereotype threat is the thought that a person will be negatively evaluated and judged regarding a negative stereotype that belongs to the group to which he/she belongs.&#xD;
Stereotype threat manipulation will be performed on the non-intensivist participants in the experimental group just before they are taken into the testing room. For manipulation, the following sentences will be said to the participants in the experimental group: &quot;We aim to compare the cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance between intensive care units and other branches.&quot; The other non-intensivist participants (Control Group) will not be given any prior information.</description>
