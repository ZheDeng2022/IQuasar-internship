      patients with neck pain and associated disability. The reliability of this scale will be&#xD;
      examined using internal consistency and test-retest methods. The internal consistency will be&#xD;
      checked by Cronbach's alpha value. The test-retest reliability will be analyzed using an&#xD;
      interclass correlation with 100 patients.&#xD;
