  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and is the most common childhood&#xD;
      disability. CP is characterized by abnormal development, impaired motor function, and&#xD;
      muscular and skeletal abnormalities. Due to their diminished musculoskeletal function,&#xD;
      individuals with CP suffer a high rate of moderate to severe bone fractures, which can lead&#xD;
      to further immobility. Optimizing muscle and bone health with exercise may be important in&#xD;
      minimizing fractures from limited mobility, and fundamental for maximizing health-related&#xD;
      quality of life. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of exercise&#xD;
      training on musculoskeletal system in individuals with CP, with the goal of reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of falls and fractures. To accomplish these aims, musculoskeletal health will be&#xD;
      assessed using various physiological techniques (e.g., Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry,&#xD;
      Humac Norm Isokinematic System, Biodex Balance System) before, during, and after one year of&#xD;
      exercise training in individuals with CP. In addition, various functional mobility tests to&#xD;
      quantify fitness levels will be performed. Findings may lead to the development of novel&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions targeted at improving musculoskeletal health in individuals with&#xD;
      CP.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Height measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Height (cm) will be measured using a standard beam scale with height rod. This anthropometric measurement is used to assess general body size. Body mass index is calculated and reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Whole body Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be measured to assess overall body composition for the mass of the bone, muscle, and fat in the whole body. For those who do not complete DXA due to severe spasticity, a bioelectrical impedance technique (BIA) using 4 electrode unit Biodynamics Model 310 Body Composition Analyzer will be used to quantify fat mass, fat free mass, and water content. BIA does not use x-ray; thus, participants will not be exposed additional radiation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscular strength</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform leg press, leg curl, and leg extension at submaximal level to predict 1-Repetition Masimum using Brzycki equations. In addition, participants will perform knee extension and flexion testing using Humac Norm Isokinetic Dynamometer to measure isometric and isokinetic muscular strength in hamstrings and quadriceps.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and related fall risks</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale and Biodex Balance System will be used to assess balance and related fall risks. The Berg Balance Scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess populations with gait and balance issues. By completing 14 assessments with varying multiple tasks, participants will receive a point per task to have a final score which indicate the balance and risk of fall. Biodex Balance System assesses neuromuscular control by quantifying the ability to maintain dynamic bilateral and unilateral postural stability on both static and unstable surface. These tests will provide a quantified value for fall risk screening and conditioning status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bone mineral density</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral content and density using regional Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be measured at regions of lumbar spine (L2-4), proximal femur at the hip joint, and forearm. T- and Z-scores of each region will be calculated to detect bone mineral density as well as the changes due to the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Weight (kg) will be measured using a standard beam scale with height rod. This anthropometric measurement is used to assess general body size. Body mass index is calculated and reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist and hip circumferences</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Waist and hip circumference (cm) will be measured using a measuring tape. These anthropometric measurements are used to assess general body size.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  those who can follow simple commands and walk independently with or without the use of&#xD;
             an assistance apparatus (within Classification level I-III, based on Gross Motor&#xD;
             Functioning Classification System, GMFCS) and have cerebral palsy will be included in&#xD;
             the study. The rationale for such inclusion criteria (level I-III) is to make sure&#xD;
             they can perform some leg exercise and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subjects have a history or symptoms of cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, or&#xD;
             respiratory diseases, they will be excluded in the study.&#xD;
