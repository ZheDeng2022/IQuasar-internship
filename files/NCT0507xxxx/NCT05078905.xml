      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been highly effective&#xD;
      against preventing severe disease. But the protective effects of these vaccines appear to&#xD;
      wane over time. Researchers want to learn why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how the immune system responds to vaccines against infections like&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 or older who are scheduled to receive either a new vaccine or a&#xD;
      booster shot against SARS-COV-2 or another emerging infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 8 study visits in 1 year. Each visit should last less than 2&#xD;
      hours. At each visit, participants will give blood samples. Some blood samples will be used&#xD;
      for genetic testing. They will also give updates on their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first study visit, participants will receive either a first vaccination or a&#xD;
      booster shot. They must get the vaccine in their community or workplace. They will not get&#xD;
      the vaccine at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study currently focuses on SARS-CoV-2, but it will expand to other infectious diseases&#xD;
      as they emerge and become the target of new vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality worldwide. Successful efforts to prevent infection and severe disease have been&#xD;
      driven by several vaccine candidates that received emergency use authorization (EUA) in late&#xD;
      2020, including vaccines developed with new technologies such as those used in the two mRNA&#xD;
      vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. However, almost one year into the effort,&#xD;
      there is mounting evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are losing their protective effects&#xD;
      for reasons that remain poorly understood. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown&#xD;
      to wane over time, although it is unclear whether lower antibody titers alone are responsible&#xD;
      for breakthrough infections or whether other factors such as emergence of variants or changes&#xD;
      in cellular responses to the virus are also involved. A better understanding of the&#xD;
      immunologic parameters involved in generating a protective response following vaccination to&#xD;
      new pathogens is necessary to evaluate correlates of protection to infection and&#xD;
      re-infection. The purpose of these studies is to characterize all aspects of the response to&#xD;
      vaccination, to follow its evolution over time and to determine parameters responsible for&#xD;
      maintaining a broad protective immunity.&#xD;

&#xD;
        General Inclusion Criteria for All Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness to give consent for the storage of blood samples for research&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent Document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Primary (New) Vaccination Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No history of having received a dose of the vaccine for the infectious disease being&#xD;
        studied. Subjects who have enrolled under another Laboratory of Immunoregulation (LIR)&#xD;
        protocol and had samples drawn prior to vaccination will also be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Secondary (Booster) Vaccination Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Willingness to return for baseline research blood collection prior to booster&#xD;
        vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current abuse of alcohol or other drugs that, in the judgement of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator (PI) could interfere with patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any medical or mental health condition that, in the judgement of the PI, would make&#xD;
             the volunteer unable to participate in the study.&#xD;
