  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Oral processing behaviours (i.e. eating rate, bite size, chews per bite, oral&#xD;
      exposure time etc.) play a major role in food ingestion and digestion, and potentially&#xD;
      influence satiation and satiety responses . Experimental studies showed that a prolonged&#xD;
      mastication or a slower eating rate is associated with decreased food intake , and increased&#xD;
      satiety response per kcal consumed. Therefore, one possible approach to control the intake&#xD;
      and appetite is to encourage eating behaviour that slow the rate of food intake and enhance&#xD;
      the onset of satiety. Texture led changes to oral processing behaviours could offer an&#xD;
      exciting opportunity to adapt an individual's response to structure properties of the food&#xD;
      being consumed in a way that maintains the associated eating experience and satiety from food&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no studies to date have investigated how differences in food processing influences&#xD;
      food texture characteristics and oral processing behaviours, and subsequently impact on&#xD;
      individuals' satiety responses and their subsequent food intake. The proposed study will&#xD;
      examine the role of oral processing behaviours and/ or food processing (i.e. minimally&#xD;
      processed, processed and ultra-processed) on satiety responses and the subsequent food intake&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of the study are to characterise the differences in oral&#xD;
      processing behaviours (i.e. eating rate, bite size, chew per bite, oral exposure time etc.)&#xD;
      and satiety responses of meals that differ in their degree of processing, and to further&#xD;
      investigate how texture-based differences in oral processing behaviours modified by degree of&#xD;
      food processing influence the satiety responses (fullness over the time) and subsequent food&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A total of 1 screening session (Session 1) and 4 test sessions (Sessions 2 to&#xD;
      5) and 2x2 randomised crossover design where participants receive 4 treatments (i.e. 4 test&#xD;
      meals) over 4 test sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy males ( n=50), aged 21-50 years with BMI between 18-25 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Session 1 involves tasting of up to 16 food items and computer task to rate and&#xD;
      evaluate their perception and health behaviour. Sessions 2 to 5 involve evaluation of sensory&#xD;
      characteristics, video recording of participants eating, and wrist-worn accelerometer to&#xD;
      track wrist movement while consuming the 4 test meals.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to characterise the differences in oral processing behaviours&#xD;
      (i.e. eating rate, bite size, chew per bite, oral exposure time etc.) and satiety responses&#xD;
      of meals that differ in their degree of processing, and to further investigate how&#xD;
      texture-based differences in oral processing behaviours modified by degree of food processing&#xD;
      (i.e. un-, minimally-processed, processed and ultra-processed foods) influence the satiety&#xD;
      responses (fullness over the time) and subsequent food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will require participants to attend a total of 5 study sessions involving 1&#xD;
      screening session (session 1) and 4 test sessions (sessions 2 to 5). Each session will last&#xD;
      for approximately one to 1.5 hours (Screening), or 1.5 to 3 hours each (4 test sessions),&#xD;
      respectively. maximum of 50 participants will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perceived sensory, oral processing behaviours, and satiety responses across different&#xD;
      meals (e.g. rice with meat and vegetable, meat with potato and salad, etc.) will be assessed&#xD;
      using video recording, sensory and appetite assessment on 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),&#xD;
      respectively. The subsequent food intake at the ad libitum snack for different meals will&#xD;
      also be measured using a Sartorius balance. The dietary behaviour, perception and portion&#xD;
      selection of foods varying in level of processing and nutrient sources will also be evaluated&#xD;
      using a Health Behaviour Questionnaire and a simple computerised task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Foods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All food that are consumed are commercially available, safe for human consumption and&#xD;
      prepared in line with safe hygienic food preparation (e.g. Meals: rice with meat and&#xD;
      vegetable, meat with potato and salad etc.; Sweet and savoury snacks: biscuits, chips etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (Session 1, 1-1.5 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be asked to give informed consent before taking part in any&#xD;
      of the research activities. Participants are to complete a screening questionnaire and basic&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, skinfold measurements and percentage body&#xD;
      fat using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analyser (Tanita) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successfully screened participants will proceed to complete a Food Preference Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Health Behaviour Questionnaire and taste no more than 16 samples to rate and evaluate their&#xD;
      perception and health behaviour for the foods varying in degree of processing and nutrient&#xD;
      sources at the remaining of the screening session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test sessions (Sessions 2 to 5, 1.5 to 3 hours each):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend 1 session per week for four consecutive weeks to evaluate up to 4&#xD;
      fixed portion test meals across for lunch-time sessions, i.e. 1 fixed portion test meal per&#xD;
      session. On each test day, participants will also be asked to consume 1 ad libitum snack&#xD;
      after 2 hours of consuming the fixed portion test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be required to fast from 11.00 pm the evening before and refrain from&#xD;
      engaging in vigorous physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each test day, participants will be asked to arrive at CNRC between 8.00-9.00am and&#xD;
      complete a set of appetite ratings (pre-breakfast rating). Following the pre-breakfast&#xD;
      rating, participants will receive a standardised, fixed portion breakfast to take away with&#xD;
      them and consume at fixed interval during the morning (before the lunch). The purpose is to&#xD;
      equilibrate their appetite need state ahead of the fixed portion test meal at lunch session.&#xD;
      Participants will consume the breakfast within 15 minutes, after which complete a second set&#xD;
      of appetite ratings (post-breakfast ratings). Participants will refrain from consuming&#xD;
      anything except water and continue to complete the appetite rating at 15 or 30 minutes'&#xD;
      intervals before coming to CNRC for their lunch (between 12.00-1.00pm), prompted by reminder&#xD;
      set on their mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lunch session will be scheduled from midday onwards (between 12.00-1.00pm) and will begin&#xD;
      with a set of appetite rating (pre-lunch rating). Participants will be served a fixed portion&#xD;
      test meal along with a glass of water. Participants will then be asked to consume the fixed&#xD;
      portion test meal within 20 minutes. Participants' eating behaviour at lunch will be webcam&#xD;
      recorded in order to record and behaviourally code their oral processing behaviour (i.e.&#xD;
      eating rate, bite number, bite size etc). In addition, Participants will be asked to wear a&#xD;
      wrist worn accelerometer (M5StickC ESP32-PICO Mini loT Development Kit, China) on the hand&#xD;
      they eat with to track the wrist movement while eating. After completed eating, participants&#xD;
      will be required to rate its sensory characteristics, such as liking, familiarity, overall&#xD;
      flavour intensity, firmness, crunchiness, chewiness, saltiness and sweetness etc on a 100mm&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) using a computer. Participants will be required to complete&#xD;
      post-lunch appetite ratings at 15 or 30 minutes' intervals for 120 minutes (post-lunch&#xD;
      ratings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approximately two hours, participants will return to CNRC for an ad-libitum afternoon&#xD;
      snack, and rate their appetite before consuming the ad-libitum snack. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to consume in their normal way and to eat until comfortably full. Participants&#xD;
      will leave CNRC after the snack session and asked to complete a food diary to record his food&#xD;
      intake for the rest of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensory, oral processing characteristics, and satiety responses for 4 different fixed&#xD;
      portion test meals will be assessed. The subsequent food intake at ad libitum snack for&#xD;
      different meals will also be measured.&#xD;
