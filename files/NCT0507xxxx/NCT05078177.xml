    <textblock>
      Considering the accumulated data on the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, indicating a&#xD;
      significant role of B cells in the progression of the disease, the use of monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies to CD20 antigen, administered intrathecally to achieve adequate B-lymphodepletion&#xD;
      in the barrier tissues can increase the duration of the recurrence-free course of autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, suspend their progression, and also prevent clinical relapse when memory B cells&#xD;
      are detected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive autoimmune-mediated inflammatory&#xD;
      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), clinically manifested by impaired&#xD;
      sensory motor function and cognitive impairment. In the pathogenesis of MS, T-cells make the&#xD;
      main contribution to the process of inflammatory demyelination; however, the accumulated data&#xD;
      on the pathogenesis of MS indicate a significant role of B cells in the progression of the&#xD;
      disease. In addition to differentiation into plasma cells that produce autoantibodies, B&#xD;
      lymphocytes stimulate T cell activity through antigen presentation, production of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines that trigger demyelination and differentiation into memory B cells&#xD;
      that promote CD4 + T cell autoproliferation. The presence of &quot;oligoclonal bands&quot; in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid and demyelination plaques of brain tissue in MS patients is the result of&#xD;
      persistent intrathecal clonal expansion of various B cell populations that contribute to the&#xD;
      production of autoreactive antibodies. Thus, B cells located in the central nervous system,&#xD;
      protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and, as a consequence, not undergoing complete&#xD;
      eradication due to limited penetration of the BBB by immunosuppressive drugs, are a potential&#xD;
      target for the treatment of patients with MS. Depletion of B cells through the use of&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies to the CD20 antigen, which is expressed predominantly on mature B&#xD;
      lymphocytes, is a promising direction in the therapy of autoimmune diseases. The most readily&#xD;
      available anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is rituximab. The available data from numerous&#xD;
      studies on the use of intravenous rituximab have demonstrated a decrease in MR activity and&#xD;
      clinical activity in patients with RRMS. At the same time, rituximab does not affect clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with PPMS and SPMS with a long history of the disease, probably due to&#xD;
      insufficient antibody concentration in intact BBB in the CNS tissue affected by tertiary&#xD;
      lymphoid follicles, because the ratio of rituximab concentration in CSF and serum after&#xD;
      intravenous infusion ranges from 0.1% to 1-1.7%. Thus, to ensure a sufficient therapeutic&#xD;
      concentration of rituximab in the tissues of the central nervous system, the use of the&#xD;
      intrathecal route of drug administration is justified. To date, sufficient data have been&#xD;
      accumulated on the safety of using intrathecal rituximab in the treatment of both oncological&#xD;
      and autoimmune diseases (including MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the use of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody injected intrathecally in order to achieve&#xD;
      adequate B-lymphodepletion in the barrier tissues can increase the duration of the&#xD;
      recurrence-free course of autoimmune diseases, suspend their progression, and also prevent&#xD;
      clinical relapse when memory B cells are detected.&#xD;

    <description>Multiple sclerosis-specific questionnaire - The Short Form-36 (SF-36) before and after AHSCT:&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of 36 questions grouped into eight scales: physical functioning, role-physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The indicators of each scale are compiled in such a way that the higher the value of the indicator (from 0 to 100), the better the score on the chosen scale. Of these, two parameters are formed: the psychological and physical components of health.</description>

The MSIS-29 scale consists of 29 items and includes indicators observed over the previous two weeks, including 20 of which characterize physical condition, coordination and mobility, and 9 questions reflect the patient's mental state. Answers are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1 = none; 2 = little; 3 = moderate; 4 = significant; 5 = very strong) in one direction.&#xD;
The total score is the sum of all 29 responses and can range from 29 to 145. A higher score means a higher degree of disability. The result is assessed on a scale from 0 to 100, where a higher result means worse health.</description>
