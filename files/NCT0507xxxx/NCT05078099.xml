      The Study Purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel binocular&#xD;
      eye-tracking-based passive home treatment system delivering personalized amblyopia therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Real-time foveal area blur was induced on the dominant eye of 20 participants (aged&#xD;
      4-15 years) with anisometropic, strabismic (&lt;5 PD) or mixed amblyopia. Subjects were trained&#xD;
      over 12 weeks with 5 weekly sessions and then for an additional 12 weeks with 3 weekly&#xD;
      sessions. Primary outcome was the improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and&#xD;
      stereo acuity. Secondary outcomes were adherence, improvement persistence, and&#xD;
      patient-reported comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  For each individual subject, clinician's decision regarding: continue treatment by&#xD;
           patching or terminate treatment Treatment cessation and follow-up; or, Treatment&#xD;
           continuation (patching)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4: 24 weeks ± 1 week (primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The call center will be comprised of NovaSight personnel, protected by a firewall. For the&#xD;
      patching group subjects, the call center personnel will contact all subjects' guardians at 1&#xD;
      week (3 to 7 days) to encourage initial compliance with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CureSight treatment group, the call center will contact the subjects' guardians in&#xD;
      order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assist first time setup at home over the phone&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide technical support by phone in case of system malfunction or any other query or&#xD;
           problem appearing during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Respond to compliance notifications of the software and contact the subject's guardians&#xD;
           when needed in order to encourage compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Answer any questions that arise by the subjects or guardians. Permission for such&#xD;
           contacts will be included in the Informed Consent Form. The call center personal will be&#xD;
           exposed to the following details, contact information, email and phone number.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria must be met for a child to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 4 to 40 years male and female&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Amblyopia associated with strabismus, anisometropia, or both (previously treated or&#xD;
             untreated)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have refractive error correction (based on a cycloplegic refraction completed&#xD;
             within the last 7 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Spectacle correction meeting the above criteria must be worn For at least 16 weeks OR&#xD;
             until distance VA stability is documented (defined as &lt;0.1 logMAR change by the same&#xD;
             testing method measured on 2 consecutive exams at least 8 weeks apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. VA, measured in each eye without cycloplegia in current spectacle correction using the&#xD;
             Lea symbol per ATS VA protocol for children &lt; 7 years and the EETDRS VA protocol for&#xD;
             children ≥ 7 years on a study-approved device displaying single surrounded optotypes,&#xD;
             as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye &lt;1.0 logMAR (20/200)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Best-corrected dominant-eye VA &lt;0.2&#xD;

             (Angles of ocular deviation &gt;4∆ are not allowed because large magnitudes of the&#xD;
             deviation would compromise successful alignment of the dichoptic stimuli.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Passing a dedicated 10 min in-clinic performance ability test to assure suitable eye&#xD;
             tracking performance (validity of eye tracking data &gt;90% and successful calibration&#xD;
             process).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. Subject in general good health and able, as per investigator decision, to comply with&#xD;
        study visits and protocol procedures and wear refractive correction and has access to&#xD;
        wireless internet at home which is able to support the CureSight treatment (loaned by&#xD;
        sponsor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Signed and dated informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10. Parent and participant understand and are willing to comply with study procedures and&#xD;
        will be available for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Myopia greater than -6.00 D. spherical equivalent in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known skin reactions to patch or bandage adhesives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe developmental delay that would interfere with treatment or evaluation (in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any condition that might interfere with eye tracking, such as ptosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any reported anatomic ocular anomaly (e.g., small lens opacity, myelinated nerve fiber&#xD;
             layer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous intraocular or refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Heterophoria with a total near deviation of ≥10Δ (measured by PACT&#xD;
