  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo data as well as early phase 1 clinical trials have shown&#xD;
      that both hematologic and solid tumor cells are susceptible to single-agent cytotoxicity by&#xD;
      CPI-613 (devimistat), consistent with its selective target of the altered form of&#xD;
      mitochondrial energy metabolism in tumor cells, causing changes in mitochondrial enzyme&#xD;
      activities and redox status, which lead to apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy of tumor cells&#xD;
      leading to the death of cancer cells. It is our hypothesis that CPI-613 (devimistat) will&#xD;
      enhance the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX plus Bevacizumab when given as a combination treatment.&#xD;
      The study will follow a standard 3+3 design. Cohorts of three to six patients will be treated&#xD;
      at each dose level until the MTD is defined.&#xD;
