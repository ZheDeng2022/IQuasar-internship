    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized control trial and will be conducted in Pakistan Railway&#xD;
      Hospital Rawalpindi. A sample of 36 participants will be taken. Patients will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups by sealed envelop method. Patients in group A will receive Active Release&#xD;
      Technique along with conventional therapy while Patients in group B will receive instrument&#xD;
      assisted soft tissue mobilization along with conventional therapy. The study includes&#xD;
      intervention protocol of 4 weeks. The sessions will be given 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      outcome measures Numeric pain rating scale(NPRS), Hand Dynamometer and Patient-Rated Tennis&#xD;
      Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) will be measured at baseline and at the end of 4th week. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed by SPSS 25&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale that is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (no pain) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;). The intrarater reliability with ICC = 0.67.</description>

    <description>hand dynamometer is the most reliable and acceptable tool for measuring grip strength. It detects and quantitatively determines the degree of weak grip strength. (ICC = 0.99)</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive Active Release Technique along with conventional therapy. ART will be given with patient seated, elbow flexed and resting on the treatment table, forearm in midprone &amp; wrist in neutral position and then the therapist will work on the common extensor tendon by applying pressure to the tendon distal to their attachment at the elbow. The patient will start with the elbow bent and wrist straight. As the therapist hold the muscles, the patient will extend the elbow and pronate and flex the wrist while the therapist move the pressure proximally, attempting to release adhesions around and between muscle planes. Total of 15 repetitions for of 10 minutes.&#xD;
CONVENTIONAL THERAPY:&#xD;
Hot pack for 15 minutes&#xD;
TENS for 15 minutes&#xD;
Ultrasound (pulsed mode, 1MHz at 1.5 W/cm2 for 5 minutes)</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive IASTM along with conventional therapy. In graston technique proper application of GT3 which include application of a cream to the common extensor tendon. The GT3will be then used to common extensor tendon. In areas of increased tissue restriction, more required pressure with GT3 is applied using increased force and shorter strokes over the areas of restriction. Ice will be offered as needed for pain management after each session.&#xD;
The study includes interventional protocol of 4 weeks. The sessions will be given 3 times a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
