  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to apply a biomechanical system (the NeuroFlexor)&#xD;
      associated with the EMG recording to study the physiological mechanisms that contribute to&#xD;
      the regulation of muscle tone in healthy subjects and in patients with increased muscle tone.&#xD;
      A second fundamental objective of this study is to monitor over time the changes in muscle&#xD;
      tone that can be found physiologically in healthy subjects and pathologically in patients&#xD;
      with spasticy and/or rigidity. A further objective of this study is the quantitative&#xD;
      evaluation of the symptomatic effects of specific therapies in improving the impaired muscle&#xD;
      tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation In this research project the investigators will recruit 20 patients with&#xD;
      upper limb spasticity (regardless of the underlying disease responsible for the spasticity),&#xD;
      20 patients with Parkinson's disease characterized by stiffness of the upper limbs and 20&#xD;
      healthy control subjects. Patients will be recruited from the IRCCS Neuromed Institute,&#xD;
      Pozzilli (IS). Participants will give their written informed consent to the study, which will&#xD;
      be approved by the institutional ethics committee of the IRCCS Neuromed Institute, in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants will be right-handed according&#xD;
      to the Edinburgh handedness inventory (EDI) (Oldfield, 1971). Parkinson's disease will be&#xD;
      diagnosed in accordance with the updated diagnostic criteria of the MDS (Postuma, RB et al.&#xD;
      Validation of the MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease. Mov. Disord. Off.&#xD;
      J. Mov. Disord. Soc. 33, 1601 -1608 (2018)., Nd). Clinical signs and symptoms of parkinsonian&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated using the Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale (H&amp;Y), UPDRS part III (Patrick et&#xD;
      al., 2001). The diagnosis of spasticity will be made through the neurological clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of the patients and on the basis of the specific clinical history of the various&#xD;
      pathologies underlying the spasticity itself (e.g. multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal&#xD;
      injuries). Spasticity will be assessed with the Modified Ashworth Scale &quot;(MAS) (Harb and&#xD;
      Kishner, 2021), the Modified Tardieu scale (MTS) (Patrick and Ada, 2006). Cognitive functions&#xD;
      and mood, in both pathological conditions, will be evaluated using the clinical Mini-Mental&#xD;
      State Evaluation (MMSE) scale (Folstein et al., 1975) and the Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale (HAM_D) ( Hamilton, 1967). No participant must report pain problems and / or functional&#xD;
      limitations affecting the upper limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: - insufficient degree of passive wrist movement (&lt;30 ° in flexion and &lt;40&#xD;
      ° in extension) - tension at rest during NeuroFlexor recordings - hand pathologies&#xD;
      (neurological or rheumatological) - upper limb fractures in the previous six months -&#xD;
      presence of peacemakers or other stimulators - pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, and the group of healthy control subjects will have comparable anthropometric&#xD;
      and demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental paradigm Participants will be seated comfortably, with the shoulder at 45 ° of&#xD;
      abduction, the elbow at 90 ° in flexion, the forearm in pronation and the dominant hand&#xD;
      placed on the platform of the Neuroflexor device. Participants will be instructed to relax&#xD;
      during the test session, which will consist of the passive extension of the wrist at 7&#xD;
      speeds, one slow (5 ° / s) and 6 rapid (50 ° / s, 100 ° / s, 150 ° / s, 200 ° / s, 236 ° / s,&#xD;
      280 ° / s). The total range of wrist movement will be 50 °, starting from an initial angle of&#xD;
      20 ° in palmar flexion up to 30 ° in extension. Before the start of the experiment,&#xD;
      participants will do practical tests in order to become familiar with the device. Two slow&#xD;
      and five rapid movements will be made for each speed. The different angular velocities of&#xD;
      wrist mobilization will be randomized. Slow movements will be performed before fast movements&#xD;
      with an interval of 10 seconds between each test. For each participant, a NC, EC and VC value&#xD;
      in Newton will be calculated by a dedicated software. The resistance profiles will also be&#xD;
      obtained when the device was running idle (without hand) to allow the biomechanical model to&#xD;
      isolate the forces originating from the hand from the intrinsic forces of the device. For&#xD;
      each movement, the corresponding surface EMG trace will have been recorded, by placing the&#xD;
      electrodes on the skin overlying the belly of the FRC and ERC muscles. An accelerometer,&#xD;
      fixed on the back of the hand of the limb to be examined, will be used to synchronize the&#xD;
      electromyograph with the NeuroFlexor. The EMG activity recorded by means of surface&#xD;
      electrodes with belly-tendon type mounting, will be amplified using the Digitimer, will then&#xD;
      be digitized at 5 kHz using the CED, and finally it will be stored on a computer dedicated to&#xD;
      offline analysis. EMG recordings will be made at 6 speeds, 50°/ s, 100°/ s, 150°/ s, 200 °/s,&#xD;
      236 °/s, 280 °/s. For each trace the following parameters will be analyzed: latency,&#xD;
      peak-to-peak amplitude and area of the EMG response.&#xD;
