  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate whether EG-007 plus&#xD;
      Len+Pem is superior to Len+Pem alone in patients with advanced endometrial cancer (Stage III&#xD;
      or IV). This trial will be preceded by a safety lead-in study with up to 28 patients (the&#xD;
      safety lead-in is a separate, free-standing protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 450 patients will be randomized equally (1:1) to receive EG-007 plus Len+Pem or&#xD;
      Len+Pem alone. The randomization will be stratified by the following stratification factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis Classification (advanced Stage III/IV vs. recurrent endometrial cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG score at baseline (0 vs 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geographic region (Asia vs ROW)&#xD;
