      The RESTART/RICOMINCIARE study is a pilot single-center, not controlled prospective, pre-post&#xD;
      intervention study aimed at verifying feasibility and safety of a device-supported home&#xD;
      rehabilitation for people suffering from mild to moderate disabilities due to respiratory or&#xD;
      neurological conditions, related to Covid-19 or frailty condition (i.e. Parkinson Disease).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RICOMINCIARE project aims at contributing to the Covid-19 pandemic emergency by promoting&#xD;
      the health and recovery of people recovering from Covid-19 and supporting frail people,&#xD;
      providing an innovative telemedicine solution for the continuity of rehabilitation, able to&#xD;
      promote and monitor remote physical rehabilitation activities in the elderly in isolation and&#xD;
      remission from Covid-19, while containing the risk of spreading the infection. Between the&#xD;
      people suffering from Covid-19, 80% show symptoms and 32% need hospitalization. It is&#xD;
      estimated that the most severe cases (about 20%) have functional sequelae that persist for&#xD;
      more than 6 months after diagnosis. In consideration of the absence of a vaccine or specific&#xD;
      therapy, social distancing represents the main tool for limiting the infection. The use of&#xD;
      tele-medicine is recommended and useful for everyone to ensure continuity of care in terms of&#xD;
      monitoring, prevention and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: to test the feasibility of integrating the ARC-Intellicare solution into&#xD;
      the care pathway for Covid-19 survivors or frail people in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) adherence to the home rehabilitation program (ii) safety of rehabilitation therapy&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to investigate the (iiI) usability and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention; (iv) the process and resources required for the new care pathway. The&#xD;
      rehabilitation will take place according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the&#xD;
      available guidelines regarding rehabilitation protocols and clinical and functional&#xD;
      assessment for chronic respiratory syndromes, Post-Covid-19 conditions and neurological&#xD;
      diseases related disabilities. Therefore, participants will undergo pre-post intervention&#xD;
      monitoring of the clinical and functional status in terms of independence in the activities&#xD;
      of daily life, endurance, fatigue, emotional state, quality of life following GCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The RICOMINCIARE study will be a pilot single-center, not controlled&#xD;
      prospective, pre-post intervention study aimed at verifying feasibility and safety of a&#xD;
      device supported home rehabilitation for people suffering from mild to moderate disabilities&#xD;
      due to respiratory or neurological conditions possibly related to Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population. 5-10 people will be enrolled in the study between subjects who consecutively&#xD;
      refers themselves to the study participating clinical center (Università Politecnica delle&#xD;
      Marche, Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica, Ancona) for rehabilitation&#xD;
      management of a post-COVID-19 condition or in frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Post-Covid-19 people: at home post-COVID-19 volunteers (discharged from hospital at home&#xD;
      or treated at home) who have recovered from SARS-COV-2 infection (healing = two 24-hour&#xD;
      consecutive oropharyngeal tampons negative for SARS-COV-2) from at least 15 days B) Frail&#xD;
      people who score 9-12 on the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) due to neurological lesions of the&#xD;
      motor system (i.e. Parkinson's Disease) or respiratory syndrome (COPD, pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis...). Individuals should have no signs of ongoing pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The two-month study involves the recruitment of at least 20 patients who will&#xD;
      use ARC-Intellicare at home, to perform usability tests and a collection of useful data in&#xD;
      order to optimize the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the same patients will each receive an ARC-Intellicare unit for home use, to be&#xD;
      used independently for the next 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 minutes 5 days / week for 4 weeks of personalized training will be carried out by the&#xD;
      enrolled subjects: 4 weekly sessions will be unsupervised, while one will be supervised&#xD;
      remotely by a therapist in telepresence, thanks to the integrated audio-video channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints. The primary endpoints are an adherence rate of 80% (+/- 5%) and a rate of&#xD;
      participants' attrition (expected dropouts) of no more than 15%. The reasons for dropout or&#xD;
      interruptions and side effects (number and types of adverse events related to the use of ARC)&#xD;
      will also be monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints are a System Usability Scale (SUS) score&#xD;
      administered to participants and informal health care workers or health care workers&gt; 70&#xD;
      (i.e., the solution has a good level of usability) and a patient satisfaction of at least 80%&#xD;
      on average on visual analog scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment timing. The entry variables and the clinical-functional data, according to the&#xD;
      GCP, are acquired at enrolment / baseline assessment (T0) or within 7 days from the start of&#xD;
      home intervention and at the end of the 30 days of intervention (T1), when monitoring of the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures on adherence, acceptability and safety will be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>ARC intellicare</intervention_name>
    <description>ARC is a system that allows home motor and respiratory rehabilitation. The system includes 5 inertial measurement units for limbs and neck, a tablet with a dedicated app installed, to acquire and monitor the exercises performed by the patient in his/her daily rehab activity. Sensors and tablet can be charged on the base station. ARC allows the therapist to tailor the individual rehab project, with the support of a monitoring dashboard. The artificial intelligence engine analyses data coming from sensors positioned on the limbs, providing real-time feedback to the patient on the correct number of repetitions performed for each exercise. ARC allows therapists to create new exercises and/or select exercises from the ARC library to customize treatment (including tutorials and tips) based on condition-specific validated protocols and best practice. Patients can safely perform home rehabilitation sessions by wearing sensors and following video tutorials and tips from the ARC library.</description>
