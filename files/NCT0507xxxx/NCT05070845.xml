  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm, multicenter, multiple subcutaneous injection,&#xD;
      safety and efficacy study of PF-06835375 in adult participants with primary immune&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (ITP). This study will focus on participants with persistent (&gt;3 months and&#xD;
      ≤12 months), or chronic (&gt;12 months) ITP&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to elucidate the effects of PF-06835375 on platelet counts in&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe primary ITP. Based on the experience with other B-cells&#xD;
      depleting agents, it is expected that the platelet counts will increase following a standard&#xD;
      treatment as evidenced in rituximab efficacy data in the treatment of ITP.3,7,24-26 Each&#xD;
      participant will receive 1 subcutaneous injection every month for 3 months during the 12 week&#xD;
      treatment period. This should provide sufficient levels of exposure and depletion of CXCR5&#xD;
      positive cells to sustain the effects of PF-06835375 during the 12 week treatment period.&#xD;
      Additional depletion of Tfh cells may provide sustained increase in platelet count following&#xD;
      the last treatment at Week 8.&#xD;
