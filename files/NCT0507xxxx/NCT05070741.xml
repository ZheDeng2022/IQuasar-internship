  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensory dysfunction as a result of peripheral nerve damage is a significant problem that&#xD;
      leads to reduced quality of life for patients. The prevalence of sensory dysfunction in&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy associates with epidemic increases in prediabetes and diabetes, but&#xD;
      also is relevant to chemotherapy treatments and genetic disorders. Clinical approaches to&#xD;
      treat peripheral neuropathy and to stimulate axon growth in settings of peripheral axon loss&#xD;
      are limited. Although new drugs will hopefully be forthcoming, the most promising approaches&#xD;
      likely involve behavioral and lifestyle interventions. Mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging&#xD;
      as a key cellular contribution to peripheral axon health and peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
      Mitochondrial deficiencies contribute to neuropathy and include impaired mitochondrial&#xD;
      problems with trafficking, mitophagy, fission, and biogenesis. All of these are thought to&#xD;
      lead to a bioenergetic crisis, ending in distal axonal degeneration, sensory dysfunction and&#xD;
      pain. Heat shock proteins play a critically important role in cellular homeostasis and&#xD;
      increasing heat shock protein functions within cells leads to a range of positive&#xD;
      improvements, particularly in mitochondria. In addition, new evidence suggests that&#xD;
      increasing heat shock protein responses in peripheral nerves has powerful, positive impacts&#xD;
      on sensory function and neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our interdisciplinary team will investigate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and translate these approaches to improve treatment for patients with&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy. We hypothesize that novel heat treatment interventions that improve&#xD;
      mitochondrial function will improve metabolic symptoms and peripheral nerve mitochondria,&#xD;
      leading to improvements in sensory function, via heat shock protein induction. We will employ&#xD;
      immersion heat treatment to elevate heat shock protein responses that induce positive changes&#xD;
      in peripheral nerve mitochondria. One aspect is to confirm the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      potential for heat treatment to improve sensory dysfunction in human patients with&#xD;
      prediabetes. The goal of this proposal is 1) to test the breadth of heat treatment on various&#xD;
      forms of neuropathy, 2) identify mechanisms in which heat treatment improves mitochondrial&#xD;
      function, and 3) test the efficacy, safety, and potential for heat treatment to improve&#xD;
      sensory dysfunction in human patients with prediabetes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This prospective, observational cohort pilot study will recruit 20 patients with prediabetes with or without peripheral neuropathy (painful and non-painful) to participate in a 4-week heat therapy intervention. After screening, informed consent, and enrollment into the study, subjects will undergo a pre-intervention evaluation that will assess metabolic biomarkers and heat shock protein levels (blood), peripheral neuropathy, and epidermal evaluation (skin biopsy). After the skin biopsy has the appropriate time to heal (approximately 7-14 days), the subjects will undergo 45-minute heat treatments in 40°C water, three times weekly, for 4 weeks. After completion of heat treatments, subjects will undergo a repeated post-intervention evaluation and skin biopsy. Statistical approaches will compare pre- and post-heat therapy measures.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This study will recruit subjects to participate in heat therapy treatment at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). After pre-screening, informed consent, and enrollment, all subjects will have baseline laboratory assessments as well as an examination for neuropathy and a lower distal leg biopsy (3mm). Subjects will complete 12 heat therapy treatments over the course of 4 weeks. Within 24-48 hours after the last heat therapy experience, post-treatment laboratory assessments as well as an examination for neuropathy and a lower distal leg biopsy (3mm) will be performed.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo 12 hot water immersions of 40.5 degrees Celsius for approximately 45 minutes per session over 4 weeks. Subjects will be immersed up to the shoulder in a 40°C hot tub until rectal temperature (Tre) increases by 1°C (~20 minutes). Subjects will then remain in the water bath submerged to waist level to maintain Tre between 38.5 and 39.0°C for another 30 minutes (approx. total time submerged ~50 minutes). Following hot water immersion, subjects will be monitored for another 10 min, or until Tre falls below 38.5°C. Core temperature will be monitored using either 1) a rectal probe with sterile disposable sheaths or 2) a sterile disposable rectal thermistor probe (401 A/C, Advanced Industrial Systems, Inc., Harrods Creek, KY) to be inserted ~1 inch past the anal sphincter (inserted by participant). Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the treatment. Subjects will be continually monitored and removed from the hot bath if Tre exceeds 39.5°C.</description>
