      The aim of this study is to clinically evaluate the effect of Nitrofurantion on Intensity of&#xD;
      Postoperative Pain and Bacterial Load Reduction, when compared to calcium hydroxide in teeth&#xD;
      with necrotic pulp.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitrofurantoin has been used as a treatment for UTI since the 1950s. Evidence suggested that&#xD;
      nitrofurantoin has excellent safety profile and lower resistance rates compared to recently&#xD;
      introduced antimicrobials, recommending it as the first-line agent. Nitrofurantoin is convert&#xD;
      to reactive intermediates by bacterial Nitroreductases. These intermediates were shown to&#xD;
      attack bacterial ribosomal proteins non-specifically, causing complete inhibition of protein&#xD;
      synthesis. In MIC, Nitrofurantoin specifically inhibit enzyme synthesis in bacteria (24). The&#xD;
      lack of clinically significant bacterial resistance development to Nitrofurantoin is likely&#xD;
      due to the multiple sites of attack and multiple mechanisms of action. Achievement of high&#xD;
      local levels and low serum concentrations, and its effectiveness against both gram-negative&#xD;
      and gram-positive bacteria provide many advantages that many of the newer agents do not have.&#xD;
      After searching the database there is no clinical studies found yet on the effect of&#xD;
      Nitrofurantoin antibiotic used as intracanal medicament in teeth with necrotic pulp. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to clinically evaluate the effect of Nitrofurantion on Intensity of&#xD;
      Postoperative Pain and Bacterial Load Reduction, when compared to calcium hydroxide in teeth&#xD;
      with necrotic pulp.&#xD;

             categorized as I or II according to The American Society of Anesthesiologists. (ASA I&#xD;
             or II) 4-Patients' accepting to participate in the trial. 5-Patients who can&#xD;
             understand pain scale and can sign the informed consent. 6- Mandibular Single rooted&#xD;
             premolars, having single root canal:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosed clinically with pulp necrosis.&#xD;
