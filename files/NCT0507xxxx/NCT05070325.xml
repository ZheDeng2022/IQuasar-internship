  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental research with the purpose of&#xD;
      determining the effect of the methods of cold application and Shotblocker on the pain and&#xD;
      anxiety level of the children in reducing the pain associated with the intramuscular&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 0. Shotblocker and the cold application to the injection site prior to the&#xD;
      injection are not effective in reducing the pain associated with the intramuscular injection&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1. Using ShotBlocker during the intramuscular injection reduces the pain and&#xD;
      anxiety experienced by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. Applying cold to the injection site prior to the intramuscular injection&#xD;
      reduces the pain and anxiety experienced by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study in a university&#xD;
      hospital in Çorum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the study comprised 150 children aged 7 to 12 years who were brought to the&#xD;
      pediatric injection room in a university hospital and had intramuscular injection. The&#xD;
      children were randomized into the Shotblocker (n=50), cold application (n=50) and control&#xD;
      (n=50) groups. In addition to Wong-Baker Pain Scale and Child Anxiety Scale, the Child&#xD;
      Information Form was used in the study to determine the introductory characteristics of the&#xD;
      children and their family.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population of this study consisted of the children within the age range of 7-12 years who&#xD;
      applied to the injection room in the pediatrics clinic of a university hospital between&#xD;
      November 2017 and June 2018. On the other hand, the sample of this study consisted of 150&#xD;
      children who met the case-selection criteria and agreed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Power analysis carried out based on the literature, the sample size of the study was&#xD;
      determined as 150 with the confidence level of 90% (α=0.10). For 150 children, the power was&#xD;
      β=0.20, 1-β=0.80 with α =.05. The approximate number of subjects was calculated as 50 per&#xD;
      group with the Cohen's effect size of α = .05 and the confidence interval of 95%. The&#xD;
      children in the sample were randomly assigned to the following groups: Cold application,&#xD;
      Shotblocker, and control. In order to determine which case to include in which group, the&#xD;
      numbers were randomly distributed to the 3 groups without repetition using a software. In the&#xD;
      study, the sample size for each of the 3 groups, that is, cold application group (n=50),&#xD;
      Shotblocker group (n=50), and control group (n=50) was determined as 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intramuscular injection was carried out in the pediatric injection room of a university&#xD;
      hospital. Before the intervention, the parents and children were met, they were informed&#xD;
      about the study, and they were asked whether they would accept to participate in the study.&#xD;
      The written and verbal consent were obtained from the parents and the children, respectively.&#xD;
      In order to ensure reliability in the study results, the intramuscular injection was applied&#xD;
      by the same nurse having at least 5 years of working experience throughout the study; and the&#xD;
      pain behavior and anxiety levels of the children were evaluated by the same researcher. The&#xD;
      parents were allowed to stay with their children during the intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information was obtained from the children and parents who agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study using the Child Information Form: the socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of the children and parent, the previous history of IM injection, the&#xD;
      previous history of being subject to a painful intervention, whether the child took an&#xD;
      analgesic drug within the last 6 hours, the body mass index (BMI), etc. Prior to the&#xD;
      intramuscular injection, the children's weight and height were measured and recorded. The&#xD;
      same medicine (procaine penicilline) was administered to all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intramuscular injection, it was ensured that the environmental factors&#xD;
      (temperature, light, noise, etc.), the injection site, and the antiseptic solution (70%&#xD;
      alcohol) were standardized. The injection site was wiped using an antiseptic&#xD;
      (batticon/chlorhexidine) cotton by gently pressing from center to periphery. It was ensured&#xD;
      that the child was in the appropriate position, that is, in the prone position, with the toes&#xD;
      facing inward. Prior to the injection, Shotblocker or the cold gel pad was introduced to the&#xD;
      children in the experimental group and they were informed of how they would be used.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the children and parents were informed about the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale and Children's Fear Scale (CFS) to be used in the study. The parents and children who&#xD;
      volunteered to take part in the study were informed of the scale scoring. Which parent would&#xD;
      take part in the study was left to the choice of parents to take participate. The CFS scale&#xD;
      was evaluated preoperatively after receiving consent from the children and parents and&#xD;
      completing the information form. The pain evaluation was made by the children, parents, and&#xD;
      observers right after the procedure. When applying the scales, a particular attention was&#xD;
      paid so that the children, parents and observers would not see each other's evaluation and&#xD;
      not affect one another. Before the injection, the anxiety level was evaluated by the child,&#xD;
      parent, and researcher using Children's Fear Scale (CFS). After the injection; the pain level&#xD;
      was evaluated by the child, parent, and researcher using the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale, and the anxiety level was evaluated by the parent and researcher using Children's Fear&#xD;
      Scale (CFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the study was collected using the Child Information Form, the Wong-Baker FACES®&#xD;
      Scale, and Children's Fear Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child Information Form: This form was prepared by the researcher to get information about the&#xD;
      children selected for the sample. This form contains a total of 12 questions such as&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics of the children, whether the child has a health problem&#xD;
      that affects her/his perception of pain, the previous history of IM injection, injection&#xD;
      duration, and whether the child has injection fear, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wong-Baker FACES® Scale (WB-FACES): In this scale, there are six faces representing the pain&#xD;
      in an increasing order of intensity from zero to five from left to right. The leftmost face&#xD;
      has a smile on it, representing &quot;no pain&quot;; whereas the rightmost face has a crying&#xD;
      expression, representing &quot;the most intense pain.&quot; As the score obtained from the scale&#xD;
      increases, the pain tolerance decreases, and vice versa. In practice, the child is asked to&#xD;
      choose the face that best expresses her/his feelings. In the application of the scale, it is&#xD;
      explained to the child that each face belongs to a person, and the faces represent a happy&#xD;
      person with no pain or a sad person feeling a little or too much pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's Fear Scale (CFS): The scale is used to measure the levels of fear and anxiety in&#xD;
      children. The child is shown a picture of 5 facial expressions, each having a score between&#xD;
      &quot;0&quot; and &quot;4&quot; points. This scale can be easily applied by both researchers and families to&#xD;
      measure the fear and anxiety before and during the applications. In the scale, while &quot;0&quot;&#xD;
      refers to &quot;no fear and anxiety&quot;; &quot;4&quot; refers to &quot;the highest fear and anxiety&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained in this study was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM SPSS, Turkey).&#xD;
      The fitness of the parameters to normal distribution was evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilks test.&#xD;
      In the evaluation of the data, in addition to the descriptive statistical methods (Mean,&#xD;
      Standard deviation, Frequency), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used for the&#xD;
      comparisons of three or more groups with normal distribution and Tamhane's T2 for the paired&#xD;
      comparisons. On the other hand, Chi-Square test was used for the comparison of the&#xD;
      qualitative data. The statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission was obtained from the clinical research ethics committee (29.07.16 / 2016-41) to&#xD;
      implement the study, and from the relevant institution to carry out the study. Before&#xD;
      starting the research, all the children and parents were informed of the purpose of the&#xD;
      study, how the study would be carried out, and how the data of the study would be used; and&#xD;
      then their verbal and written consent were obtained through the Voluntary Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form. Furthermore, they were informed that they could quit the study at any time without&#xD;
      giving any reason.&#xD;

    <description>The WB-FACES was developed by Wong and Baker in 1981 and revised in 1983. The scale is used to diagnose pain in children aged 3-18 years. It consists of six facial expressions, each one representing an increasing degree of pain scored on a scale 0 to 5 from left to right (0 = very happy/no pain, 5 = the worst pain imaginable). The first face is a happy face representing &quot;no pain&quot; (0) while the last face is a crying face representing &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; (5). Higher scores indicate low pain tolerance. Participants are asked to choose the facial expression that best represents their pain</description>
