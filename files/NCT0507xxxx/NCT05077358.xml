      STUDY DESIGN This study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study comparing&#xD;
      intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis in performing laparoscopic right colectomy.&#xD;
      The study subjects will be randomly assigned to 1. intracorporeal anastomosis (experimental&#xD;
      group) 2. extracorporeal anastomosis (control group) with 1:1 manner. After surgery the&#xD;
      subjects will be followed up at 1month, after then, every 3 month in total 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Screening A detailed review of the medical records will be performed to assess&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for all subjects who have been diagnosed with right colon tumor&#xD;
      (malignant or benign) or benign disease (complicated diverticulitis and so on) that are&#xD;
      subject to a right colectomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are eligible, meet the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria of this&#xD;
      study, will be offered enrollment into the study at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Potential risks All these procedures are in practice today and only surgeons competent&#xD;
           in a technique shall be allowed to perform those surgeries. Therefore, there are no&#xD;
           anticipated additional risks than would normally be encountered from these surgeries&#xD;
           when they are performed for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential benefits There may be some benefit due to having closer follow-up in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALIFICATION OF PARTICIPATING SURGEONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laparoscopic surgery: a surgical technique where operations are performed far from&#xD;
                their target anatomy location through small incisions normally less than 15mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Extracorporeal anastomosis: the anastomosis is performed by pulling out the bowel&#xD;
                through a laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intracorporeal anastomosis: the anastomosis is performed inside the abdominal&#xD;
                cavity with a laparoscopic technique. Specimen extraction will be done through&#xD;
                Pfannenstiel incision or similar incision in lower abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure standardization and qualification procedure Participating surgeons should&#xD;
           complete the learning curve of the procedure and experience at least 50 laparoscopic&#xD;
           right colectomy. They are required to be evaluated by the quality control (QC)&#xD;
           committee. They should submit their unedited videos of laparoscopic right colectomy and&#xD;
           must be accepted by 2 or more of total 3 QC committee members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Based on attaining a success rate of 85% for the primary endpoint, a&#xD;
      total of 106 subjects will be required for each group. Accounting for a 5% loss, a total of&#xD;
      241 subjects will be recruited for this study.&#xD;

      STUDY METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ethical committee approval The study protocol, patient informed consent form and other&#xD;
           required study documentation will be reviewed and approved by an institutional review&#xD;
           board or any other authority body, prior to study start-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study duration and enrollment The total study duration will be approximately 5 years.&#xD;
           Study enrollment will take approximately 24 months. The study subjects will have a&#xD;
           short-term follow-up at 30 and 3 months post procedure, with long term follow-up upto 3&#xD;
           years after surgery. Surveillance will be performed according to standard follow-up&#xD;
           guideline after colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization All the enrolled subject will be randomly assigned to one of the study&#xD;
           group (intracorporeal or extracorporeal). The randomization will be performed upon the&#xD;
           enrollment at the central institution stratifying center on 1:1 manner by a coordinator&#xD;
           who is not aware of any clinical information&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data collection Data will be collected at baseline, operative procedure, discharge, 1&#xD;
           month, 3 months and 1 year. A screening log will be maintained at each site during the&#xD;
           enrollment period, in which all patients eligible for the trial shall be identified.&#xD;
           This will be maintained to ensure no patient selection bias occurs within a center or by&#xD;
           a surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Informed Consent Using the study-specific, IRB approved, informed consent form,&#xD;
           information pertinent to this study will be provided to the subjects in writing and in&#xD;
           their native, non-technical, language. The consent form will include a description of&#xD;
           the study and its purpose, potential benefits, potential risks, site contact&#xD;
           information, and all other elements required of an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects are required to voluntarily sign the informed consent form before any&#xD;
           study-specific procedure is performed. The Investigator and/or his/her authorized&#xD;
           designee, trained on the protocol and performing a consent, will conduct the informed&#xD;
           consent process and will answer questions the subjects may have. If the subject agrees&#xD;
           to participate, the informed consent form must be signed and dated by the subject or&#xD;
           his/her legally authorized representative prior to enrollment in the study and&#xD;
           separately signed and dated by the person taking consent. Only subjects who have signed&#xD;
           the study informed consent will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Withdrawal and discontinuation The subject's participation in any clinical trial is&#xD;
           voluntary. The subject has the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of&#xD;
           benefit. Study withdrawal means the subject is no longer participating in the study and&#xD;
           no further follow-ups will be performed. All subjects that withdraw after informed&#xD;
           consent is signed will be evaluated at the time of withdrawal. Every effort will be made&#xD;
           to document the subject outcome at the time of withdrawal. The investigator has the&#xD;
           right to discontinue subjects from the study at their discretion to ensure wellbeing of&#xD;
           the subject. The reasons for withdrawal shall be documented.&#xD;
