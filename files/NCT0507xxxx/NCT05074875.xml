  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week, observational study looking to see if the inflammatory process of&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 leads to progressive pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis. Inpatient, as well as outpatient adults with recent COVID-19 hospitalization will&#xD;
      be recruited. Data from hospitalization will be collected and subjects will return to the&#xD;
      center for follow-up visits. Subjects will undergo the following procedures: High Resolution&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest, Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT), Muscle Strength&#xD;
      Measurement, and blood draw for biomolecular data such as biomarkers found in ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), serum, and plasma. Quality of Life (QoL)&#xD;
      measurements will also be collected through the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational, and prospective study collecting data on subjects who&#xD;
      were hospitalized with hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 or patients who&#xD;
      have evidence of an outpatient COVID-19 infection that have been treated with supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 300 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into one of 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Inpatient Enrollment: Subjects enrolled while hospitalized for COVID-19, prior to&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Outpatient Enrollment: Subjects enrolled up to 4 weeks after discharge from&#xD;
      hospitalization for COVID-19 or 4 weeks post their outpatient COVID -19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Outpatient Enrollment: Subjects enrolled between 6 and 24 weeks after discharge&#xD;
      from hospitalization for COVID-19 or 6 and 24 weeks post their outpatient COVID -19&#xD;
      infection. Cohort 3 will be sub-divided into 3a and 3b depending on the timepoint of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the Informed Consent Form, the screening visit will be performed. Screening and&#xD;
      enrollment can occur at Visit 0 (inpatient) or Visit 1 (outpatient). Following completion of&#xD;
      Visit 0 or 1 the subjects' data will be assessed by the investigator to confirm eligibility&#xD;
      and a decision will be made if the patient is to be enrolled. If not the reason for&#xD;
      non-enrollment will be listed in the trial log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will either have a total of 4 or 5 visits, depending on if subjects complete&#xD;
      enrollment while still admitted to the hospital (Visit 0) or at Visit 1. At weeks 4, 24, 36,&#xD;
      48, all subjects will complete questionnaires, have physical exams, spirometry test with&#xD;
      DLCO, HRCTs, 6MWTs, blood draws, and review of medical history since the previous visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis of this study will be performed once the last enrolled subject reaches&#xD;
      Week 48. At that time, there will be a data-base lock. Unless otherwise noted, Visit 1 is&#xD;
      treated as baseline measurement. In addition, for patients enrolled at discharge, a second&#xD;
      set of analysis will be performed treating Visit 0 as baseline for the measurements collected&#xD;
      at Visit 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To identify whether the trajectory of COVID-19 associated respiratory failure results&#xD;
      in progressive pulmonary fibrosis with clinical features or biomolecular changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To identify biomarkers that may indicate those patients at risk for developing a&#xD;
      chronic fibrotic HRCT pattern that may go on to progression.&#xD;
