    <textblock>
      In the present study, we test the ability of AMSS as a simple tool to identify women with HMB&#xD;
      who have ID/ IDA. We will compare the AMSS score to patients' hemoglobin and serum ferritin&#xD;
      in women with self-reported HMB and women with normal menstrual flow.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anemia remains a critical health burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and a&#xD;
      paradigm shift is needed to effectively reduce the prevalence in women. The reproductive&#xD;
      years place women at high risk of anemia in general, and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in&#xD;
      particular, largely because of menstrual and delivery -associated blood loss, as the lost&#xD;
      iron is often not adequately replenished from dietary sources. Iron deficiency, even without&#xD;
      anemia, has profound adverse effects on multiple cellular and metabolic parameters and&#xD;
      frequently manifests with impaired cognitive and physical function. In Africa and Eastern&#xD;
      Mediterranean regions, around 39% of non-pregnant women and 40-45% of pregnant women have&#xD;
      anemia as estimated by The World Health Organization (WHO). Maternal anemia is a risk factor&#xD;
      for preterm labor and both maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although data is&#xD;
      limited, 5-28% of women in LMICs experience abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) yet the&#xD;
      importance of menstrual blood loss as an indicator of and a risk factor for anemia is&#xD;
      frequently ignored in anemia control and prevention strategies. The condition is further&#xD;
      complicated by the fact that both women and their physicians tend to normalize menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms. To enable development of comprehensive interventions to address IDA among women in&#xD;
      our locality, it is critical to characterize heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and its&#xD;
      relationship with IDA among women and determine ways to use these data to direct women at&#xD;
      risk for IDA to appropriate healthcare services for evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women with HMB, early diagnosis and treatment of anemia is important to prevent its&#xD;
      negative health consequences. However, in low resource settings, laboratory facilities are&#xD;
      not always available. In addition, laboratory tests may be expensive limiting their use in&#xD;
      such circumstances. For this reason, a cheap, simple to use tool to identify women at high&#xD;
      risk of anemia who require further evaluation and treatment is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aberdeen Menorrhagia Severity Scale (AMSS) is a multi-dimensional scale. It measures&#xD;
      quality of life in women with HMB in addition to menstrual bleeding characteristics. AMSS&#xD;
      consists of 13 questions. with a 4-point answer to each question. Maximum score is 47, which&#xD;
      is converted to a percentage. The lower the scale is associated with better quality of life.&#xD;
      The AMSS has been validated against the SF-36, which is a generic scale for measurement of&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

        Details on the research will be explained to potentially eligible women. They will be given&#xD;
        patient's information leaflet in Arabic (attached). The research team will emphasize that&#xD;
        participation in the study is completely voluntary, and women can withdraw at any time&#xD;
        without affecting level of care that is provided for them. Eligible women who accept to&#xD;
        participate in the study will sign informed consent. Women will be assured on&#xD;
        confidentiality and that data will be coded, with no names/ identifying information, and&#xD;
        will be kept on a secure server through RedCap operated by Assiut Faculty of Medicine.3.4.&#xD;
