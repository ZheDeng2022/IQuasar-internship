  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrate is a controversial component of vegetables, meat, and drinking water. The now&#xD;
      well-established benefits of nitrate, through the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO) pathway, on cardiovascular risk factors and long-term cardiovascular disease risk are&#xD;
      tarnished by a continuing concern about a link between nitrate ingestion and cancer. This can&#xD;
      result in misguided advice to avoid consumption of high-nitrate leafy green vegetables by&#xD;
      both the media and the scientific literature. A recent media headline stated, &quot;Cancer alert&#xD;
      over rocket: trendy salad leaves exceed safe levels of carcinogenic nitrates in one in every&#xD;
      ten samples&quot;. One scientific review stated, &quot;the presence of nitrate in vegetables, as in&#xD;
      water and generally in other foods, is a serious threat to man's health&quot;. Controversy in the&#xD;
      literature, and gaps in the knowledge are leading to confusing messages around vegetables&#xD;
      that may play a critical role in cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major dietary sources of nitrate are vegetables, meat, and drinking water. Source of&#xD;
      nitrate could be a crucial factor determining whether the consumption of nitrate is linked&#xD;
      with beneficial (such as improving cardiovascular health) versus harmful (N-nitrosamine&#xD;
      formation) effects. For example, unlike meat and water-derived nitrate, vegetables contain&#xD;
      high levels of vitamin C and/or polyphenols that may inhibit the production of&#xD;
      N-nitrosamines. So far, no study has investigated the formation of N-nitrosamines after&#xD;
      consumption of these different sources in humans. This study will compare N-nitrosamine&#xD;
      formation after intake of meat with and without added nitrate.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crossover study design will be used with a 1-week washout period. Each participant will&#xD;
      complete the scheduled study visits for one of the dietary interventions which will be&#xD;
      assigned in random order. Following the washout, the participants will then complete the&#xD;
      scheduled study visits for the remaining intervention. Participants will be provided with a&#xD;
      low nitrate and N-nitrosamine meal on the preceding evening of each study visit. These meals&#xD;
      will be consistent across all study visits Participants will be asked to refrain from&#xD;
      drinking coffee and any alcoholic beverage and do any exercise 24 hours prior to their study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meat with added nitrate: Prosciutto/pancetta/Parma ham/salami (all derived from pork)&#xD;
      prepared by a commercial butcher with sodium nitrate and nitrite as an additive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meat without added nitrate and nitrite: Pork sausages, prepared by a commercial butcher,&#xD;
      equivalent in weight to the meat plus nitrate intervention. Nitrate is not an allowed&#xD;
      additive in sausages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first clinic visit, each participant will complete a food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (FFQ) to assess background habitual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinic visit, baseline samples of blood, saliva, and urine will be collected for&#xD;
      measurement of N-nitrosamines (plasma and urine), nitrate and nitrite (plasma, saliva, and&#xD;
      urine). An oral (tongue scraping) sample and faecal stool sample will be collected for oral&#xD;
      and gut microbiome analysis. A small blood sample (20 mL, approximately 1.5 tablespoons) will&#xD;
      be taken at this time. A sterile container will be provided to participants for saliva&#xD;
      collection over a time period of 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, a saliva sample will be taken at 30-minute intervals up to 240&#xD;
      minutes for measurement of nitrate and nitrite. At 60 min and 240 minutes, a blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected for measurement of N-nitrosamines, nitrate, and nitrite. The amount of the&#xD;
      blood sample at each time point is the same as collected at baseline. After the intervention,&#xD;
      all urine within the first 240 minutes and then subsequent 20-hour period will be collected&#xD;
      for measurement of N-nitrosamines, nitrate, and nitrite.&#xD;
