    <textblock>
      Use of illegal drug among adolescents is one of the critical health problems in this age&#xD;
      group. The purpose of that study was to apply the 3D virtual reality technology to develop a&#xD;
      training program aiming at improving the abilities of problem solving, self-efficacy and&#xD;
      teamwork of supervisory volunteers on adolescents' illegal drug use. This study used a&#xD;
      randomized controlled design with recruiting 68 participants. The participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group received the 3D VR training program and the counterparts in the control&#xD;
      group did not receive any intervention. The participants in the experimental group performed&#xD;
      better on problem solving, self-efficacy and teamwork. In addition, the scores of technology&#xD;
      use related variables also supported that experimental participants favored the 3D VR&#xD;
      training system. The findings suggested that the 3D VR training system enhanced the&#xD;
      supporting volunteers' abilities to deal with adolescents' illegal drug use. The 3D VR&#xD;
      program showed potential for future promotion to supporting volunteers that contribute to&#xD;
      improve volunteers' abilities on dealing with adolescents' illegal drug use.&#xD;

    <description>The SVVR training program is consisted of five scenarios with tasks. Before the SVVR training implementation, the research team provided 10-minute orientation session to introduce the purpose of the training. The 3D VR professional taught the participants how to wear the 3D VR helmets and select the VR scenes, so that the participants could practice multiple times.</description>
