    <textblock>
      Vegan meal kit delivery offers consumer convenience and has shown benefit in cardiometabolic&#xD;
      parameters such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and weight. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the impact of meal kit facilitated vegan diet on LDL-c and&#xD;
      trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) when compared to an omnivorous diet control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the impact of a vegan diet to a non-vegan diet, when provided with&#xD;
      meal kits in participants who are overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vegan diet includes foods that come from plants and excludes foods that come from animals&#xD;
      like meat, dairy, and eggs. Dietary modifications such as adopting a vegan diet are&#xD;
      associated with significant improvements in cardiometabolic parameters, making it one of the&#xD;
      preferred treatment options for obesity and preventing associated health conditions. Meal&#xD;
      kits are packages that include: a quick (~30-45 minutes) and simple recipe, all the recipe's&#xD;
      required ingredients, and are conveniently delivered to patient homes. In this study, a&#xD;
      facilitated vegan diet is defined as a change from an omnivorous diet to a vegan diet with&#xD;
      the aid of boxed vegan meal kit delivery. A facilitated vegan diet has shown LDL-c and weight&#xD;
      improvements over continuing an omnivorous diet in a preliminary study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMAO, changes in gut microbiome, and compliance to dietary modification impact cardiovascular&#xD;
      and overall health. TMAO is a diet dependent biomarker for CVD, as elevated TMAO levels are&#xD;
      associated with a 62% increased risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. TMAO increases&#xD;
      platelet hyperactivity, inflammation, and foam cell generation, all of which contribute to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and may explain the increased risk of CVD. Additionally, TMAO predicts risk&#xD;
      of major adverse cardiovascular events independently of other cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of animal products elevate TMAO levels due to its abundance of TMAO precursors:&#xD;
      choline and carnitine. Chronic dietary red meat was associated with increased TMAO levels&#xD;
      over white meat and non-meat protein. One study found that consuming plant-based alternative&#xD;
      meat products improved TMAO levels over a mostly red meat diet. Both study interventions&#xD;
      replaced protein sources but did not remove animal products such as eggs and dairy, which&#xD;
      have conflicting evidence relative to TMAO. This study intervention will have participants&#xD;
      adopt a full vegan diet, eliminating animal products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in converting dietary precursors into TMAO. TMAO&#xD;
      levels post l-carnitine ingestion were significantly higher in patients on a long-term&#xD;
      omnivorous diet vs patients on a long-term vegan or vegetarian diet. This suggests that the&#xD;
      gut microbiome in a plant-based diet lowers the formation of TMAO via the diet. This study&#xD;
      will explore changes in gut microbiome from a dietary intervention in relation to TMAO and&#xD;
      explore if these changes are sustained after discontinuing a 4-week facilitated vegan diet.&#xD;
      Additionally, changes in gut microbiome will be explored in relation to microbiota changes&#xD;
      seen in other disease states such as anxiety, irritable bowel disease, and other inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of dietary modifications on controlling obesity and associated health conditions&#xD;
      has room for improvement. Dietary modifications have long been one of the preferred&#xD;
      treatments in obesity and CVD prevention, yet the obesity rates continue to rise. One&#xD;
      potential area of improvement is compliance to dietary modification. This study will explore&#xD;
      changes in food group restricted free diet patterns after a 4-week vegan meal kit&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
