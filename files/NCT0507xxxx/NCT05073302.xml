  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation is an effective modality for treating type 1 diabetes. Despite marked&#xD;
      progress in clinical islet transplantation with the achievement and maintenance of insulin&#xD;
      independence in over half of recipients up to 5 years, transplant approaches are limited to&#xD;
      those that struggle to control their diabetes. Furthermore, this approach remains restricted&#xD;
      due to the scarcity of human pancreas donors. While transplanting insulin-producing cells&#xD;
      into the liver has been demonstrated as an efficacious means of restoring glycemic control to&#xD;
      patients with T1D, the procedure often results in cell loss, and carries risks. Moreover,&#xD;
      transplant in to the liver does not permit imaging or retrieval of donor islets. The ability&#xD;
      to retrieve the cells is also important for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, the space under the skin is an attractive alternate site for transplanting insulin&#xD;
      producing cell, due to ready access, and potential for monitoring cellular transplant&#xD;
      function through novel imaging techniques. However, transplantation of insulin producing&#xD;
      cells into an unmodified site under the skin universally fails to reverse diabetes in&#xD;
      research animal models, or in human studies. Other techniques using devices with different&#xD;
      type of technologies and biomaterials have been explored with variable success.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the foreign body and inflammatory reaction persist in the implant. Shapiro&#xD;
      Lab, has developed a novel technique called 'device-less' (DL) transplant modality. This&#xD;
      approach was designed to harness an innate foreign body response in a favorable and&#xD;
      controlled manner, to induce growth of new blood vessels to allow the survival of the insulin&#xD;
      producing cells without the natural body response to foreign body. Briefly, this site&#xD;
      transforms the inhospitable under the skin site into a viable location through the temporary&#xD;
      implantation of a small tube called angiocatheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, 5 patients will received transplant in to the modified site under the skin&#xD;
      using the DL transplant technique.&#xD;

      1. Before any study-specific procedure is performed, valid informed consent will be&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A complete medical history will be collected including smoking status and alcohol&#xD;
           frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On admission to hospital, the recipient will be assessed for fitness to proceed to&#xD;
           transplant according to local procedures. If a recipient is deemed unfit for transplant&#xD;
           at the time of admission, they will no longer be active on the transplant waiting list&#xD;
           and as such will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implantation of the DL sentinel unit: Occurs at Visit 3 (2 Weeks to 24 Weeks Prior to&#xD;
           Islet Transplant). One DL sentinel unit will be implanted in the forearm, as deemed&#xD;
           appropriate by the Investigator. To conduct the procedure, local anesthesia with&#xD;
           sedation may be utilized, with use of general anesthesia at the discretion of the&#xD;
           Surgeon. Implantation is executed via incision followed by formation of tissue pockets&#xD;
           for each DL unit. Incisions are up to approximately 10 to 30 mm in length, but could&#xD;
           vary. The DL unit will consist of a minimum of 5 French (Fr) or up to 7 Fr Torcon NB®&#xD;
           Advantage nylon catheters prepared to 8-10 cm in length. Each DL unit will be inserted&#xD;
           into one subcutaneous pocket prepared. Surgeons trained on the procedure will have&#xD;
           discretion on the ultimate number and length of incisions, but should discuss the&#xD;
           details of the implantation plan with the subject prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are inherent surgical risks with the implantation and explantation of DL&#xD;
                sentinel units including pain, bleeding, hematoma, seroma, tenderness, redness,&#xD;
                scarring, and infection. Steps will be taken to minimize the risks and to make the&#xD;
                subject comfortable during the procedure with anesthetic and post-procedure&#xD;
                analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  With any implanted product, the possibility of migration or extrusion of the DL&#xD;
                implant exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The use of anesthesia itself may cause side effects. The type(s) of anesthesia used&#xD;
                during the implantation and explantation procedures will be determined by the&#xD;
                Investigator. Side effects may include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Local Anesthesia: Stinging and/or a burning sensation. Less likely side&#xD;
                     effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, allergic reactions&#xD;
                     (e.g., redness, itching, and rash), low blood pressure, weakness, severe&#xD;
                     numbness or tingling, ringing in ears, blurry or double vision, slurred&#xD;
                     speech, metallic taste in the mouth, mental status change, muscle twitching,&#xD;
                     and seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  General Anesthesia: Harm to the vocal cords, heart attack, lung infection, and&#xD;
                     stroke, trauma to the teeth or tongue, or temporary mental confusion. Rarely,&#xD;
                     waking during anesthesia or death may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Conscious Sedation: Difficulty breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ultrasound Monitoring Ultrasound monitoring will be performed after DL implantation as&#xD;
           per the Principal Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Standard Islet cell Transplantation: Will occur simultaneously Portal islet&#xD;
           transplantation and subcutaneous islet transplantation in the DL sentinel spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard islet isolation procedures will be followed for all aspects of the islet&#xD;
           isolation process. The final islet product will be evaluated based on standard assays&#xD;
           used in standard islet isolation practice. Islet transplantation occurs at Visit 4 (Day&#xD;
           0).&#xD;
&#xD;
           A minimum target of 4,000 IEQ/kg recipient body weight will be infused either via a&#xD;
           percutaneous transhepatic catheter inserted into the portal vein under ultrasound and&#xD;
           fluoroscopic guidance, or by open laparotomy under general anesthesia (via cannulation&#xD;
           of an omental or mesenteric vein), at the discretion of the investigators. Islets are&#xD;
           maintained for a minimum of 6 hours up to 72 hours in supplemented CMRL1066-based media&#xD;
           until the time of transplant. The packed islet tissue volume preparation will not exceed&#xD;
           10 cc in order to minimize the risk of portal thrombosis and post-procedural bleeding.&#xD;
           Islet transplant into the portal vein is part of Alberta Health Services standard of&#xD;
           care procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant to portal vein infusion, islet transplantation will occur in the DL sentinel&#xD;
           space. A small incision will be made cranial to the implanted DL unit. A small section&#xD;
           of implanted catheter is cut to expose the vascularized tissue scaffold. The DL unit is&#xD;
           exposed through the superficial incision and PE-50 or PE-90 tubing containing the human&#xD;
           islet preparation is inserted into the lumen of the DL catheter. Approximately 500 -&#xD;
           4000 Islet Equivalent (IEQ), equivalent to 20 μl of islet tissue, will be infused into&#xD;
           the DL sentinel. This is based on the original islet mass and packed tissue volume&#xD;
           before transplantation and the volume of 8 cm of PE-50 tubing with 0.53 mm inner&#xD;
           diameter. The DL catheter is subsequently withdrawn along the PE-50 (or PE-90) tubing&#xD;
           and the islets are subsequently infused into the resulting DL lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Explantation of DL Sentinels: One quarter of the DL sentinel will be explanted at 2, 4,&#xD;
           12, and 24 weeks post islet transplant, respectively. Experiences in other studies&#xD;
           investigating subcutaneous transplantation indicate that while under anesthesia, the&#xD;
           units and the surrounding tissue can be explanted with traditional surgical instruments.&#xD;
           Local anesthesia is required at a minimum, with the use of sedation or general&#xD;
           anesthesia at the discretion of the Surgeon. To explant a unit, the Surgeon will make an&#xD;
           incision (re-entry thru the same implant/transplant incision is advocated) and then&#xD;
           carefully dissect the tissue engrafted around the transplant. The entire transplant site&#xD;
           and any adherent tissue capsule can then be removed entirely from the pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a first in human study, there is the possibility the explantation procedure and&#xD;
      technique will be modified based on the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may receive all required concomitant medications for islet transplant patients:&#xD;
      Alemtuzumab, basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, etanercept and anakinra are&#xD;
      Standard of Care medications used in the Clinical Islet Transplant program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study receiving their islet transplants will be managed following&#xD;
      standard of care including implantation procedure, peri- and post-operative care,&#xD;
      post-transplant monitoring, immunosuppression and other medications. For detailed islet&#xD;
      transplant standard of care (pre- and post- islet transplant assessments and evaluations),&#xD;
      please refer to Appendix B of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Portions of the same device-less (DL) biopsy samples will be assessed by histology and&#xD;
      MMDx approaches. MMDx assessments of explanted tissue are standardized molecular measurements&#xD;
      (probabilities) of transplant rejection or injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional samples will be required. Samples sent to the (ATAGC) will be coded by the&#xD;
      trial personnel. The only required information will be the time of DL explant, post&#xD;
      implantation. There will be no additional risks for the patient.&#xD;
