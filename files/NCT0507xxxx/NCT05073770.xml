  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the male latex condom as&#xD;
      the best physical barrier for preventing HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD)&#xD;
      transmission. Condoms are a safe and effective form of contraception that have 98%&#xD;
      effectiveness in protecting against STD and pregnancy. However, evidence shows that if a&#xD;
      condom does not fit properly, its impact can reduce to 85% or less, as it may slip off during&#xD;
      sex or during removal of the penis from the vagina or breaks during intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condoms need to fit correctly to guard against fluids and exposed skin which could lead to&#xD;
      STD contraction or pregnancy. To choose the right size, the girth (the width of an erect&#xD;
      penis) is the most important factor, not length. However, most condom companies do not list&#xD;
      their nominal width, let alone base their sizes off girth. In addition, most brands usually&#xD;
      offer XL as only 56 mm based on a misconception that one size fits all and that &quot;XL&quot; condoms&#xD;
      are big enough. But that is far from the truth, and several men complain about the lack of&#xD;
      simplicity and intuitiveness when finding a condom that fits them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this gap, after a long two years of development, Titan company was able to&#xD;
      engineer four distinct sizes so that each man can easily find the condom he needs. This study&#xD;
      aims to obtain a preliminary estimate of slippage and breakage of Titan's new condom (64mm or&#xD;
      69mm) during use.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical slippage rate will be calculated as the number of condoms with at least 1 clinical slippage event divided by the number of condoms used during intercourse, reported as a percentage. Clinical slippage events, defined in ISO 29943-1:2017, will be reported by subjects. A clinical slippage is defined as a condom slipping off completely during intercourse or during withdrawal from the vagina. Slippage that occurs because the user failed to hold onto the condom at the base of the penis during withdrawal and/ or because the user delayed withdrawal after sex are to be record as &quot;non-clinical slippage&quot;, these events are considered user failures.</description>
