      This is a Phase II, single-arm, study of pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy in&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) participants who have received maximum TURBT and&#xD;
      tri-modality treatment (TMT) and achieved CR. All participants will receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy per 21 days no longer than 17 cycles until disease progression or death.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radical cystectomy (RC) has long been the standard of care for the treatment of&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Modern RC series have demonstrated 5-yr overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) rates of 56-66%. There has been an increasing trend of utilizing&#xD;
      organ-preserving therapies in the management of bladder cancer over the past several decades.&#xD;
      A multidisciplinary approach has led to the development of bladder-sparing approaches using&#xD;
      maximal transurethral resection (TURBT) followed by radiotherapy with concomitant&#xD;
      radio-sensitizing chemotherapy for MIBC. Multiple tri-modality treatment (TMT) series have&#xD;
      suggested that TMT can yield favorable results in well-selected patients. The 5-yr OS is&#xD;
      48-75%, and 75-80% of the survivors have preserved their native bladder. Even if local&#xD;
      recurrence occurred after concurrent radio-chemotherapy, salvage cystectomy can also bring&#xD;
      50-57.6% of 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) without more complications associated with&#xD;
      surgery. So, NCCN guidelines have regarded this TMT strategy as a preferred choice for&#xD;
      patients with MIBC since 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, distant metastasis after TMT was still the main concern. Giacalone NJ, et al.&#xD;
      reported that the 5-yr distant metastasis rate was 32% in MIBC patients who received an&#xD;
      organ-preserving strategy. Up to now, there was no consensus on adjuvant therapy after&#xD;
      concurrent radio-chemotherapy. Some retrospective studies demonstrated that adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy had no survival benefit, and only approximately 50% of patients completed the&#xD;
      planned adjuvant chemotherapy due to intolerable toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These years, studies on PD-(L)1 inhibitors for urothelial carcinoma showed the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. FDA has approved indications of pembrolizumab used as 1L (selected patients) and 2L&#xD;
      treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Checkmate-274 has reported that adjuvant&#xD;
      immunotherapy improved disease-free survival (DFS) in MIBC patients after RC. Javelin Bladder&#xD;
      100 prolonged OS of mUC patients by Avelumab as maintenance therapy who achieved CR, PR or PD&#xD;
      after 1L chemotherapy. These results support our hypothesis that, for those MIBC patients who&#xD;
      have received bladder-preserving TMT and achieved CR, pembrolizumab monotherapy as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy is superior to observation.&#xD;
