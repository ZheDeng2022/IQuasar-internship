  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this feasibility study is to investigate if an addition of an internet-delivered&#xD;
      psychological treatment, Acceptance and commitment therapy (IACT), can enhance the effect of&#xD;
      an existing evidence-based interdisciplinary rehabilitation program (IRPR) for chronic pain&#xD;
      patients enrolled in clinical tertiary care, on pain-related psychological outcomes. The&#xD;
      study might contribute to developing internet-delivered treatments suitable for this patient&#xD;
      group and also help develop implementation strategies for internet interventions in clinical&#xD;
      services. The study is planned to run for 2 years and include 300 patients, of which 150 will&#xD;
      be in the intervention group and 150 in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that the IACT addition will lead to better and more sustained&#xD;
      results compared to the IRPR alone. The first sub-hypothesis is that the IACT addition will&#xD;
      enhance adherence and uptake during the IRPR. The second sub-hypothesis is that the IACT&#xD;
      addition will help patients maintain results after the IRPR has ended.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an un-blinded single-center randomized controlled trial with two parallel study&#xD;
      groups set at a clinical service in regular care at a University Hospital. An online true&#xD;
      random-number service (www.random.org) executed by a research assistant not otherwise&#xD;
      involved in the trial, will allocate participants, with 1:1 allocation ratio, upon&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients will be recruited from a specialist pain clinic which provides tertiary&#xD;
      care (IPRP) for non-malign chronic pain with mild to moderate psychiatric comorbidities and&#xD;
      serves as competence center for complex chronic pain in its City Council in southern Sweden.&#xD;
      As an active comparator will be used as the control condition, an effect size of d=0.30&#xD;
      (specific component comparator was expected. Given 80 % power and a 5% significance level,&#xD;
      the sample size calculation indicated that 90 participants in each group were needed.&#xD;
      Considering a 50% dropout rate, a sample size of 135 participants in each group would be&#xD;
      sufficient. The study planned to include n=300. Outcome variables will be collected digitally&#xD;
      on 4 occasions; at pre and post treatment, at post aftercare intervention and at 1 year&#xD;
      follow up. Additional complementary pen-and-paper data will be drawn from a national register&#xD;
      (the SQRP) at three occasions; at pre-baseline/enrollment, at post treatment and at 1 year&#xD;
      follow up. Outcome measures include psychological outcomes: pain acceptance, psychological&#xD;
      inflexibility, self-efficacy, harm/negative effects and psychosocial consequences of living&#xD;
      with pain. Also, measures of cost-effectiveness, usability, dose and time spent will be&#xD;
      collected. Patients with long pain duration, high pain intensity, overuse of analgesics,&#xD;
      alcohol or opioids, social withdrawnness, depression, or previous treatment failures&#xD;
      constitute high risk of attrition. Early signs of attrition will be monitored by delayed&#xD;
      response frequency. A plan to prevent attrition will be set at the inclusion assessment. As&#xD;
      long as participant follow the IPRP through, data will likely be collected and there will be&#xD;
      opportunities to discuss or prevent drop-out. Data will be entered and stored digitally. The&#xD;
      process is monitored by a responsible research assistant who will also alert the research&#xD;
      time of missing data. Access to study data will be restricted to the research team.The two&#xD;
      study arms will be compared using parametric methods for data analysis or other methods&#xD;
      depending on the robustness of the data. Missing data will be handled depending on the&#xD;
      robustness of the data, assessed by Little MCAR test. Intention to treat analysis is an&#xD;
      opportunity given the missing is not more than 40 %. Mixed models may be an option given&#xD;
      missing data is not random. The steering committee will act as data monitoring committee (the&#xD;
      lead investigator excluded) and will decide of interim analyses and execute stopping&#xD;
      guidelines. The research assistant responsible for data management will alert the steering&#xD;
      committee if collected data on negative experiences of treatment signals that any participant&#xD;
      needs additional care related to experiences of the trial. Any modifications to the protocol&#xD;
      which may impact on the study, will be agreed on within the research group. These changes&#xD;
      will be either documented to be addressed at publication or communicated with the regional&#xD;
      Ethical board if needed. Written informed consent will be obtained as pre-measurement are&#xD;
      collected. An oral consent will be obtained prior to that, during the assessment interview,&#xD;
      whereas participants may ask for further information. All recruited participants will be&#xD;
      given an identification number. As little personal information as possible (e.g. only&#xD;
      informed consent forms) will be kept locally as the majority of participants' information&#xD;
      will be digital, secured with password-protected access systems. The research team members&#xD;
      will be given access to the cleaned data set. To ensure confidentiality, data dispersed to&#xD;
      project team members will be blinded of any identifying participant information. The steering&#xD;
      committee will have access to the un-cleaned data set. Post-trial care will be given by IPRP&#xD;
      staff when needed.&#xD;

    <description>CPAQ is a measure of pain acceptance with 20 items rated on a 6-point scale ranging from &quot;never true&quot; to &quot;always true&quot; and divided into two subscales: activity engagement and pain willingness.

    <description>Twelve items are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;never true&quot; to &quot;always true&quot; and divided into two subscales: Avoidance and Cognitive fusion. Higher score means higher psychological inflexibility. PIPS has been found a valid and reliable measure which may function as a working mechanism in ACT for chronic pain</description>
