  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of&#xD;
      MK-0616 in participants with moderate renal impairment (RI) to those of healthy matched&#xD;
      control participants. This study is being conducted to assess the impact of moderate renal&#xD;
      insufficiency on the PK of MK-0616.&#xD;
