  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is an exploratory study that aims to investigate the effects of IOPI therapy on&#xD;
      the swallowing function and tongue strength of geriatric patients in a geriatric ward in an&#xD;
      acute hospital. Its secondary aim is to investigate the correlation between IOPI readings and&#xD;
      functional status. The result of this study could help to improve current practice of&#xD;
      dysphagia intervention in the geriatric population. If results are significant, there will be&#xD;
      research evidence to put forth a change to work processes for speech therapists. IOPI will be&#xD;
      more widely used in the clinical context and will then result in better functional outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there have been increasing evidence that tongue strengthening exercises have&#xD;
      the ability to improve tongue muscle strength and tongue muscle thickness in the geriatric&#xD;
      population. These improvements have a direct impact on the oral phase of swallow,&#xD;
      specifically resulting in better orolingual manipulation and propulsion, and increasing&#xD;
      intra-oral pressure for better bolus clearance. Reduction in tongue strength and other&#xD;
      swallowing parameters can lead to swallowing disorder known as dysphagia. In the healthy&#xD;
      ageing population, weakness in swallowing muscles is termed presbyphagia. Geriatric patients&#xD;
      have an even higher chance of transitioning from presbyphagia to dysphagia when they become&#xD;
      acutely unwell. Studies have also shown that deterioration of the whole-body muscle strength&#xD;
      is associated with poorer oral function. Additionally, other studies have also shown that a&#xD;
      lower isometric tongue strength might represent diminished functional reserves, which may&#xD;
      increase the risk of dysphagia once an insult to the body occurs. There is also evidence that&#xD;
      people who have episodes of aspiration have significantly weaker tongue strength at both the&#xD;
      anterior and posterior regions. Thus, frail geriatric adults who have weaker skeletal muscles&#xD;
      are at a higher risk of developing dysphagia. The tongue is amendable to therapy but current&#xD;
      practices in Singapore lack an objective measure. Conventional dysphagia oromotor exercises&#xD;
      employ the use of a tongue depressor. This method lacks a quantifiable measure to track&#xD;
      outcome and is quite subjective to individual therapists. There is also a lack of practice&#xD;
      guideline on recommended resistive load and frequency of exercise in the geriatric population&#xD;
      in the acute setting. Other than outcome measures and practice guidelines, there is also a&#xD;
      lack of research investigating the correlation of tongue strength and functional status. A&#xD;
      few studies have explored the effects of different resistive load used in tongue&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, although it was recommended to use a resistive load between 60% to&#xD;
      80% for more positive and extrinsic feedback, and for target population with a lower&#xD;
      frustration threshold. Studies also used a longer timeframe of 3-4 weeks of rehabilitation to&#xD;
      attain significant effects from skeletal muscle exercise. This, however, is not realistic in&#xD;
      the acute geriatric setting in Singapore where the mean length of stay is 10 days. Thus, this&#xD;
      study is an exploratory study to investigate the efficacy of using IOPI in this population to&#xD;
      improve swallowing function and tongue strength. This study also aims to investigate if a&#xD;
      correlation exists between IOPI reading and functional status.&#xD;
