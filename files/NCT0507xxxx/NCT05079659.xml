      Nowadays, headache has been considered as one of the top global disabling medical&#xD;
      conditions.1 Migraine is an important type of headache, and one of the chronic multifaceted&#xD;
      neuro-inflammatory disorders.2 It is characterized by recurrent throbbing headache pain that&#xD;
      typically affects one side of the head, and is often accompanied by nausea and disturbed&#xD;
      vision. Migraine headache accounts for 1.4% of all neurological and mental disorders.2 It was&#xD;
      reported that the estimated lifetime prevalence of migraine ranged 12%-18%.3 Chronic migraine&#xD;
      is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders - ICHD-3 as having&#xD;
      headaches for ≥ 15 days per month, for ≥ 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      , which ≥ 8 days/month are linked to migraine. Chronic migraine affects around 1%-4% of the&#xD;
      population and chronic tension-type headache about 2.2%.4 Approximately 25%-50% of those&#xD;
      affected also have medication overuse headache, which has a population prevalence of 1%.5&#xD;
      Chronic headache is a severely disabling long-term condition, with higher symptom ,frequency&#xD;
      and severity than episodic headache.6&#xD;

      Chronic headache is a severely disabling long-term condition, with higher symptom ,frequency&#xD;
      and severity than episodic headache.6 Diagnostic criteria of chronic migraine according to&#xD;
      ICHD(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache occurring on 15 or more days/month for more than 3 months, which, on at least 8&#xD;
      days/month, has the features of migraine headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Headache (migraine-like or tension-type-like1) on ≥15 days/month for &gt;3 months, and&#xD;
      fulfilling criteria B and C B. Occurring in a patient who has had at least five attacks&#xD;
      fulfilling criteria B-D for 1.1 Migraine without aura and/or criteria B and C for 1.2&#xD;
      Migraine with aura&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. On ≥8 days/month for &gt;3 months, fulfilling any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. criteria C and D for 1.1 Migraine without aura&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. criteria B and C for 1.2 Migraine with aura&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. elieved by the patient to be migraine at onset and relieved by a triptan or ergot&#xD;
           derivative D Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodic migraine (EM) is characterized by those with migraine who have 0 to 14 headache days&#xD;
      per month, while chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by 15 or more headache days per&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between EM and CM is complex. EM progresses to CM at the rate of 2.5% per&#xD;
      year [8], and CM often remits to EM (2-year transition rate of 26%) [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors have been associated with migraine chronification (predictors) ; such as age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age *Sex *Presence of depression *Presence of anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sleep disorder *obesity *medication compliance *medication overuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coffee * low income *allodynia *other pain disordes comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims were to identify factors that predict prognosis in patients with chronic Migraine.&#xD;
