  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress, anxiety, distress and depression are exceptionally high among healthcare providers at&#xD;
      the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge of factors underlying distress and&#xD;
      resilience and evidence based interventions to impact the mental wellbeing of frontline&#xD;
      healthcare providers is limited. This study will evaluate a novel mobile platform to gather&#xD;
      the &quot;distress experience&quot; of healthcare workers at Unity Health Toronto in real time during&#xD;
      and after the COVID-19 pandemic, use automated personalized mobile interventions (e.g.&#xD;
      routine, sleep, exercise) to nudge active/passive parameters to manage distress.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Upon logging into the study platform, half of the participants will be automatically randomized to receive (for 4 weeks) daily-personalized automated alerts (The mobile intervention). This feature will be made available to all participants after 4 weeks. Hence, for the first 4 weeks, this study can be described as having a parallel group study model. After 4 weeks, the study switches to a single group study model, and can therefore be described as having a single group interventional model after 4 weeks from the start date until the rest of the duration of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be issued a specific ID number to be used within the mobile app to ensure that any identifiable information within this app will remain anonymous. A master linking log will serve as the only link between participants and the study data collected in the mobile app.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the ten-item Perceived Stress Scale. Scores range from 0 to 40, and higher scores indicate more severe stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the ten-item Perceived Stress Scale. Scores range from 0 to 40, and higher scores indicate more severe stress.</description>

    <measure>Active Data - Short UCLA Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Short, 3-item scale; scores range from 3 to 9, and higher scores indicate more severe loneliness symptoms. Feasibility of the mobile platform will be indicated by a significant reduction in score.</description>

    <measure>Active Data - Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>7-item scale; scores range from 0 to 21, and higher scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. Feasibility of the mobile platform will be indicated by a significant reduction in score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Active Data - Patient Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>9-item scale; scores range from 0 to 27, and higher scores indicate more severe depression symptoms. Feasibility of the mobile platform will be indicated by a significant reduction in score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Passive Data - GPS Sample Point Metrics</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the mobile platform will be determined by the number of GPS sample points (mobility metrics) collected per user per day.</description>
