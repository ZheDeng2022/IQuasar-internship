  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients (&lt;21 years at study entry) with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) will be treated with CD33*CD3 a bispecific antibody to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, first in human dose escalation trial in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      increasing doses of CD33xCD3 BsAb administered subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (mBOIN) design will be applied. The trial will&#xD;
      start with accelerated titration using single patient cohorts until one grade ≥2 AE not&#xD;
      clearly associated to underlying disease, thereafter the trial will continue with mBOIN&#xD;
      titration.&#xD;
