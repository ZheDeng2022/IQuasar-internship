  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies suggested low serum level of vitamin D have been associated with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. So, the present study is designed to investigate the role of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation along with CsDMARD in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a autoimmune arthritis characterised by synovitis of peripheral&#xD;
      joints, with extra-articular manifestations with a prevalence of 0.5 - 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of RA is appeared during last decade followed a 4-decade period of time during&#xD;
      which the incidence declined, and it appeared to be limited to women. The treatment of this&#xD;
      condition remain unsatisfactory with a good response to conventional medications. Some recent&#xD;
      trial attempted to asses the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation to improve patient's pain&#xD;
      and disease activity and most of them shows positive findings. This proposed study is an&#xD;
      effort whether there is any role of vitamin D3 as a supplement with conventional synthetic&#xD;
      DMARDs( csDMARD) to produce improvement of pain symptoms and disease activity in RA patients.&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      the department of Pharmacology, BSMMU in collaboration with the Rheumatology Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Clinic of department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, BSMMU from the day of approval&#xD;
      by the Institutional Review Board(IRB) to January, 2022. Validated version of visual analogue&#xD;
      scale (VAS) and Disease Activity Score-28 C reactive protein (DAS-28 CRP) scale will be used&#xD;
      to asses patients. A total of 90 patients suffering from RA will be selected according to&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and serum vitamin D and C Reactive Protein(CRP) level will&#xD;
      be assessed. The clinical diagnosis of patients suffering from RA would be performed by a&#xD;
      physiatrist at the Rheumatology Rehabilitation Clinic of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      department. After completing the necessary formalities including informed consent of the&#xD;
      patients, patient would undergo a selected questionnaire disease activity score (DAS-28) to&#xD;
      assess the disease activity and visual analogue scale (VAS) to asses pain improvement. The&#xD;
      patients would be randomly allocated into two arms: intervention and control arm. Patient in&#xD;
      intervention arm would consist of patients who will receive conventional DMARDs plus vitamin&#xD;
      D for 8 weeks. Intervention arm will receive vitamin D (40,000IU) weekly orally. On the other&#xD;
      hand, patient in control arm will receive placebo for 8 weeks starting after the day of&#xD;
      initial assessment . Blood sample will be collected to measure serum vitamin D and C Reactive&#xD;
      Protein(CRP) level at baseline and again after 8 weeks of therapeutic intervention. The&#xD;
      regularity of medicine intake will be ensured over telephone, pill count, and from the&#xD;
      patient's compliance sheet. Statistical analysis will be obtained by SPSS (statistical&#xD;
      package for social science) version 24. Unpaired 't' test will be done to compare between two&#xD;
      means of interventional group and placebo group. Paired 't' test will be done to compare&#xD;
      between two means of before and after intervention. Proportion test 'Z' will be done to&#xD;
      compare proportion between intervention group and placebo group. Calculated 'p' value may&#xD;
      suggest the level of significance ( significant at p &lt; 0.05). After approval from&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) every eligible patient will be informed about the&#xD;
      intervention and the study objectives. Patient will also be informed that participants can&#xD;
      participate in this study by participants free will and also participants are free to refuse&#xD;
      to participate or to withdraw at any time without compromising participants medical care.&#xD;
      Patients who will take part in the study willingly with written consent will be interviewed.&#xD;
      Patient's confidentiality will be strictly maintained. Patients personal data regarding name,&#xD;
      age, sex and other information will not be disclosed anywhere and will only be used for&#xD;
      research purpose. The study will help to analyze whether vitamin D3 supplementation has any&#xD;
      role to reduce pain symptoms and disease activity.&#xD;
