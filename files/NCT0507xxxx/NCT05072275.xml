      This study will investigate the role of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in preventive health.&#xD;
      Specifically, the purpose of this study is to determine whether knowledge of the degree of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) genetic risk, as measured and conveyed by a PRS, influences&#xD;
      patient and physician decision-making during short-term (6 month) and long-term (2 year)&#xD;
      follow-up. The initial findings of this study will be used to plan an expanded second phase&#xD;
      study with the purpose of prospectively validating that these decision-making changes lead to&#xD;
      improvements in clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Statin or other lipid lowering therapy initiation or intensification by EHR entry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>New or intensified prescriptions for statins or other LDL lowering therapy. Binary outcome measured at 6-months post-enrollment by survey-based self-report and EHR analysis - encoded as 0 if no new or intensified prescription relative to medication status at baseline, and 1 if a new or intensified prescription is entered in the EHR relative to medication status at baseline. A prescription for statins or other LDL lowering therapy is considered new if an EHR entry for a statin, PCSK9i, or ezitimibe is present at follow-up and no equivalent EHR entry exists for up to 1-year prior to enrollment. A statin prescription is considered intensified if an active statin prescription is present in the EHR at enrollment and an active statin prescription of a higher intensity tiers (high-, moderate-, and low-intensity) as described in the 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol is present at follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Statin or other lipid lowering therapy persistence by EHR entry</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Statin or other lipid lowering therapy prescription renewal. Binary outcome measured at 2-years post-enrollment by EHR analysis. Statin persistence is defined as prescription renewal within 60 days of the end of the duration of an index statin prescription made after study enrollment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Statin or other lipid lowering therapy adherence by EHR entry</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Statin or other lipid lowering therapy prescription possession. Binary outcome measured at 2-years post-enrollment by EHR entry. Statin adherence is defined as prescription coverage of no less than 80% of the days between the index statin prescription and the end of the 2-year follow-up period</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adequate LDL-C lowering - comparison of baseline and follow-up measures by lab test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 2 years post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Adequate LDL-C lowering. Adequate LDL-C lowering is defined as 30% or more reduction from baseline study measured LDL-C</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lifestyle changes by survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption of Healthy Lifestyle. Binary outcomes derived from baseline and 6-months post-enrollment by survey-based self-report.</description>

    <ipd_description>Research records with patient identification will be kept for 6 years after study completion. The collected data and related de-identified health information may be kept indefinitely. Record retention will comply with the specific requirements of the Scripps IRB (i.e., Scripps Research must keep HIPAA form for at least 6 years after study completion). The results of this research will be presented at meetings or in publication. However, research participants' identities will not be disclosed in those presentations.</ipd_description>
