  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Despite a favorable prognosis, metastatic cervical lymph nodes (LN), are not&#xD;
      uncommon among patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend that a suspicious cervical LN on neck ultrasound (US) should be investigated with&#xD;
      fine needle aspiration biopsy for cytology (FNAC) and for thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement&#xD;
      (FNA-Tg), using saline washout of the needle content. Since Tg is a protein produced&#xD;
      exclusively by thyroid follicular cells, a positive FNA-Tg result establishes the diagnosis&#xD;
      of metastatic DTC. Currently, following LN biopsy, a patient must wait days to weeks to&#xD;
      receive results, that directly impacts the treatment plan. This delay may be solved by a&#xD;
      point of care assay of the washout Tg (POC-Tg), drawn from a suspicious cervical LN. Another&#xD;
      potential novel usage of POC-Tg is the evaluation of suspicious LN found during neck surgery&#xD;
      for known or suspicious DTC. Here, the POC-Tg may save the time needed for the completion of&#xD;
      'frozen section'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study product: POC-Tg is a lateral flow immunoassay for Tg, able to detect within minutes&#xD;
      Tg at concentration equal to 5 ng/mL and above (the midrange of the accepted cut-off).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The multi-center validation study will include 100 patients in the FNA clinic, and&#xD;
      150 LN (dissected from 50-150 patients) in the operating room (OR). Each LN will be evaluated&#xD;
      using both the formal accepted method (in the FNA clinic, the combination of FNAC and FNA-Tg;&#xD;
      and frozen section in the OR), and the novel POC-Tg. Clinical decisions will be made&#xD;
      according to the formal evaluation only. In a retrospective analysis, the investigators will&#xD;
      estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the POC-Tg and the formal accepted method against&#xD;
      the reference ('gold') standard (cytology, histology and follow-up US in the FNA clinic&#xD;
      setting, and final histology in the OR setting).&#xD;

      Methods and materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The diagnostic accuracy of the novel POC-Tg will be comparable with the current&#xD;
      diagnostic methods used for the evaluation of cervical LNs suspected as DTC metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate the POC-Tg in the FNA clinic: Indeterminate or suspicious cervical LNs in&#xD;
           patients with known or suspected DTC will be assessed using both the novel POC-Tg, and&#xD;
           the formal evaluation (formal immunoassay for Tg and cytology).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the POC-Tg in the OR: Indeterminate or suspicious cervical LNs in patients&#xD;
           operated for DTC will be assessed using both the novel POC-Tg and the formal evaluation&#xD;
           (frozen section and/or final histology in the pathological institution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: An accurate POC-Tg may change current diagnostic and treatment approaches of&#xD;
      patients with suspected metastatic DTC and improve patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multi-center study. All coded data will be managed&#xD;
      centrally, using an electronic case report form, by Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC)&#xD;
      Clinical Research Center. All the data for sensitivity and specificity evaluations of the&#xD;
      novel POC-Tg, and the current diagnostic methods of DTC cervical LN metastasis will be&#xD;
      analyzed retrospectively against the reference ('gold') standard (see below). Clinical&#xD;
      decisions will be made according to the current guidelines and accepted approaches for the&#xD;
      evaluation of cervical LN that are suspected as DTC metastases (in the FNA clinic, the&#xD;
      combination of FNAC and FNA-Tg; and in the OR, frozen section and/or final histology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The FNA clinic arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All recruited patients will undergo US examination of the neck using an US scanner with&#xD;
           a 12.5-MHz linear phased-array transducer. US-guided FNA of suspicious or indeterminate&#xD;
           LN will be performed by an experienced physician (an endocrinologist, otolaryngologist,&#xD;
           or a radiologist), as clinically indicated. LN will be classified as suspicious if any&#xD;
           of the following imaging features is present: calcification, cystic change,&#xD;
           hyper-echogenicity, or peripheral or diffuse increased vascularity on color Doppler&#xD;
           imaging. LN will be classified as indeterminate suspicious when neither clear benign nor&#xD;
           suspicious imaging features are found (neither echogenic hilum nor hilar vascularity in&#xD;
           the absence of suspicious findings). The FNA procedure will be performed under US&#xD;
           guidance with the free hand technique using a 22 to 25-gauge needle connected to a 3 to&#xD;
           10-mL syringe, as routinely performed in each medical center. If technically and&#xD;
           clinically possible, each LN will be sampled twice: one passage for cytology and one&#xD;
           passage for FNA-Tg washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FNA for cytology (FNAC)- FNAC specimens will be prepared from direct smears and/or&#xD;
           liquid-based cytology, as routinely performed in each medical center. In the FNA clinic&#xD;
           at SUMC, specimens will be smeared on slides and immediately fixed in 95% ethanol using&#xD;
           the direct smear method. With the liquid-based cytology method, specimens will be&#xD;
           prepared using the ThinPrep PreservCyt® (Hologic Ins., Marlborough, MA, USA). Cytology&#xD;
           findings will be interpreted by cytopathologists specialized in thyroid cytology. The&#xD;
           cytology results obtained from the LN of interest will be categorized as: malignant,&#xD;
           benign, or indeterminate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FNA-Tg and POC-Tg- After the needle is localized inside the LN of interest, a negative&#xD;
           pressure will be produced by the syringe handle, while performing inward-outward and&#xD;
           rotatory movement, until a bloody material is seen in the proximal end of the needle.&#xD;
           Thereafter, 100 µL of 0.9% (w/v) saline will be drawn via the needle into the syringe&#xD;
           that will contain 100 µL of mildly bloody aspirate from the LN of interest. The aspirate&#xD;
           will then be transferred into an Eppendorf tube through the same needle that was used&#xD;
           for the FNA procedure. At this time the product bag of the POC-Tg kit will be opened.&#xD;
           Using a disposable pipette, 40 µL will be aspirated from the Eppendorf tube and dripped&#xD;
           into the middle of the sample well of the POC-Tg kit. Two drops of the buffer will then&#xD;
           be dispensed into the middle of the sample well. Results of the POC-Tg will be obtained&#xD;
           and documented after 10 minutes. To compare the accuracy of the POC-Tg kit to the formal&#xD;
           immunoassay for Tg that is used in each institution, 0.9% saline will be added to the&#xD;
           aspirate that will be left in the Eppendorf tube to a final volume of 0.6 mL, then&#xD;
           transferred into a gel containing tube and sent to the clinical laboratory that performs&#xD;
           Tg measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reference ('gold') Standard- LN will be finally diagnosed as metastatic if they show&#xD;
           malignant FNA cytology (Bethesda 6) or meeting at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
           (i) malignancy confirmation based on the surgical specimen (histology), (ii) subsequent&#xD;
           repeat FNA or core-needle biopsy reporting Bethesda 6 or DTC, respectively, or (iii)&#xD;
           follow-up with imaging after one year showing clear US features of metastasis. LN with&#xD;
           benign or indeterminate FNA cytology free of metastatic disease by the same criteria&#xD;
           will be finally diagnosed as benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Routine laboratory assessment- Analytes as plasma Tg, anti-Tg-antibodies,&#xD;
           anti-thyroid-peroxidase, TSH, free T4, and free T3 will be performed as part of the&#xD;
           routine evaluation of patients with suspected or known thyroid disease.&#xD;

                (years) at the time of the index procedure, past diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis&#xD;
                (ICD9 code 2452), past diagnosis of Grave's disease (ICD9 code 2420), treated with&#xD;
                levothyroxine or an anti-thyroid-drug, prior thyroid surgery (no, lobectomy&#xD;
                [left/right], sub-total thyroidectomy, complete thyroidectomy), prior neck&#xD;
                dissection (central [no, right, left], lateral level 2-4 [no, right, left], lateral&#xD;
                level 5 [no, right, left]).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory data prior to the index procedure (each will be reported with units used&#xD;
                by the laboratory where it was performed, and as X upper limit of norm): TSH, Tg,&#xD;
                anti-Tg- antibodies, free T4, free T3, anti-thyroid peroxidase.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. The OR arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid/neck surgery and Ex-vivo FNA- All recruited patients will be operated, as clinically&#xD;
      indicated, either as part of primary treatment for DTC or for persistent or recurrent DTC.&#xD;
      Thyroid and neck dissection surgeries will be led by experienced otolaryngologist or&#xD;
      endocrine surgeons. Whenever an indeterminate or suspicious LN is found, and it is deemed&#xD;
      that a frozen section report of the LN may change surgery extent, the LN will be dissected&#xD;
      and evaluated by both the formal evaluation-frozen section and POC-Tg. Following dissection&#xD;
      of the LN, the ex-vivo FNA-Tg and POC-Tg will be conducted as detailed above (under the&#xD;
      'FNA-Tg and POC-Tg' section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen section- The relevant specimen for frozen section will be dissected, treated, and sent&#xD;
      to pathological evaluation as clinically indicated and routinely performed in each medical&#xD;
      center. All clinical decisions during the surgery will be made according to the frozen&#xD;
      section results or clinical judgment. The histology results of the frozen section analysis,&#xD;
      obtained from the LN of interest, will be categorized as: malignant, benign, or&#xD;
      indeterminate/inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference ('gold') Standard- LN will be finally diagnosed as benign or malignant (DTC&#xD;
      metastasis) according to the final histological report.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Technical data (per center): Frozen section equipment, type of FNA-Tg immunoassay (type,&#xD;
           firm, limit of detection, reported accuracy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and clinical data: Date of birth, date of the index procedure, age (years)&#xD;
           at the time of the index procedure, past diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis (ICD9 code&#xD;
           2452), past diagnosis of Grave's disease (ICD9 code 2420), treated with levothyroxine or&#xD;
           an anti-thyroid-drug, prior thyroid surgery (no, lobectomy [left/right], sub-total&#xD;
           thyroidectomy, complete thyroidectomy), prior neck dissection (central [no, right,&#xD;
           left], lateral level 2-4 [no, right, left], lateral level 5 [no, right, left]).&#xD;
&#xD;

           left], lateral level 5[no, right, left]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FNA-Tg- units as reported by the institutional lab, and X upper limit of norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POC-Tg- positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The operation that was executed: as planned/ extended (specify).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final histology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimates of sensitivity and specificity will be calculated for the positive and negative&#xD;
      samples, respectively, while their status will be defined using the reference ('gold')&#xD;
      standard (diagnostic procedure depending on cytology and histology results, and other&#xD;
      clinical information). To address the main objectives of the study, the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval will be constructed around each of the validation parameters. A design effect will&#xD;
      be considered for the samples taken in the OR that originate from the same patient, using a&#xD;
      sandwich estimator of the standard error. Furthermore, the researchers will explore potential&#xD;
      factors associated with agreement and disagreement of the diagnostic test with the reference&#xD;
      ('gold') standard. Specifically, characteristics of patients in whom the diagnosis was&#xD;
      aligned with the reference ('gold') standard will be compared to those with discordant&#xD;
      results. This type of analysis will indicate populations, if any, for which the test should&#xD;
      not be utilized. The comparisons will be conducted using standard statistical methodology,&#xD;
      i.e. Chi-Square or Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables and t-test, ANOVA or&#xD;
      non-parametric alternative tests for continuous parameters. Confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      adjusted to clustered observations as appropriate.&#xD;
