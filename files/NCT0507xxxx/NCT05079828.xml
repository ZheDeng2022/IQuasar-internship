    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide robust data on the head-to-head comparison of the two&#xD;
      ligands of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) available in Switzerland for&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET)-imaging, i.e. 68Ga-PSMA-11 und 18F-PSMA-1007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer (PC) is the most common malignancy in men and the second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death in men. Despite initial therapy at early stage disease, biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence remains a commonly encountered entity and presents a challenge for conventional&#xD;
      imaging modalities given their limited abilities to detect disease at early stages of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT with ligands of the prostate specific membrane antigen has been shown to have a&#xD;
      significant impact on treatment and is now the sine qua non for staging of recurrent PC. For&#xD;
      example, accurate identification of PC lesions allows for more accurate radiotherapy&#xD;
      planning, allowing for an individualised treatment strategy. There is therefore a substantial&#xD;
      clinical requirement for the accurate identification and stratification of individuals in&#xD;
      whom prostate cancer is diagnosed and at earlier stages of recurrent disease when the chance&#xD;
      of a curative treatment is at its highest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that PSMA has become the focus of much attention owing to its high&#xD;
      levels of expression on PC cells and has rapidly established itself as the investigation of&#xD;
      choice in recurrent PC. Furthermore, PSMA-directed radioligand therapy is a rapidly evolving&#xD;
      treatment modality for metastatic disease, creating an additional therapeutic role for&#xD;
      PSMA-ligand molecular imaging, for which the term &quot;theragnostics&quot; has been coined. The&#xD;
      challenge for nuclear medicine is therefore to develop tracers and examination protocols that&#xD;
      provide optimal detection and characterisation of disease, thus improving upon this promising&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no published prospective head-to-head studies comparing these two tracers&#xD;
      in recurrent PC. Because of this lack of data, there are no clear recommendations about which&#xD;
      tracer to use and in which situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to fill this gap and provide comprehensive data with the potential to improve&#xD;
      the diagnosis of PC. By providing robust data comparing the two tracers, such data will also&#xD;
      provide guidance to clinicians faced with the scenario of an initially negative 68Ga-PSMA-11&#xD;
      PET as to the diagnostic utility of an additional 18F-PSMA-1007 PET, or vice-versa, and in&#xD;
      which scenarios repeated scanning may be justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the application of the radiotracer into the same patient allows for a comparison of&#xD;
      tracer kinetics. Although radiotracer kinetics are well known from the original pioneering&#xD;
      dosimetric publications, they have never been compared in a head to head fashion and not in&#xD;
      biochemical recurrence. Obtaining dynamic scans over the first hour post injection will allow&#xD;
      intra-individual dosimetry and a head-to-head comparison of parametric imaging parameters,&#xD;
      allowing a direct comparison of the radiotracer's affinity using standard parametric imaging&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

    <description>Readers shall independently classify all PSMA-avid lesions according to previously published diagnostic criteria.

The interreader reliability for these classifications will be compared between all readers.</description>
