    <textblock>
      This is a short pilot usability study of a virtual reality device for patients with chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a study of patients with chronic pain to collect feasibility&#xD;
      of recruitment data, adherence to therapy data, and preliminary effectiveness data. All&#xD;
      patients will be in the active arm, this is not a randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention being piloted is the EaseVRx (AppliedVR, Los Angeles, CA) VR hardware and&#xD;
      software. EaseVRx incorporates evidence-based principles of cognitive behavioral therapy,&#xD;
      mindfulness, and pain neuroscience education into an immersive and enhanced biofeedback&#xD;
      experience. EaseVRx includes breathing training and relaxation response exercises that&#xD;
      activate the parasympathetic nervous system. EaseVRx was designed for at-home use and comes&#xD;
      with a sequence of daily immersive experiences. Each session will include one VR experience,&#xD;
      which is 2-16 minutes in length (average of 6 minutes). This study will last one week, or 7&#xD;
      total sessions (out of 56 total sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete one survey at 3 days over the telephone assessing pain, mood,&#xD;
      adherence to the device, and overall satisfaction. Then participants will complete an&#xD;
      additional assessment when the device is returned after day 7, again assessing pain, mood,&#xD;
      overall adherence to the device, and overall satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are recruiting participants from the VR Usability Study (IRB # 2021-13108)&#xD;
      who expressed interest in participating in further research. As this is a pilot feasibility&#xD;
      trial, the plan is to recruit between 5 and 10 patients.&#xD;

    <description>This is a study of patients with chronic pain to assess usability of a VR device at home. The main goals are 1) to collect data on feasibility of recruitment, 2) to collect data on daily adherence to therapy, and 3) to collect preliminary effectiveness data on pain and mood outcomes. There will be 7 sessions over one week, with each session lasting about 2-16 minutes. All patients recruited will be in the active arm; this is not a randomized pilot study.</description>
