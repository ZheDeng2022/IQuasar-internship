  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of single-administration low-dose&#xD;
      glucagon and split-administration low-dose glucagon to placebo for prevention of&#xD;
      exercise-induced hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps and multiple&#xD;
      daily injections (MDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to compare the accuracy of three continuous glucose monitors (CGM)&#xD;
      during and after exercise in inpatient and outpatient settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled three-arm cross-over study will be conducted&#xD;
      to assess the study objectives. 22 participants with type 1 diabetes will complete three&#xD;
      study visits in random order. At every visit the participants will exercise for 60 min&#xD;
      receiving different low doses of glucagon before or before and after exercise compared with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits and in an outpatient period the participants will have 3 different CGM&#xD;
      devices installed and the values will be compared with self-monitored blood glucose values.&#xD;
