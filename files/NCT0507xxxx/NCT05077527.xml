    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects and usefulness of axicabtagene clioleucel (a&#xD;
      CAR-T therapy) and find out what effect, if any, it has on treating patients with&#xD;
      HIV-associated aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or not&#xD;
      responded to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill&#xD;
      tumor cells. Axicabtagene ciloleucel consists of genetically modified T cells, modified to&#xD;
      recognize CD-19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD-19-specific T cells may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system identify and kill CD-19-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of axicabtagene ciloleucel for relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      (R/R) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (B-NHL) in participants with well-controlled HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in HIV-associated B-NHL as measured by&#xD;
      complete response rate, event-free survival, and duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the relationship between T-cell subset profile and clinical response in R/R&#xD;
      HIV-associated B-NHL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the relationship between immune-mediated response and clinical response and&#xD;
      toxicity in HIV-associated B-NHL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define burden of HIV integration in the final chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell&#xD;
      product versus the pheresis product through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over&#xD;
      1 hour on days -5, -4, and -3. Patients then receive axicabtagene ciloleucel IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up once weekly for month 1, once a&#xD;
      month for months 2-6, and then at 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety defined as blood count recovery of neutrophils and platelets to grade 2 or less within 6 weeks of CAR-T cell administration; incidence of infections; and cytokine release syndrome as defined by the 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy harmonized system. The incidence of toxicity will be summarized using frequency and percentage and presented by overall and for each CD4 cohort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of CAR-T Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility defined as ability of enrolled participants in each cohort to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel. Feasibility will be estimated as the proportion of participants who receive axicabtagene ciloleucel among all enrolled participants who undergo leukapheresis. A two-sided 95% exact confidence interval will also be reported together with the estimated proportion. Production failure will be defined as the number of episodes of &quot;inability to collect sufficient T-cells and/or create products.&quot; It will be summarized using descriptive statistics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be estimated as the proportion of participants who achieve complete response as per Lugano criteria. A two-sided exact 95% confidence interval will be reported together with the estimated response rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time from randomization to earliest date of disease progression, commencement of new lymphoma therapy, or death, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per Lugano, commencement of new lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause. The event of interest includes disease progression or treatment discontinuation for any reason. Patients who do not experience an event will be censored at the last time the patient is alive without disease progression or treatment discontinuation. The distribution of event-free survival will be presented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The event-free survival probability together with 95% confidence interval at specific time points will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time when response criteria are met to the documentation of relapse or progression, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR defined as time from when response criteria (completer response or partial response) are met to the documentation of relapse or progression. The event of interest includes relapse, progression or death from any cause. For patients who die without disease, response duration is censored at the time of death. For patients who have not progressed, response duration is censored at the last time at which progression was assessed. The analysis approach for response duration will be similar to what has been described for event-free survival.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CD4 and CD8 counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in CD4 and CD8 counts between those who achieve complete response and those who do not will be tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon rank sum test. The analysis will be done for both CD4 count-based cohorts separately.</description>

          -  History of any one of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 6&#xD;
             months: class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association,&#xD;
             cardiac angioplasty or stenting, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or other&#xD;
             clinically significant cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of clinically relevant CNS pathology such as epilepsy, seizure,&#xD;
             paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
             cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, or psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women. NOTE: Women of reproductive potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before starting conditioning&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because axicabtagene&#xD;
             ciloleucel has not been studied in pregnant women. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with axicabtagene ciloleucel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. These potential risks may also apply&#xD;
             to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Therapeutic doses of corticosteroids (defined as &gt; 20 mg/day prednisone or&#xD;
                  equivalent) within 7 days before leukapheresis or 72 hours before axicabtagene&#xD;
                  ciloleucel administration. Physiologic replacement, topical, and inhaled steroids&#xD;
                  are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy given after leukapheresis to maintain disease control must be&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents that are not considered lymphotoxic (see below)&#xD;
                  within 1 week before leukapheresis. Oral chemotherapeutic agents, including&#xD;
                  lenalidomide and ibrutinib, are allowed if at least 3 half-lives have elapsed&#xD;
                  prior to leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lymphotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,&#xD;
                  bendamustine) within 2 weeks before leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Experimental agents received within 4 weeks before leukapheresis unless no&#xD;
                  response or disease progression is documented while on the experimental therapy&#xD;
                  and at least 3 half-lives have elapsed before leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunosuppressive therapies within 4 weeks before leukapheresis and axicabtagene&#xD;
                  ciloleucel administration (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, or other&#xD;
                  chemotherapeutics, mycophenolate, rapamycin, thalidomide, immunosuppressive&#xD;
                  antibodies such as anti-TNF, anti-IL6, or anti-IL6R)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) within 6 weeks before axicabtagene ciloleucel&#xD;
                  administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation within 1 week before leukapheresis. Subjects must have progressive&#xD;
                  disease in irradiated lesions or have additional non-irradiated, PET-positive&#xD;
                  lesions to be eligible. However, palliative radiation to a single lesion, if&#xD;
                  additional non-irradiated PET-positive lesions are present, is allowed up to 2&#xD;
                  weeks before leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior receipt of CAR T-cell therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with signs or symptoms indicative of active CNS involvement are excluded&#xD;
             from the protocol, with the following exceptions: The following patients are included&#xD;
             in the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with previously treated CNS involvement by lymphoma or leukemia, who&#xD;
                  and have no neurologic symptoms and no evidence of active lymphoma or leukemia in&#xD;
                  the CNS by total spine and brain gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
                  (MRI) within 2 weeks before leukapheresis and no neurologic progression prior to&#xD;
                  axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with active CNS involvement and stable neurologic symptoms for at&#xD;
                  least 3 weeks before leukapheresis and without neurologic progression prior to&#xD;
                  axi-cel infusion. These patients should have assessment by a total spine and&#xD;
                  brain gadolinium enhanced MRI within 5 days before axi-cel infusion to document&#xD;
                  the extent of CNS disease prior to axi-cel infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
                  sampling for cell count, cytology and cell markers by flow cytometry should also&#xD;
                  be included within 5 days of axi-cel infusion if previously positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone&#xD;

             are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational&#xD;
             corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids are permitted, including if &gt;= 10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
             equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye&#xD;
             allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type&#xD;
             hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. Use of anabolic&#xD;
             steroids is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE =&lt; grade 1 from toxicity due to&#xD;
             all prior therapies except =&lt; grade 2 alopecia, neuropathy, and other non-clinically&#xD;
             significant adverse events (AEs), provided that all other eligibility criteria are met&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Opportunistic infection within the last 3 months, with the exception of oropharyngeal&#xD;
             candidiasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to axicabtagene ciloleucel or other agents used in study&#xD;
