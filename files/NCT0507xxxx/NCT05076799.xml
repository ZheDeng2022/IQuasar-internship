  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the most useful exam used to evaluate colorectal diseases, like colorectal&#xD;
      polyps and cancer. The appropriate bowel preparation is indispensable for colonoscopy&#xD;
      procedures. Polyethylene glycol solution (PEG) is the most frequent laxative medication.&#xD;
      However, the taste is poor, and patients need to drink a lot of liquids to obtain adequate&#xD;
      visualization of the mucosal surface. In fact, no laxative has all the characteristics of an&#xD;
      ideal medication. Lactulose is an osmotic laxative which widely used in cirrhosis and&#xD;
      constipation patients, and could inhibit bacterial in the colon to increase colon cleanliness&#xD;
      and prolong the effect time of PEG. Previous study demonstrate PEG combined with lactulose&#xD;
      has a significant improvement in the quality of bowel preparation compared with PEG alone.&#xD;
      The present study aim to assess the efficacy of lactulose with or without PEG in bowel&#xD;
      preparation to improve mucosal visualization, reduced volume of fluid consumed, and&#xD;
      preparation intolerance.&#xD;

      This study will conduct in 5 clinical central. 1000 participants who were scheduled for&#xD;
      colonoscopy age between 18 and 80 years were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      patients with uncontrolled acute or recurrent chronic intestinal infections, with active&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding or gastrointestinal stricture or intestinal obstruction, with&#xD;
      severity coronary heart disease or heart failure or renal failure and liver failure or severe&#xD;
      electrolyte metabolism disorder, with pregnant or lactating or metal diseases or refuse to&#xD;
      colonoscopy examination. Central stratification and block randomization is achieved via a&#xD;
      computer-generated random-sequence table by using R software. The participants will be&#xD;
      assigned into one of four groups at a ratio of 1 : 1, and received a single 3 L dose of&#xD;
      either PEG or 200ml dose of lactulose, 100ml lactulose combined with 1L PEG, 100ml lactulose&#xD;
      combined with 2L PEG. The following parameters were then obtained: time of the first&#xD;
      defecation, defecation frequency, the overall drink liquid volume, the taste of the&#xD;
      preparation, the tolerance evaluation, the cleansing quality of the bowel preparations and&#xD;
      adverse reaction.&#xD;
