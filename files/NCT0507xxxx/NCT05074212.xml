  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether complex linear closure vs second intention&#xD;
      healing for cutaneous wounds below the knee affects esthetic outcomes (primary outcome). As&#xD;
      secondary outcome, the study team plans to look at patient quality of life measures and&#xD;
      complications. This will be a prospective, 2-arm, randomized, evaluator-blinded clinical&#xD;
      trial. One half of the patients will receive repair by complex linear closure and the other&#xD;
      half of the patients will undergo second intention healing. Three-months post-surgery, the&#xD;
      scar will be evaluated via the patient observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), a validated&#xD;
      scar instrument, as well as the trace-to-tape method, an objective outcome measure for linear&#xD;
      postoperative scars. In addition, patients will be provided a validated quality of life&#xD;
      survey to complete. Any adverse events will also be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a cutaneous wound is created following Mohs micrographic surgery and standard excisions,&#xD;
      a decision is made to either allow the wound to heal by second intention (&quot;leave open&quot;) or&#xD;
      repair the wound (&quot;close&quot;). The decision may depend on patient characteristics, wound&#xD;
      location, wound size or wound characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the decision is made to repair the wound, the majority of wounds are reconstructed using&#xD;
      two layers of sutures: a deep (subcutaneous) layer and a top (cutaneous) layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether complex linear closure versus second intention healing&#xD;
      for cutaneous surgical procedures performed below the knee affects wound cosmesis. In other&#xD;
      words, the study team would like to determine which of the following yields a more&#xD;
      cosmetically appealing scar: below the knee wound that is closed in a linear fashion or below&#xD;
      the knee wound that is left open to heal on its own. The study team also plans to look at&#xD;
      quality of life measures via validated surveys and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized control trials comparing these two methods appear to be lacking. A randomized&#xD;
      trial looked at second intention healing vs primary simple closure following 4mm or 8mm punch&#xD;
      biopsies on the arm, back or thigh1. Besides this study, no other information could be found&#xD;
      in the literature on randomized trials comparing linear closure vs second intent for&#xD;
      cutaneous wounds below the knee. The study team hopes that this study will provide new&#xD;
      insight in cutaneous surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the sum of the average components of the Observer portion of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). The observer scale of the POSAS consists of six items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability and surface area).&#xD;
All items are scored on a scale ranging from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable'). The sum of the six items results in a total score of the POSAS observer scale. Categories boxes are added for each item. Furthermore, an overall opinion is scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 10.</description>
