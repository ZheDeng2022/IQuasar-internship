  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&amp;C)&#xD;
      versus excision with complex linear closure affects esthetic outcomes (primary outcome). As&#xD;
      secondary outcome, we plan to look at patient quality of life measures and complications.&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, 2-arm, randomized, evaluator-blinded clinical trial. One half of&#xD;
      the patients will receive ED&amp;C and the other half will receive excision with repair by&#xD;
      complex linear closure. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be evaluated via the patient&#xD;
      observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), a validated scar instrument, as well as the&#xD;
      trace-to-tape method, an objective outcome measure for linear postoperative scars. In&#xD;
      addition, patients will be provided a validated quality of life survey to complete. Any&#xD;
      adverse events will also be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low risk lesions on the trunk and extremities can be treated via various modalities including&#xD;
      topical therapies, ED&amp;C, and excision. The purpose of this study is to compare ED&amp;C versus&#xD;
      excision with repair by complex linear closure. The wound following ED&amp;C will heal by second&#xD;
      intention, meaning that there will not be any sutures placed. Complex linear closures&#xD;
      following an excision will require two layers of sutures: a deep (subcutaneous) layer and a&#xD;
      top (cutaneous) layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether ED&amp;C versus excision with repair by complex linear&#xD;
      closure for low risk lesions on trunk and extremities affects cosmesis. In other words, the&#xD;
      research team would like to determine which of the following yields a more cosmetically&#xD;
      appealing scar: ED&amp;C or excision with linear closure. As secondary outcomes, the research&#xD;
      team plans to look at quality of life measures via a validated survey and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a prospective cohort study measuring quality of life following ED&amp;C vs&#xD;
      excision vs Mohs surgery1 and another prospective cohort study measuring patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes following ED&amp;C2. However, randomized control trials comparing the cosmesis and&#xD;
      quality of life of these two methods appear to be lacking in current literature. The research&#xD;
      team hopes that this study will provide new insight in cutaneous surgery.&#xD;
