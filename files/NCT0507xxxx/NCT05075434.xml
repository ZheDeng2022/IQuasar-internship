  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diacutaneous Fibrolysis (FD) is a physiotherapy technique based on Cyricax's transverse&#xD;
      massage. Kurt Ekman, its creator, observed that Cyriax's deep transverse massage was intended&#xD;
      to achieve a mechanical effect on the tissues, but this had a series of disadvantages such as&#xD;
      the difficulty in penetrating between tissue septa due to the large surface area of the&#xD;
      finger tips, as well as its soft consistency in the face of adhesions or fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adding FD to the gastrocnemius and plantar fascia to a primary care treatment&#xD;
      protocol will produce a decrease in the stiffness (viscoelastic property) of the plantar&#xD;
      fascia, an increase in length, width, height and a decrease in the plantar arch, as well as&#xD;
      an increase in the length of the gastrocnemius greater than not adding it in subjects with&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Once the participant has passed the selection criteria and signed the&#xD;
      informed consent form, the measurements of the anthropometric variables and classification of&#xD;
      the foot with the Foot Posture Index will be carried out. Subsequently, the dependent&#xD;
      variables will be collected, starting with active and passive gastrocnemius flexibility,&#xD;
      followed by measurements with the anthropometric foot measurement platform (foot length, arch&#xD;
      height in loading and unloading, arch height index, foot width in loading and unloading,&#xD;
      windlass force at 20º, 40º and maximum, myotonometry measurements (tone, stiffness,&#xD;
      elasticity, relaxation and creep) and pain. Once the initial variables have been recorded,&#xD;
      the first patient intervention will be carried out according to the assigned group. A total&#xD;
      of 8 sessions will be carried out over 4 weeks (2 sessions per week). The variables of this&#xD;
      study will be collected at the beginning of the study and at the end of the 8 intervention&#xD;
      sessions (1 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention &quot;Protocol The usual protocol that the health service guidelines for this&#xD;
      pathology will be carried out. The protocol consists of calf stretching exercises, plantar&#xD;
      fascia, proprioception exercises, ultrasound, magnet therapy and gait re-education and&#xD;
      proprioceptive exercises. The average intervention lasts between 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Protocol &quot;+FD Participants in this group will additionally receive 15 minutes of the&#xD;
      treatment technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FD intervention will be carried out with the same duration and protocol for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention protocol will be: Start with the point of maximum tension between the two&#xD;
      muscle bellies of the calf and hamstring (Reverse hook). Then work on the peroneus longus&#xD;
      lateralis and soleus. Then the external calf muscle belly and soleus and the internal calf&#xD;
      muscle belly and soleus. Then work on the tendon of the flexor hallucis proprio of the big&#xD;
      toe and the inner edge of the Achilles tendon and peroneus longus. Then treatment of the&#xD;
      peroneus longus with the peroneus brevis. Scraping of the insertion of the Achilles tendon,&#xD;
      hooking of the internal and external part of the plantar fascia. Finally, longitudinal&#xD;
      friction of the plantar fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be in prone position with a support on the front of the leg with the&#xD;
      foot off the stretcher. The physiotherapist will be in a standing position next to the&#xD;
      participant. The procedure will be to palpate the different intermuscular septa and grooves&#xD;
      and then perform the FD phases with the hook (supplementary transverse traction).&#xD;

      Diacutaneous Fibrolysis (FD) is a physiotherapy technique based on Cyricax's transverse&#xD;
      massage. Kurt Ekman, its creator, observed that Cyriax's deep transverse massage was intended&#xD;
      to achieve a mechanical effect on the tissues, but this had a series of disadvantages such as&#xD;
      the difficulty in penetrating between tissue septa due to the large surface area of the&#xD;
      finger tips, as well as its soft consistency in the face of adhesions or fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these difficulties, Ekman designed hooks that allowed, according to Ekman&#xD;
      himself, to treat areas located in depth. The hooks used in the current FD are metallic,&#xD;
      curved at both ends, which allow working more specifically in depth and transversally to the&#xD;
      tissue without slipping on the skin, focusing the mechanical effect and reducing the stress&#xD;
      on the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its mechanical effect is described as the elimination of areas of fibrosis, trying to recover&#xD;
      physiological sliding between tissue planes, and although there is little scientific evidence&#xD;
      on the mechanical effects of FD, several authors have described clinical modifications in&#xD;
      passive muscle resistance to stretching or gains in joint movement. These modifications&#xD;
      suggest a tendon mechanical adaptation as suggested by Lévenez, Guissard and Duchateau. A&#xD;
      cutaneous circulatory effect is also described and is the most visible effect achieved with&#xD;
      instrumental soft tissue mobilisation techniques. In addition, Burnotte and Duby, observed&#xD;
      that venous return was improved with FD in several pathologies, although the mechanism is&#xD;
      unknown. Histamine released after FD application is thought to be responsible for these&#xD;
      effects. Neurophysiological effects were observed by Veszely et al. in the application of FD&#xD;
      to the triceps suralis, in which neuromodulatory effects were observed 30 minutes after&#xD;
      application, with a decrease in tendon reflexes. A neuromuscular effect has now also been&#xD;
      described in response to tensomiography and myotonometry with a decrease in tone and&#xD;
      stiffness of the triceps suralis muscle in asymptomatic subjects, which was maintained 30&#xD;
      minutes post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of the gastrocnemius with the plantar fascia and this with the maintenance&#xD;
      of the plantar arch is well known. The gastrocnemius, with the continuation of the Achilles&#xD;
      tendon, modulates the tension of the plantar aponeurosis. As the tension of the triceps&#xD;
      suralis increases, so does the tension of the plantar fascia. This is very important for&#xD;
      weight-bearing transition during gait. The direction of the tendons of the extrinsic muscles&#xD;
      of the foot shows their ability to provide dynamic support and control of the longitudinal&#xD;
      and transverse components of the plantar arch. The global movements will provide both&#xD;
      absorption and propulsive capacity during dynamic activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common foot disorders, being the leading cause of heel&#xD;
      pain in primary care and accounting for 80% of all heel pain. Plantar fasciitis is a common&#xD;
      injury caused by repetitive traction of the origin of the plantar fascia on the distal&#xD;
      calcaneus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, the gastrocnemius approach is commonly used to treat plantar fascia and&#xD;
      Achilles problems. FD is one of the techniques used for these treatments; however, no studies&#xD;
      have been found on its clinical effects or the effects of this technique on the plantar arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adding FD to the gastrocnemius and plantar fascia to a primary care treatment&#xD;
      protocol will produce a decrease in the stiffness (viscoelastic property) of the plantar&#xD;
      fascia, an increase in length, width, height and a decrease in the plantar arch, as well as&#xD;
      an increase in the length of the gastrocnemius greater than not adding it in subjects with&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis.&#xD;
