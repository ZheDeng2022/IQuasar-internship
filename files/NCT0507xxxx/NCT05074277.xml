  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This small intervention study will determine if simulated short-term night shift work (NSW)&#xD;
      negatively alters bone metabolism. The specific aim of the study is to determine if NSW&#xD;
      acutely uncouples bone turnover markers (BTMs), if sympathetic tone is a mechanism for this&#xD;
      disruption and if a resumption of a normal sleep/wake pattern reverses BTM uncoupling. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that NSW will reversibly uncouple BTMs via increased sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      (SNS) tone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy, nonpregnant adults 20-40 years old who habitually sleep 7-9 hours during the&#xD;
             biological night&#xD;

             breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to complete a sleep diary, wear a wrist actigraphy monitor and&#xD;
             complete a 3-6 week research study including two 4-night inpatient stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fully vaccinated against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus 2&#xD;
             (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Night shift work within 1 year prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Travel &gt; 1 time zone within 4 weeks prior to the study or need to travel &gt;1 time zone&#xD;
             during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than moderate activity level (&gt;3 days of exercise per week &gt;30 min of exercise&#xD;
             per session).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are concurrently participating in another research protocol that would&#xD;
             influence their safe participation in this study. For example, participants involved&#xD;
             in a study that requires blood draws or ingestion of experimental medication as this&#xD;
             would increase the risk of participation in our study and/or compromise study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant unstable medical or surgical condition within the last year&#xD;
             (treated or untreated), including history of a clinically significant abnormality of&#xD;

             any history of seizure (including febrile seizure-sleep loss has been used clinically&#xD;
             to induce seizures in patients with epilepsy). Given the wide range of illnesses that&#xD;
             are encountered in medical practice, it would not be possible to provide a&#xD;
             comprehensive list of each and every disease that could serve as grounds for exclusion&#xD;
             for the subject. However, the following is a list of illness categories that would&#xD;
             certainly be grounds for exclusion: Connective Tissue and Joint Disorders;&#xD;

             stimulating hormone &lt;0.5 or &gt;5.0 microUnits/ml, abnormal alkaline phosphatase &lt;39 or&#xD;

             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-V). Individuals with a history&#xD;
             of most psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will be excluded, such as but&#xD;
             not limited to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug dependency, schizophrenic&#xD;
             disorders, and personality disorders (performed by medical history and physician&#xD;
             interview). However, a personal history of limited prior counseling, psychotherapy&#xD;
             (e.g., for adjustment reactions) will NOT be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  responses to the CES-D are reviewed immediately and appropriate referrals are&#xD;
                  made if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Individuals who are unaware of specific psychiatric diagnoses who have a history&#xD;
                  of having been treated with antidepressants, neuroleptic medications or major&#xD;

             frequent sleep walking], insomnia, including but not limited to hypersomnias such as&#xD;
             apnea, periodic limb movements, narcolepsy). Sleep disorders will be screened by&#xD;
             self-report and physician interview including use of validated sleep questionnaires&#xD;
             (PSQI, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Berlin sleep questionnaire for sleep apnea). The&#xD;
             following scores will be used to exclude those with sleep disorders: PSQI &gt;5, Epworth&#xD;

             this is known to affect C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Z-score &lt; -2.0 for bone mineral density at the L-spine, femoral neck, or total hip on&#xD;
             baseline dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as compared to the DXA machine's&#xD;
