    <textblock>
      Cancer is the commonest cause of death in the UK, and a national and international healthcare&#xD;
      priority. Survival in the UK is relatively poor vs. European comparators1, meaning early&#xD;
      tumour detection and accurate clinical assessment is particularly important to improve&#xD;
      outcomes. Treatment fundamentally depends on tumour staging, both of the local cancer and of&#xD;
      draining lymph nodes (LN), as well as distant spread of disease i.e. TNM stage (tumour (T),&#xD;
      node (N) and metastases (M). However, current non-invasive pre-operative imaging technologies&#xD;
      of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are limited&#xD;
      in sensitivity and specificity for nodal assessment, either missing disease or subjecting&#xD;
      patients to unnecessary additional invasive biopsies or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple, rapid, non-invasive tool to assess primary tumours and LN involvement would be of&#xD;
      great clinical value. One candidate technology is photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a&#xD;
      relatively novel modality that combines exquisite spatial resolution with the ability to&#xD;
      image multiple biological tissues, including blood, water and lipid. To date, PAT has been&#xD;
      most successful in imaging the vasculature, which is of particular interest for oncological&#xD;
      imaging because one of the key hallmarks of cancer is the development of new, abnormal blood&#xD;
      vessels (neoangiogenesis). The high sensitivity for superficial imaging with PAT means that&#xD;
      head and neck tumours and neck LN are readily amenable for assessment. In this cohort of&#xD;
      patients, those with oral cavity tumours, in particular tumours arising from the lining of&#xD;
      the tongue, would be readily accessible for direct scanning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer accounts for almost 30% of all deaths in England and Wales. Head and neck cancer is&#xD;
      the 8th most common cancer in the UK, and over the last decade the incidence and mortality&#xD;
      rates have increased by 24% and 14% respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or a variant&#xD;
      is the commonest histologic type in these cancers. The prognosis and treatment fundamentally&#xD;
      depend on the TNM stage. For example, the 1- and 3-year survival rates for patients with&#xD;
      early stage oral cavity cancer (Stage 1 and 2) are around 90% and 65%; however, for late&#xD;
      stage disease (Stage 3 and 4), this drops to around 80% and 45% respectively. Patients with&#xD;
      advanced disease often require more aggressive treatment such as pre-operative (neo-adjuvant)&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both; and usually need more extensive surgery / radiotherapy&#xD;
      when definitive treatment is instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eighth edition of the TNM classification of malignant tumours, which provides&#xD;
      internationally agreed-upon standards to stage cancer, now includes the depth of invasion&#xD;
      (DOI) of oral cancer for accurate T staging, with 5mm being the cut off between Stages 1 and&#xD;
      2, and 10mm the cut off for Stages 2 and 3 disease. Not only does the precise extent of local&#xD;
      growth determine whether or not a limited local resection can be achieved rather than a more&#xD;
      radical excision, but the DOI dimension, which is thought to reflect the proximity to&#xD;
      underlying lymph and vascular structures, is a good predictor of LN involvement. As&#xD;
      described, the survival rate in these patients is related to the stage of the disease&#xD;
      therefore imaging is a crucial determinant of prognosis. There is a paucity of data on the&#xD;
      reliability of radiologic and clinical staging of DOI as well as the subsequent concordance&#xD;
      of these measurements against the pathologic i.e. post-surgical, DOI. The imaging modality&#xD;
      used to assess the T stage/DOI of oral cavity cancer varies between US, CT and MRI depending&#xD;
      on the preference of the centre. Small studies evaluating how accurate each of these imaging&#xD;
      modalities are at determining DOI have been performed with promising results, however they&#xD;
      are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations in radiologic and clinical staging of the neck LN are also well known and&#xD;
      elective neck dissection (END), which involves resecting the entire regional LN group, is&#xD;
      still considered the most accurate diagnostic procedure for N staging. The reported mean&#xD;
      incidence of subclinical occult nodal metastasis detected at END in patients with early stage&#xD;
      tongue cancer is around 25% - implying these were missed by conventional imaging. However,&#xD;
      this is an invasive surgical technique with significant associated morbidity e.g. neuropathic&#xD;
      pain and reduced shoulder movement, and there is uncertainty as to whether it provides any&#xD;
      meaningful clinical benefit over observation in patients with early stage disease. An&#xD;
      alternative to END in radiologic/clinical N0 SCC of the oral cavity is sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      biopsy (SNLB), which involves identifying and excising the initial LN(s) to which a primary&#xD;
      tumour drains, thereby attempting to limit the surgical dissection. Even so, this still&#xD;
      requires a surgical procedure with the associated risks, costs and patient inconvenience, is&#xD;
      not widely-available and still misses &gt;15% of diseased nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapid and easy-to-use, non-invasive and well-tolerated test that could improve local and&#xD;
      regional cancer staging, as well as help to standardize this assessment across centres would&#xD;
      therefore be of great clinical value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a relatively novel technology that may be able to help&#xD;
      address these needs. PAT relies upon the absorption of laser-generated light of specific&#xD;
      wavelengths (often in the infra-red spectrum) by intrinsic components of the imaged tissue.&#xD;
      Such absorption results in the emission of ultrasound waves, which can be reconstructed into&#xD;
      images in a similar manner to conventional ultrasound scanners. By imaging at multiple&#xD;
      wavelengths, the tissue distribution of water, lipid and haemoglobin (in red blood cells and&#xD;
      therefore blood vessels) can be mapped with extremely high resolution (~100 microns), raising&#xD;
      the possibility that PAT can depict the small volume tumour that existing techniques cannot.&#xD;
