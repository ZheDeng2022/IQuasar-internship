    <description>Participants will receive afatinib 40 mg once a day. Each cycle is 4 weeks. They will have CT imaging (and/or digital photography) done at baseline and every 8 weeks while on treatment. Participants will have a baseline and on-treatment (at 4 weeks) tumor biopsy, and a biopsy at disease progression if feasible. Patients may remain on treatment as long as they are deriving clinical benefit, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>

&#xD;
          -  At least 1 measurable lesion - either per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or for patients with&#xD;

             measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received prior immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody,&#xD;
             if participant was deemed eligible (i.e., was not immunosuppressed or a transplant&#xD;
             receipt, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppressed participant including those with concurrent autoimmune diseases and&#xD;
             solid organ transplant recipients are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with brain metastases are permitted assuming that the brain metastases&#xD;
             have been adequately treated with prior surgery or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In participants with known liver cirrhosis, those with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with mixed histologies (eg, sarcomatoid, adenosquamous) will generally&#xD;
             not be eligible, unless the predominant histology is invasive cuSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
             (in the opinion of the treating physician) does not have the potential to interfere&#xD;
             with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for&#xD;
             this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection are eligible&#xD;
             providing they are on effective anti-retroviral therapy and have undetectable viral&#xD;
             load at their most recent viral load test and within 90 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
             Participants with a known history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been&#xD;
             treated and cured. Participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment must&#xD;
             have an undetectable HCV viral load prior to randomization.&#xD;
