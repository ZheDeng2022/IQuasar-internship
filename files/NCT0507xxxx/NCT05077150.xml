  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii is responsible for pneumocystosis (PcP), a life threatening&#xD;
      pneumonia in patients undergoing HSCT. The spontaneous attack rate of 16% within the first 6&#xD;
      months following allogeneic HSCT reported in the 1980's has considerably decreased with&#xD;
      prophylaxis. However, PcP still remains a concern in the transplant ward with an incidence&#xD;
      rate up to 2.5% in allo- and 1.4% in autologous HSCT but up to 7.2% on low dose of Dapsone.&#xD;
      The mortality of PcP is especially high in HSCT recipients. One of the main factors of PcP&#xD;
      after HSCT seems to be either the lack of TMP-SMX prophylaxis (all the other prophylactic&#xD;
      drugs being inferior to TMP-SMX), or poor compliance to prophylaxis. Due to the rarity of the&#xD;
      disease after HSCT, it is impossible to study it in monocenter studies, except on very long&#xD;
      periods of time which may not reflect current practice. Several questions deserve&#xD;
      investigations in a multicenter study, about timing, risk factors, and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, some European laboratories involved in the diagnosis of PcP have already given up&#xD;
      to classical diagnostic methods and switched to qPCR. This implies that lower fungal burden&#xD;
      can be detected and the clinical pertinence of such a diagnostic strategy deserves to be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

      Definition of PcP cases: any allogeneic HSCT recipient who, during the 1-year study period,&#xD;
      underwent a BAL from the day of transplant, and whose BAL fluid was positive for PcP: either&#xD;
      by qPCR alone, or positive cytology or IF, irrespectively of clinical presentation, imaging,&#xD;
      co-infection and PcP treatment. Only first episode of PcP will be included (incident cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of standardization, qPCR on sputum only will not be taken in account for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of PcP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria of the PcP cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic HSCT within the previous 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New case (first onset) of PcP documented in a BAL fluid, whatever the positive&#xD;
           diagnostic test (cytology or IF or PCR) and whatever the presentation and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre or post-transplant signed informed consent to enter the data in the EBMT registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria of the PcP cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic HSCT recipient transplanted more than 24 months at time of the onset of PcP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second episode of PcP since allogeneic HSCT (patients who had experienced PcP before the&#xD;
           allogeneic HSCT are not excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre prospective case-control study performed in volunteer EBMT centers on a&#xD;
      prospective 12 months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For each recruiting center, the technic of qPCR will be collected, and the participation&#xD;
           in an external quality control will be proposed to the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A specific Med C will be created to collect the data of the PcP cases, and one other&#xD;
           MedC for the controls. The Med C for the PcP cases will include: date of PcP diagnosis&#xD;
           (first positive laboratory result), direct and indirect diagnostic procedures for PcP&#xD;
           diagnosis (type of respiratory sample, technics used for the diagnosis,&#xD;
           positivity/negativity of each of them, clinical presentation (including severity&#xD;
           criteria, ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation,), imaging, CMV and other infections,&#xD;
           immune status: neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocyte counts, CD4 counts,&#xD;
           hypogammaglobulinemia (when available), clinical characteristics at PcP diagnosis&#xD;
           (especially GVHD status, status of underlying disease), previous PcP prophylaxis (drug,&#xD;
           dose/rhythm, dates), pulmonary and non-pulmonary co-infections within 7 days of the PcP&#xD;
           diagnosis, anti-PcP treatment (yes/no, drug(s), doses, dates), outcome at 30 and 90 days&#xD;
           of PcP diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each participating center will be asked to immediately declare their cases of PcP&#xD;
           diagnosed in HSCT recipients within 7 days from diagnosis, to the PI of the study and&#xD;
           the IDWP data manager with a specific, short registration form. To avoid selection bias,&#xD;
           the declaration of the cases must be consecutive and exhaustive during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The IDWP data office will contact the local investigator and data manager for filling&#xD;
           the MedC within the 90 days after the initial declaration of the case, and will propose&#xD;
           to the center 2 controls for one PcP case, matched on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Center&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patient transplanted at the same time 4 months as the index case&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Underlying disease (non malignant disease or lymphoproliferative disorder or acute&#xD;
                leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disorder or other).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. No PcP since transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The data office will send a Med C form for each proposed control. This Med C form will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. give a date of inclusion for each control, calculated at the same delay from&#xD;
                transplant that the delay between transplant and PcP of the corresponding case.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. ask the investigator to confirm that at the date of inclusion, the control had not&#xD;
                developed PcP&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Additional data will be asked to the centers for the 2 controls on a specific Med C&#xD;
           form, including immunesuppressors, PcP prophylaxis, CMV and other infection, and&#xD;
           gammaglobulin serum levels, blood lymphocyte counts, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD4&#xD;
           when available. Knowing this is a non-interventional study, no additional visits or&#xD;
           laboratory tests will be performed for the study. Only the available data will be&#xD;
           collected. It will be asked to the centers to collect the clinical and biological data&#xD;
           within +/- 14 days of the date of inclusion, choosing the closest date of the inclusion&#xD;
           date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. In order to assess the pre-transplant risk factors for PcP: the pretransplant&#xD;
           characteristics of the PcP patients will be compared to the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. In order to assess the post-transplant risk factors for PcP: the post-transplant&#xD;
           characteristics of the PcP patients at time of diagnosis will be compared to the&#xD;
           controls at the same time of transplant.&#xD;
