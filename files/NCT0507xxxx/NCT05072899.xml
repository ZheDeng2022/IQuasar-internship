      This study was prospective randomized comparative trial on patients with chronic shoulder&#xD;
      pain presented at outpatient Clinic of Physical Medicine, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Department at Assiut University Hospitals from June 2019 to December 2020. Our study started&#xD;
      by 70 patient with chronic shoulder pain 20 of them were missed in follow up period, the&#xD;
      range of age from 36 - 56 years, history, clinical examination, Laboratory investigation, and&#xD;
      imaging (X-ray or MRI) done for all patient to complete the diagnosis, patient divided&#xD;
      randomly into two groups, Group (A) included 25 patients were treated by PRP injection and&#xD;
      group (B) included 25 patients were treated by HA injection, both injections were performed&#xD;
      under ultrasound (US) guidance. Randomization by sealed envelopes technique, the follow up&#xD;
      was at the baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months post injection.&#xD;

    <description>This scoring system combines physical examination tests with subjective evaluations by the patients. The subjective assessment consists of 35 points and the remaining 65 points are assigned for the physical examination assessment. The subjective assessment includes a single item for pain (15 points) and 4 items for activities of daily living (20 points) (work 4, sport 4, sleep2 and positioning the hand in space 10 points). The objective assessment includes: range of motion (40 points) (forward elevation, 10 points; lateral elevation, 10 points; internal rotation, 10 points; external rotation, 10 points) and power (25 points) (scoring based on the number of pounds of pull the patient can resist in abduction to a maximum of 25 points). The total possible score is therefore 100 points.</description>

    <time_frame>4weeks post injection follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>is a self-introduction administered index designed to measure the effects of different pathologic conditions on the functional status of the shoulder. All items are rated by using a visual analogue scale from &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;no difficulty&quot; to &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; or &quot;so difficult it required help&quot;. A numerical value was obtained by dividing the scale into 11 segments from 0 to 10 for each item</description>
