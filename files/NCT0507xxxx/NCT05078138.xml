  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative hematological adaptations due to prolonged periods of strenuous physical activity&#xD;
      may, in part, contribute to declines in physical performance during military operations.&#xD;
      Exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) is a potential intervention that may be used to maintain&#xD;
      hemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and physical performance during periods of high physical&#xD;
      activity. The objective of the current study is to determine the ability of EPO to maintain&#xD;
      hgb, Hct, and physical performance compared to a matched placebo (PLA; saline). Additionally,&#xD;
      EPO may result in non-hematological adaptations which increase mitochondria biogenesis and&#xD;
      alter substrate oxidation. As such, this study will also assess the influence of EPO on&#xD;
      whole-body and skeletal muscle substrate oxidation compared to PLA. Twenty four healthy&#xD;
      physically active individuals will be recruited to participate in this randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial. After exercise practice sessions, volunteers will complete baseline&#xD;
      physical performance (time trial) and substrate oxidation testing. Participants will then&#xD;
      receive an EPO or PLA injections 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Diet and exercise will be&#xD;
      controlled during the injection period. Participants will undergo four weeks of an intense&#xD;
      physical training exercise program. Every seventh day during the injection period a safety&#xD;
      blood sample, assessing hematocrit, will be drawn, and participants will complete a 5 km time&#xD;
      trial to determine the time course of changes in physical performance can be detected. After&#xD;
      the 4 week EPO or PLA injections volunteers will complete the same physical performance and&#xD;
      substrate oxidation testing. Substrate oxidation will be assessed during 90-min steady-state&#xD;
      load carriage (30% body mass) exercise on a treadmill at 55 ± 5% of VO2peak. 6-6-[2H2]&#xD;
      glucose tracer technique and indirect calorimetry will be used measure substrate oxidation.&#xD;
      Muscle biopsies will be performed to measure muscle glycogen, enzyme activity, and molecular&#xD;
      markers of metabolism and inflammation before, and immediately and 3-hrs post exercise.&#xD;
      Multiple blood samples will be collected throughout the study to determine alterations in&#xD;
      hemoglobin, hematocrit, and markers of substrate metabolism, and inflammation. All study&#xD;
      procedures will occur at USARIEM. The primary risks associated with this study include those&#xD;
      associated with EPO injection, exercise, blood draws, and muscle biopsies.&#xD;

      Healthy physically active individuals will be recruited to participate in this randomized&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial. A random number generator will be used to randomize volunteers to&#xD;
      ensure equitable randomization of participants is utilized. After baseline assessments of&#xD;
      body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), VO2peak and exercise familiarization;&#xD;
      volunteers will complete physical performance and substrate oxidation testing. Physical&#xD;
      performance will be assessed using a 5 km time trial. Substrate oxidation will be assessed by&#xD;
      volunteers performing 90-min of steady-state load carriage (30% body mass) exercise on a&#xD;
      treadmill at 55 ± 5% of their VO2peak. 6-6-[2H2] glucose will be used as a tracer to assess&#xD;
      glucose turnover. Indirect calorimetry will be used to determine carbohydrate and fat&#xD;
      oxidation. Muscle biopsies will be performed to measure muscle glycogen, enzyme activity, and&#xD;
      molecular markers of substrate metabolism before, immediately after, and 3-hrs post exercise.&#xD;
      Multiple blood samples will be collected on substrate oxidation protocol days. To minimize&#xD;
      carry over effects of muscle biopsies on subsequent exercise performance, volunteers will not&#xD;
      exercise for 3 days. During the first two days of this period, volunteers will undergo carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (CO) rebreathing to measure Hgb mass and blood volume. Volunteers will then receive&#xD;
      EPO or PLA injections 3 times a week for 4 weeks. During the injection period all volunteers&#xD;
      will have safety blood draws to assess Hct once a week. Volunteers will also complete a&#xD;
      physical performance test once a week to determine time course change in performance with EPO&#xD;
      or PLA injections. Exercise training will be controlled during the injection phase,&#xD;
      consisting of a combination of endurance- and resistance-type exercise. All exercise will be&#xD;
      metabolically matched between groups. During the final week of the injection phase body&#xD;
      composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and VO2peak will be reassessed. At the end of the&#xD;
      4-week injection phase volunteers will complete a final physical performance test and&#xD;
      substrate oxidation protocol, followed by two CO rebreathing tests on subsequent days. All&#xD;
      food and beverages (except water) will be provided to volunteers beginning at the pre&#xD;
      injection physical performance and substrate oxidation through the duration of the study. All&#xD;
      data collection will occur at USARIEM.&#xD;
