  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation is a pilot feasibility study that aims to compare a physical&#xD;
      exercise intervention in a face-to-face context (considered state of the art) with a physical&#xD;
      exercise intervention in a distance context (online), both supervised, in women, of legal&#xD;
      age, physically inactive, breast cancer survivors after primary treatment with curative&#xD;
      intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention these women will have a physical and functional assessment,&#xD;
      as well as a pre-trial cardiopulmonary exercise test, to check if there are safety conditions&#xD;
      to participate and also to self tailor the exercise prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prescription follows the ACSM´s exercise guidelines for cancer survivors and will&#xD;
      comprise a 8 week combined exercise training, 3 times per week, in which two of them will be&#xD;
      supervised and the third session of the week (cardio session) won´t.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chat´s and weekly personal messages, as well as education, will be used to promote retention&#xD;
      and exercise adherence.&#xD;

    <description>Before the intervention, these women will undergo an evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness, functional fitness, psychological status and a physiatry assessment. A consent form is signed before the start.&#xD;
The physical exercise intervention was planned based on the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine for cancer survivors (ACSM 2019), with two supervised combined training sessions (mobility, aerobic training, strength and flexibility training) planned, and one unsupervised aerobic training session per week, interspersed with at least one rest day in between, for 8 weeks. The intensity will be individualized and defined based on the initial assessment. The structure of the training plan was based on the FITT-VP principles (frequency, intensity, time, type, volume and progression) recommended by the ACSM (2019).</description>
