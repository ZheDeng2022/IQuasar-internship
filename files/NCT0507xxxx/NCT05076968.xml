  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation of the edentulous patients has always been a challenge. The success of this&#xD;
      treatment modality is not only affected by the patients' acceptance of his new dentures, but&#xD;
      on his ability to use them which depends to a great extent on the quality of those dentures.&#xD;
      It is strongly believed that the success of dental treatments is affected by the experience&#xD;
      of a dentist. The aim of this study was to compare patient satisfaction with complete&#xD;
      dentures provided by forth and fifth year dental students and prosthodontists at the&#xD;
      University of Jordan Hospital one week and 8 weeks post insertion&#xD;

      After obtaining the ethical approval, questionnaires were distributed to a total of 60&#xD;
      patients who accepted to participate in this study. The 60 patients consisted of 2 groups.&#xD;
      The first group included patients treated by fourth and fifth year students, the second group&#xD;
      consisted of patients treated by prosthodontists with a minimum of 5 years of experience. The&#xD;
      questionnaire was distributed to those patients 8 weeks post insertion of complete upper and&#xD;
      lower dentures. The questionnaire was divided into 3 parts. the first part included&#xD;
      demographic and contact information questions for the patient. The second part included&#xD;
      examination to the upper and lower dental arches and a third part included questions that&#xD;
      probed the patient's satisfaction with his upper and lower dentures in general. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the questionnaire included questions about the patient's comfort with his dentures, whether&#xD;
      he is satisfied with the esthetics, phonetics, retention, efficiency in mastication, and ease&#xD;
      of cleaning. This part of the survey was adapted from the Oral Health Impact Profile&#xD;
      (OHIP-EDENT) questionnaire.&#xD;
