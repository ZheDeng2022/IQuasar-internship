  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting where individuals consume ad&#xD;
      libitum energy intake within a set window of time, commonly 8 hours, which induces a fasting&#xD;
      window of 16 hours per day (i.e., 16:8 TRE). TRE could be an effective addition to cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation as it has demonstrated cardiovascular health benefits and potential for&#xD;
      synergy when combined with exercise training. This study will be a two site (Toronto&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Institute and Toronto Western Hospital), 2-arm, parallel group, randomized&#xD;
      feasibility trial of cardiac rehabilitation alone or cardiac rehabilitation plus 16:8 TRE.&#xD;
      Men and women who are referred through the standard clinical pathways and eligible for either&#xD;
      outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program for coronary artery disease and are willing to&#xD;
      accept random assignment and complete the study assessments will be enrolled. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive the standard, multi-dimensional cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of&#xD;
      physician-directed risk factor management, an individualized exercise prescription, and&#xD;
      virtual education. All participants will receive an assessment with a registered dietitian&#xD;
      and individualized recommendations for a heart healthy diet. During the consultation with the&#xD;
      registered dietitian, the TRE group participants will also be counselled to restrict their&#xD;
      eating to between 11 am and 7 pm and consume no calories outside of those hours during the&#xD;
      program starting the evening of the consultation. The primary outcome is feasibility measured&#xD;
      by daily adherence to the 16-hour fast which will be tracked with two daily text messages for&#xD;
      the 16 weeks of the cardiac rehabilitation program. The safety outcomes that will be compared&#xD;
      between groups include re-hospitalization, death, angina, and nutritional impact symptoms.&#xD;
      Before randomization and after completion of the program the following preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed: 1) VO2peak; 2) total body and truncal fat, lean mass; 3) metabolic&#xD;
      markers: fasted glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure and waist circumference. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that cardiac rehabilitation and TRE will be feasible, safe, and&#xD;
      provide added cardiovascular health benefits compared to cardiac rehabilitation alone.&#xD;
