    <textblock>
      Within the MobiStaR project the adaptation of procedures in an intensive care unit combined&#xD;
      with the use of this robotic system will create the conditions to increase the mobilization&#xD;
      rate of critically ill intensive care patients significantly, possibly thereby increasing the&#xD;
      rehabilitation outcomes for these patients and developing a new standard of care for&#xD;
      robot-assisted early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention study will assess the organizational feasibility of robot-assisted early&#xD;
      mobilization (starting in the first 72 hours after admission to the ICU), the behavior and&#xD;
      experience of the mobilizing professionals and the effects on patient outcomes in terms of&#xD;
      ventilation time, muscle mass (sonographic examination) and physical activity (measured by&#xD;
      established scores such as Functional Status Score for ICU (FSS-ICU) and Medical Research&#xD;
      Council (MRC) classification).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early mobilization means the mobilization of critically ill patients in the early course&#xD;
      after admission to the intensive care unit. The positive influence of early mobilization of&#xD;
      critically ill patients on various aspects of patient outcomes has already been demonstrated.&#xD;
      However, the implementation of early mobilization in clinical practice is difficult.&#xD;
      Especially the high personnel effort is a barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Munich-based company Reactive Robotics (RR) is currently developing the world's first&#xD;
      adaptive robotic assistance system VEMO©, which has CE approval for the planned indication&#xD;
      and is to be used in the medium term for mobilizing intensive care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the MobiStaR project, the adaptation of procedures in an intensive care unit combined&#xD;
      with the use of this robotic system will create the conditions to significantly increase the&#xD;
      mobilization rate of critically ill intensive care patients, possibly thereby increasing the&#xD;
      rehabilitation results for these patients and developing a new standard of care for&#xD;
      robot-assisted early mobilization. In this project, the robotic system will be used in&#xD;
      anesthesiology intensive care units of the Ludwigs-Maximilians-University hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study, the effects of robot-assisted early mobilization will now be evaluated.&#xD;
      This study comprises three study arms, in which (1) the feasibility and practicability of&#xD;
      robot-assisted early mobilization, (2) the behavior and experience of the mobilizing&#xD;
      professionals, and (3) the effect on patient outcomes will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is monocentric, prospective, interventional, does not include invasive procedures&#xD;
      or blood sampling and has multiple data collection time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The feasibility of robot-assisted early mobilization surveys concomitantly how many VEM&#xD;
           therapies can be implemented in how many patients as well as if and which adverse events&#xD;
           occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The behavior and experience of the mobilizing professionals will be evaluated by using&#xD;
           episodic interviews and standardized observations. Nurses with advanced training in&#xD;
           anesthesia and intensive care, nurses and physiotherapists who have at least three years&#xD;
           of professional experience in an intensive care unit as well as medical specialists with&#xD;
           completed specialist training or a leading position in the intensive care unit will be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effects on patient outcomes, primarily ventilation duration, muscle mass&#xD;
           (sonographic examination) and physical activity (measured by established scores such as&#xD;
           FSS-ICU and MRC classification), will be measured at different time points and compared&#xD;
           with a historical patient population. Secondary factors such as delirium incidence,&#xD;
           hemodynamic parameters, respiratory parameters but also longitudinal parameters such as&#xD;
           ICU and hospital length of stay will be analyzed from routine data/patient records.&#xD;
           Informed consenting patients undergoing a planned surgical procedure that is&#xD;
           postoperatively associated with intensive care treatment and an anticipated duration of&#xD;
           ventilation of more than 48 hours will be included. These patients will receive&#xD;
           standardized early mobilization using the robotic system at either ten frequencies or&#xD;
           for seven days. No invasive procedures such as blood sampling will be performed as part&#xD;
           of the study. Outcomes will be compared with a historical comparison group to evaluate&#xD;
           the effect of robot-assisted VEM (very early mobilization). Approximately 30 patients&#xD;
           will be included. The outcomes will be compared with those of a historical group (n=30)&#xD;
           treated with conventional early mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is planned for a duration of five to six months starting in September 2021.&#xD;

These examinations should be performed on day -1 (preoperatively), on postoperative days 1,2,3, then once a week if the patient remains in the ICU, on day 28, on the day of discharge from the ICU, and on a follow-up examination approximately 3 months after discharge from the ICU.The follow-up examination should only take place if the patients present themselves at the hospital anyway due to medically indicated follow-up examinations (not study-related).
