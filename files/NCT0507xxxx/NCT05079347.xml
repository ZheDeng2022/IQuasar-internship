  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot test of a program aimed at training&#xD;
      traditional healers to conduct HIV testing and implementing HIV testing among people living&#xD;
      in Bushbuckridge, South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Healer-initiated HIV testing uptake and linkage to prevention services. Trust in&#xD;
      allopathic health care and HIV stigma will be measured among participants at study enrollment&#xD;
      and at month seven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Healer-initiated HIV counseling and testing (HICT) will increase trust in&#xD;
      allopathic health care and reduce HIV stigma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional healers see patients who avoid allopathic health services, including those who&#xD;
      refuse HIV testing. Patients report a general preference for traditional healers, given their&#xD;
      fluency in local language, the length of time they spend with patients, the respect they show&#xD;
      patients, the cultural congruity to their diagnosis, and their proximity to the patients.&#xD;
      Reports of poor treatment by health care providers are common in SSA, often resulting in&#xD;
      patients refusing or delaying allopathic health services and/or seeking alternative health&#xD;
      services. Men, immigrants, and those with low SES most frequently report poor treatment at&#xD;
      the health facility or report that the health system is not designed for their needs. People&#xD;
      who first visit a traditional healer for HIV-associated symptoms before seeking an HIV test&#xD;
      are delayed 2.4 times longer in seeking health services than those who do not. Among patients&#xD;
      enrolled in HIV care and treatment, a preference for traditional medicine impacts their&#xD;
      treatment decisions: patients who report use of both traditional and allopathic services are&#xD;
      45% less likely to enroll in antiretroviral therapy (ART) services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healers are respected members of their communities, play an integral role as informal&#xD;
      referral agents to the South African health system, and act as supportive providers to&#xD;
      patients living with chronic disease, if effectively engaged. In rural South Africa,&#xD;
      traditional healers provide physical and psychological services to &gt;80% of the population.&#xD;
      There are more than 200,000 traditional healers in South Africa, but only 46,000 registered&#xD;
      physicians (&gt; 20:1 ratio) who provide services for a myriad of disease conditions, including&#xD;
      HIV, TB, malaria, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and depression. Given the level of trust in the&#xD;
      community and the numbers of healers, partnerships may facilitate diagnosis and linkage to&#xD;
      care via the creation of unique testing locations. It is up to researchers and health care&#xD;
      providers to overcome our own biases and/or prejudices against this workforce to develop an&#xD;
      effective strategy to increase testing uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional healers can bridge the testing gap between &quot;non-testers&quot; and the allopathic&#xD;
      health system. Traditional healers have been successfully engaged in health systems to&#xD;
      promote care linkage among people living with diabetes, TB, HIV, malaria, and mental illness-&#xD;
      many of whom initially did not believe in their allopathic diagnosis until a healer convinced&#xD;
      them that their condition was not caused by a curse. Those who are hesitant to test need a&#xD;
      trusted and culturally concordant provider (traditional healer) to both vouch for and deliver&#xD;
      the HIV test, and the same provider to create a bridge to the allopathic health facility,&#xD;
      providing a metaphorical &quot;safe space&quot; for the patient while they transition to HIV care.&#xD;
      Traditional healers are strongly motivated to play this role for two reasons: (1) Better&#xD;
      patient health outcomes are strongly correlated with perceived quality of traditional healer&#xD;
      care. Healers do not want to be associated with high levels of morbidity or mortality, as it&#xD;
      is bad for business; and (2) Healers are excited at expanding their public health services.&#xD;
      As allopathic medical knowledge is disseminated, healer views on disease causation are&#xD;
      expanding to include the germ theory of disease. Patients are open to this partnership, given&#xD;
      their inclination to ping-pong between the two systems depending on their needs.&#xD;
