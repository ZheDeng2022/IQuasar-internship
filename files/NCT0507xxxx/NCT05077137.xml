      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of administering the&#xD;
      Tetanus Diptheria Vaccine (Td) or Polio Boost Immunization (IPOL) to patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma who are receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO) therapy per standard of care.&#xD;
      Subjects will have the vaccine at cycle 4 of IO therapy and will have research blood and&#xD;
      tissue samples collected prior to starting IO therapy, at cycle 4 prior to vaccine&#xD;
      administration, and at 12-17 days post vaccine.&#xD;

             participate, in the opinion of the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
