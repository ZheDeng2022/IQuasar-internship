      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an immune system disease. People with SCN do not have&#xD;
      enough of a kind of white blood cell called neutrophils. This means they get sick easily from&#xD;
      infections. Some drugs to treat SCN have lots of side effects. Researchers want to see if a&#xD;
      the drug empagliflozin can help increase the number of neutrophils in a person with SCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a drug called empagliflozin can help people with SCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults aged 18 and older with SCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests. They&#xD;
      may have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits and local lab visits. They will repeat the screening&#xD;
      tests. They will have heart and lung function tests. They will have an ultrasound of the&#xD;
      liver and spleen. Their skin symptoms will be photographed. They may have consultations with&#xD;
      specialists. They may give a stool sample. They may have an optional colonoscopy with tissue&#xD;
      sample collection. They may have an optional bone marrow biopsy and aspirate. They may have&#xD;
      an optional magnetic resonance imaging scan of their heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to NIH for 5 7 days. They will start taking the study drug as a&#xD;
      pill once daily. They will be monitored for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug at home for 12 months. They will use a fingerstick&#xD;
      blood glucose meter to measure blood sugar at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be able to take the study drug through their local doctor after the study&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 15 months....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One symptom of G6PC3 deficiency is recurrent infections resulting from severe congenital&#xD;
      neutropenia (SCN). Data suggest that SCN is the result of accumulation of the toxic dietary&#xD;
      metabolite 1,5 anhydroglucitol 6 phosphate (1,5-AG6P) in leukocytes. This buildup inhibits&#xD;
      glycolytic metabolism, thus impairing their function. Increasing urinary glucose excretion&#xD;
      results in the urinary excretion of the precursor to 1,5-AG6P, and will likely reduce levels&#xD;
      of 1,5-AG6P in leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase 1 open-label study, we will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      the sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with G6PC3&#xD;
      deficiency. Empagliflozin is FDA approved in doses of 10 or 25 mg daily for treatment of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes in adults. Eligible participants (n=5) aged &gt;=18 years will be on a 2-month daily&#xD;
      regimen of 10 mg of oral empagliflozin (phase A). Participants may then be increased to 25 mg&#xD;
      daily (phase B) if the participant fails to achieve an adequate improvement in neutropenia&#xD;
      during phase A and is able to tolerate the higher dose, or alternatively may continue on the&#xD;
      10-mg dose. Participants will temporarily discontinue any current granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) regimen starting at least 7 days before the empagliflozin&#xD;
      regimen begins, to remove or reduce the effects of concomitant G-CSF so the baseline ANC can&#xD;
      be evaluated without confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase A, participants will have blood drawn locally every two weeks for clinical lab&#xD;
      evaluations (including ANC). A member of the study team will also contact the participant for&#xD;
      remote AE assessment at each blood draw. During phase B, blood draws and remote AE&#xD;
      assessments will be monthly for the first 4 months, and bimonthly for the last 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will have outpatient study visits at the NIH Clinical Center at the end of phase&#xD;
      A (month 2), and at months 6 and 12 during phase B.&#xD;

    <description>This is an open-label pilot study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of empagliflozin as a treatment for severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) in patients with glucose-6-phosphatase 3 (G6PC3) deficiency. Participants will be on a 12-month daily regimen of empagliflozin at a starting dose of 10 mg (phase A), which may be increased after 2 months to 25 mg (phase B). Evaluate the safety and efficacy of the biomarker response (the change in absolute neutrophil count [ANC] after one year of empagliflozin treatment relative to baseline ANC prior to drug treatment) in patients with G6PC3 deficiency.</description>
