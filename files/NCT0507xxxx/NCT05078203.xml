  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis is that, while both groups will benefit from the exercise session,&#xD;
      participants with obesity will exhibit greater gains in cognitive control, relative to&#xD;
      healthy weight adults. Additionally, we anticipate that the benefits of the single bout of&#xD;
      exercise for cognitive control will be mediated by changes in exercise-induced myokines.&#xD;
      These hypotheses will be tested by accomplishing three aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Elucidate the changes in cognitive control following an acute bout of exercise,&#xD;
      relative to a sedentary condition, in persons with and without obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the effect of a single bout of exercise, relative to a sedentary condition,&#xD;
      on myokines known to have neuroprotective effects i.e., BDNF and CTSB in both healthy weight&#xD;
      and individuals with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To link changes in exercise-induced myokines (i.e., BDNF and CTSB) to changes in&#xD;
      cognitive function, following a single bout of exercise.&#xD;

      18 adults with healthy weight (BMI 18.5-25.0kg/m2) and 18 adults with obesity (BMI 30.0kg/m2)&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a counter-balanced crossover trial. After initial baseline testing,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete either an acute exercise bout or sedentary control&#xD;
      session in a counter-balanced order. A cognitive testing battery accompanied by an&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) will be administered following each session. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected prior to, during, and following each throughout each testing condition.&#xD;
