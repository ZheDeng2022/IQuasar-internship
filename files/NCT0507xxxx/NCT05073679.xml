  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral naltrexone tablets in&#xD;
      pediatric and adolescent eating disorders, in particular anorexia nervosa and bulimia&#xD;
      nervosa, as compared to placebo. Study participants will be patients in a partial&#xD;
      hospitalization program or intensive outpatient program for eating disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects participating in this study will receive routine care for eating disorder at a&#xD;
      partial hospitalization (PHP) level of care at MSHMC. In PHP, all patients have weekly&#xD;
      medical screening visits for the duration of their time in care, as well as weekly individual&#xD;
      therapy sessions, individual dietician sessions, and psychiatry appointments. They have&#xD;
      supervised meals and numerous group therapy sessions. Every three weeks, patients in PHP&#xD;
      complete a battery of mood and eating disorder indices including those evaluated in this&#xD;
      study; participants in this study will complete an additional two surveys with this routine&#xD;
      battery. Participants in this study will have no alterations in their routine eating disorder&#xD;
      care outside of study article use and these additional surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled at their first visit for eating disorder programming at child or&#xD;
      adult partial hospitalization (PHP) programming at MSHMC adolescent medicine eating disorders&#xD;
      clinic. Informed consent/assent will be obtained as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be provided with oral naltrexone or placebo weekly from the MSHMC research&#xD;
      pharmacy. Subjects will be given one weeks' worth of medication at a time. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized at enrollment to receive either study drug (naltrexone) or placebo. Participants&#xD;
      or parents of minor participants will be provided study drug or placebo following completion&#xD;
      of urine drug screen and consent/assent. Patients will take the medication daily while they&#xD;
      are in programming; after completion of programming or withdrawal from the study they will no&#xD;
      longer be given study medication. For subjects who are enrolled in child PHP and who eat&#xD;
      meals with parents, the families may choose to administer study drug during meals at&#xD;
      programming. For adult patients enrolled in adult programming, subjects may choose to&#xD;
      self-administer the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On their first contact with PHP, all patients in Child PHP complete various eating disorder&#xD;
      indices as a part of routine care, including the ED-15, EDE-Q, RMCAS, and CDI. This battery&#xD;
      of indices is repeated every 3 weeks while a patient is in programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who are enrolled in this study, they will complete their routine indices, in&#xD;
      addition they will also complete the BIS/BAS and the ABUSI at enrollment and at weeks 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 9 while in programming. Participants will receive routine eating disorder care while in&#xD;
      PHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Adult PHP typically complete a different inventory every three weeks. If a&#xD;
      patient choses to participate in this study they will be asked to complete the same five&#xD;
      surveys as participants in Child PHP, and they will receive the same amount and type of&#xD;
      compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after enrollment, subjects will be sent copies of ED-15, EDE-Q, RMCAS, CDI,&#xD;
      BIS/BAS, and ABUSI indices either in an in-person medical appointment or via RedCap to&#xD;
      complete. If the patient returns for medical follow-up between 5 and 7 months after&#xD;
      enrollment, their height, weight, and body mass index will also be recorded to determine if&#xD;
      weight restoration was maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At initial contact with the eating disorders clinic, all patients receive an initial battery&#xD;
      of laboratory tests as a part of the standard of care for eating disorder. These tests&#xD;
      include liver function assays and transaminase levels.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The Penn State Health IDS pharmacy will purchase Naltrexone 50mg tablets from a pharmaceutical wholesaler. The IDS pharmacy will purchase gelatin capsules and USP grade methylcellulose from a pharmacy supplier to be used for compounding the active and placebo capsules. For the active Naltrexone 50mg capsules, a Naltrexone 50mg tablet will be placed in an empty gelatin capsule with methylcellulose filler. The placebo capsules will be empty gelatin capsules filled with Methylcellulose.&#xD;

&#xD;
        The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low&#xD;
        body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.&#xD;
        Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for&#xD;
        children and adolescents, less than minimally expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that&#xD;
        interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue&#xD;
        influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of&#xD;
        the seriousness of the current low body weight D. During the last three months the&#xD;
        individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behaviour (i.e.&#xD;
        self-induced vomiting, or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).19 E. A diagnosis&#xD;
        of atypical anorexia nervosa can be made when the body weight is normal or high If these&#xD;
        patients engage in bingeing or purging behaviors as defined in anorexia nervosa,&#xD;
        binge-purge subtype, they are eligible for inclusion in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        The diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. both:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Eating in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2 hour period), an amount of food&#xD;
        that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time&#xD;
        under similar circumstances; ii. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episodes&#xD;
        (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as&#xD;
        self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or&#xD;
        excessive exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at&#xD;
        least once a week for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. F. The disturbance does&#xD;
        not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • The diagnostic criteria for purging disorder are: recurrent purging behavior to influence&#xD;
        weight or shape (e.g. self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other&#xD;
        medications) in the absence of binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
