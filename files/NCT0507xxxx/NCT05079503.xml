  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multimodality strategy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or total neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      (TNT) followed by surgery, has been widely used to improve local control and overall survival&#xD;
      in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). TNT is a recently promising strategy incorporating&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy following short-course radiotherapy before surgery in LARC, and showed&#xD;
      superior rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) compared with the concurrent CRT&#xD;
      followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (CRT-A). However, issues regarding neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy-related toxicity as well as disease progression during TNT have been raised, which&#xD;
      need to identify biomarkers for prediction of treatment responses and safety in patients with&#xD;
      LARC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiomes interact with tumor microenvironment and are&#xD;
      related with inflammation and immunomodulation. The association between gut microbiomes and&#xD;
      responses of chemotherapy or immunotherapy has been previously reported. The administration&#xD;
      of certain beneficial microbiome can be one of the strategies to treat gut dysbiosis in&#xD;
      cancer patients, restoring microbial diversity and changing the composition of microbiome.&#xD;
      GEN-001, Lactobacillus lactis is a live, purified facultative anaerobic gram-positive&#xD;
      probiotic lactic acid bacterial strain. The preclinical studies showed the potential&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of GEN-001 as an anti-cancer treatment through the activation of immune&#xD;
      cells, including CD4 or CD8 T-cells and natural killer cells, and synergistic effects with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin chemotherapy. Therefore, the investigators plan to investigate dynamics of gut&#xD;
      microbiomes and metabolites, and their effects on immune modulation. Additionally&#xD;
      investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNT with GEN-001 and identify&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers for pathologic response in patients with LARC.&#xD;
