  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare simulation training with conventional training (case-based&#xD;
      discussion only) to improve team performance in implementing one-hour sepsis bundle in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an experimental randomized single-blind study to examine the role of&#xD;
      simulation-based training in improving team performance in conducting sepsis management.&#xD;
      Subjects were sixteen doctors and twenty-four nurses working in the intensive care unit. The&#xD;
      subjects were randomly divided into two treatment groups: the discussion group and the&#xD;
      simulation group. Each treatment group was further divided into four small groups consisting&#xD;
      of two doctors and three nurses. Prior to the training, every subject received a pretest for&#xD;
      cognitive evaluation and a posttest at the end of the training. The performance of both&#xD;
      groups in implementing one-hour sepsis bundle was assessed by solving a sepsis case in high&#xD;
      fidelity manikin.&#xD;
