  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-interventional single-center cohort study (Rothschild Foundation Hospital) of patients&#xD;
      aged 0 to 18 years followed up in ophthalmology for KCV, treated with tacrolimus 0.1% eye&#xD;
      drops previously treated with ciclosporin 2% with treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective collection of quality of life from the parents and/or, if possible, the&#xD;
           children via the QUICK questionnaire and 6 additional questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospective collection of clinical data (secondary endpoints) from the patients'&#xD;
           medical records, aiming to compare the period before the start of treatment and the&#xD;
           period under treatment with TALYMUS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the response to TALYMUS® treatment in patients&#xD;
      with Vernal keratoconjunctivitis who have failed ciclosporin 2% therapy, whether due to lack&#xD;
      of efficacy, compliance difficulties or poor tolerance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic inflammatory eye disease affecting children&#xD;
      and adolescents. It is a disease of allergic origin which, if left untreated, can have a&#xD;
      significant impact on quality of life, daily activities and learning. In some cases, sequelae&#xD;
      of the disease or complications from the treatments used can lead to permanent vision&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of VKC include intense itching, tearing, mucous secretions, burning, foreign body&#xD;
      sensation and severe photophobia. Clinical signs include conjunctival and corneal involvement&#xD;
      -which may leave scarring opacities-and in the most severe stage, limbal insufficiency with&#xD;
      definitive corneal conjunctivalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus on the therapeutic strategy to adopt. Treatment is based on a&#xD;
      combination of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, and in case of failure on&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Cortico-resistant or cortico-dependent forms require treatment with local or&#xD;
      general immunosuppressants, because of the long-term ocular complications of corticosteroids.&#xD;
      These local immunosuppressants, belonging to the class of calcineurin inhibitors, have been&#xD;
      used in ophthalmology for many years in hospital preparations of ciclosporin eye drops. More&#xD;
      recently, commercial forms have appeared on the market: RESTASIS® (0.05% cyclosporine eye&#xD;
      drops), IKERVIS® and VERKAZIA® (0.1% cyclosporine eye drops), CICLOGRAFT® (2% cyclosporine&#xD;
      eye drops) and TALYMUS® (0.1% tacrolimus eye drops).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although TALYMUS® has French marketing authorization for VKC, its place in the therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy and its positioning in relation to the various cyclosporine eye drops is not clearly&#xD;
      established. Series have reported similar efficacy of TALYMUS® and 0.05% and 2% cyclosporine&#xD;
      in patients with KCV, at a lower dosage than those usually required for cyclosporine eye&#xD;
      drops (2 drops per day for TALYMUS® versus 3 to 4 drops per day for cyclosporine). Given the&#xD;
      difficulties of compliance in children, particularly in a school environment and in the&#xD;
      context of a chronic pathology, the possibility of a less frequent administration represents&#xD;
      a significant advantage. The simplicity of use and efficacy of TALYMUS® , as well as its&#xD;
      safety profile, which is comparable to that of cyclosporine eye drops, have led some authors&#xD;
      to recommend it as a first-line eye drop on a par with cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in numerous publications and in our experience, there are cases of failure of&#xD;
      treatment with cyclosporine eye drops, which have even led some authors to recommend for many&#xD;
      years only hospital preparations of cyclosporine at concentrations greater than or equal to&#xD;
      1%. It is therefore to be expected that cases of resistance to VERKAZIA® will appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study reported the efficacy of a 0.1% tacrolimus hospital preparation in patients who had&#xD;
      failed 1% cyclosporine therapy. However, the efficacy of TALYMUS® treatment in patients who&#xD;
      have failed ciclosporin 2% therapy has not been reported to date.&#xD;
