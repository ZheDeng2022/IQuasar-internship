  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endodontic treatment is performed frequently which often results in weakening of tooth&#xD;
      structure. Coronal restoration is done to restore these endodontically treated teeth. Posts&#xD;
      have been used to retain the coronal restoration and reinforce these teeth but unfortunately&#xD;
      posts placement results in further weakening of tooth structure. Newer contemporary core&#xD;
      buildup materials will be used to restore coronal part of tooth without using endodontic&#xD;
      posts and then the fracture resistance of these teeth will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed to evaluate the fracture resistance of endodontically treated&#xD;
      teeth restored with newer contemporary core buildup materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 recently extracted single rooted caries-free and unrestored premolars will be taken and&#xD;
      mounted in acrylic resin blocks. Roots of teeth will be covered with light bodies of&#xD;
      condensation silicone impression material to simulate periodontal ligaments. Class 1 and&#xD;
      class 2 cavities will be prepared and endodontic treatment will be performed in these teeth&#xD;
      specimens. Coronal restoration will be done with three core buildup materials (Cention-N,&#xD;
      Zirconomer and Aristaloy Amalgam). Teeth specimens are then divided into group 1 and group 2&#xD;
      (class 1 cavity preparation and class 2 cavity preparation respectively) and each group is&#xD;
      further divided into four subgroups: Subgroup A: Control group Subgroup B: Cavities restored&#xD;
      with Zirconomer (Shofu) Subgroup C: Cavities restored with Cention-N (Ivoclar vivodent)&#xD;
      Subgroup D: Cavities restored with Aristaloy Amalgam (Cookson) Fracture resistance of&#xD;
      endodontically treated teeth restored with different core buildup materials will be tested by&#xD;
      the Universal testing machine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 80 recently extracted single rooted lower second premolars, extracted for orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment, will be selected for this study. Because lower second premolars are commonly&#xD;
      extracted for orthodontic purposes and during mastication, the anatomic shape ofpremolars&#xD;
      create tendency for separation of cusps. Indenter contacts the tooth and acts as a wedge&#xD;
      between buccal and lingual cusps and decrease mean fracture resistance values. So the&#xD;
      application of force vertically on cusp inclines found to be appropriate to simulate&#xD;
      intraoral clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth will be washed under running water and any soft tissue attached to root surfaces will&#xD;
      be scraped off with hand scaler. Teeth disinfected with 0.1% thymol solution and will be&#xD;
      stored in 10% formalin solution for four days atleast, until they are used, teeth will be&#xD;
      stored in 0.9% saline solution at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of computer generated software, Teeth will be randomly divided into two groups.&#xD;
      Each group contains 40 teeth. Class 1 cavity preparation will be done in teeth of group 1&#xD;
      with straight fissure diamond bur (HiCare ISO. 109/010) in high speed handpiece (Nsk, Japan)&#xD;
      along with water coolant and cavity will be prepared on occlusal fissures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercuspal distance and mesio-distal dimension of teeth will be measured with digital&#xD;
      caliper. The buccolingual width of class 1 cavity will be one-third of the distance between&#xD;
      buccal and lingual cusps and mesiodistal width would be one-third of mesio-distal distance.&#xD;
      Buccal and lingual walls will be parallel to one other and cavo-surface angle of&#xD;
      approximately 90 degree will be prepared. Class 2 cavity will be prepared in teeth of group&#xD;
      2, in the same way as class 1 except that proximal box will also be prepared in class 2. The&#xD;
      width of occlusal isthmus will be the one-third of intercuspal distance and the buccolingual&#xD;
      dimension of approximal preparation will be the one-third of buccolingual dimension of&#xD;
      overall crown. Gingival extent of this approximal preparation will be 1mm coronal to&#xD;
      cemento-enamel junction and the gingival width would be of 2 +/- 0.2mm. Buccal and lingual&#xD;
      walls of occlusal preparation will be parallel to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class 1 and class 2 cavities are prepared because occlusal and proximal surfaces of teeth are&#xD;
      the main surfaces which are subjected to higher forces during mastication and these two&#xD;
      surfaces are more susceptible to caries attack and standard method for access opening is from&#xD;
      occlusal and proximal surface (if carious lesion involve proximal surface too).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access cavity for endodontics will be prepared with diamond round bur (HiCare ISO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      001/010). The working length will be taken by introducing the #10 K-file (Mani) in the canal&#xD;
      until it becomes visible from apical foramen, The working length will be determined by&#xD;
      subtracting 1mm from this estimated length. Endodontic procedure will be carried out in all&#xD;
      teeth specimens by using rotary Protaper files (Densply). Sequence of S1, S2 and then F1 and&#xD;
      F2 will be followed to prepare the canals at the working length. Canals will be irrigated&#xD;
      thoroughly after every file with 2.5% NaOCl solution. After cleaning and shaping, canals will&#xD;
      be dried with paper points and obturation will be done with sealer (Sealapex,&#xD;
      SybronEndo-Kerr, Glendora, CA, USA) and F2 gutta percha cone (Densply).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modeling wax will be melted and root of tooth will be dipped in it below cement-enamel&#xD;
      junction, this will produce a layer of 0.2 to 0.3 mm of wax on root surfaces. This thickness&#xD;
      of wax on root surfaces will be representative to the thickness of periodontal ligament.&#xD;
      Teeth will be placed in acrylic resin block of 3cmx 2.5cm such that 1.0 mm of root below&#xD;
      cement-enamel junction will be out of the block to simulate the biologic width. Wax will be&#xD;
      used as spacer between root and acrylic resin block and will be removed. Light body of&#xD;
      condensation silicone impression material will be mixed and poured into resin block. Teeth&#xD;
      will be reinserted into acrylic resin blocks with the silicone impression material, which&#xD;
      will simulate periodontal ligament. Since the PDL acts as an effective support during the&#xD;
      masticatory function and absorb and transmit forces between teeth and alveolar bone. So, to&#xD;
      produce the clinical situation and to provide a more accurate assessment of fracture&#xD;
      resistance of teeth, teeth are embedded in light body of condensation silicone impression&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, Each group will be randomly divided into four sub-groups. In each sub-group, there will&#xD;
      be 10 teeth specimens. To make identification of specimens, each group and sub-group will be&#xD;
      color coded. There will be one positive control group and one negative control group among&#xD;
      the four subgroups and rest 2 sub-groups will be restored with new contemporary core buildup&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 (Yellow color coded) Class 1 cavity preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      A (Blue color coded) negative control group: Normal teeth with no cavity preparation and no&#xD;
      endodontic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B (Pink color coded): teeth specimens in which endodontic procedure was performed and coronal&#xD;
      restoration was done with Zirconomer (Shofu) C (Green color coded) : teeth specimens in which&#xD;
      endodontic procedure was performed and coronal restoration was done with Cention-N (Ivovclar&#xD;
      vivodent) D (Black color coded) : teeth specimens in which endodontic procedure was performed&#xD;
      and coronal restoration was done with Aristaloy Amalgam (cookson)&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2 (Purple color coded) Class 2 cavity preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      A (Blue color coded) negative control group: Normal teeth with no cavity preparation and no&#xD;
      endodontic procedure B (Pink color coded): teeth specimens in which endodontic procedure was&#xD;
      performed and coronal restoration was done with Zirconomer (Shofu) by using tofflemire&#xD;
      retainer and matrix band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C (Green color coded) : teeth specimens in which endodontic procedure was performed and&#xD;
      coronal restoration was done with Cention-N (Ivovclar vivodent) by using tofflemire retainer&#xD;
      and matrix band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D (Black color coded) : teeth specimens in which endodontic procedure was performed and&#xD;
      coronal restoration was done with Aristaloy Amalgam (cookson) by using tofflemire retainer&#xD;
      and matrix band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each tooth specimen will be individually tested in the Universal testing machine (UTM,&#xD;
      INSTRON - 4301 Sr. # H1853, PCSIR Karachi). Tooth specimen will be placed in the holding slot&#xD;
      that will be attached to the lower part of testing machine. Rounded stainless steel probe of&#xD;
      diameter 6mm will be attached to the upper part of machine. Since, We are evaluating the&#xD;
      fracture resistance of tooth that whether the new contemporary material enhances the fracture&#xD;
      resisting ability of tooth, the probe will contact the inclined planes of facial and lingual&#xD;
      cusps of tooth beyond the margins of restoration. The force will start from 'zero' Newton and&#xD;
      then indenter will apply the increasing compressive loads to the inclined planes of buccal&#xD;
      and lingual cusps until the tooth fractures and final force (Newtons) will be noted. The&#xD;
      applied load would be parallel to the long axis of teeth. Load will be applied at crosshead&#xD;
      speed of 1mm/min and will be increased gradually until fracture occurs. Maximum force&#xD;
      required to fracture the tooth will be recorded in Newtons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sample preparation will be done by the principle investigator and sample testing and&#xD;
      scoring will be done by a blinded examiner.&#xD;
