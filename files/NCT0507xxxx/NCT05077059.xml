  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine the weight status in primary school children in the Rhein-Neckar&#xD;
      Region in Germany and will analyse the development of height and weight in these children&#xD;
      during the time of COVID-19 related restrictions by asking parents to provide data from&#xD;
      childhood examinations. Additionally, interactions between cognitive abilities and&#xD;
      weight-status will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and overweight is increasing among both adults and children. School&#xD;
      and kindergarten closings during the COVID-19 epidemic may have had an additional negative&#xD;
      impact on the weight development of the affected children. This study aims to examine the&#xD;
      post-lockdown prevalence of overweight and obesity in school children in the second grade in&#xD;
      the Rhein-Neckar Region in Germany and look at possible lockdown effects. Additionally,&#xD;
      interactions between cognitive abilities and weight-status will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements, interviews as well as cognitive testing will be performed in&#xD;
      schools in the summer of 2021 in children in the first grade (class 2020/2021). Parents will&#xD;
      be asked to provide measurements from U-childhood-examinations and complete a 3-day food&#xD;
      record. The local health authority (Gesundheitsamt) will assist in making a representative&#xD;
      selection of schools from different socioeconomic areas and provide data from the pre-school&#xD;
      examinations. Collected data will be analyzed and compared to national and international&#xD;
      surveys, evaluating the trends of the children's height and weight development. Weight status&#xD;
      will be assessed by calculating z-BMI standardized for age and compared with national and&#xD;
      international growth charts using both national and WHO classification. Potential&#xD;
      interrelation between weight-status, weight development with cognitive performance will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be able to deliver valuable insights in regards to the health of school&#xD;
      children in the Rhein-Neckar Region as well as evaluate the effect of COVID-19 related&#xD;
      lockdowns on their health.&#xD;
