      The PROMOD study is an international multicenter retrospective Project. The aim is to create&#xD;
      a comprehensive database that will include multiple heterogeneous cohorts in order to explore&#xD;
      inter-center differences in the accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of prostate cancer and to define optimal strategies for the selection of men at risk of&#xD;
      clinically significant prostate cancer who might benefit from biopsies.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent years Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate and targeted biopsy have&#xD;
      been shown to substantially improve detection of International Society of Urological&#xD;
      Pathology (ISUP) prostate cancer (PCa) Gleason Grade Group (GG) â‰¥ 2, clinically significant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (csPCa). In fact, 2020 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines&#xD;
      recommend performing MRI before prostate biopsy in men with prior negative prostate biopsy as&#xD;
      well as in biopsy naive men with a clinical suspicion of PCa. If MRI is positive, a&#xD;
      combination of targeted and systematic biopsy should be performed. If MRI is negative, biopsy&#xD;
      could be omitted based on the clinical suspicion of PCa and a shared decision-making with the&#xD;
      patient. Such approach binds the decision to perform biopsy to the clinical suspicion of PCa&#xD;
      to be determined using MRI, risk calculators, and biomarkers. While several risk calculators&#xD;
      and biomarkers have been developed and are currently under evaluation, the 'MRI pathway' is&#xD;
      supported by level 1 evidence but seems to be limited by the low to moderate inter-reader and&#xD;
      inter-center reproducibility and the low specificity/positive predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, several techniques for target prostate biopsies have been described but recent&#xD;
      studies found no significant differences among various methods of MRI targeted biopsy for&#xD;
      csPCa detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this international multicenter project is to create a comprehensive database&#xD;
      including multiple heterogeneous cohorts in order to explore inter-center differences in the&#xD;
      accuracy of MRI, and define optimal strategies for selection of men who might benefit from&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate variables (such as lesion size, lesion location, number of biopsy cores&#xD;
           per lesion) affecting the Positive predictive value (PPV) of prostate MRI on lesion&#xD;
           level and patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore inter-center differences in PPV of prostate MRI and possible reasons for such&#xD;
           differences on lesion level and patient level&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluated combined use of MRI with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other clinical&#xD;
           variables (such as age, race, history of prior negative prostate biopsy, use of&#xD;
           5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, family history of PCa/csPCa) in A. men with a clinical&#xD;
           suspicion of PCa, B. men with diagnosed prostate cancer on active surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess if there is an optimal cut-off of MRI suspicious scores and PSA density (PSAd)&#xD;
           in each individual institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) to assess the impact of patient selection on biopsy rate and number of men who could&#xD;
      safely avoid biopsy despite MRI suspicious findings in per center and pooled data analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological evidence of Clinically significant Prostate Cancer (csPCa), defined as Gleason&#xD;
      score 3+4 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who received prostate biopsy with a pre-biopsy MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional inclusion criteria will be project-specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deidentified data from each cohort will be collected in a RedCap HIPPA compliant Database.&#xD;
      Each center is responsible for the deidentification of the shared spreadsheet. The data&#xD;
      handling center will be the University of Foggia (Foggia, Italy) and datasets will not be&#xD;
      imported until data transfer agreements are complete between the institution sending data and&#xD;
      the data handling center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Retrospective analyses of multiple prospective single- and multi-institutional&#xD;
      clinical trials and cohort studies. The analysis will be performed on per center level as&#xD;
      well using pooled dataset and will include comparisons of MRI and clinical, blood variables&#xD;
      in men who underwent A. target biopsy only, B. targeted and systematic biopsy, C. systematic&#xD;
      biopsy only. Decision curve analysis will be performed to assess the biopsy strategy with the&#xD;
      higher clinical benefit.&#xD;
