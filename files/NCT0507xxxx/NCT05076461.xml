  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the trials conducted comparing ondansetron and domperidone have been conducted among&#xD;
      children aged below 5 or 6 years of age while no study from Pakistan has compared efficacy of&#xD;
      these antiemetic agents among children up to 12 years of age. The findings of present study&#xD;
      will give valuable evidence about the effectiveness of these antiemetic agents to prevent&#xD;
      vomiting among children suffering with acute gastroenteritis at a resource limited setting of&#xD;
      South Punjab, Pakistan.&#xD;

    <description>Children in ondansetron group received oral suspension of ondansetron as 0.15mg per body weight while in domperidone group, oral suspension of domperidone was given as 0.5 mg per kg body weight. Children in both study groups were administered designated drugs in the emergency department. Children were observed in the emergency department for 6-hours and discharged if they were vomiting free. All children were asked to follow up after 24 hours for the assessment of the effectiveness of the treatment for cessation of vomiting.</description>
