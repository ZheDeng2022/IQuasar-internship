      The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of intense pulse light and&#xD;
      meibomian glands expression in cases of recurrent chalazion after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that IPL application on the skin adjacent to eyelids after chalazion surgery&#xD;
      will result in better meibomian gland function and lower recurrence. To date, it has not been&#xD;
      previously reported the outcomes of the use of this technology for the management of&#xD;
      chalazions recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      intense pulse light and meibomian glands expression in cases of recurrent chalazion after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The patients whose lesions had failed to respond to warm compresses and antibiotic and steroid treatment underwent incision and curettage. One week after lesion incision, the E-Eye machine (E-SWIN company, France) IPL treatment was administered to the skin area below the lower eyelid. After removal of the ultrasound gel, meibomian gland expression (MGX) was performed with forceps-shaped meibomian gland compressor.</description>

    <description>One week after lesion incision, the E-Eye machine (E-SWIN company, France) IPL treatment was administered to the skin area below the lower eyelid.13 Before treatment, the eyes were protected with opaque goggles and ultrasound gel was applied on the patient's face from tragus to tragus including the nose to conduct the light.</description>
