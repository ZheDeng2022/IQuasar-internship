  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that adaptive stimulation of the Subthalamic&#xD;
      Nucleus (STN) drives changes in sleep episode maintenance and improves sleep quality.&#xD;
      Investigators will directly test the efficacy of an adaptive stimulation protocol. Study&#xD;
      subjects are adults with Parkinson's disease who experience inadequate motor symptom relief,&#xD;
      and who have been offered implantation of a deep brain stimulator system targeting STN for&#xD;
      the treatment of motor symptoms (standard-of-care). Investigators will implant 20 (n = 10 per&#xD;
      clinical site) Parkinson's Disease subjects with the Medtronic RC+S System, enabling the&#xD;
      implementation of real-time adaptive stimulation during in-home sleep. Prior to surgery,&#xD;
      study subjects will complete clinical sleep questionnaires in an outpatient setting and wear&#xD;
      an actigraphy watch for 3 weeks to monitor sleep architecture and sleep fragmentation. Three&#xD;
      months after subjects have completed their standard-of-care Deep Brain Stimulation surgery&#xD;
      and are optimized in terms of Parkinson's medication and clinical DBS stimulation parameters,&#xD;
      we will monitor sleep for an additional 3 weeks, using in-home monitoring. During each week&#xD;
      of the in-home monitoring period, subjects will undergo, in a randomized and double-blind&#xD;
      fashion, one of three nocturnal stimulation algorithms: Adaptive stimulation, Open-Loop&#xD;
      stimulation (standard clinical stimulation therapy) and No stimulation (control). During the&#xD;
      3 weeks of in-home sleep monitoring, we will monitor sleep architecture and sleep&#xD;
      fragmentation using an actigraphy watch and subjects will complete a sleep questionnaire. At&#xD;
      the end of the 3-week period of sleep-time randomized, blinded stimulation delivery, subjects&#xD;
      will return to their standard stimulation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our previous work, we investigated the use of local field potentials (LFP) recorded from&#xD;
      STN-DBS electrodes to identify unique spectral patterns in STN oscillatory activity that&#xD;
      correlate with distinct sleep cycles, offering insight into sleep dysregulation and&#xD;
      supporting the notion that biomarkers from STN-recorded LFP could be used to identify&#xD;
      specific sleep stages. Aim 1 of this study, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04620551, characterized&#xD;
      the relationship between aberrant STN activity (via LFP) and sleep dysregulation in PD by&#xD;
      recording and analyzing three consecutive nights of STN-LFP with concurrent PSG. During the&#xD;
      third night we collected sleep recordings as we delivered sub-threshold stimulation, to&#xD;
      assess how stimulation affects sleep-stage duration and transitions. These data directly&#xD;
      informed the development and optimization of an adaptive stimulation algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will assess the efficacy of the adaptive stimulation algorithm and will&#xD;
      test the working hypothesis that modulation of STN during nighttime sleep will normalize&#xD;
      sleep behavior by offsetting aberrant signaling in the sleep network. Investigators will use&#xD;
      subjective assessments, 3-week actigraphy, and nocturnal PSG, in 20 PD subjects 3 months&#xD;
      after DBS implantation, a point at which DBS and medication will have been therapeutically&#xD;
      optimized for PD motor symptoms. Investigators will compare chronic open-loop stimulation to&#xD;
      adaptive stimulation, and to a no-stimulation control group. All subjects will experience&#xD;
      each of the 3 conditions (one condition per week; OFF-Stim, ON-Stim-Adaptive, ON-Stim-Open),&#xD;
      however the order in which each subject is assigned to a condition will be randomized while&#xD;
      preserving a balanced ratio of group assignments. Investigators will monitor sleep&#xD;
      architecture and quality in all groups for 3 weeks prior to DBS surgery, and then at 3 months&#xD;
      post-DBS surgery, using in-home actigraphy. Subjects will be blinded with respect to group&#xD;
      assignment to mitigate subject bias, which will be set by the Research Host PC when a subject&#xD;
      initiates the recording sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this aim is (1) to validate a therapeutic intervention for the burdensome&#xD;
      non-motor symptom of sleep dysfunction in PD, and (2) to fill a critical gap in our&#xD;
      understanding of the contribution of STN-DBS to ameliorating sleep-wake disturbances in PD.&#xD;
      The acquisition of these data will improve the understanding of the role of basal ganglia,&#xD;
      specifically STN, in sleep hemostasis in PD. We expect that STN-DBS will improve sleep-wake&#xD;
      parameters in both the PSG and actigraphy recordings but that adaptive stimulation, targeted&#xD;
      at sleep-stage biomarkers, will further optimize sleep and alleviate this non-motor burden in&#xD;
      PD. Specifically, we predict that adaptive more so than chronic open-loop STN-DBS during&#xD;
      sleep will decrease nonconsolidated sleep, reduce the frequency of awakenings, increase the&#xD;
      percentage time spent in REM sleep, reduce daytime sleepiness, and increase subjective&#xD;
      experience of restfulness and sleep quality.&#xD;
