    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess - through a randomized controlled trial -&#xD;
      the effectiveness and long-term improvement of motor relearning program on balance, mobility&#xD;
      and performance of activities of daily living among post-stroke patients. In this two-armed&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 66 sub-acute stroke patients who meet the&#xD;
      trial criteria will be recruited. The patients will randomly receive task-specific training&#xD;
      based on a motor relearning program (MRP) or a conventional physical therapy program (CPT).&#xD;
      Twenty-four rehabilitation sessions will be conducted for eight weeks. Both interventions&#xD;
      will be followed by analysis of patients' balance, gait and performance of activates of daily&#xD;
      living at two time period; post-intervention and follow-up after 3-months, using clinical&#xD;
      outcome measures and instrumental analysis of balance and gait.&#xD;

    <description>Task-specific training based on motor relearning program will be performed for 8 weeks (3 sessions per week; 1 hr. per session; total 24 sessions). Each training session will consist of five training tasks: (1) bed mobility and sitting up over the side of the bed; (2) balanced sitting; (3) standing up and sitting down; (4) balanced standing; and (5) practice of walking.</description>

    <description>The conventional physical therapy program (CPT) exercises will be performed following a standard stroke rehabilitation program for 8 weeks (3 sessions per week; 1 hr. per session; total 24 sessions). Each CPT rehabilitation session will include the following exercises: (1) passive and active-assisted range of motion; (2) stretching; (3) strengthening exercises; (4) balance exercises; and (5) walking.</description>
