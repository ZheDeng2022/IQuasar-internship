  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia could be subdivided into two main groups of diseases: non-scarring alopecia, such as&#xD;
      male pattern baldness, or alopecia areata (AA), in which hair follicles are preserved, yet&#xD;
      quiescent, and scarring alopecia, also known as cicatricial alopecia (CA), in which hair&#xD;
      follicles are irreversibly destroyed. CA leads to scarred areas, most commonly on the scalp,&#xD;
      that cannot re-grow hair. Despite being a long-term condition, that often has significant&#xD;
      impact on patients' well-being, available effective treatments for these diseases are&#xD;
      lacking. In addition, the molecular abnormalities causing CA are largely unknown. The study&#xD;
      team's research involves administrating patients a new investigational drug (a combined&#xD;
      TYK/JAK inhibitor) which has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in clinical studies to&#xD;
      date, and is being investigated in other conditions, such as AA. CA patients will be asked to&#xD;
      provide small samples of skin and blood throughout the treatment period, to find out how they&#xD;
      respond to the drug, and to attempt to better understand these diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JAK inhibitors are a group of small molecules, recently emerging as an appealing class of&#xD;
      immune modifiers in dermatology. These are antagonists of the various members of the JAK&#xD;
      enzymes family, which consists of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase-2 (TYK2). JAKs enable&#xD;
      the binding and activation of the transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), by&#xD;
      phosphorylating the cytoplasmic domain of multiple cytokine receptors. This results in&#xD;
      translocation of the STAT into the nucleus, which greatly affects transcription. JAK&#xD;
      antagonism therefore blocks this signaling through STAT activation, targeting Th1/IFN-γ as&#xD;
      well as common γc cytokines (shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21), and&#xD;
      TYK2 also adds an IL-23 capability. Therefore PF-06700841, a dual inhibitor of JAK1 and TYK2,&#xD;
      currently being investigated for a number of indications including psoriasis, Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus and AA, and which has been shown to be safe and well tolerated, with good&#xD;
      safety profile, was chosen for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will evaluate scalp and blood markers of inflammation, hair keratins and&#xD;
      fibrosis, and our ultimate goal would be to elucidate the relations between inflammation and&#xD;
      tissue scarring. While the study design is specifically powered to detect mechanistic tissue&#xD;
      effects of PF-06700841, drug safety and tolerability in this patient population will also be&#xD;
      closely monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team's research proposal is novel in that the team proposes to investigate the&#xD;
      immune profile of CA patients in skin and blood, at baseline, as well as during treatment&#xD;
      with PF-06700841. In addition to the much-needed, prospective investigation of a new&#xD;
      treatment modality for these diseases, the study team also aims to better characterize these&#xD;
      diseases molecularly, and attempt to determine the effects of the inflammatory process on the&#xD;
      resultant fibrosis. These findings will help to identify new treatment targets as well as&#xD;
      direct further investigation for the development of new therapies for these disfiguring&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

          -  Use of other systemic agent for CA, including, 5α-reductase inhibitors,&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine, or retinoids, within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of an intralesional corticosteroids or oral JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib,&#xD;
             ruxolitinib) within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used topical corticosteroids, and/or tacrolimus, and/or pimecrolimus&#xD;
             within 1 week before the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been previously treated with biological drugs in the last 12 weeks for&#xD;
             other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously tested with a positive or indeterminable PPD or QFT result,&#xD;
             including subjects that completed standard tuberculosis therapy.&#xD;

          -  Screening 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically significant abnormalities requiring&#xD;
             treatment, e.g acute myocardial infarction, serious tachy or brady arrhythmias or that&#xD;
             are indicative of serious underlying heart disease (e.g. cardiomyopathy, major&#xD;

          -  If QTcF exceeds 450 mS, or QRS exceeds 120 mS, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times&#xD;
             and the average of 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participants'&#xD;
             eligibility. Participants with average screening value QTcF &gt; 450 mS should be&#xD;
             excluded. Concomitant use of medications that prolong the QT/QTcF interval is&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;

          -  Use of concomitant drugs that prolong the QT interval at the judgment of the PI&#xD;
