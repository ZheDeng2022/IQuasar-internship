  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ADAPT system by Stryker is introduced in the orthopedic department (at Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital). Following the introduction of the ADAPT system all pertrochanteric fractures&#xD;
      operated with a gamma3 nail by stryker are operated with the use of the ADAPT system.&#xD;
      Following surgery the operating surgeon fill out a questionaire on the use of ADAPT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At the ortopedic department, Aarhus University Hospital pertrochanteric fractures are mostly&#xD;
      operated with the gamma3 system by Stryker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADAPT system is software based instrumentation designed for use in Gamma3 surgery. The&#xD;
      software assists the surgeon with implant alignment, lag screw length determination, lag&#xD;
      screw positioning and distal targeting. ADAPT is the only augmented reality instrumentation&#xD;
      of its kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From March 1, 2021 it becomes mandatory for all orthopedic surgeons at the department to use&#xD;
      the ADAPT system when operating pertrochanteric fractures with a gamma3 nail. Following&#xD;
      surgery the operating surgeon will fill out the System Usability Scale questionaire and an&#xD;
      additional 3 questions.&#xD;

    <description>Result of the &quot;System Usability Scale&quot; questionaire. The &quot;System Usability Scale&quot; is a questionaire that include 10 questions that participans rank from 1 to 5 (5 means they agree completely, 1 that they disagreee). Highest score is 100 due to the calculation process. Above 80.3 means that the participans are finding ADAPT very usefull and will recommend the use of the system to collegeaus, Above 68 means that participans finds ADAPT usefull, Below 51 means participans finds ADAPT unusefull.</description>
