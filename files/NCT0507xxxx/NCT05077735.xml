  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the clinical outcomes of hypofractionated radiation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with diffuse midline gliomas. This study aims to change the way radiation is&#xD;
      delivered, from giving 6 weeks of radiation all at once to giving 2 weeks of radiation. This&#xD;
      may determine if there is a difference in the outcome of the treatment, and most importantly,&#xD;
      the patients' quality of life.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the time to progression after the second hypofractionated radiation course of&#xD;
      25 Gy in 10 fractions in patients with diffuse midline glioma of the pons, calculated from&#xD;
      date of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the quality of life outcomes for patients with diffuse midline gliomas of the&#xD;
      pons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate progression free survival intervals for patients after each hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiation treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the quality of life outcomes for parents of patients =&lt; 18 years with the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G) Family/Caregiver Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the overall survival for patients with diffuse midline gliomas of the pons&#xD;
      treated with planned multi-course hypofractionated radiation courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To report toxicities associated with hypofractionated, planned, multi-course radiation&#xD;
      treatment for diffuse midline glioma of the pons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) over 10 fractions. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve progression undergo up to 2 retreatment courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 2 months for&#xD;
      year 1, every 3 months for year 2, then every 6 months for year 3.&#xD;
