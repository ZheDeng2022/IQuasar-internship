    <textblock>
      The Myeloid Neoplasms Biology and Outcome Project (MyBOP) aims to establish a registry study&#xD;
      for patients with myeloid neoplasms. It integrates clinical data, biological samples,&#xD;
      socio-demographic information, long-term follow-up and patient reported outcomes in a&#xD;
      structured manner for scientific purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate benefits are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement of evidence-based clinical management of patients with myeloid neoplasms&#xD;
           through better understanding of the course of disease and prognostic and predictive&#xD;
           parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Direct access to new and personalized treatment approaches through recruitment into&#xD;
           clinical studies based on the myeloid neoplasms study platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality assurance of participating centers by evaluating and comparing clinical outcomes&#xD;
           and side effects of the MyBOP patients with published data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During recent years, considerable progress has been made in deciphering the molecular genetic&#xD;
      and epigenetic basis of myeloid neoplasms and in defining new diagnostic and prognostic as&#xD;
      well as predictive markers. Myeloid neoplasms are categorized according to the current WHO&#xD;
      Classification of Tumors of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues based on the revision of 2016&#xD;
      [1]. This includes Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), Mastocytosis, Myeloid/lymphoid&#xD;
      neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, or with PCM1-JAK2,&#xD;
      Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),&#xD;
      Myeloid neoplasms with germ line predisposition, Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related&#xD;
      neoplasms (i.e. Myeloid sarcoma and Myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome), Blastic&#xD;
      plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm and Acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing number of recurring genetic changes are recognized in the current WHO 2016&#xD;
      classification of myeloid neoplasms [2] and additional molecularly defined subgroups as well&#xD;
      as new entities are expected to be included in future versions. Furthermore, novel therapies&#xD;
      are now available and being developed, which target specific genetic lesions, and several&#xD;
      surface antigens are being explored as targets for immunotherapy-based treatment strategies,&#xD;
      e.g. CAR-T-cell therapy [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the WHO 2016 classification represents an enormous progress in terms of reliability,&#xD;
      validity and objectivity, there are still huge diagnostic uncertainties left [4-18] and the&#xD;
      field of targeted therapy [19-25] in myeloid neoplasms is just at its beginning. Furthermore,&#xD;
      clonal evolution and transition from one entity to another is a clinically relevant issue&#xD;
      [26-30].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, key areas of interest are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systematic collection and evaluation of comprehensive clinical information from patients&#xD;
           with myeloid neoplasm, including morphomolecular disease subtype, as well as drug&#xD;
           treatments, radiation therapy, surgical procedures and long-term follow-up data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systematic collection and evaluation of comprehensive biological specimens and&#xD;
           information from patients with myeloid neoplasms, including data on the genomic,&#xD;
           transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic &quot;landscapes&quot; as well as expression of surface&#xD;
           antigens of myeloid disease subtypes, to identify novel prognostic and predictive&#xD;
           parameters as well as entry points for targeted therapeutic interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular assessment of patient reported outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above challenges are ideally met by a registry study with a sufficient population size in&#xD;
      order to answer relevant questions in rare cancer entities. The aim is to set up a registry&#xD;
      study that covers systematic and comprehensive clinical data acquisition. In addition, the&#xD;
      banking of tumor and germline samples from patients with myeloid neoplasms is intended by all&#xD;
      patients. This resource will spur patient-oriented investigations into relationships between&#xD;
      clinical and biological parameters in myeloid neoplasms and lay the groundwork for novel,&#xD;
      molecular mechanism- and immunotherapy-based treatment approaches in poorly understood and&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat subsets.&#xD;
