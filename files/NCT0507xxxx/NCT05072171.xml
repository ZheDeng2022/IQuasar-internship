  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study utilizes the same tissue specimens gathered for previous investigations and removed&#xD;
      from 15 patients already operated for inguinal hernia, who for different reasons needed&#xD;
      additional surgery in the previously operated groin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the individual of investigated the cohort, seven patients underwent groin revision for&#xD;
      subsequent hydrocele, 4 for recurrence, and 4 for overlooked ipsilateral multiple hernia&#xD;
      protrusions. Made from low weight, large porous polypropylene, ProFlor is composed of a&#xD;
      multilamellar cylindrical 3D core, 15 mm thick, with 2 different longitudinal dimensions, 25&#xD;
      or 40 mm. The center of the implant core is connected on one surface to a flat mesh of&#xD;
      different width depending on the dimension of the 3D core. This flat part of the device is&#xD;
      intended to be deployed to counterface the peritoneal sheath. The 3D core of ProFlor ® is&#xD;
      arranged to be compressible on both planes, longitudinal and transversal. Due to its&#xD;
      proprietary centrifugal expansion, it can be positioned, fixation free, into the hernia&#xD;
      defect for permanent obliteration. ProFlor owns an inherent dynamic responsivity as it&#xD;
      contracts and relaxes in accord to the movements of the inguinal floor in which is&#xD;
      positioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsies were excised from the anterior aspect of the 3D device. It should be noted that&#xD;
      once deployed the anterior surface of ProFlor merely faces the external oblique fascia and&#xD;
      has no contact with other structures of the groin. Therefore, corruption by host native&#xD;
      tissue can be excluded. The biopsies were carried out in ten patients, three in the short&#xD;
      term postop. between 3 and 5 weeks, five in the mid-term between 3 and 4 months postop., four&#xD;
      in the long-term between 6 and 8 months postop. and the latter three in the extra-long term&#xD;
      postop., more than three years after implantation.&#xD;

    <description>Tissue specimens excised at the above defined postoperative stages were fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin and routinely processed to paraffin wax. Sections (4 μm thick) were cut and stored at room temperature until use. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for histological analysis and Azan trichrome (Bioptica) staining to evaluate muscular tissue in the implant fabric.</description>
