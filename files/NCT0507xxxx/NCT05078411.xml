      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND The periodontal risk assessment method proposed by the University of&#xD;
      Ferrara (namely, the PerioRisk; Trombelli et al. 2009) has been retrospectively validated and&#xD;
      has been shown as a promising tool for tailoring supportive periodontal care. No information&#xD;
      on its efficacy on psychological outcomes, however, is currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of communicating periodontal&#xD;
      risk level (as assessed with the PerioRisk tool) on psychological outcomes (i.e, patient&#xD;
      consciousness and propensity to adhere to treatment instructions) in subjects who have been&#xD;
      programmed for first periodontal consultation. The secondary aims of the study are (i) to&#xD;
      comparatively evaluate the level of consciousness and propensity to adhere to treatment&#xD;
      instructions in patients without a history of tooth loss due to periodontitis (as evaluated&#xD;
      after communication of their periodontal risk level) and patients with a history of tooth&#xD;
      loss due to periodontitis (as evaluated before their periodontal consultation); and (ii) to&#xD;
      comparatively evaluate oral hygiene levels in patients who have received information on their&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment plan, oral hygiene instructions and treatment goals with or without the&#xD;
      support of PerioRisk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS Eighty patients (40 without a history of tooth loss due to periodontitis,&#xD;
      NTLP; 40 with a history of tooth loss due to periodontitis, TLP) will be recruited at 2&#xD;
      centers and randomly assigned to receive test or control treatment. Therefore, each of the&#xD;
      two treatment groups (test and control) will incorporate two subgroups (NTLP and TLP) of 20&#xD;
      patients each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the experimental phase of the study will consist of three observation&#xD;
      intervals: T0 (verification of the eligibility criteria, patient allocation to treatment; T1&#xD;
      (performed within 3 months from T0 for assessment of clinical parameters, treatment&#xD;
      administration, and administration of questionnaires before and after treatment; T2&#xD;
      (performed at 8-12 weeks after T1 for the assessment of clinical parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T1, following routine periodontal clinical assessment and questionnaire completion,&#xD;
      patients will receive test or control treatment according to the randomization list. Test&#xD;
      treatment will consist of a single session structured as follows: (i) information on&#xD;
      periodontal diagnosis; (ii) information on periodontal risk level (as calculated with the&#xD;
      PerioRisk tool) and profile (i.e., the magnitude of the contribution of each PerioRisk&#xD;
      parameter to generate the patient risk level); (iii) information on treatment plan and oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions, with emphasis to treatment goals based on the PerioRisk output. Control&#xD;
      treatment will consist in a single session structured as follows: (i) information on&#xD;
      periodontal diagnosis; (ii) information on treatment plan and oral hygiene instructions, and&#xD;
      treatment goals. Although the general concept of risk of periodontitis incidence/progression&#xD;
      will be explained, no mention will be made to the patient risk level (as calculated with&#xD;
      PerioRisk or any other tool) when administering control treatment. Two operators will be&#xD;
      trained to administer test and control treatments in approximately 8', but time for treatment&#xD;
      administration will be extended for additional questions and answers whenever needed by the&#xD;
      patient. Total time for treatment administration will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered the following battery of psychological questionnaires: (i)&#xD;
      Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) (Watson et al. 1988); (ii) Protection&#xD;
      Motivation Theory (PMT) questionnaire (Conner &amp; Norman 2005); (iii) Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS-A/D) (Zigmond &amp; Snaith 1983). While HADS-A/D will be used to screen&#xD;
      out patients with clinical anxiety/ depression before treatment administration, PANAS and PMT&#xD;
      will be completed either immediately before and immediately after treatment administration.&#xD;

      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND The standardized application of the same protocols (for intensity,&#xD;
      modality, and monitoring) for primary and secondary prevention of periodontitis as well as&#xD;
      for the active treatment phase itself will rarely meet the individual's needs, resulting in&#xD;
      under-provision of care to some and over-provision to others, with unwanted side effects and&#xD;
      suboptimal allocation of resources. To deliver personalized and precision periodontal care,&#xD;
      risk assessment should be incorporated in the periodontal evaluation as a third dimension, to&#xD;
      comprehensively assess and interpret factors that may have an impact on future disease onset&#xD;
      or progression and upon a patient's anticipated response to periodontal treatment. Previous&#xD;
      studies showed that patients receiving information on individual periodontal risk level had&#xD;
      significantly higher consciousness of disease seriousness and significantly higher intention&#xD;
      to adhere to treatment instructions after consultation. These findings support the use of&#xD;
      this system in clinical practice and obtain greater patient adherence to the suggested&#xD;
      preventive and treatment protocols. Although the periodontal risk assessment method proposed&#xD;
      by the University of Ferrara (namely, the PerioRisk) has been retrospectively validated and&#xD;
      has been shown as a promising tool for tailoring supportive periodontal care, no information&#xD;
      on its efficacy on psychological outcomes is currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM Primary aim: to evaluate the efficacy of communicating periodontal risk level (as&#xD;
      assessed with the PerioRisk tool) on psychological outcomes (i.e, patient consciousness and&#xD;
      propensity to adhere to treatment instructions) in subjects who have been programmed for&#xD;
      first periodontal consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result (primary aim): when communicating information on periodontal diagnosis,&#xD;
      periodontal treatment plan, oral hygiene instructions and periodontal treatment goals to the&#xD;
      patient undergoing first periodontal consultation, the adjunctive use of the PerioRisk tool&#xD;
      will result in significantly increased levels of patient consciousness and propensity to&#xD;
      adhere to treatment instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim #1: to comparatively evaluate the level of consciousness and propensity to&#xD;
      adhere to treatment instructions in (i) patients without a history of tooth loss due to&#xD;
      periodontitis (as evaluated after communication of their periodontal risk level) and (ii)&#xD;
      patients with a history of tooth loss due to periodontitis (as evaluated before their&#xD;
      periodontal consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result (secondary aim #1): in subjects without a history of tooth loss due to&#xD;
      periodontitis, the adjunctive use of the PerioRisk tool during first periodontal consultation&#xD;
      will improve patient consciousness and propensity to adhere to treatment instructions up to&#xD;
      levels that are reached with periodontitis-associated tooth loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim 2: to comparatively evaluate oral hygiene levels in patients who have received&#xD;
      information on their diagnosis, treatment plan, oral hygiene instructions and treatment goals&#xD;
      with or without the support of PerioRisk during their consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result (secondary aim #2): at a distance of 8-12 weeks from consultation, greater&#xD;
      improvements in full-mouth Plaque Index will be observed in patients who have received&#xD;
      information on their diagnosis, treatment plan, oral hygiene instructions and treatment goals&#xD;
      with the support of the PerioRisk tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The study is designed as a multicenter, single-blind, parallel-arm,&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS Participating clinical centers Participants will be recruited at 2&#xD;
      centers: (i) Section of Dentistry, University of Ferrara; and (ii) Operative Unit of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale of Ferrara, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used to recruit adult&#xD;
      patients programmed for their first periodontal consultation. Patient selection will ensure a&#xD;
      balanced distribution (1:1 ratio) of patients with and without a history of tooth loss due to&#xD;
      periodontitis (Tooth Loss due to Periodontitis, TLP group; and No Tooth Loss due to&#xD;
      Periodontitis, NTLP group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based on data from the study by Asimakopoulou et al. (2015), a per-protocol study&#xD;
      of 62 patients will be sufficient to detect a significant inter-group difference in the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure (i.e., patient propensity to adhere to treatment instructions) with a&#xD;
      two-sided test at a p-level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%. An intention-to-treat&#xD;
      population of 80 patients (40 allocated to test treatment, 40 allocated to control treatment)&#xD;
      will be used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the experimental phase of the study will consist of three observation&#xD;
      intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 (screening visit): verification of the eligibility criteria, patient allocation to&#xD;
      treatment; T1 (within 3 months from T0): assessment of clinical parameters; treatment&#xD;
      administration; administration of questionnaires before and after treatment; T2 (8-12 weeks&#xD;
      after T1): assessment of clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental treatments and patient allocation to treatment Following routine periodontal&#xD;
      clinical assessment and questionnaire completion (see study parameters for details), patients&#xD;
      will receive test treatment (RISK) or control treatment (TaU) according to the randomization&#xD;
      list (as created using a random digit generator). Before the study, two operators (A.S. and&#xD;
      M.E.G.) will be trained to administer RISK or TaU in approximately 8 minutes. The patient&#xD;
      will be left free to interrupt the session for questions, if needed. Only the operator and&#xD;
      the patient will be present in the operating room during treatment administration. Whenever&#xD;
      needed by the patient, time for treatment administration will be extended for additional&#xD;
      questions and answers. Total time for treatment administration will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Non-parametric two-sided statistical tests will be used for intra-group&#xD;
      comparisons (i.e., pre- vs post-treatment administration; Wilcoxon paired samples test) and&#xD;
      inter-group comparisons (i.e., RISK vs TaU and TLP vs NTLP; Mann-Whitney U-test) for scores&#xD;
      obtained from the psychological questionnaires. Cronbach's alpha will be calculated for the&#xD;
      PMT scale overall to assess internal consistency.&#xD;
