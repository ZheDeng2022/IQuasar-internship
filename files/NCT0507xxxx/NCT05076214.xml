      The aim is to evaluate aerobic group exercise versus leisure group activities in adolescents&#xD;
      with mild to moderate depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are Clinical Global Impressions - Severity and Improvement scales (CGI), self-reported Quick&#xD;
      Inventory of Depression Symptomatology (QIDS- A17-SR), the self-reported Outcome Rating Scale&#xD;
      (ORS), clinician rated Children Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS), aerobic capacity (VO2max),&#xD;
      muscular strength, body, Body Mass Index (BMI), presence or activity of selected biological&#xD;
      markers of neuroprotection and neuroinflammation in blood samples and a cost evaluation rated&#xD;
      by parents with Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness -&#xD;
      Child version (Tic-P). Further objectives are qualitative interviews to explore adolescents'&#xD;
      experiences of the intervention as well as how their health and lifestyle are influenced and&#xD;
      a validation of QIDS- A17-C and QIDS- A17-SR versus CDRS-R will be performed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common in adolescence and prevalence is increasing. It is a major cause of&#xD;
      disability worldwide and contributes to lower educational achievements, increased risk of&#xD;
      substance abuse, suicide and cardiovascular disease. The effect of evidence based treatments&#xD;
      with antidepressants or psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or&#xD;
      interpersonal therapy (IPT) are modest. Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have&#xD;
      shown effect on depression in children and adolescents, but the effect is often insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic exercise seems to have effect on depression in adolescents but studies have several&#xD;
      shortcomings. Recruitment was mostly in non-clinical or primary care facilities, results are&#xD;
      heterogeneous and adequate control groups are lacking. More data on qualitative,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and biomarker aspects are clearly warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate aerobic group exercise versus leisure group activities on&#xD;
      clinician rated depression symptoms among adolescents in child and adolescent outpatient care&#xD;
      with mild to moderate depressive disorder by measuring changes in Children's Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS-R) after the intervention at 13 weeks from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To evaluate change in CDRS-R also at 26 weeks after baseline, i.e.&#xD;
      after a period of no active intervention. Other secondary objectives are at both 13 and 26&#xD;
      weeks clinician rated Clinicial Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) and function with Children Global Assessment Scale&#xD;
      (C-GAS), self-rated symptoms (QIDS-A17-SR) and function with the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS),&#xD;
      aerobic capacity measured by a submaximal aerobic capacity test, muscular strength measured&#xD;
      by the isometric mid-thigh pull strength test, a hand grip strength test and muscular&#xD;
      endurance by the one-leg sit-to-stand test, and body composition with a bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance analysis and presence or activity of selected biological markers of neuroprotection&#xD;
      and neuroinflammation in blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will assess cost-effectiveness. Also to explore adolescents'&#xD;
      experiences of the intervention as well as how their health and lifestyle are influenced by&#xD;
      the intervention through qualitative interviews. Finally, to validate QIDS- A17-C and&#xD;
      QIDS-A17-SR against CDRS-R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: The study will be a multi centre randomised pilot study that will include 122&#xD;
      adolescents with ongoing mild to moderate depression after three or more vlinical visits.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to receive 12 weeks of either aerobic group exercise or&#xD;
      leisure group activities at a ratio of 1:1. Adolescents allocated to leisure activities will&#xD;
      get the opportunity to participate in aerobic exercise after the evaluation at 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group justification: Leisure activities in a group setting to control for the&#xD;
      possible effect on social interaction and behavioural activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting: The study will be conducted at the child and adolescent psychiatric clinic in&#xD;
      Halmstad, Kungsbacka, Stockholm and Lund, Sweden. The sites are the only providers of&#xD;
      specialised care for adolescent depression in their geographical areas. Outcome variables are&#xD;
      assessed by communicating with patients on smart phones. Research interviews will be recorded&#xD;
      video calls, and self-rated measures collected electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER ANALYSIS: The statistical power is based on a pilot study (id: 2020-03364) with a beta&#xD;
      of 80% and an alpha of 0.05 and a 25% attrition arriving at 122 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: QIDS-A17-SR and K-SADS-PL with the adolescent and parent will be conducted&#xD;
      at the clinics before baseline. CDRS-R, QIDS-A17-C and CGAS at baseline, 13 weeks, 26 weeks&#xD;
      and one- year follow up assessment will be conducted through a recorded video call. Patients&#xD;
      fill out a web based questionnaire with QIDS-A17-SR and ORS every two weeks during the 12&#xD;
      weeks intervention period and monthly during the follow-up until one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES: The investigators will from outpatient clinics recruit&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with depression and who have had at least three visits and thus most&#xD;
      likely have received some basic psychosocial interventions. The patients will be identified&#xD;
      through a scanning of the outpatient computer system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION, ENROLMENT AND MASKING: Participants will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 to&#xD;
      aerobic group exercise or group leisure activities. Sealed envelopes with randomisation&#xD;
      numbers will be stored in a locked cabinet. Randomisation will occur for each site to arrive&#xD;
      at equally sized groups if full inclusion is not possible within the set time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators Tina Cronqvist (TC) and Rebecca Mortazavi (RM) conducting the baseline, 13&#xD;
      and 26 week evaluation will be blind to treatment allocation. The outcome measures are&#xD;
      identical for the two groups, ensuring that the assessors remain blind. Participants will be&#xD;
      reminded at the start of each interview not to reveal their arm of allocation. To measure&#xD;
      blinding integrity, the assessor will record whether the participating patients inadvertently&#xD;
      reveal their group allocation. At the one-year open follow up, all patients have had the&#xD;
      opportunity to exercise and the evaluation is unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATER TRAINING: TC and RM will get instructions and perform CDRS-R supported by an&#xD;
      experienced user of CDRS-R including rating and discussions of four recorded videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE ASSESSMENTS: Clinician video evaluation: CDRS-R, QIDS-A17-C, CGI-I and C-GAS will be&#xD;
      conducted through a recorded video call. Inter rater test will be performed between RW, TC&#xD;
      and PI on ten CDRS-R, C-GAS and QIDS-A17-C from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported web based: QIDS-A17-SR and ORS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent cost evaluation web based with the Treatment Inventory of Costs in Psychiatric&#xD;
      Patients (Tic-P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures at site: aerobic capacity, muscular strength and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling to be stored in a freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECURRENT EVALUATIONS: QIDS-A17-SR and ORS will be filled in two weeks. After two weeks of&#xD;
      intervention patients also fill in questions on safety, side effects and treatment&#xD;
      credibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13 WEEK EVALUATION Clinician video evaluation: CDRS-R, CGI and C-GAS Self-reported web based:&#xD;
      QIDS-A17-SR and ORS Parent rated and web-based cost evaluation with Tic-P Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews with participants according to interview guide Anthropometric measures at site:&#xD;
      height, weight, aerobic capacity, muscular strength and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      26 WEEK EVALUATION Clinician video evaluation: CDRS-R, CGI and C-GAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      ONE YEAR EVALUATION: Identical to baseline assessments but also qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      patients and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      END OF TRIAL: The trial will end when the final data from the one-year follow up has been&#xD;
      collected for the last patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL: Participants are free to withdraw from the trial at any point. After&#xD;
      the withdrawal, participants will not be requested to complete any measures, but will be&#xD;
      asked to provide non-obligatory feedback regarding their reason for withdrawal Once&#xD;
      participants have withdrawn from the trial, it will not be possible to re-enter or resume&#xD;
      treatment. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced in the trial. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      have their data withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCOMITANT INTERVENTIONS: Medication for depression is required to have been stable for four&#xD;
      weeks prior to inclusion. Medications with stimulants or neuroleptics need to have been&#xD;
      stable for two weeks. Additionally, the participants are encouraged not to alter medication&#xD;
      or receive any psychological treatment until after the 26 week evaluation. Visits for safety&#xD;
      evaluations, school-planning and to issue parental child-sick leave are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT: All aspects of data management of the trial will comply with the General&#xD;
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Notes will be made in the clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 will be&#xD;
      used for analyses. Multilevel regression modelling will be performed to quantify the&#xD;
      treatment effects on the change scores from baseline measures with included explanatory&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any unfortunate occurrence that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      results in death is life-threatening requires hospitalisation results in persistent or&#xD;
      significant disability or incapacity is otherwise considered medically significant by the&#xD;
      investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is any SAE that is deemed to be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      related to the trial intervention AND unexpected AND not listed in the protocol as an&#xD;
      expected adverse event of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have considered the following events as possible adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased depressive symptoms. Suicide attempt. Increased stress due to time consuming&#xD;
      sessions and transportation. Injuries due to exercise. The investigators also have to&#xD;
      consider that adverse events may also be symptoms of the underlying depressive disorder,&#xD;
      rather than the intervention itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the relationship between adverse events and the administration of the&#xD;
      treatment is a decision based on all available information. The final decision is taken by&#xD;
      the PI. If the event is a result of the administration of any of the research procedures then&#xD;
      it will be classified as related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the event has been listed in the protocol as an expected side effect of the intervention&#xD;
      then the event will be classified as expected. If the event is not listed then it will be&#xD;
      classified as unexpected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be noted by the trial coordinator in a specific log (including date,&#xD;
      recorded clinical symptoms, and a brief description of the event). SAEs and SUSARs will be&#xD;
      recorded in the trial coordinator's log. Appropriate action will be taken in the case of SAE&#xD;
      and SUSAR, making sure the participant will get in contact with suitable health care&#xD;
      services. Events will be considered as potentially treatment-related up to the 13 weeks&#xD;
      evaluation, where the reporting of adverse events will terminate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notification of serious breaches to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and/or the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SHARING: The investigators will not share trial data with other researchers around the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study is under review at the National Ethical Review Board in&#xD;
      Sweden. All patients and parents will be provided by oral and written information about the&#xD;
      study. Informed consent in writing will be provided from patients and parents to participants&#xD;
      below 15 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to leisure activities will get the opportunity to exercise after 26&#xD;
      weeks, ensuring all participants are offered the active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLICATIONS: Aerobic group exercise can, if shown to be effective, become a recommended&#xD;
      treatment option for major depressive disorder in adolescents either alone or as an addition&#xD;
      to present treatment options with cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants.&#xD;
