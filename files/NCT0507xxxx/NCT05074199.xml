  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the cosmetic outcome of traditional straight-line&#xD;
      (SL) linear closure to that of W plasty (a type of geometric broken-line cutaneous closure&#xD;
      technique) for closure of post-auricular wounds resulting from harvest of full thickness skin&#xD;
      grafts during Mohs micrographic surgery. The research team will use a split wound model,&#xD;
      where half of the wound is repaired with a straight-line cutaneous closure and the other half&#xD;
      is repaired with the W-plasty technique. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured&#xD;
      via the patient observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), a validated scar instrument. The scar&#xD;
      width, and adverse events will also be recorded.&#xD;

      Optimizing the cosmetic appearance of surgical scars is an important element of cutaneous&#xD;
      surgery, especially for procedures performed on conspicuous areas of the body such as the&#xD;
      head and face. Multiple factors have been shown to affect the aesthetic outcome of scars&#xD;
      resulting from cutaneous surgery including the amount of tension on the resultant surgical&#xD;
      wound, suture technique and type of sutures used. The use of various wound closure techniques&#xD;
      including linear straight-line (SL) and geometric broken-line closure techniques (Z-plasty,&#xD;
      W-plasty) to achieve a superior cosmetic scar outcome, has been debated in the dermatology&#xD;
      and plastic surgery literature with few studies comparing SL and broken-line closure&#xD;
      techniques and mixed results as to which modality provides a superior cosmetic outcome [2]. A&#xD;
      study of forehead donor site closure in in 31 undergoing a paramedian forehead flap procedure&#xD;
      showed that W-plasty provided a superior cosmetic outcome over straight-line closure, however&#xD;
      another study in 30 patients undergoing tempo-parietal facial flaps found that W-plasty&#xD;
      resulted in an inferior cosmetic outcome compared to linear closure. In addition, a large&#xD;
      national survey of over 800 lay public participants found that linear scars were perceived as&#xD;
      more cosmetically favorable than zig-zag scars in three facial locations (temple, cheek and&#xD;
      forehead). Currently, there are no studies comparing the two closure techniques in a&#xD;
      split-scar design, which can ameliorate many potentially confounding individual patient&#xD;
      factors that could affect scar outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) are a commonly utilized reconstructive option in cutaneous&#xD;
      surgery, and are typically harvested from behind the ear (postauricular) to close surgical&#xD;
      defects on the head and face following surgical removal of both benign and malignant&#xD;
      cutaneous tumors. This study aims to investigate whether the choice of straight-line linear&#xD;
      closure versus a zig-zag broken line cutaneous closure technique (W-plasty) affects the&#xD;
      cosmetic outcome of postauricular scars resulting from donor site closure following FTSG&#xD;
      harvest. Additionally, skin lesions removed behind the ear present another opportunity to&#xD;
      compare outcomes of these two techniques in an inconspicuous location.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the difference in Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) scores between the halves of the wound (standard linear closure versus W-plasty). The POSAS instrument incorporates separate questionnaires for observers and patients. Each questionnaire contains six items with possible scores from 0-10 for a total maximum score of 60 on each component (patient and observer).</description>

    <description>The patient's wound will be labeled A if it is on the left or superior side of the investigator and B if it is on the right or inferior side. A predetermined, concealed randomization number will be obtained from the RedCap randomization module, which will specify how side A is to be treated. Side B will be treated the opposite way as A. Side A will always be closed first. The side assigned to be closed in a traditional straight line (SL) will have the standing cutaneous deformity (&quot;dog ear&quot;) excised in the standard manner using Burrow's triangles, resulting in an elliptical defect amenable to linear closure. The side assigned to be closed with W-plasty will have the dog ear excised in a zig-zag fashion consistent with the W plasty flap design. Both sides of the wound will receive subcuticular closure with interrupted subdermal sutures as is the standard of care, followed by a standard running cuticular closure with absorbable suture material.</description>
