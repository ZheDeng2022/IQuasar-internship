    <textblock>
      The phase 1 primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile, characterize&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine the dosing schedule, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) of ABT-199 (venetoclax) when administered in participants&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also assess the safety profile&#xD;
      and PK of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone in participants with t(11;14)-positive&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 primary objective is to further evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) and&#xD;
      very good partial response or better rate (VGPR+) in participants with t(11;14)-positive&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
