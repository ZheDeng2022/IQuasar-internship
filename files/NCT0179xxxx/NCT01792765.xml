  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stones are very common, and can inflict a significant degree of pain and renal damage.&#xD;
      Some stones become obstructed in the ureter, the tube that drains the kidney. In order to&#xD;
      remove these stones, an Urologist and their team use fluoroscopic guidance to do so, this&#xD;
      involves continuous X-ray. Flouroscopy delivers a significant dose of radiation to the&#xD;
      patient, as well as the health care team, which has been shown to have serious health&#xD;
      consequences. Previous studies have shown that in certain populations, like pregnant women,&#xD;
      stones can be managed using ultrasound guidance. The investigators propose that mid and&#xD;
      distal ureteral stones could be managed using ultrasound guidance in conjunction with&#xD;
      conventional stone removal techniques (ureteroscopy, lithotripsy, and ureteral stent&#xD;
      placement), in lieu of fluoroscopy, thereby minimizing radiation to healthcare staff and&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that distal ureteral stones can be identified and efficiently&#xD;
      fragmented and removed under ultrasound guidance in a safe and effective manner without the&#xD;
      use of radiation.&#xD;

      Patients will be enrolled and consented for this study in our Urology Clinic at Dartmouth&#xD;
      Hitchcock Memorial Hospital and randomized prospectively to fluoroscopic versus ultrasound&#xD;
      guided groups. A computer randomization program will be used to randomize the patient to the&#xD;
      test or control group. Randomization will take place after they have consented to participate&#xD;
      in the study, and the case will be booked accordingly. Consent to participate in this study&#xD;
      will be obtained at the patient's followup appointment. At the time of the initial clinical&#xD;
      encounter they will be provided with the consent form and information regarding the study.&#xD;
      Once they have had the chance to look this over they will be contacted about whether they&#xD;
      would consent to be in the study. If so, they will be randomized and the consent form signed&#xD;
      on the morning of the procedure. Each group will consist of 25 patients. This pilot group&#xD;
      size was determined based on feasibility of recruitment in the study period and funding&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive preoperative antibiotics selected in accordance to their previous&#xD;
      urine culture sensitivities and their respective allergies where applicable.&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, all patients will be placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. All patients&#xD;
      will be under general anesthesia, in both treatment arms, this is standard of care. All&#xD;
      procedures will begin with standard cystourethroscopy, removal of the previous ureteral&#xD;
      stent, and passage of a wire proximally into the renal pelvis. The ultrasound group will&#xD;
      undergo intraoperative transabdominal ultrasonography by a designated ultrasonographer, and&#xD;
      the presence of the wire, and later the ureteral stent, within the renal pelvis will be&#xD;
      confirmed via ultrasound in all patients. The control group will undergo standard&#xD;
      verification of wire and stent placement via fluoroscopy. Operative time as well as radiation&#xD;
      fluoroscopy time will be recorded and compared between the two groups. At our institution,&#xD;
      this procedure is scheduled for 140 minutes of OR time based on previous experience by our&#xD;
      group and this individual surgeon. Stone free rate will be determined at one month post&#xD;
      operatively with a KUB and renal ultrasound and compared between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, if there is concern for poor visualization, lack of progress, or technical&#xD;
      difficulty related to the use of intraoperative ultrasound, or any other safety concerns,&#xD;
      then this technique will be abandoned and conventional fluoroscopy will be used for this&#xD;
      patient group. This will be apparent in the first 15 - 30 minutes of the procedure.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Selection criteria will include adult patients with mid and distal ureteral stones â‰¤8mm,&#xD;
        and will be stented prior to presenting for their intervention. Ureteral stenting prior to&#xD;
        ureteroscopy is the standard at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, and both the test and&#xD;
        control group will be stented for two weeks prior to their procedure. Initial ureteral&#xD;
        stenting will be performed using conventional fluoroscopy at the discretion of the surgeon&#xD;
        as this may be in the acute setting and not within the scope of this trial. The mid and&#xD;
        distal portion of the ureter refers to the segment of ureter that extends from the upper&#xD;
        portion of the sacrum distally to the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the trial if they have had surgical resection involving the&#xD;
        bladder or ureter, or a history of known ureteral stricture. Also, this is only for adult&#xD;
        patients (&gt;18yo).&#xD;
