  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir (RAL) is a preferred option for initial antiretroviral therapy in the most recent&#xD;
      HIV Treatment Guidelines and is emerging as a popular choice for use in the specialized&#xD;
      population of HIV-infected patients being considered for solid organ transplantation. Data&#xD;
      from HIV-infected persons with normal organ function have revealed few raltegravir-associated&#xD;
      metabolic complications compared to older antiretrovirals, and in general, drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions with raltegravir are infrequent. The absence of such concerns appears to make&#xD;
      raltegravir a potentially appealing option for antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients being considered for solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, however, little is known of the safety and long term tolerability of&#xD;
      RAL-containing regimens in persons undergoing solid organ transplantation. As more&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients undergo organ transplantation, there is a growing need for good data on&#xD;
      such things as the effect of dialysis on RAL concentrations, the potential interactions with&#xD;
      commonly used immunosuppressive drugs, and the pharmacokinetic (PK) /pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      characteristics in those with end stage organ failure, as well as those with functioning&#xD;
      grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will also examine transplant function and survival in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients receiving RAL-containing ART and will compare it to HIV negative historic controls.&#xD;

      Pre-transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on stable antiretroviral regimens who undergo evaluation for transplantation&#xD;
           and are subsequently placed on the transplant waiting list will be considered for&#xD;
           inclusion in the study. The details of the cART for each patient will remain the sole&#xD;
           purview of the patient and the patient's HIV care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To be considered for solid organ transplantation, in addition to routine transplant&#xD;
           listing criteria, the patient must fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. non-pregnant adult patient with CD4 count &gt;200/μL;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. no concurrent active AIDS-defining infections or malignancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. at least 24 months of well controlled HIV viremia, defined as &lt;50 copies for the&#xD;
                majority of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all screening procedures have been completed to ensure eligibility, a pre-transplant&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study will be done as described below. Using specimens obtained during 7 time&#xD;
      points, patient-specific Cmax, Cmin and AUC determinations will be made using standard&#xD;
      calculation approaches. The PK data will also include samples drawn on dialysis days for&#xD;
      patients with End-stage renal failure:- pre-dialysis, arterial and venous concentrations (Cin&#xD;
      and Cout) at the beginning of dialysis, and post dialysis levels (to determine individual&#xD;
      hemodialysis extraction ratios).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data to be collected include a Quality of Life questionnaire, SF-36, and a PHQ-9&#xD;
      depression screen which will be administered as a baseline test done at enrollment. Patients&#xD;
      will be asked to have a dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan prior to transplant&#xD;
      (unless this has been completed within two years of enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-transplant Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard of care laboratory and imaging procedures that are done around&#xD;
      the time of organ transplantation, the following research samples will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-transplant - RAL concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the following information will be recorded from the subject's medical&#xD;
           record: full HIV and infective history and test results including CD4 count, and&#xD;
           percentage, HIV viral load, electrocardiography (to assess QTc interval), CMV-IgG/IgM,&#xD;
           Hepatitis B, C, D screens +/- viral loads if not already determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant inpatient hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAL concentrations as well as HIV viral load and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the following information will be recorded from the subject's medical&#xD;
           record: test results including EKG (to assess QTc interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAL concentrations will be collected at Months 1 and 3 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to the routine post-transplant care, the following information will be&#xD;
           collected from the subject's medical records at study months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 post&#xD;
           transplant: CD4 count and %, HIV viral load (+/- genotype and integrase mutation&#xD;
           analysis if viral rebound occurs), Vitamin D, Basic Metabolic Panel (to calculate ClCr),&#xD;
           quantitative urinary creatinine and protein excretion. Patient side-effect card will be&#xD;
           ascertained by directed questioning from the study coordinator at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat DEXA scan will be done at the 24 months post-transplant visit. Quality of Life&#xD;
      assessment and depression screening tools will be administered at the 6 and 24 month marks.&#xD;
