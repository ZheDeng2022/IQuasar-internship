  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study to compare patients evaluated by primary care&#xD;
      physicians alone versus patients who are additionally evaluated by a dermatologist at the&#xD;
      primary care physician&quot;s office, aiming to demonstrate that visits to the primary care&#xD;
      physician&quot;s (PCP) office that involve both the PCP and an on-site dermatology consultation&#xD;
      will reduce hospital admission rates. The hypothesis of this study is that obtaining&#xD;
      outpatient dermatology consultations during a patient&quot;s initial presentation to a primary&#xD;
      care office will reduce admissions for cellulitis with accuracy. The primary objective will&#xD;
      be to measure the difference in the proportion of patients requiring hospital admission&#xD;
      utilizing a dermatology consultation at the PCP&quot;s office (active arm) versus primary care&#xD;
      evaluation alone (control arm) by calculating risk ratios and risk differences. The risk of&#xD;
      admission for each arm will be assessed once the study has been completed. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint will be admission versus discharge home at a dermatology follow-up visit to assess&#xD;
      accuracy of initial assessment. An additional endpoint will be to determine if any&#xD;
      differences in frequencies of cellulitis and admission exist based on age and&#xD;
      immunosuppression. Exploratory analyses will assess the percentage of patients with a&#xD;
      concomitant known predisposing factor for recurrent cellulitis such as lymphedema, leg&#xD;
      ulceration, tinea pedis, or onychomycosis, as well as the association of fever &gt;100.5 F and a&#xD;
      history of a prior episode of cellulitis.&#xD;

      Patients to be enrolled in the study will be those that present to outpatient internal&#xD;
      medicine clinic and are identified by primary care physicians as having pain, redness, and&#xD;
      swelling of the skin that the physician believes may represent cellulitis. Patient&#xD;
      recruitment will occur at five Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) outpatient internal&#xD;
      medicine clinical sites: Medical Walk-In, Internal Medicine Associates, Bulfinch Medical&#xD;
      Group, Senior Health, and Women's health. Patients with abnormal vital signs will be&#xD;
      excluded, specifically systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg,&#xD;
      heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute or less than 50 beats per minute, respiratory&#xD;
      rate greater than 20, or temperature &gt;100.5 F. In addition, any patients with a history of&#xD;
      transplantation must be more than six months after initial transplant with no treated&#xD;
      episodes of acute rejection in the last 90 days, no use of antithymocyte globulin or campath&#xD;
      to treat rejection in the last 6 months, or more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for more than&#xD;
      30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient is identified with potential cellulitis who is a candidate for outpatient&#xD;
      treatment, the primary care physician will then approach them regarding their interest in&#xD;
      entering our study. Patients will be randomized during this initial presentation to their&#xD;
      primary care physician. The patients randomized to the treatment group will obtain a&#xD;
      dermatology evaluation at the primary care physician&quot;s office and will be sent to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department or discharged home with outpatient dermatology follow-up in two to three&#xD;
      days to assess for improvement in their condition versus no change or worsening that requires&#xD;
      transfer to the Emergency Department. Patients who are evaluated by a dermatologist and who&#xD;
      require hospitalization will have their transition to the Emergency Department managed by the&#xD;
      dermatologist with notification of the patient&quot;s PCP. These patients who have follow-up in&#xD;
      dermatology clinic will not require a follow-up visit with their primary care physician. The&#xD;
      skin and lymph node exam performed by the dermatologist on patients in the treatment group&#xD;
      will be documented in the electronic medical record for the subjects&quot; medical records.&#xD;
      Patients who are admitted after the initial outpatient discharge or at the follow-up visit&#xD;
      will be considered treatment failures. A medical record review will be performed for patients&#xD;
      in the treatment group two weeks after initial evaluation at the internal medicine clinic. A&#xD;
      medical record review will be performed for patients who are randomized to the treatment&#xD;
      group two weeks after initial evaluation at the internal medicine clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the control group who do not obtain a dermatology evaluation will follow primary&#xD;
      care recommendations alone and will also have chart review two weeks later to assess for&#xD;
      admission versus discharge home from clinic and outcome. In the control group, the need for&#xD;
      additional clinical follow-up will be at the primary care physician&quot;s discretion. These&#xD;
      patients will receive a followup telephone call to confirm the final outcome of their&#xD;
      condition two weeks after their visit to internal medicine clinic. The data sets generated&#xD;
      from the treatment and control groups will then be compared to look for differences in&#xD;
      hospital admission rates. For the treatment arm of the study, this data will be obtained&#xD;
      during the follow-up visit and the medical record review. For the control arm, this will be&#xD;
      obtained during both the medical record review and the follow-up phone call. The goal of this&#xD;
      data collection is to determine what the final outcome is for patients in both groups in&#xD;
      terms of need for hospital admission.&#xD;
