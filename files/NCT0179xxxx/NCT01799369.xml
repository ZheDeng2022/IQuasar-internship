      Background Surgeons lack a routine, objective evaluation of patient condition after surgery.&#xD;
      We currently rely on subjective assessment of available patient data. The current scoring&#xD;
      methods such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation and Physiological and&#xD;
      Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity are complex and&#xD;
      cumbersome and have therefore not been adopted into routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) is a simple score on a scale of 0 to 10 calculated from 3&#xD;
      parameters collected during the operation: lowest heart rate, lowest blood pressure,&#xD;
      estimated blood loss (Regenbogen et al., Arch Surg 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous validation studies have shown a good correlation between the score and incidence of&#xD;
      major complications or death occurring within 30 days. For example, 75% patients with a score&#xD;
      of 0-2 had major complications, whereas it was only 5% in those with a score of 9-10. To&#xD;
      date, the SAS has never been clinically applied and tested in a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that routine use of the SAS will lead to a reduction in major complications and&#xD;
      deaths after surgery. We also believe that it will lead to a reduction in the severity of the&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is based on our theory that the SAS eliminates the guesswork. Using this score will add&#xD;
      objectivity and clarity to clinical decisions that are presently based on clinical instinct&#xD;
      or 'gut feeling'. The score will more clearly highlight those patients who are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing complications or dying and will flag them up for increased&#xD;
      monitoring, a higher index of clinical suspicion and a lower threshold for early management&#xD;
      of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim The primary aim of the pilot is to strengthen the design and assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the main study on the SAS. We aim to recruit 100 patients in each group, 200&#xD;
      in total. The primary aim of the main study will be to establish if clinical application of&#xD;
      the SAS leads to a reduction in 30-day post-operative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The design of this pilot is the same as what the main trial will eventually be:&#xD;
      a multicentre single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). Current data suggests the&#xD;
      overall expected major complication or death rate in our target population would be 21%. The&#xD;
      sample size of the future RCT is therefore estimated to be 986 each group to detect a 5%&#xD;
      reduction in complications (Significance 0.05%, Power 80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Our primary outcome will be major complications or death within 30 days of&#xD;
      operation. Our secondary outcomes (all within 30 days of operation) will be minor&#xD;
      complications, primary and secondary critical care admissions and length of stay, duration of&#xD;
      therapeutic antibiotics, number of additional operations under general anaesthetic to treat&#xD;
      complications, and overall length of stay.&#xD;
