  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of school-age children with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience neurocognitive&#xD;
      deficits, even in the absence of stroke. In particular, deficits in attention and working&#xD;
      memory have emerged as two of the most common neurocognitive sequelae of SCD. Thus, the goal&#xD;
      of the present proposal is to address feasibility and compliance of a novel computerized&#xD;
      cognitive training program, Cogmed. Pilot data will also be collected to establish&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. Twenty-four children meeting initial age and diagnostic criteria will&#xD;
      be identified and approached about participation by their attending physician during&#xD;
      regularly-scheduled SCD clinic visits. Baseline assessments will include a brief measure of&#xD;
      intellectual functioning, a brief cognitive testing battery evaluating processing speed and&#xD;
      working memory, in addition to questionnaires regarding behavior and quality of life.&#xD;
      Children will then be randomized to the computerized CT program Cogmed (n=12) or a waitlist&#xD;
      control (n=12). Participants enrolled in the computerized CT program will be asked to&#xD;
      complete 25-sessions of Cogmed over a five to eight week period (3 to 5 sessions per week).&#xD;
      Following completion of the program, children and their parents will be asked to return to&#xD;
      clinic for a follow-up visit. After a five to eight-week waiting period, children in the&#xD;
      waitlist condition will also be asked to return to clinic for a second visit. Following this&#xD;
      assessment, participants initially enrolled in the waitlist will be offered an opportunity to&#xD;
      participant in the intervention. If interested, they will follow the same intervention&#xD;
      protocol described above. These children will return to clinic for a third visit following&#xD;
      completion of the intervention. Compliance rate and its confidence interval will be&#xD;
      calculated for the overall study population. A t-test for binomial proportion with continuity&#xD;
      correction will be used to examine whether the compliance rate is lower than the target.&#xD;
      Participants' change in criterion outcomes will be evaluated (i.e., those neurocognitive&#xD;
      measures such as attention, executive functioning and working memory, that are most closely&#xD;
      related to the trained tasks).&#xD;
