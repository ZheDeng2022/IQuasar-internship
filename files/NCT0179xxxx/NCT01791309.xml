  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug combination consisting of two drugs,&#xD;
      vemurafenib (also known as ZelborafTM) and panitumumab (also known as VectibixTM). This&#xD;
      treatment is being tested in a subgroup of patients with colorectal cancer whose tumors have&#xD;
      changes in the BRAF gene that may make them more likely to respond to this new drug&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

    <description>This will be a pilot study of the combination panitumumab and vemurafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. Patients participating in this study must have BRAF V600E mutated metastatic colorectal cancer and not previously received treatment with an anti-EGFR targeting antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab).</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>combination panitumumab and vemurafenib</intervention_name>
    <description>Treatment will consist of panitumumab 6mg/kg IV every 14 days and vemurafenib 960mg orally twice daily. In patients who initially respond to treatment and later progress, a voluntary biopsy will be requested at the time of relapse to study mechanisms of acquired resistance. This biopsy should consist of at least one frozen core specimen. Every effort will be made to obtain this biopsy within 30 days of discontinuation of treatment and before the initiation of any new tumor-directed therapies.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any patient meeting any of the following criteria is not eligible to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;

             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or who has not recovered from the adverse&#xD;
             events due to previous agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to study day 1. If&#xD;
             the patient has residual toxicity from prior treatment, other than oxaliplatin-related&#xD;
             neurotoxicity or bevacizumab-related albuminuria, toxicity must be ≤ grade 1.&#xD;

        resection is allowed if the patient remains without evidence of disease progression in the&#xD;
        brain ≥ 6 weeks and has been off corticosteroids for ≥ 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity to the components of study drug or its analogs.&#xD;

          -  Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab&#xD;
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or it is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would, in the opinion&#xD;
