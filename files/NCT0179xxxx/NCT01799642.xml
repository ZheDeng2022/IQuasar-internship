    <textblock>
      Shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exercise is a major source of distress and is a commonly&#xD;
      reported symptom in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Due to the investigators' poor&#xD;
      understanding of how dyspnea develops, there are no treatments that consistently reduce&#xD;
      dyspnea in this population. The investigators aim to acquire a more comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of the physiological mechanisms of exertional dyspnea in CF patients. This&#xD;
      study will likely identify an important physiological mechanism of dyspnea in CF and may&#xD;
      contribute to the development and use of effective treatments to reduce dyspnea in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that the impaired tidal volume (VT) response during exercise in CF,&#xD;
      in the setting of increased ventilatory demand will give rise to different qualitative&#xD;
      descriptions of exertional dyspnea compared with healthy age and sex-matched controls.&#xD;
      Specifically, CF patients will select &quot;increased work and effort&quot; as their dominant&#xD;
      descriptor of dyspnea up to the VT inflection/plateau. Beyond this point, CF patient's&#xD;
      dominant descriptor will become &quot;unsatisfied inspiration.&quot; In contrast, healthy control&#xD;
      participants will report &quot;increased work and effort&quot; throughout all phases of exercise and&#xD;
      will not report &quot;unsatisfied inspiration&quot;, even after the VT inflection/plateau.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine if sensations of breathlessness (dyspnea) are&#xD;
      qualitatively and quantitatively different in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to&#xD;
      age and sex-matched healthy controls during exercise, and to determine if these differences&#xD;
      can be explained by differences in the ventilatory response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the progression of dyspnea during exercise will enable the investigators to&#xD;
      better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of this debilitating symptom in patients&#xD;
      with CF. A more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying exertional dyspnea&#xD;
      may ultimately lead to new therapeutic interventions (pharmacologic and non pharmacologic)&#xD;
      that would positively impact exercise limitations in CF. A healthy control group will enable&#xD;
      investigators to better identify the &quot;normal&quot; physiological and perceptual responses to&#xD;
      exercise so that direct comparisons to patients with CF may be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Overview: Participants with CF and healthy control participants will report to&#xD;
      the exercise laboratory for one visit. Informed consent, medical history screening,&#xD;
      evaluation of chronic activity-related dyspnea and anthropometric measurements will firstly&#xD;
      be obtained. Subjects will then be familiarized with the cycle ergometer, breathing apparatus&#xD;
      and symptom scales. This will be followed by simple spirometry testing. After which&#xD;
      participants will rest prior to a symptom limited incremental cycle exercise test. Detailed&#xD;
      physiological and sensory measurements will be obtained during the familiarization and&#xD;
      exercise test sessions. Data from the exercise test will address our hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: The study will include 40 participants in total. Of the 40 participants,&#xD;
      20 will be patients with CF and 20 will be healthy age and sex-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Protocol: A symptom-limited incremental exercise test will be performed using an&#xD;
      electronically braked cycle ergometer according to recommended guidelines. The test will&#xD;
      consist of steady-state rest for 10 minutes, a 1 minute warm-up at 0 watts, and 20 watt&#xD;
      stepwise increases in work rate every 2 minutes until symptom-limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Familiarization Session: Participants and control participants will exercise on&#xD;
      the cycle ergometer at a very low work rate (0W and 20W) for 2 minutes at each intensity in&#xD;
      order to become familiarized with the cycle ergometer, breathing apparatus and symptom scales&#xD;
      (see details below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function: Spirometry and maximum respiratory pressures, will be performed according&#xD;
      to standard recommendations. A commercially available cardiopulmonary testing system (Vmax&#xD;
      229d with Autobox 6,200 DL; SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, CA) will be used, and all measurements&#xD;
      will be expressed as percent of predicted normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea Evaluation: Dyspnea intensity (defined as &quot;the sensation of laboured or difficult&#xD;
      breathing&quot;) and perceived leg discomfort will be evaluated at rest, every minute during&#xD;
      exercise, and at peak exercise using the modified 10-point Borg scale on all testing visits.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to describe their dyspnea during exercise prior to the intensity&#xD;
      ratings and at end-exercise using the following 3 descriptors: (1) &quot;my breathing requires&#xD;
      more work and effort&quot; (work and effort); (2) &quot;I cannot get enough air in&quot; (unsatisfied&#xD;
      inspiration); (3) &quot;I cannot get enough air out&quot; (unsatisfied expiration). None to all 3 of&#xD;
      the descriptors can be chosen at any one time. Upon exercise cessation, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to verbalize their main reason(s) for stopping exercise (i.e., breathing discomfort,&#xD;
      leg discomfort, combination of breathing and legs, or some other reason) and to select&#xD;
      qualitative descriptors of breathlessness using an established questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardio-respiratory Responses to Exercise: Standard cardio-respiratory measures will be&#xD;
      recorded on a breath-by-breath basis and averaged over 30-second epochs, including minute&#xD;
      ventilation (V'E), oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (CO2), partial&#xD;
      pressure of end-tidal CO2, VT, and breathing frequency (Vmax 229d with Autobox 6,200 DL;&#xD;
      SensorMedics, Yorba Linda, CA). Operating volumes (i.e., end-expiratory and end-inspiratory&#xD;
      lung volumes) will be derived from dynamic inspiratory capacity (IC) manoeuvres as previously&#xD;
      described. An indirect measure of neural respiratory drive will be obtained non-invasively&#xD;
      using bi-polar surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes placed over the right parasternal&#xD;
      intercostals and sternocleidomastoid as previously described. For safety purposes,&#xD;
      electrocardiography will be monitored using a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured using a manual sphygmomanometer, and arterial oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      monitored using pulse oximetry. All exercise tests will be administered by experienced&#xD;
      exercise physiologists. Tests involving patients with CF and healthy controls will be&#xD;
      supervised by a physician. Exercise tests will be terminated based on established criteria as&#xD;
      per American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics: Muscle oxygenation will be noninvasively monitored using&#xD;
      near infrared spectroscopy in all participants. A four-channel continuous-wave near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscope (Oxymon M III, Artinis Medical Systems, BV, The Netherlands) will be used to&#xD;
      determine oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total hemoglobin by measuring light attenuation&#xD;
      at 760 and 864 nm wavelengths, and analyzed using algorithms based on the modified&#xD;
      Beer-Lambert law. This data will be used for descriptive exploratory purposes to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between muscle oxygenation of the leg (vastus lateralis) and respiratory muscles&#xD;
      (sternocleidomastoid, parasternal, and intercostals), and sensory responses to exercise in CF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed Tomography Phenotyping: Existing chest computed tomography (CT) scans, obtained&#xD;
      through routine clinical practice, will be used for descriptive exploratory purposes to&#xD;
      examine the relationship between the extent of bronchiectasis vs. mucus plugging vs. air&#xD;
      trapping (based on CF-specific CT scoring) on the physiological and sensory responses to&#xD;
      exercise in patients with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflection Point of the VT and V'E Relationship: VT data will be averaged over 30-second&#xD;
      epochs and will be plotted against V'E at rest and throughout all exercise intensities for&#xD;
      each individual participant. The point at which VT deviates from linearity and begins to&#xD;
      plateau will be defined as the inflection point of the VT and V'E relationship. Two different&#xD;
      observers will determine the inflection point for each participant during the incremental&#xD;
      exercise test by examining individual Hey plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) unless&#xD;
      otherwise specified. Between group comparisons (CF vs. healthy control) for descriptive&#xD;
      characteristics, exercise responses, and Borg ratings at standardized evaluation points (20&#xD;
      watt increments, VT/minute ventilation (V'E) inflection, and peak) will be compared using&#xD;
      unpaired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections where appropriate. Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficients will be used to examine the association between measured variables: parasternals&#xD;
      electromyography, breathing pattern, operational lung volumes, Borg ratings, and exercise&#xD;
      variables. Reasons for stopping exercise and qualitative descriptors of dyspnea will be&#xD;
      analyzed as frequency statistics and compared between control and CF participants using the&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test at standardized 20 watt increments in work-rate, VT/V'E inflection, and&#xD;
      peak exercise. A P-value less than 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the data will be performed using Stata v11.2 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Calculation: Determining adequate sample size for qualitative&#xD;
      descriptors of dyspnea in CF is difficult because limited data exists in this population.&#xD;
      Therefore, the sample size in the present study is based on previous studies of dyspnea&#xD;
      intensity ratings and the VT response in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      during exercise. In these studies, statistically significant results were detected using a&#xD;
      sample size of 16, under the assumptions: a SD of approximately 1.5 units, a difference of&#xD;
      approximately 1.5 units found between the VT/V'E inflection point and peak exercise, a&#xD;
      two-sided test, 80% power, and α = 0.05. Thus a sample size of 20 participants in the present&#xD;
      study will likely have adequate power for the investigators' analyses.&#xD;
