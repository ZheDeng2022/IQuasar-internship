      Scientific Rationale: Many children with ADHD have serious difficulties in participation in&#xD;
      daily occupations in their ecological settings. These difficulties have a pervasive negative&#xD;
      impact on their everyday functioning and quality of life (QoL). Although pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment has been proven effective in treating ADHD symptoms in many children, as have&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions such as parent training, there is little evidence for integrative&#xD;
      approaches that address the cognitive, volitional and social-environmental barriers to&#xD;
      participation with this population. Although preliminary positive effects of a&#xD;
      cognitive-function (Cog-Fun) treatment in occupational therapy on this population have been&#xD;
      demonstrated, additional evidence is needed to confirm these initial findings. Methods:&#xD;
      Initial results of our pilot study (N=17 children with ADHD) demonstrated significant&#xD;
      moderate to large effects of Cog-Fun treatment, which targeted participation and executive&#xD;
      functions in daily life. Significant effects were also found for a measure of self-efficacy&#xD;
      and neuropsychological measures of attention, planning and organization. Parent ratings&#xD;
      showed significant reduction of ADHD symptoms and improved QoL. The purpose of the current&#xD;
      study is to replicate the pilot study findings in a randomized controlled trial. The study&#xD;
      will be a randomized controlled trial with a crossover design, including 2 groups of children&#xD;
      with ADHD attending elementary school and their parents. The research group (Group A, n=50)&#xD;
      will receive three months of the Cog-Fun treatment, designed for a parent/child dyad and the&#xD;
      control group (Group B, n=50) will be wait-listed and receive treatment after three months.&#xD;
      Outcomes will include measures of participation, executive functions in daily life, child and&#xD;
      parental self-efficacy, ADHD symptoms and QoL. The investigators expect to find a significant&#xD;
      main effect of time (pre-post intervention), group (research vs. control) and a significant&#xD;
      interaction effect (group x time) on executive and occupational outcome measures.&#xD;
