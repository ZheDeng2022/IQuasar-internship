  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is effective in&#xD;
      reducing Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) core symptoms in a clinical sample&#xD;
      of children and adolescents with ADHD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relative efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, more specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in&#xD;
      reducing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children. The present&#xD;
      study is going to determine whether DHA supplementation induces modifications in fatty acid&#xD;
      blood level and to evaluate the correlation between this possible modification and&#xD;
      behavioral, neuropsychological and functional indexes. The study is a randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled double-blind intervention trial providing within- and between-group&#xD;
      comparisons over 6 months. At the start of the study, the patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      active treatment with DHA in a dose of one capsules twice daily, corresponding to a daily&#xD;
      dose of 500 mg DHA, or to placebo (identical capsules with fishy odor containing 500 mg wheat&#xD;
      germ oil). A total of 50 patients will be included in the study which is conducted in the&#xD;
      Child Psychiatry Unit of &quot;E. Medea&quot; Scientific Institute (in northern Italy). The study&#xD;
      participants are recruited from among patients assessed and diagnosed at this clinic, aged 6&#xD;
      to 14 years, who met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD of any subtype (see Eligibility&#xD;
      Criteria for further details). The study will also recruit 20 typically developing children&#xD;
      to provide a control group at the start of the research for comparison of fatty acid blood&#xD;
      level and other outcome measures (healthy children will not be included in the&#xD;
      supplementation phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment will be made were made at three visits at the site: at baseline (Visit&#xD;
      1), 4 months (Visit 2) and 6 months (Visit 3). At Visits 1-2-3, a blood sample will be taken&#xD;
      for analysis of the blood fatty acid profile. At Visit 1, informed consent is signed,&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are assessed, and the investigators make a medical&#xD;
      evaluation, including medical and psychiatric history, assessment of diagnosis and&#xD;
      comorbidity through parent interview according to DSM-IV criteria (DAWBA). A number of other&#xD;
      examinations and instruments will be used, including height and weight, pulse and blood&#xD;
      pressure, a neuromotor examination and an assessment of the general level of functioning with&#xD;
      clinical scales and questionnaires completed by parents (see Outcome Measure Section for more&#xD;
      details); several neuropsychological tests and reading test will be performed by a&#xD;
      developmental neuropsychologist. At Visits 1-2, changes in the concentration of oxygenated Hb&#xD;
      and deoxygenated Hb in prefrontal cortex during a computerized visual working memory task&#xD;
      will be assessed in a subset of patients (10 children from each group) with functional&#xD;
      Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. Visit 2 will included the same examinations and instruments as&#xD;
      Visit 1, with the exception of the reading test; Visit 3 will included all the same measures&#xD;
      as Visit 1, with the exception of the fNIRS. Parents will return every month at the clinic to&#xD;
      assess the compliance (defined as taking the prescribed dosage on more than 70% of the days&#xD;
      in the interval), to be interviewed about current medical symptoms and any adverse events or&#xD;
      side effects, and to get the supplementation dosage for the following month.&#xD;
