  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Azasite on patients with corneal&#xD;
      surface irregularity (meibomian gland dysfunction).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-masked, clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing a four week course of Azasite (azithromycin ophthalmic 1%) to vehicle (Durasite®)&#xD;
      in patients with MGD-related evaporative dry eye. All patients will be evaluated at&#xD;
      screening, baseline, two weeks, four weeks, and six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be improvement, as compared to baseline, in corneal&#xD;
      irregularity as measured by a topographically-derived value, the Corneal Irregularity&#xD;
      Measurement (CIM). Secondary outcome measures will be a global symptom score, tear film break&#xD;
      up time, meibomian gland secretion characteristics, best-corrected distance visual acuity,&#xD;
      corneal staining, axial topography based astigmatism patterns, and IOL Master keratometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 60 eyes of 30 patients, and each patient will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      Azasite in one eye and vehicle (Durasite®) in the fellow eye.&#xD;

    <description>Meibum secretions of the eyelids will be assessed at each visit by pressing on the lower or upper lid (with a finger) until excretions are seen from at least 2 meibomian glands. The following scale, based on a scale in a study by Mathers et al (Mathers et al. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction in Chronic Blepharitis. Cornea .1991;10(4): 277-285.) will be used:&#xD;
NE= &lt;2 glands expressible = Atrophic or Cicatricial MGD (exclusion at Visit 1 and 2) 0= clear secretion (normal)&#xD;
opaque secretion with normal viscosity&#xD;
opaque secretion with increased viscosity&#xD;
severely thickened secretion, toothpaste consistency At each time point, these characteristics will be compared to baseline at day 0.</description>

    <measure>Axial topography based astigmatism pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patterns will be compared to baseline at day 0. All topography testing will be performed using the same machine and system, the Carl Zeiss Meditec Atlas, Model 9000, system 3.0.0.39.&#xD;
The topographic pattern will be reviewed by a masked investigator (masked to eye randomization), and categorized as one of the following:&#xD;
Normal/Symmetrical: Includes round, oval, or symmetric bowtie patterns&#xD;
Asymmetric bowtie: Differentiated from symmetric bowtie by a difference between axial keratometry readings along the two lobes of &gt;1D at points 1.5mm from the center, or a difference in the widths of the lobes of the bowties at that distance of &gt;33%.&#xD;
Irregular: Includes skewed radial axis (skewing by &gt;20%), inferior or superior steepening (I-S asymmetry &gt;1.2D); or a pattern that does not fit either 1 or 2 above.</description>
