  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are closely associated with&#xD;
      chronic inflammation characterized by abnormal cytokine production. Some authors have found&#xD;
      discordances between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and other measures of glycemic control,&#xD;
      suggesting that a &quot;glycation gap&quot;, defined as the difference between the HbA1c concentration&#xD;
      and that predicted by the fructosamine concentration, could explain the excess&#xD;
      interindividual variation in HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was aimed to examine the association between inflammation, sociodemographic&#xD;
      (age, gender) and lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, alcohol, and tobacco consumption), and&#xD;
      common diseases. In addition, we also examine levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, fructosamine&#xD;
      and &quot;glycation gap&quot; determining the prevalence of &quot;high glycators&quot; in a general adult&#xD;
      population and their association with lifestyles and prevalent diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Selection of a random sample of the general adult population from a single&#xD;
      municipality (A-Estrada, Pontevedra, Spain), stratified by age. The initial sampling includes&#xD;
      3,500 subjects. Considering approximate 67% participation rate, the final study population&#xD;
      would include more than 2,000 individuals. The standard workup includes structured&#xD;
      questionnaires, skin prick test, periodontal examination, psychological tests, physical&#xD;
      examination and blood determinations to allow for categorization of participants in terms of&#xD;
      basic demographics, profession, education level, socioeconomic level, quality of life,&#xD;
      physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption and smoking, atopy, obesity, diabetes, metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease. We determine blood levels&#xD;
      of inflammation markers, HBA1c, fructosamine and glucose. We will collect a urine sample for&#xD;
      microalbuminuria determination. In addition, blood will be drawn to be stored at the Biobank&#xD;
      of our Hospital. One half of participants (~1000 individuals) will undergo continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring. The design is cross-sectional, followed by a longitudinal study using population&#xD;
      registries for the determination of events (mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion. This comprehensive study in a general adult population provides an excellent&#xD;
      opportunity to determine serum concentrations of inflammation and glycation markers and how&#xD;
      they can vary widely with age, sex, common habits, metabolic abnormalities, and chronic&#xD;
      diseases. The findings from this study should also help to find out the relationship between&#xD;
      glucose profiles and HbA1c and fructosamine concentrations with diet and inflammation&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
