      Synucleinopathies are a group of rare diseases associated with worsening neurological&#xD;
      deficits and the abnormal accumulation of the protein α-synuclein in the nervous system.&#xD;
      Onset is usually in late adulthood at age 50 or older. Usually, synucleinopathies present&#xD;
      clinically with slowness of movement, coordination difficulties or mild cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Development of these features indicates that abnormal alpha-synuclein deposits have destroyed&#xD;
      key areas of the brain involved in the control of movement or cognition. Patients with&#xD;
      synucleinopathies and signs of CNS-deficits are frequently diagnosed with Parkinson disease&#xD;
      (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, accumulation of alpha-synuclein and death of nerve cells can also begin outside the&#xD;
      brain in the autonomic nerves. In such cases, syncucleinopathies present first with symptoms&#xD;
      of autonomic impairment (unexplained constipation, urinary difficulties, and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction). In rare cases, hypotension on standing (a disorder known as orthostatic&#xD;
      hypotension) may be the only clinical finding. This &quot;pre-motor&quot; autonomic stage suggests that&#xD;
      the disease process may not yet have spread to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a variable period of time, but usually within 5-years, most patients with abnormally&#xD;
      low blood pressure on standing develop cognitive or motor abnormalities. This stepwise&#xD;
      evolution indicates that the disease spreads from the body to the brain. Another indication&#xD;
      of this spread is that acting out dreams (i.e., REM sleep behavior disorder, RBD) a problem&#xD;
      that occurs when the lower part of the brain is affected, may also be the first noticeable&#xD;
      sign of Parkinson disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to document the clinical features and biological markers of&#xD;
      patients with synucleinopathies and better understand how these disorders evolve over time.&#xD;
      The study will involve following patients diagnosed with a synucleinopathy (PD/DLB and MSA)&#xD;
      and those believed to be in the &quot;pre-motor&quot; stage (with isolated autonomic impairment and/or&#xD;
      RBD). Through a careful series of follow-up visits to participating Centers, we will focus on&#xD;
      finding biological clues that predict which patients will develop motor/cognitive problems&#xD;
      and which ones have the resilience to keep the disease at bay preventing spread to the brain.&#xD;
      We will also define the natural history of MSA - the most aggressive of the&#xD;
      synucleinopathies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      α-synuclein is a small protein of 140 amino acids that is highly expressed in the brain. It's&#xD;
      function remains poorly understood.10 Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases associated with the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein within cytoplasmic&#xD;
      inclusions in neurons or oligodendroglia. These α-synuclein containing cytoplasmic aggregates&#xD;
      occur throughout the brain, producing cell death and specific motor, autonomic and cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction in four phenotypically distinct synucleinopathies. When α-synuclein deposition&#xD;
      occurs in neurons it aggregates into Lewy bodies, producing Parkinson disease (PD), dementia&#xD;
      with Lewy bodies (DLB) or pure autonomic failure (PAF). Whereas in multiple system atrophy&#xD;
      (MSA) neuronal death probably occurs as a consequence of α-synuclein aggregation in&#xD;
      oligodendroglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A characteristic feature of the synucleinopathies is that they can all begin with varying&#xD;
      degrees of autonomic dysfunction as the sole clinical feature - implying an initial diagnosis&#xD;
      of isolated (pure) autonomic failure 11. After a variable period of time, but usually less&#xD;
      than 5 years, only a small number of patients remain with a pure autonomic failure phenotype,&#xD;
      but careful follow-up is lacking 11. Most patients develop cognitive or motor abnormalities&#xD;
      (or both) and the patient is then diagnosed with PD, DLB or MSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stepwise clinical progression suggests that the neurodegenerative process can in rare&#xD;
      cases remain confined to autonomic neurons12, but more frequently spreads to affect&#xD;
      additional areas of the central nervous system (CNS). This unique feature of the&#xD;
      synucleinopathies poses diagnostic challenges and potential therapeutic opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges are first, to determine whether PAF is a distinct disease or is always a&#xD;
      prodromal phase of PD, DLB or MSA and second, to discover biomarkers that predict spread to&#xD;
      motor and cognitive neurons. Such biomarkers would allow testing of disease-modifying&#xD;
      strategies to delay or stop the neurodegenerative process in the pre-motor or pre-dementia&#xD;
      phase. Aim 2 will focus on defining the natural history of MSA, the most aggressive of the&#xD;
      synucleinopathies. This prospective observational study will establish disease-specific&#xD;
      milestones for use in future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstacles to identifying biomarkers predicting further CNS involvement are that most medical&#xD;
      centers only see patients with synucleinopathies when they already have developed motor and&#xD;
      cognitive involvement, and that PAF and MSA are rare disorders. In this context the Autonomic&#xD;
      Disorders Consortium (ADC) within the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) of the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) was created with the objective of providing a better&#xD;
      understanding of the variability, progression, and natural history of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      synucleinopathies. Continuing this observational study, and increasing its power by including&#xD;
      additional academic centers from the U.S., South America, and Europe, will allow us to define&#xD;
      the natural history of these diseases and establish the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      proposed biomarkers.&#xD;

        Primary autonomic disorders are a group of diseases that usually begin in adulthood with&#xD;
        the inability to stand because of dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. Symptoms are the&#xD;
        result of a dysfunction in the autonomic nerves that regulate blood pressure and heart&#xD;
        rate, and are either related to the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits and a primary&#xD;
        neurodegenerative process (like Parkinson's disease, pure autonomic failure, dementia with&#xD;
        Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy), secondary to genetic abnormalities&#xD;
        (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency), an autoimmune process (autoimmune ganglionopathy),&#xD;
        or because of a direct injury to the nerves involved in buffering blood pressure&#xD;
        fluctuations (acquired baroreflex failure).&#xD;
