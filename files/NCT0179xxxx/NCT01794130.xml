      The aim of this investigation is to determine the incidence of silent interstitial pulmonary&#xD;
      edema by chest ultrasound at moderate altitude (3905m). Secondary endpoints are to detect a&#xD;
      suspected association with acute mountain sickness (AMS), co-morbidities and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction (marker of hypoxia responses, endothelial damage and inflammation).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is the leading cause of death from high altitude&#xD;
      sickness. At moderate altitude (2500-4500m) the incidence (0.2-6%) may be underestimated&#xD;
      because only clinical HAPE leads to symptoms and motivates the patient to seek medical&#xD;
      advice. Cremona et al. [Cremona et al. Pulmonary extravascular fluid accumulation in&#xD;
      recreational climbers: a prospective study. Lancet 2002;359:303-09] suggested that a silent&#xD;
      interstitial pulmonary edema arises in most recreational climbers at moderate altitude.&#xD;
      Recently, chest sonography has been shown to effectively detect pulmonary edema and quantify&#xD;
      extravascular lung water through the sign of &quot;ultrasound lung comets&quot; (ULCs) originating from&#xD;
      water-thickened interlobular septa [Lichtenstein D et al. The comet-tail artifact. An&#xD;
      ultrasound sign of alveolar-interstitial syndrome. Am J Respir Crit Care Med;156:1640-46].&#xD;
      The technique requires only basic twodimensional technology and has been applied in extreme,&#xD;
      out-of-hospital setting, showing in recreational climbers a high prevalence of clinically&#xD;
      silent interstitial pulmonary edema at high-altitude [Pratali L et al. Frequent subclinical&#xD;
      high-altitude pulmonary edema detected by chest sonography as ultrasound lung comets in&#xD;
      recreational climbers. Crit Care Med 2010;38:1818-23]. However, data for moderate altitude&#xD;
      remain scarce, despite that mountaineers are increasing in age and comorbidities and could be&#xD;
      more prone to high altitude emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, non-randomised, observational study. Study participants are recruited from a&#xD;
      scientific research group lead by the Ohio State University during a glaciology study on the&#xD;
      Ortles Glacier in South Tyrol (3905m).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are tested for a baseline measure, during a permanent stay on the glacier camp (3h,&#xD;
      9h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 7d ). Parameters include chest ultrasound, Lake Louise score, cerebral&#xD;
      sensitive score, non-invasive haemodynamic parameters (i.e. US) and markers of hypoxia&#xD;
      responses, endothelial damage and inflammation.&#xD;
