  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective pain management following total knee arthroplasty is important to facilitate early&#xD;
      mobilization and rehabilitation. To manage post-operative pain, multimodal analgesia,&#xD;
      including acetaminophen, NSAID's, gabapentin, opioids and local anesthetics are used.&#xD;
      However, local anesthetics injected into the femoral nerve area may cause a block in motor&#xD;
      function of the quadriceps muscle. Both adductor-canal peripheral nerve block performed&#xD;
      pre-operatively, and periarticular infiltration performed intra-operatively are effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain following TKA without causing quadriceps motor block which can impede&#xD;
      mobilization. No published trials have been found that compare single shot adductor-canal&#xD;
      block plus periarticular infiltration to periarticular infiltration only or adductor-canal&#xD;
      nerve block only. The purpose of this trial is to examine the effect of 3 different&#xD;
      approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular infiltration; 2)&#xD;
      adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only, on pain, analgesic&#xD;
      consumption, mobility, pain related interference with activities and length of hospital stay&#xD;
      in participants undergoing unilateral TKA. Patients will be eligible for participation if&#xD;
      they are 18 years old or older, and can speak, and read English. Ninety-six trial&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 approaches to nerve blockade as part of&#xD;
      their pain management plan. Outcomes will be measured on post-operative days 1 and 2 and&#xD;
      length of stay will be calculated in hours after the participant is discharged to home. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that participants that receive both adductor-canal nerve block plus&#xD;
      periarticular infiltration will report less pain, improved mobility and less pain related&#xD;
      interference with activities.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of adductor-canal peripheral nerve block with periarticular intra-operative&#xD;
      infiltration (AC+PI) provides superior analgesia and preserves motor function as compared to&#xD;
      adductor-canal block (AC) only or periarticular infusion (PI) only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this trial is to examine pain on walking, using a 0 to 10 numeric&#xD;
      rating scale (NRS), at post-operative day 1 in patients who undergo TKA using 3 different&#xD;
      approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular infiltration; 2)&#xD;
      adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes of this trial are to examine, in patients who undergo TKA using 3&#xD;
      different approaches to nerve blockade: 1) adductor-canal block plus periarticular&#xD;
      infiltration; 2) adductor-canal block only; 3) periarticular infiltration only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. pain at rest on post-operative day 1 and day 2 at 1000&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pain with walking on post-operative day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. pain with knee flexion on post-operative day 1 and day 2 at 1000&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. analgesic consumption on post-operative day 1 and day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. distance walked on post-operative day 1 and day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. pain related interference with activities on post-operative day 1 and day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. length of stay&#xD;

    <description>The adductor-canal block only group will receive an adductor-canal block prior to surgery in the block room using ultra sound guidance by an anesthetist. After the adductor-canal is located a total of 30mL of 0.33% ropivacaine will be injected into the area surrounding the saphenous nerve. Participants will also receive 110mL of normal saline administered as follows: the first 20mL aliquot is injected into the posterior capsule and the medial and lateral ligaments just prior to implantation; after the implants have been cemented and curing, another 20mL is infiltrated to the quadriceps and retinacular tissues. The remaining solution (~60mL) is used to infiltrate the muscle, subcutaneous tissues.</description>
