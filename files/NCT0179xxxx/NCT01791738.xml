    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing patient specific&#xD;
      instruments with solely standardized instruments and pre-operative planning used for the&#xD;
      placement of the acetabular cup prosthesis used in total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 36 patients who have consented to total hip arthroplasty for&#xD;
      treatment of hip pathology. This treatment is a standard of care. Patients will receive&#xD;
      standard of care pre- and post-operative care and placement of standard of care implants all&#xD;
      of which are commercially available and FDA approved for general use for the clinical&#xD;
      indications used in these patients. All patients will receive a pre-operative CT scan for&#xD;
      surgical planning and comparison with post-operative CT scan. The difference in intervention&#xD;
      between the groups will be the creation and use of patient specific instruments from the&#xD;
      pre-operative planning session. These instruments will be used for placement of an indexing&#xD;
      peripheral guide wire to direct acetabular preparation and placement of the shell assisting&#xD;
      standard surgical instruments. Print-offs from the pre-operative plan will also be used in&#xD;
      the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative scan will be performed within two weeks of the surgery for both the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups. The investigators will analyze the difference in acetabular&#xD;
      shell placement (acetabular version and abduction angle) from the pre-operatively planned CT&#xD;
      scan. These differences will be compared between the control and experimental groups.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects to be included in this protocol will be adult males and females of all races and&#xD;
        socioeconomic status meeting the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary, unilateral direct lateral or posterior THA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 to 85 years old at time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to get a pre- and post-operative CT scan at the Cleveland Clinic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The following criteria will exclude subjects from this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant metal in the joint that results in metal artifact on the pre--operative CT&#xD;
             scan, thereby compromising the ability to visualize the acetabulum on the&#xD;
             pre-operative simulator.&#xD;
