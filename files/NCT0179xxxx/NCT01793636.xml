  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When kidney cancer spreads beyond the kidney, it is known as metastatic kidney cancer. This&#xD;
      is very difficult to treat and almost all patients will die of their disease within 2 years&#xD;
      of the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib and other related drugs (e.g. pazopanib) have become standard therapy for untreated&#xD;
      patients with metastatic kidney cancer. They target a growth factor known as VEGF which is&#xD;
      important in treating kidney cancer. Although the results with this drug are impressive,&#xD;
      patients develop resistance to the drug and stop therapy. It is currently standard practice&#xD;
      is to give everolimus when resistance to sunitinib occurs; this is associated with clear&#xD;
      clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the average time to cancer regrowth with everolimus is only 5 months. It is thought&#xD;
      this might be because, everolimus only partially inhibits its target (TORC 1 and TORC 2).&#xD;
      Therefore further improvement in treating patients is required. AZD2014 is a promising new&#xD;
      drug which does inhibit both TORC 1 and TORC 2 and is therefore worthy of investigation in&#xD;
      renal cancer as it theoretically could may have advantages over everolimus. Therefore study&#xD;
      compares AZD2014 to everolimus in the setting where everolimus is used as standard of care.&#xD;
      (e.g. in patients who have failed drug like sunitinib). The study is a randomised trial&#xD;
      allowing us to quantify the benefit and potential for further development of AZD2014. Repeat&#xD;
      Xrays (CT scans) will be used to assess if the new drug delays tumour growth. Patients will&#xD;
      be closely followed up in clinic to ensure safety. A maximum of 122 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited into this multi centre national trial. The primary goal of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate if AZ2014 delays the time for cancer regrowth (time to progression) compared to&#xD;
      everolimus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell cancer, also referred to as kidney cancer, is diagnosed in approximately 170,000&#xD;
      people worldwide annually, resulting in 82,000 deaths. Treatment for metastatic kidney cancer&#xD;
      is difficult. Almost all of the patients die from their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006 a new drug called sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, transformed treatment&#xD;
      options. It targets the development of new blood vessels within the cancer. Although the&#xD;
      results with this drug are impressive, patients develop resistance a median after 11 months&#xD;
      to the drug, relapse and die of renal cancer. It is currently standard practice to switch to&#xD;
      everolimus when resistance to sunitinib occurs; this is associated with clear clinical&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING AZD2014:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risks and burdens to the patients participating in the study are the potential for&#xD;
      side effects of the AZD2014 drug. The phase I study using this drug has been completed,&#xD;
      therefore we know it is safe to administer to patients and we have a good idea of what side&#xD;
      effects the drug causes. But as the drug is given to larger numbers, additional side effects&#xD;
      may be discovered. The activity of the drug has not been evaluated in kidney cancer.&#xD;
      Therefore we are not sure if AZD2014 will work&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING EVEROLIMUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is the current standard therapy for these patients so the risks associated with&#xD;
      study drug for these patients are the same as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS FOR ALL PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIDE EFFECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects will be closely monitored during and after the study. Patients are required to&#xD;
      attend clinic weekly for the first four weeks and then every 4 weeks whilst they are on study&#xD;
      medication where adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient information sheet includes details on expected adverse events for patients to&#xD;
      look out for and also details that unexpected events may occur. Patients are provided with&#xD;
      the research nurse and principal investigator contact details should any adverse events occur&#xD;
      during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medical professionals are informed that patients are receiving an experimental drug&#xD;
      (through GP letter and labelling of hospital records). There will be an independent data&#xD;
      monitoring committee for the trial which will closely assess the side effects of the drugs on&#xD;
      a regular basis and the trial results to make sure there are no risk excess to patients.&#xD;
