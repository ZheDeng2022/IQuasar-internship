      Data on fingolimod effects on NK cells are so far conflicting. A longitudinal study on&#xD;
      fingolimod treated kidney transplant patients showed that NK cells were not influenced in any&#xD;
      of the treatment groups. However, more recent reports indicate an increased frequency of NK&#xD;
      cells in peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients treated with fingolimod and a relative&#xD;
      reduction of immature CD56bright NK cells in fingolimod-treated MS patients. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that the expression of NK cell relevant sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors&#xD;
      seems to increase during NK cell maturation. Thus, different NK cell sub-types may response&#xD;
      differently to S1P-receptor agonist such as fingolimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate longitudinally (baseline vs. treatment) the&#xD;
      effects of fingolimod on NK cell maturation/differentiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, it has become evident that natural killer (NK) cells are more than simply&#xD;
      killers and seem to be involved in the regulation of autoimmune conditions such as Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (MS). Yet, the complexity of NK cell activation and maturation is only now being&#xD;
      understood. Several recent publications have reported on markers characterizing different&#xD;
      stages of human NK cell maturation/ differentiation, including CD27, CD62L, CD94 and CD57. In&#xD;
      our more recent study, the investigators demonstrated that the chemokine receptor CX3CR1&#xD;
      represents an additional marker for NK cells, which in conjunction with other novel markers,&#xD;
      serves to delineate the sequential stages of human NK cell differentiation. CX3CR1 has been&#xD;
      suggested to be essential for the protective effects of NK cells in the animal model of MS.&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators previously reported on the correlation of the frequency of&#xD;
      circulating CX3CR1-positive NK cells with disease activity in patients with MS. Moreover, our&#xD;
      unpublished data indicates an association of genetic variation in NK cell-related genes and&#xD;
      response to IFN-beta treatment. Thus, it appears that NK cells (or at least certain NK cell&#xD;
      fractions) may be not only protective in MS but also mediators of therapeutic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fingolimod (GILENYA®) is a modulator of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P-receptors)&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of&#xD;
      clinical relapses. Gilenya® is licensed in Germany since April 2011 as an escalation therapy&#xD;
      for patients with highly active RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on fingolimod effects on NK cells are so far conflicting. A longitudinal study on&#xD;
      fingolimod treated kidney transplant patients showed that NK cells were not influenced in any&#xD;
      of the treatment groups. However, more recent reports indicate an increased frequency of NK&#xD;
      cells in peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients treated with fingolimod and a relative&#xD;
      reduction of immature CD56bright NK cells in fingolimod-treated MS patients. However, this&#xD;
      latter study exclusively compared frequencies of NK cells in untreated MS patients and&#xD;
      patients treated with fingolimod, while longitudinal intraindividual data during treatment&#xD;
      was not presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, these two studies have not considered the potential diverse effects of fingolimod&#xD;
      on different NK cells subpopulations. It has been demonstrated that the expression of NK cell&#xD;
      relevant sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors seems to increase during NK cell maturation.&#xD;
      Thus, different NK cell sub-types may response differently to S1P-receptor agonist such as&#xD;
      fingolimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate longitudinally (baseline vs. treatment) the&#xD;
      effects of fingolimod on NK cell maturation/differentiation.&#xD;
