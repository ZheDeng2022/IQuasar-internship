&#xD;
          -  Female subjects have to be post-menopausal for more than one year or use a highly&#xD;
             efficient method of contraception (i.e. a method with less than 1% failure rate [e.g.&#xD;
             sterilisation, hormone implants, hormone injections, some intrauterine devices,&#xD;
             abstinence, or vasectomised partner]). Oral contraceptives: combined pill (estrogen /&#xD;
             progestin) and medium-dose progestin pill (for example desogestrel 75ug) are accepted&#xD;
             only in combination with the partner using condoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures and restrictions&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current malignancy of any kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of frequent nose bleeds or a condition that increases the risk of excessive&#xD;
             bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pronounced anterior septal deviation or other significant nasal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;

             gastro-intestinal conditions and/or chronic medications which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might compromise the study results, or would place the subject at&#xD;
             increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital signs with clinically significant deviations that would make the subject&#xD;
             unsuitable for the study, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
