      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 when&#xD;
      given together with letrozole in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. The PI3K inhibitor BYL719 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the proteins needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast&#xD;
      cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving the PI3K inhibitor BYL719&#xD;
      together with letrozole may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and tolerability of BYL719 given in combination&#xD;
      with endocrine therapy in post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer by determining:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 4 weeks of treatment (cycle 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BYL719 (PI3K inhibitor BYL719) given in combination with&#xD;
      letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Highest tolerated dose - ability to tolerate BYL719 with letrozole for a total of 8&#xD;
      weeks without development of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperglycemia (fasting glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL) for more than 2 weeks in a row despite&#xD;
           optimal medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTC Grade 3 or &gt; rash for more than 2 weeks in a row despite optimal medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTC Grade 2 or &gt; GI toxicity for more than 2 weeks in a row despite optimal medical&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTC Grade 2 or &gt; serum creatinine, bilirubin, AST, ALT elevation from baseline for more&#xD;
           than 2 weeks in a row despite optimal medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To determine the anti-tumor effect of the combinations of endocrine&#xD;
      therapy with BYL719 in post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer by assessing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Progression free survival (PFS). II. Objective response rate (ORR). III. Clinical benefit&#xD;
      rate (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD] &gt;= 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pharmacokinetics of BYL719 in combination with letrozole: Plasma concentration-time&#xD;
      profiles and derived basic pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BYL719 and letrozole, including&#xD;
      but not limited to area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last&#xD;
      measurable concentration (AUC0-tlast), AUC curve to infinite time (AUC0-inf), maximum&#xD;
      observed concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), clearance over&#xD;
      bioavailability (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) and the terminal half-life&#xD;
      (t1/2) and other PK parameters if deemed appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlation of response with alterations of the PI3K pathway: Mutational analysis of&#xD;
      PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and AKT1 in formalin-fixed&#xD;
      paraffin blocks (FFPB) from previous surgeries or fresh-frozen biopsies (if available) on all&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label phase Ib dose-escalation study of the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 in&#xD;
      combination with letrozole in post-menopausal patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BYL719 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and letrozole PO QD. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
