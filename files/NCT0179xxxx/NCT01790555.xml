    <textblock>
      Adequate treatment of postsurgical pain leads to better mobilization, shorter hospital stay,&#xD;
      lower costs and higher patient satisfaction. In its treatment, frequent use is made of&#xD;
      opioids. However, opioids have many side-effects. A possible add-on can be sought in THC,&#xD;
      which has been shown to have possible analgesic and/or pain modulating effects in preclinical&#xD;
      research. The purpose of this study is to investigate the analgesic and pain modulating&#xD;
      effects of perioperative Namisol, a tablet containing THC, in patients that will undergo&#xD;
      major abdominal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Early postsurgical pain is a consequence of tissue trauma during surgery, which&#xD;
      can lead to hyperalgesia or allodynia. Adequate management of postsurgical pain leads to&#xD;
      earlier mobilization, shortened hospital stay, reduced costs, and increased patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. Treatment usually involves the use of opioids, which have many side effects.&#xD;
      Besides the problem of acute surgical pain, surgery may lead to the development of persistent&#xD;
      postsurgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preclinical research, it is hypothesized that Δ9-THC may improve outcomes of early&#xD;
      postsurgical pain due to pain modulatory effects and may lower the incidence of persistent&#xD;
      postsurgical pain through modulation of central pain processing, e.g. reduction of central&#xD;
      sensitization. From clinical studies, evidence for the value of Δ9-THC in this context is, to&#xD;
      date, scarce. Indeed, research in a patient group with a major nociceptive load - i.e. major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery - and an extended perioperative treatment schedule has not been performed&#xD;
      so far. Both a major nociceptive load and an extended perioperative treatment schedule are&#xD;
      necessary for adequate assessment of the analgesic efficacy of Δ9-THC in this context. Thus,&#xD;
      the question regarding the perioperative analgesic efficacy of Δ9-THC in major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery remains unresolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the analgesic effect of&#xD;
      perioperatively administered Namisol® to reduce postsurgical pain on the day of major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery and in the first five days after major abdominal surgery. A secondary aim&#xD;
      is to investigate the effect of perioperatively administered Namisol® on the incidence of&#xD;
      persistent postsurgical pain in the first 12 postoperative weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study design&#xD;
      with an perioperative add-on treatment of Namisol or placebo and a follow-up period of 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Forty patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
      department of surgery of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center. Patients will have&#xD;
      persistent or intermittent abdominal pain, due to underlying intra-abdominal pathology&#xD;
      including diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, chronic pancreatitis, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
      endometriosis, or abdominal adhesions. Other intra-abdominal pathology may be included if&#xD;
      causing pain and if judged appropriate by the investigator. Patients will be planned to&#xD;
      undergo elective, open abdominal surgery with planned use of an epidural catheter for&#xD;
      perioperative analgesia. The surgical procedure will have an estimated duration of at least&#xD;
      two hours, excluding the time to induce anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Namisol®, a tablet with standardized Δ9-THC content, or identical matching&#xD;
      placebos will be administered orally to evaluate the analgesic properties of Namisol®&#xD;
      administered as add-on perioperative treatment. The study medication is given from the day&#xD;
      before surgery (day -1: 5 mg in the afternoon and in the evening) up to the fifth day after&#xD;
      surgery (day 0 to +5: 5 mg four times daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary study parameters: The primary study outcome is postsurgical pain&#xD;
      intensity during the first five postoperative days, reflected by the primary endpoint: the&#xD;
      area under the curve of the VAS scores in the first five days (AUC5days) after surgery. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is the incidence of persistent postsurgical pain 12 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other study parameters: In addition to the primary and secondary outcomes, several other&#xD;
      outcome parameters will be collected. These include measures of postsurgical pain intensity&#xD;
      at 24 weeks after surgery, measures of analgesic efficacy (postoperative consumption of other&#xD;
      analgesics), central nervous system processing and sensitization in the first 5 days and&#xD;
      after 6 and 12 weeks after surgery (QST, Von Frey testing, and brush stroke testing),&#xD;
      postoperative sedation level (Ramsay Scale), and immune system response during 72 hours after&#xD;
      surgery and after 6 weeks (ILs, MMPs) are investigated. In addition, questionnaires are&#xD;
      filled out to examine parameters related to side effects and postoperative recovery (VAS&#xD;
      Bond&amp;Lader, VAS Bowdle, HADS, SF-36, PCS, PASS, QoR-40, AppLe, and TSQM). Two variants in&#xD;
      genetic CYP2C9 polymorphisms will be genotyped and three variants in genetic CYP2C19&#xD;
      polymorphisms will be genotyped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burdens, risks, and benefits: Participation means three or four&#xD;
      visits to the outpatient clinic in addition to usual care, including the screening visit.&#xD;
      Various measurements, including blood samples (seven additional samples over the entire study&#xD;
      period), will be conducted during each visit. The participating patients may experience&#xD;
      better pain relief in the postoperative period and may benefit from a reduced incidence of&#xD;
      persistent postsurgical pain, but are subject to more intense diagnostics and observation.&#xD;
