  <brief_summary>

      The goal of the present study is to establish a prospective observational cohort of&#xD;
      Rheumatoid Arthritis patients in order to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine and validate biomarkers that predict drug response and toxicity in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine and validate biomarkers that predict disease activity and prognosis in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the natural history of treated RA in terms of its clinical, functional and&#xD;
           economic outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Registry will be a prospective observational study totaling 1600 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      RA. Patients who are 18 years of age or greater, are a patient at the R.B. Brigham Arthritis&#xD;
      Center and have been diagnosed with RA meet entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients have agreed to participate and sign an informed consent form, they will undergo&#xD;
      a detailed baseline examination to include demographic and clinical information, functional&#xD;
      status, disease activity, comorbidity, laboratory testing and hand radiographs. RA criteria&#xD;
      will be determined by the rheumatologist documenting ACR criteria and a medical record&#xD;
      review. The primary outcomes of interest will be the presence of erosive and extra-articular&#xD;
      disease, decline in functional status and significant drug toxicity. A sample of blood and&#xD;
      urine will be stored for DNA/RNA testing. During this time either through interview or&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires, they will be asked information about their disease&#xD;
      severity, functional status, resource utilization, level of fatigue, employment status,&#xD;
      medications and adverse events. Information will be obtained at the time of enrollment in the&#xD;
      Registry, during annual examinations, from semi-annual questionnaires and annual follow-up&#xD;
      visits, as well as from medical records. Subjects will be followed for 5 years at which time&#xD;
      they will be asked if they would like to consent to an additional 5 years. At the 10 year&#xD;
      visit, subjects still enrolled will be given the option to consent for an additional 5 years.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given the option within the consent forms to agree or not to the collection&#xD;
      of their discarded specimens to analyze cells and soluble factors such as proteins in the&#xD;
      blood to determine how they can affect the course of rheumatoid arthritis and how it develops&#xD;
      in different individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a billing diagnosis of RA (714.0) or seronegative inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      (714.9) over the age of 18 years old who are enrolled in the Robert Breck Brigham Arthritis&#xD;
      Center will be eligible for recruitment. Rheumatologists within the Division of Rheumatology,&#xD;
      Immunology and Allergy who evaluate patients in the R.B. Brigham Arthritis Center will be&#xD;
      asked for permission to contact patients with a tentative diagnosis of RA based upon ICD&#xD;
      billing code. A letter describing the study, Dr. Nancy Shadick, and the primary&#xD;
      rheumatologist will be sent to the subject 7-10 days prior to their next scheduled visit. The&#xD;
      consent form will be included with the letter so they will have time to discuss it with&#xD;
      family and others. In the case of non-English speaking patients, the short form consent form&#xD;
      will be presented and an interpreter will be supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A letter describing the study, signed by Dr. Shadick, the PI, and the patient's primary&#xD;
      rheumatologist will be sent to the patient 7-10 days prior to their next scheduled visit. An&#xD;
      informed consent document will be sent at that time for the patient to read over and to&#xD;
      discuss with family and others. If they are interested in participating in the study, the&#xD;
      subject will be asked to bring the informed consent document to the appointment with their&#xD;
      rheumatologist. Either the participating rheumatologist or research coordinator trained in&#xD;
      explaining the protocol in detail will obtain the consent. Each research coordinator that&#xD;
      will be involved in obtaining consents will undergo a 1 hour training session with the&#xD;
      principal investigator, Nancy A. Shadick, MD. The investigator will review the general&#xD;
      principles, benefits and risks of genetic analysis as well as details of the study. All&#xD;
      subjects must be able to give consent for the study themselves.&#xD;
