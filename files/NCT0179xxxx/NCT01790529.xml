  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most frequent hospital acquired infections in patients&#xD;
      who underwent surgery. With regards to the increasing financial restraint in patient care,&#xD;
      the socio-economic burden of SSI in the public health sector and its prevention gains in&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prophylactic application of antibiotics (surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis, SAP) prior&#xD;
      to the skin incision significantly reduces the risk of SSI, but the correct time point of&#xD;
      drug administration remains unclear. Most studies recommend application of SAP directly prior&#xD;
      to skin incision. Other studies, however, suggest that this is too late and more time between&#xD;
      administration of the SAP and skin incision is necessary for optimal SSI prevention. A large&#xD;
      cohort study in Switzerland concluded that SAP should be applied between 74 and 30 minutes&#xD;
      prior to skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the obvious importance of this controversy, we want to answer this question with a&#xD;
      clinical study (randomized controlled trial, RCT) at the University Hospital of Basel and the&#xD;
      Cantonal Hospital of Aarau. We plan to investigate two administration strategies according to&#xD;
      the timing of the SAP. Strategy A will consist of SAP application in the anesthetic room&#xD;
      located in front of the actual operating theatre, where the patient gets anesthesia.&#xD;
      Therefore, the application of SAP will take place early, approximately between 75 and 30&#xD;
      minutes prior to skin incision. In strategy B we will apply SAP in the operating theatre,&#xD;
      which on average occurs later (approximately within the last 30 minutes before skin&#xD;
      incision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We test the hypothesis that strategy A is more effective in preventing SSI than strategy B.&#xD;
      We will include a total of 5000 patients in abdominal, vascular and trauma surgery (2500 at&#xD;
      each study site and 2500 per study group). All patients will be followed in the hospital for&#xD;
      SSI occurrence. Additionally, all patients will be interviewed by telephone after hospital&#xD;
      discharge at a defined follow-up period of 30 days (1 year if an implant is in place, such as&#xD;
      hip endoprosthesis or meshes). We expect this study to be completed within approximately 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

      Additionally, the association between the following pre-defined variables and the occurence&#xD;
      of SSI, mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay (LOS) will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laparoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tutorial assistance during operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obesity (Body Mass Index, BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preoperative Virtual Reality (VR) training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) concept&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perioperative blood glucose levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preoperative levels of HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intensified insulin resistance as measured by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and&#xD;
           quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  type of diabetes (IDDM vs. NIDDM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intraoperative Hypothermia (body core temperature)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of adherence to the principles of asepsis during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgical experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malnutrition, measured by Hypalbuminaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emergency operations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immunosuppression and steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictive value of Procalcitonin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intraoperative blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preoperative wound class&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following changes were made to the study protocol according to amendments approved by the&#xD;
      local ethics committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As of April 22nd, 2013, or the 222. patient randomized at the University Hospital Basel,&#xD;
           the time the SAP infusion STARTED was recorded instead of the time that it ENDED. The&#xD;
           decision to change this important parameter was taken in order to make results of this&#xD;
           trial more comparable to those of other published studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the original study protocol it was planned to provide each randomized patient with a&#xD;
           patient's diary to record signs of SSI. This was abandoned for limited benefit and in&#xD;
           order to minimize patients' time and effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who undergo combined surgery (by one of the participating surgical specialties&#xD;
           plus by a non participating specialty) shall not be included in this trial as outcomes&#xD;
           (SSI) could be difficult to correlate to one or another part of surgery. This had not&#xD;
           been specified as an exclusion criterion in the original study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' information sheets and informed consents in one of the languages other than&#xD;
           German were only approved by the local ethics committees by May 15th, 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As per ethics committees regulations, patients can only be included in more than one&#xD;
           clinical trials under specific circumstances. Therefore only a limited percentage of&#xD;
           patients that are already included in other studies can still be included for this&#xD;
           trial. However, overall, this only excludes a very limited number of potentially&#xD;
           includable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following additional amendments were authorized by the ethics committees on August 9th,&#xD;
      2014:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Version 4 of the patients' information and the written consent form. In these new versions,&#xD;
      patients are specifically asked for permission to review their general practitioners' notes&#xD;
      concerning potential SSI, for planned follow up as well as in case of readmission to&#xD;
      hospital. This is specified in the study protocol, but had not been specifically mentioned in&#xD;
      the patients' information and consent forms. This change is also intended to significantly&#xD;
      decrease the number of patients lost to follow up as it proved difficult to contact some&#xD;
      patients by telephone.&#xD;
