      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Current treatments for alcoholism have limited success. More than half of people with&#xD;
      alcoholism return to uncontrolled drinking even after treatment or self-help programs. One&#xD;
      possible treatment is the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS studies of the ventral&#xD;
      capsule/ventral striatum, a region of the brain, reduced cravings for alcohol in a small&#xD;
      group of alcoholics. DBS is approved for treating other disorders, such as Parkinson s&#xD;
      disease, but not for treating alcoholism. Researchers want to study whether DBS can be used&#xD;
      to treat chronic alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if deep brain stimulation is helpful and safe for people who have chronic&#xD;
      alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 21 and 60 years of age who have been diagnosed with chronic&#xD;
           alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have tried for more than 10 years to stop drinking alcohol, and have&#xD;
           failed multiple treatment and self-help programs. They may not have any other current&#xD;
           substance abuse or dependence problem (except alcohol and nicotine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will start the study by entering a separate alcohol detoxification study at&#xD;
           the National Institutes of Health. They will be monitored during this study with blood&#xD;
           tests and brain scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 weeks of baseline tests. They will include physical exams and&#xD;
           blood and urine tests. They will also include tests of thinking and memory, and&#xD;
           questions about current moods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have surgery to insert the DBS device. Electrodes will be placed in&#xD;
           the brain and a battery pack will be placed in the chest. Participants will recover from&#xD;
           the surgery and continue the alcohol detoxification program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 4 weeks after surgery, participants will be separated into two groups. For one&#xD;
           group, the DBS device will be turned on with electrical stimulation and participants&#xD;
           will be monitored for an additional two weeks in the hospital to find the right setting&#xD;
           for the device. For the second group, participants will receive mock stimulation, but no&#xD;
           real electrical DBS, and will also be monitored for an additional two weeks in the&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return home for 24 weeks. During this time they will have frequent&#xD;
           study visits to look at the DBS device. These visits will include questions about mood&#xD;
           and memory, as well as imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will return for an additional two week inpatient stay in the hospital.&#xD;
           Those participant who had initially received mock stimulation will now have their&#xD;
           devices turned on with real electrical stimulation and will be monitored for the two&#xD;
           weeks to find the right setting for the device. Those participants who had initially&#xD;
           received real stimulation will continue to receive stimulation while being monitored for&#xD;
           the two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return home for another 24. All participants at this point will have&#xD;
           actual electrical DBS. Participants will continue to have frequent study visits for up&#xD;
           to a year to look at the DBS device. These visits will also include questions about mood&#xD;
           levels and alcohol cravings.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot clinical study is to test the safety and efficacy of deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum and ventral capsule in patients&#xD;
      with treatment-resistant alcoholism and to provide critical information for planning&#xD;
      subsequent clinical trials, including additional experience with the safety of this&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients 21 to 60 years of age with severe, treatment-resistant alcoholism will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, sham-controlled trial with open-label extension exploring the use&#xD;
      of DBS of the nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum, and ventral capsule in ten healthy alcohol&#xD;
      dependent men and women who have failed repeated alcoholism treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurosurgical implantation of the DBS in the nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum and ventral&#xD;
      capsule will be performed. Following surgery but prior to initiation of the titration phase,&#xD;
      baseline cognitive and behavioral testing will be performed. Approximately four weeks&#xD;
      following placement of the electrodes, a randomized, sham-controlled trial with an open-label&#xD;
      extension will be instituted whereby participants will be randomized and blinded to undergo&#xD;
      either titration for two weeks followed by 24 weeks with the DBS system ON, or titration&#xD;
      followed by 24 weeks with the DBS system OFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 weeks with DBS ON or OFF, the open-label extension phase will occur. All&#xD;
      participants will be readmitted to the hospital for the second two-week titration period. The&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral assessments performed at baseline will be repeated. Following the&#xD;
      inpatient titration phase, they will be discharged from the hospital and followed in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic for 24 weeks with the DBS ON. Cognitive and behavioral assessments which&#xD;
      were performed at baseline will be repeated at the end of this 24-week period. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed monthly after this time for 9 months, for a total of approximately 24 months&#xD;
      of active enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Risks associated with DBS for alcoholism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Alcohol consumption as measured by Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include: 1) change in processing of rewards and punishments as&#xD;
      measured in decision-making tasks, 3) change in mood as measured by Comprehensive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), 4) change in participation in social, physical, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      rehabilitative activities as measured by the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4),&#xD;
      5) change in overall life satisfaction as measured by the Satisfaction with Life Scale&#xD;
      (SWLS), 6) change in alcohol craving as measured by the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS),&#xD;
      and (7) number of alcohol relapses and time to alcohol relapse.&#xD;
