      There is good evidence of the effectiveness of regular physical activity in the primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of stroke. STARFISH is a smartphone-based application designed as a&#xD;
      behavioural change intervention to encourage the user to become more physically active. The&#xD;
      study will investigate if using STARFISH for 6 weeks can increase physical activity in people&#xD;
      after stroke. Subjects will be randomised to the STARFISH intervention or a control group.&#xD;
      Control subjects will not have access to their daily activity count.&#xD;

      Introduction Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability in western countries&#xD;
      (Donan et al. 2008). Stroke survivors are often deconditioned and predisposed to a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle that limits performance of activities of daily living, increases the risk for&#xD;
      falls, and may contribute to a heightened risk for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (Ivey et al. 2005). There is good evidence of the effectiveness of regular physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) in the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic diseases e.g.&#xD;
      stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, hypertension, obesity&#xD;
      and osteoporosis (Warburton et al. 2006). Walking may be one of the most accessible forms of&#xD;
      exercise in the stroke population. STARFISH is a mobile phone application designed to&#xD;
      encourage the user to become more physically active. Phase 1 of the project will involve the&#xD;
      development of the current STARFISH to ensure it is fit for purpose for people following&#xD;
      stroke. This will be done in collaboration with stroke survivors and their family if&#xD;
      necessary. The study will investigate if using STARFISH for 6 weeks can increase physical&#xD;
      activity and if the programme has the potential to improve health and well being in people&#xD;
      following stroke, including those with residual, physical, sensory and visual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of STARFISH The current version of STARFISH is a smartphone-based programme&#xD;
      designed as a behavioural change intervention to encourage the user to become more physically&#xD;
      active. The sensors within a standard smartphone record the number of steps taken per day by&#xD;
      the individual. Each person is represented by a fish within a fish tank which the participant&#xD;
      can see on their mobile phone display. When the participant is active their fish blows&#xD;
      bubbles and swims faster and, as the participant reaches their target number of steps per&#xD;
      day, their fish's fins and tail grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives The overall aims are to adapt STARFISH for use in stroke survivors and to&#xD;
      undertake a feasibility study to evaluate the acceptability and potential effectiveness of&#xD;
      STARFISH in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To use a participatory co-design approach to develop the STARFISH software and&#xD;
           interfaces to ensure that STARFISH is fit for purpose for use by people with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the likely effectiveness of STARFISH in increasing levels of PA in people&#xD;
           post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the likely acceptability of STARFISH by people post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To provide sufficient data on effect sizes of STARFISH on outcomes related to amount of&#xD;
           physical activity undertaken, quality of life, general well-being and fatigue, walking&#xD;
           speed, and metabolic health biomarkers (BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile, resting&#xD;
           heart rate) to undertake power calculations to establish the sample size required for a&#xD;
           fully powered, randomised controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Methods Design Following MRC guidance, the proposed mobile phone application&#xD;
      development and pilot evaluation comprises a 2-phase (sequential) mixed-methods programme of&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will involve the development of the current STARFISH mobile phone application. This&#xD;
      will involve participatory co-design of the application to ensure suitability for stroke&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will involve piloting the revised STARFISH application with participants to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility to recruit the target populations, potential to support participants to&#xD;
      become more physically active, improve health behaviours and deliver physical and mental&#xD;
      health benefits . The Phase 2 findings will inform a decision on whether to proceed to larger&#xD;
      scale evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Up to 6 stroke survivors attending Western Infirmary physiotherapy outpatient clinic&#xD;
      will be recruited to the phase 1 of the study. Another 24 patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      stroke-related walking dysfunction and who have had a single stroke will be recruited through&#xD;
      Chest Heart &amp;Stroke affiliated groups. Potential patients will be given verbal and written&#xD;
      information about the study by the research team member. Patients who are willing to take&#xD;
      part in the study will be advised to telephone the researcher via the contact details on the&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheet. Thereafter, if the participant is willing to participate in&#xD;
      the study a suitable date/time for the assessment will be arranged by telephone, and then&#xD;
      confirmed by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. An initial co-design session of up to six people with stroke will be undertaken to&#xD;
      elicit their views on the current STARFISH application and how this should be adapted to meet&#xD;
      their needs. For example, the fish may require to be larger to allow stroke survivors to see&#xD;
      them or for those with physical impairments of their upper limb voice activated commands may&#xD;
      be beneficial. The software will require more modelling work to sense the different gait&#xD;
      patterns of people with stroke and thus ensure accurate counting of steps. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      STARFISH application will be refined and prototype user trial (for up to 3 weeks) will be&#xD;
      undertaken. Another co-design session will be then organised to evaluate the changes and&#xD;
      final revision of the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Participants will have an initial visit to the Clinical Research Facility (CRF)&#xD;
      where the study will be explained and they will be given a mobile phone and asked to carry&#xD;
      the phone for seven days to establish their normal level of PA. They will return to the CRF&#xD;
      at the end of the seven day period for baseline measures (see below) and for agreed activity&#xD;
      targets to be set. They will then be randomised to either the intervention (n=12) or control&#xD;
      group (n=12). The intervention group will follow the STARFISH programme for six weeks. After&#xD;
      three weeks the group will be invited to return to the CRF to informally discuss progress and&#xD;
      for PA targets to be reviewed and amended as necessary. During the intervention period&#xD;
      participants will be given contact numbers of the research assistant to call if they&#xD;
      experience any problems. Control participants will carry the phone for six weeks, to allow&#xD;
      recording of their levels of physical activity. Control participants will not have access to&#xD;
      their daily step nor will they have access to the STARFISH app. All participants will return&#xD;
      to the CRF after six weeks for final measures to be taken. All participants will then be&#xD;
      given their daily activity results in a form of short report. A summative focus group will be&#xD;
      undertaken to establish the views of the participants on areas of technical feasibility&#xD;
      including accessibility, ease of use and effectiveness of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Up to six people with stroke, who will not be participating in the phase 2 of the&#xD;
      study, will be involved in the development/co-design stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Twenty four adults with mild to moderate stroke-related walking dysfunction and who&#xD;
      have had a single stroke will be randomised to the intervention (n=12) or control group&#xD;
      (n=12). The randomisation process will be carried out using sealed opaque envelopes&#xD;
      containing participant's unique numbers. All participants will be provided with a standard&#xD;
      smartphone. Control participants will carry the phone for six weeks but without STARFISFH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STARFISH is undertaken in groups of four and each member of the group is represented by a&#xD;
      fish within the tank, each fish is distinguishable by colour as belonging to a specific&#xD;
      individual thus each participant gets feedback on the activity level of each member of the&#xD;
      group, in real time, via the visual representation of the fish in the fish tank. Different&#xD;
      goals can be set for different individuals in the group, along with goals for the whole&#xD;
      group. The study has been designed around a framework based on Control Theory, a technique&#xD;
      known to be successful for behavioural change, which includes: goal setting, action planning,&#xD;
      self-monitoring, reviews of goals and providing feedback on performance; social support is&#xD;
      likely to act by influencing all of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, sex, height, weight, BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting heart rate, blood pressure, Blood analysis; blood lipids, LFTs, CRP, HBA1c The&#xD;
      Ten-Meter Walking Test (10 MWT) assesses walking speed (m/sec) over a 10m distance, measured&#xD;
      by research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a self reported questionnaire which evaluates the impact of&#xD;
      fatigue. It contains 9 statements scored on a 1 to 7 scale. A total score of less than 36&#xD;
      suggests that patient may not be suffering from fatigue. A total score of 36 or more suggests&#xD;
      that patient may need further evaluation by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale contains 8 items to assess more complex&#xD;
      activities (termed &quot;instrumental activities of daily living&quot;) necessary for functioning in&#xD;
      community settings. The higher the score, the greater the person's abilities. The research&#xD;
      assistant will examine the scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) is a self-report questionnaire consisting of&#xD;
      49 items in the 12 domains of energy, family roles, language, mobility, mood, personality,&#xD;
      self-care, social roles, thinking, upper extremity (UE) function, vision, and&#xD;
      work/productivity. The domains are scored separately, and a total score is also provided.&#xD;
      Higher scores indicate better functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Index. A measure of self-representations of&#xD;
      intrapersonal affective or emotional states reflecting a sense of subjective well-being or&#xD;
      distress consists of 22 items that measure components of psychological well-being such as&#xD;
      anxiety, positive well-being, self-control, depression, general health and vitality. Scores&#xD;
      range from 0 to 110 and higher scores suggest better well-being. The PGWB index is&#xD;
      self-administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise all variables. Where appropriate,&#xD;
      comparisons between patients and controls will use Students t-test or UMann-Whitney analyses&#xD;
      for parametric and non-parametric distributions respectively.&#xD;
