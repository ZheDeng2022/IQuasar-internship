      The School of Public Health of HKU collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service&#xD;
      (HKSCC) to conduct a district-based mega-project &quot;Happy Family Kitchen&quot;, which using &quot;eating&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;the kitchen&quot; as a platform, to make the effort to improve effective communication in&#xD;
      Hong Kong families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;HFK 2&quot; project is a enhanced version of HFK project, which plan to be conducted in the&#xD;
      Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi district from August 2012 to August 2013. This project&#xD;
      adopts a cluster-randomized controlled design, with the application of positive psychology&#xD;
      concepts as a theoretical framework. A community-based participatory (CBP) approach, which is&#xD;
      an effective way to engage public health researchers and community members (NGOs, schools,&#xD;
      other major stakeholders, and participants), will be used. Both quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      methods will be used in the evaluation of major outcomes (participants' family relationship&#xD;
      and 3Hs) at different time points throughout the project. Process evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the process of each component of the project. The whole project&#xD;
      includes two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Model enhancement- an enhanced model of project is started with the training the&#xD;
      trainer workshop to build capacity among the community partners. After that, the trained&#xD;
      community partners design and conduct the district-based intervention programmes by using one&#xD;
      of the five themes of the positive psychology framework, which teach the participants to&#xD;
      practice positive behaviors for improving family communication, and in turn promote the 3Hs.&#xD;
      The five themes are joy, flow, gratitude, savoring and listening. The pre-, post-, 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 3 month follow up questionnaire surveys are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      programmes. All of the participating NGOs and schools will be randomly allocated into three&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm 1: core session intervention + booster intervention; Intervention arm 2:&#xD;
      only core session intervention; Control arm: waiting list control, only questionnaire&#xD;
      evaluations can be conducted at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsequent qualitative study is conducted to further explore the outcomes, the problems and&#xD;
      the requirements from the programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Model scaling up- A series of Professional Tool Kits consist of practice guides and&#xD;
      evaluation tools for different service settings will be published with the contribution of&#xD;
      participating NGOs and project partners. The tool kits will be the key reference and be&#xD;
      further disseminated to a wider scope. A series of Professional Practice Seminars will be&#xD;
      organized in different regions (including Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories). Social&#xD;
      work practitioners of various service settings will be invited to attend the seminars. The&#xD;
      evidence-based professional tool kits will be introduced and distributed in the seminar.&#xD;
      Clinical psychologist will be the speaker on how to apply positive psychology in practice,&#xD;
      and HKU staff will also illustrate the use of evaluation tools in assessing the outcome of&#xD;
      the program. Participating NGOs of this project will be invited to share their practice&#xD;
      experience in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing district as well. another new edition of Happy Family&#xD;
      Cookbook will be published and distributed to the whole territory. The new edition will be&#xD;
      enhanced with more attractive content including healthy recipes and tips for positive&#xD;
      communication etc. To enhance the interactivity of the cookbook, related apps for mobile&#xD;
      devices will be developed for public free download.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, Chinese people place great importance on their families. However, the&#xD;
      increasingly busy city lifestyle leaves little time for family gatherings and communication.&#xD;
      A recent census by the Hong Kong government showed that nearly 50% of respondents never, or&#xD;
      only occasionally, listened to their parents' concerns or heeded their advice on important&#xD;
      matters; and over 50% rarely or never listened to their siblings' views or gave them advice&#xD;
      on important matters. This lack of communication raises the problem of neglect or&#xD;
      indifferent, rigid relationships within the family, which tend to exert negative effects on&#xD;
      health, happiness and harmony (the 3Hs). For these reasons, the School of Public Health of&#xD;
      HKU collaborates with the Hong Kong Council of Social Service (HKSCC) to conduct a&#xD;
      district-based mega-project &quot;Happy Family Kitchen&quot;, which using &quot;eating&quot; and &quot;the kitchen&quot; as&#xD;
      a platform, to make the effort to improve effective communication in Hong Kong families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Happy Family Kitchen 1 project (HFK 1 project) was launched in September 2010 with the&#xD;
      mission to promote family health, happiness and harmony (i.e. 3Hs) by advocating positive&#xD;
      family communication. In collaboration with 18 NGOs and SWD (including 23 service units) in&#xD;
      Yuen Long district, the one-year HFK project was completed in August 2011, with the following&#xD;
      achievements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 1,000 families joined the 23 community programs under the project theme of positive&#xD;
           family communication in Yuen Long district.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 professional social work practitioners were equipped with knowledge and skills in&#xD;
           integrating positive psychology and program design through trainer's training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Built-in evaluative research study conducted to examine the project process and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practice wisdom consolidated and shared with the social services sector through a&#xD;
           sharing forum and a specially designed practice manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 10,000 pieces of Happy Family Kitchen Cookbook were distributed to the public with&#xD;
           positive feedback received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Series of media publicity (e.g. news feature, magazine, Roadshow, You tube etc) was&#xD;
           conducted to convey the key message of promoting positive family communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the one-year pilot project, it was observed that substantial impact was&#xD;
      made in various aspects, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Participating Families - over 1,000 families in Yuen Long district participated in the&#xD;
      community programs and learned the ways to enhance the communication with their family&#xD;
      members through the means of dinning together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Social Work Practice - prototype of the practice model adopting positive psychology (i.e.&#xD;
      正向溝通五常法) was successfully piloted with empirical evidence supported. Practice wisdom of&#xD;
      applying such model had been documented as practice manual for future use. Besides,&#xD;
      evidence-based practice approach was promoted by supporting NGOs to integrate theoretical&#xD;
      framework (i.e. positive psychology) and program evaluation into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Community Partnership - district-based collaboration network among NGOs and SWD&#xD;
      established for joint effort in promoting 3Hs in the community. Family-centered approach had&#xD;
      been adopted as the foundation of collaboration among service units of different settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Territory-wide Public Education - the key message on encouraging positive family&#xD;
      communication was disseminated to the whole territory through series of publicity work. The&#xD;
      impact of the project was beyond Yuen Long district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The community-based HFK project was the first of its kind which aimed to integrate the best&#xD;
      social work practice with public health science. Based on the successful experience of the&#xD;
      HKF project in Yuen Long district, it is crucial to think of ways to sustain the project&#xD;
      impact in the longer term. As the enhanced version of the HFK project, HFK2 is going to&#xD;
      answer this question by suggesting three possible ways forward:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) enhancing the existing practice model with evidence support; ii) scaling up the practice&#xD;
      model in wider scope; and iii) strengthening the key message of promoting positive family&#xD;
      communication in the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and objectives The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a district-based&#xD;
      intervention programme (with the application of positive psychology) among families in the&#xD;
      Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi district, on enhancing their family communication and&#xD;
      family 3Hs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To promote family happiness, harmony and health by building capacity for families on&#xD;
      positive communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To enhance and test the practice model integrating positive psychology and family&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To improve and strengthen the community-based service model and keep sustainable&#xD;
      application in the target district&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families participated in a district-based programme that received a positive psychology&#xD;
      intervention (intervention groups) have better family communication and family 3Hs than&#xD;
      families who don't participate in a community-based programme (control group) during 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. The district-based intervention programmes (core session) has significant effect on&#xD;
      improving family communication and 3Hs (intervention 2 versus control) ii. The District-based&#xD;
      intervention programmes (whole dosage, core session +booster) have significant effect on&#xD;
      improving family communication and 3Hs (intervention 1 versus control) iii. Booster&#xD;
      intervention can further improve the family communication and 3Hs compares with non-booster&#xD;
      intervention (intervention 1 versus intervention 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 NGOs and schools will be randomized into three groups respectively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm 1: core session intervention + booster intervention; questionnaire&#xD;
      evaluation is conducted at baseline (T1), post-session (T2), pre-booster (T3) and 3 month&#xD;
      after core session (T4-tea gathering).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm 2: only core session intervention; once finish the T4 evaluation, the&#xD;
      booster can be conducted subsequently. Questionnaire evaluation are conducted at baseline&#xD;
      (T1), post-session (T2), T3 and 3 month after core session (T4- tea gathering).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: waiting list control, only questionnaire evaluations can be conducted at T1(Tea&#xD;
      gathering), T3(Tea gathering) and T4; when finish T4 evaluation, the core session and booster&#xD;
      can be conducted subsequently.&#xD;
