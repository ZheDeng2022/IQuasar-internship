      The goal of the project is to define the prevalence and inflammatory background of&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in school children and determine individual and&#xD;
      environmental risk factors for EIB. The obtained results will provide objective measures on&#xD;
      biological processes leading to bronchoconstriction during exercise, as might be experienced&#xD;
      naturally during the school life. The results could be applied in the management of EIB&#xD;
      patients with or without asthma. The results of planned research will be published in&#xD;
      journals with national and international impact, and presented during symposia and&#xD;
      conferences.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Study design It will be two-step study carried out among school teenagers. In&#xD;
      the first step the school children will be screened for EIB during physical education (PE)&#xD;
      lesson. Inn all children before and after physical exercise (PE) lesson spirometry will be&#xD;
      performed. Children with decreased FEV1 (&gt;=10% from baseline) and/or children with EIB&#xD;
      history within last 12 months (symptoms: dyspnea, cough, wheezes, chest pain during/after&#xD;
      exercises) will be invited to the clinic for future evaluation and qualified to the next step&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second step children with suspected EIB and their parents will be invited to the&#xD;
      clinic. Three visits are planned. Treatment with long acting beta agonists will be stopped 24&#xD;
      hours before each visit; antihistamine treatment will be stopped 21 days before the first&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all children standardized exercise trade mil challenge together with reversibility test&#xD;
      and skin prick tests will be performed. Based on these results children will be divided to&#xD;
      the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children with EIB and asthma (EIB+A+)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children with EIB without asthma (EIB+A-)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children without EIB and asthma (EIB-A+)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children without EIB without asthma (EIB-A-) Second visit Twenty children will be&#xD;
           randomly selected from each group. In all children standardized exercise trade mil&#xD;
           challenge will be performed again together. Blood sample will be taken before and after&#xD;
           challenge together with exhaled breath condensate sample in order to detect markers of&#xD;
           inflammation. Also before and after exercise challenge exhaled nitric oxide will be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit Bronchial provocation challenge with metacholine will be performed in each child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lung function tests Pulmonary function tests Pulmonary function testing will be&#xD;
           performed with a Master Screen unit (Erich Jaeger Gmbh-Hochberg, Germany). Predicted&#xD;
           values for all lung function variables are based on a previous study of healthy controls&#xD;
           provided by the manufacturer of the lung function test equipment. Flow-volume curves&#xD;
           will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society standards. The highest of 3&#xD;
           successful measurements will be taken and analyzed. The results will be expressed as the&#xD;
           percentage of a predicted value. All the subjects will be able to perform spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exhaled nitric oxide measurements The NO measurements will be performed according to&#xD;
           European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) recommendations with a&#xD;
           chemiluminescence analyzer (model 280i nitric oxide analyzer; Sievers, Boulder, CO, USA)&#xD;
           and deaned in parts per billion. The analyzer provides an on-line continuous measurement&#xD;
           of NO in a single exhalation with a detection range of 0.1 to 500 ppb. Environmental NO&#xD;
           will be measured before and after each test and never exceed 5 ppb. All subjects are&#xD;
           studied in the sitting position, without wearing a nose clip. The subjects exhale at a&#xD;
           constant ﬂow rate (50mL/s) from total lung capacity to residual volume without breath&#xD;
           holding. They maintain a constant mouth pressure (17 cm H2O) by monitoring a visual&#xD;
           display in order to eliminate contamination from nasal NO. Dead space and nasal NO&#xD;
           (which are reﬂected by the NO concentration peak during exhalation) and NO from the&#xD;
           lower respiratory tract (determined by the plateau value after the peak) are recorded&#xD;
           automatically by using the manufacturer's software. Three fractional exhaled nitric&#xD;
           oxide (FeNO) measurements of the plateau phase will be obtained, with less than 10%&#xD;
           variation. The mean value of 3 successive, reproducible recordings will be retained for&#xD;
           statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standardized exercise treadmill challenge Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction will be&#xD;
           tested by the use of a motor-driven treadmill (Kettler, Ense-Parsit, Germany) according&#xD;
           to ATS/ERS guidelines. The children will be instructed to run for 8 minutes with a&#xD;
           submaximal exercise load. The exercise test consist of a 2-minute warm-up and 6 minutes&#xD;
           of steady-state running on a treadmill inclined to produce a heart rate of at least 95%&#xD;
           of the maximum predicted for age (calculated as 220 - age [years]). The slope of the&#xD;
           treadmill is 5.5% (3°). Small adjustments in workload (treadmill speed) will be made, if&#xD;
           necessary, to achieve targeted hearth rates. Nasal clips will be used during the test,&#xD;
           and heart rate will be continuously monitored (electronic heart rate scanner; Kettler).&#xD;
           The submaximal run on the treadmill will be performed at the same speed (exercise load)&#xD;
           on both test occasions (at randomization and after 4 weeks of treatment) for each child.&#xD;
           The ambient temperature in the air-conditioned laboratory will be kept stable at 22°C,&#xD;
           and the humidity will be stable between 40% and 50% on each day of the study.&#xD;
           Differences of 1°C in temperature and 5 mg H2 OxL-1 of air humidity on the test days on&#xD;
           each patient will be accepted. 14 FEV1 will be measured before running, immediately&#xD;
           after, and 3, 6, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes after running. Maximum percentage fall in&#xD;
           FEV1 after exercise test will be calculated by using the following formula:&#xD;
           [(pre-exercise FEV1 - lowest postexercise FEV1) /pre-exercise FEV1] x 100. The FEV1&#xD;
           values will be plotted against time for each treatment. The area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
           for the FEV1 values from exercise over the 30-minute period will be calculated by using&#xD;
           a trapezoidal rule. EIB will be defined as a ≥ 15% decrease in FEV1 from baseline within&#xD;
           the first 5 minutes after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exhaled breath condensate EBC samples will be collected through EcoScreen-II device&#xD;
           (Viasys Healthcare GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Samples of exhaled breath condensate (EBC)&#xD;
           will be obtained from children during tidal breathing while wearing a nose clip, as&#xD;
           describe previously [6]. The two-way non-rebreathing valves and tubing to the condenser&#xD;
           will be served as a saliva trap. After collection (during 10min), EBC will be rapidly&#xD;
           frozen in small plastic tubes at -80°C using dry ice and will be stored at -80°C until&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material will be the exhaled breath condensate of children diagnosed with asthma. The&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using Quantibody Human Inflammation Array 3 (RayBiotech, Norcross,&#xD;
      GA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This multiplex ELISA array kit allows&#xD;
      quantitative measurement of 40 human cytokines. Each standard glass slide consists of 16&#xD;
      wells, each with an identical cytokine antibody array. All antibodies and positive controls&#xD;
      will be printed in quadruplicated in every well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first step, the capture antibody is bound to the glass surface of the slide. Next, 100&#xD;
      µl of each patient sample and the aray specific cytokine standards of known concentration are&#xD;
      added to each well. After incubation for 2 hours at the room temperature, the array is washed&#xD;
      5 times with 150 µl of Wash Buffer I and twice with 150 µl of Wash Buffer II, 5 minutes per&#xD;
      wash. Next, the array is incubated for 2 hours with 1.4 ml of the biotin - conjugated&#xD;
      antibody at the room temperature. Then the washing protocol is repeated before the addition&#xD;
      of 80 µl of Cy3 equivalent dye-conjugated streptavidin to each well for 1 hour. After washing&#xD;
      the array, the fluorescence signal is detected and quantified with the Axon GenePix 4000B&#xD;
      scanner and GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). The results will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Q - Analyzer Software (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  metacholine bronchial provocation challenge Metacholine bronchial test of the&#xD;
           provocation will be performed using the dosimeter technique aerosol provocation system&#xD;
           (APS) Pro (Erich Jaeger Gmbh-Hochberg, Germany) with controlled tidal breathing. After&#xD;
           the pulverization physiological diluent, methacholine will be delivered in four&#xD;
           cumulative doses: 0,015 mg, 0,045mg, 0,18mg, 0,72mg. Metacholine based provocation test&#xD;
           (MBPT) is continued with 2-min intervals between the inhalations until a fall in forced&#xD;
           expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) of ≥20% will be obtained. Provocative dose (PD20) is&#xD;
           calculated by linear interpolation on a log-dose-response curve (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in blood sample (5 ml sample): tryptase, lipoxin A4 serum levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  also in the present study blood sample will be taken before and after challenge together&#xD;
           with exhaled breath condensate sample in order to detect markers of inflammation (such&#xD;
           as interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22,&#xD;
           monocyte chemoattractant protein one (MCP1), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2),macrophage&#xD;
           inflammatory protein one alfa (MIP1a), platelet derived growth factor (PDGFBB), tissue&#xD;
           inhibitor of metalloproteinase two (TIMP2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), C&#xD;
           reactive protein (CRP), transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-b1), thymic stromal&#xD;
           lymphopoietin (TSLP) - ELISA and cysteinyl leukotrienes, leukotriene B4 (LTB4),&#xD;
           prostaglandin E2 - high pressure liquid chromatography ((PGE2-HPLC))/mass spectrometry).&#xD;

      Meaning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical assessment/The results of proposed study will allow us to assess the prevalence and&#xD;
      define the inflammatory background of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in school&#xD;
      children. School absence, morbidity, and co-morbidity affecting physical activity will be&#xD;
      verified and undiagnosed patients will be treated. Significance of environmental (tobacco&#xD;
      smoking, type of exercise, temperature and humidity of exercise room) and individual (age,&#xD;
      gender, atopy, obesity, recurrent respiratory truck infections, presence of chronic diseases)&#xD;
      factors will be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New findings/Main findings of study will allow to define primary prevention methods of EIB&#xD;
      without exercise avoidance, and new recommendations for EIB treatment in children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EIB screening in real live environment (during exercise lesson at school) verified by&#xD;
           standardized exercise test in the clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Defining the individual and environmental risk factors of EIB in school children&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Kinetics of inflammatory markers (in exhaled breath condensate and serum) during&#xD;
           exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complex evaluation of clinical and inflammatory profile of patients with EIB&#xD;
           with/without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings in the field/To define markers of inflammation in EIB and possible differences&#xD;
      between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children with/without EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects/The goal of the project is to define the prevalence and inflammatory background of&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in school children and determine individual and&#xD;
      environmental risk factors for EIB. The obtained results will provide objective measures on&#xD;
      biological processes leading to bronchoconstriction during exercise, as might be experienced&#xD;
      naturally during the school life. The results could be applied in the management of EIB&#xD;
      patients with or without asthma. The results of planned research will be published in&#xD;
