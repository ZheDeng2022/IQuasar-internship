    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) on the pain and itching associated with burn injury. This study is part of the&#xD;
      Boston-Harvard Burn Model System. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a decrease&#xD;
      in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation, using a 3 week&#xD;
      stimulation schedule- 2 weeks of stimulation (10 consecutive days) followed by 1 week of&#xD;
      stimulation (5 consecutive days) after three follow up visits at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after&#xD;
      initial course of stimulation. The subject will also have follow ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the second course of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject receives sham during the experiment, he/she may enroll in an open-label portion&#xD;
      of the study and receive 10 days of active stimulation.&#xD;

    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in reducing pain in subjects with neuropathic pain due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) consist consists of a 9 part questionnaire. The questions include the severity of pain levels (worst, least, average, &amp; current), the impact of pain on daily functioning in different areas (mood, walking, relationships, sleep, normal work, &amp; general activity), current treatments and perceived effectiveness of current treatments. The VAS Pain scale is a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine'') measuring patients' worst pain and least pain, on average and at present time.</description>

    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in reducing itch severity/activity in subjects with neuropathic itching due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) .This is a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 indicates no intensity and a 10 indicates unbearable intensity of itching.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in decreasing severity of depression in subjects with neuropathic pain and itching due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3 (total from 0-63). Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in decreasing post-traumatic stress symptoms in subjects with neuropathic pain and itching due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R).This 22-item scale is designed to measure severity of PTS symptoms associated with a traumatic event. Subjects rate their level of distress associated with the event on a 0-4 scale (0 means not at all distressed, 4 means extremely distressed). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) where higher scores represent higher stress</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in decreasing severity of anxiety in subjects with neuropathic pain and itching due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).This is a self-evaluation scale that ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 means no anxiety and 10 means the worst anxiety ever.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in increasing quality of life in subjects with neuropathic pain and itching due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36). There are eight domains total including: bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, physical functioning, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, and role limitations due to mental health issues. Scores for each domain are from 0-100 with a higher score defining a more favorable health outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in increasing community integration functional outcomes in subjects with neuropathic pain and itching due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ). Total CIQ scores were used as the outcome measure. Contains 15 itms assessing community integrations across three domains (Home integration, social integration, productive activity) . The total score can range from 0 to 29 points (0 - minimal integration to 29 -maximal integration). A positive change indicates an improvement in integration.</description>

          <title>Change in Pain Scale</title>
          <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is effective in reducing pain in subjects with neuropathic pain due to burn injury, as measured by changes in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) consist consists of a 9 part questionnaire. The questions include the severity of pain levels (worst, least, average, &amp; current), the impact of pain on daily functioning in different areas (mood, walking, relationships, sleep, normal work, &amp; general activity), current treatments and perceived effectiveness of current treatments. The VAS Pain scale is a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine'') measuring patients' worst pain and least pain, on average and at present time.</description>
