  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation of the morbidly obese is often performed awake. This is performed&#xD;
      after topical anesthesia of the patient's pharynx and larynx. There are many techniques used&#xD;
      to perform topical anesthesia of the patient's airway, which include aerosolization of local&#xD;
      anesthesia, topical application of local anesthesia, and nerve blockade using needles and&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Reasons for failure of any awake tracheal intubation technique is excess&#xD;
      gagging. The most effective method to adequately anesthetize the airway to decrease the&#xD;
      amount of gagging is unknown. The investigators wish to assess if the instillation of local&#xD;
      anesthesia soaked gauze next to the peritonsillar pillars will decrease the number of gagging&#xD;
      episodes during awake video laryngoscopy assisted tracheal intubation of the morbidly obese.&#xD;

      Research design 1.1 Study design Prospective randomized control trial. 1.2 Patients All&#xD;
      morbidly obese patient presenting for bariatric surgery at the Royal Victoria Hospital are&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Exclusions We will exclude any patient with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderate to severe systemic illness, i.e. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#xD;
           score of 4 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inability to communicate in English or French&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  contraindications to the drugs used in the study 1.4 Recruitment Eligible patients&#xD;
           admitted to Royal Victoria Hospital who do not have any of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
           be approached by one of the investigators in the recovery room, or in the preoperative&#xD;
           clinic before the scheduled surgery. The study protocol will be explained and a consent&#xD;
           form will be given to the patients. Patients will have time and opportunity to ask any&#xD;
           questions before the consent will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Study protocol Patients will be prepared for surgery according to the routine guidelines&#xD;
      established by the Departments of Surgery and Anesthesia at the Royal Victoria Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will have an IV and peripheral arterial line inserted, and will have Canadian Anesthesia&#xD;
      Society standard monitors placed. Glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg iv will be given to decrease&#xD;
      secretions. Using a computer generated randomization table, patients will be assigned to a&#xD;
      group that receives standard airway anesthesia with 20 ml of aerosolized 2% lidocaine and&#xD;
      peritonsillar instillation of gauze soaked in normal saline (Control Group) or that receives&#xD;
      20 ml of aerosolized 2% lidocaine and peritonsillar instillation of gauze soaked with 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine (Glossopharyngeal Group). Sedation will be administered using a remifentanyl&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of 0.05 /min with an initial bolus of 0.4Âµg/kg, and intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam 0.05 mg/kg. We will review the chart to obtain patient demographic data including&#xD;
      patient age, height, weight, medications, and past medical histories. Baseline blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, will be recorded, and a blood sample will be drawn for lidocaine level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the airway is topicalized and sedation has taken effect, the anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      insert the video laryngoscope into the patient's oropharynx. Once the ideal view of the vocal&#xD;
      cords is obtained, an endotracheal tube fitted with a stylet will be introduced into the&#xD;
      pharynx, and then slid through the vocal cords into the trachea. During the intubation&#xD;
      attempt, a blinded observer will record the blood pressure and heart rate at every minute,&#xD;
      and the best view obtained with the laryngoscope. The observer will assign the patient a&#xD;
      reaction score (4) at three time points: the insertion of the video laryngoscope, the&#xD;
      pharyngeal insertion of the tracheal tube, and the tracheal insertion of the tracheal tube.&#xD;
      This score will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single change in facial expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grimacing facial expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severe facial grimace, no reflex head movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Severe facial grimace with head movements&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Severe facial grimace with head and limb movements The observer will also record the&#xD;
           time from the insertion of the video laryngoscope, and the first evidence of endtidal&#xD;
           carbon dioxide from the tracheal tube. If the intubation attempt results in a reaction&#xD;
           score of 6, or in an inadequate laryngeal view, the treating anesthesiologist may secure&#xD;
           the airway in any way they see fit, which may include addition of more topical&#xD;
           anesthesia, more sedation, or the use of another airway technique. The number of&#xD;
           attempts at intubation, and any other techniques used for intubation will be recorded.&#xD;
           We will measure lidocaine levels in blood samples every 10 minutes for 40 minutes after&#xD;
           the commencement of the airway anesthesia, using the mass spectrometry method previously&#xD;
           used for similar studies at the Royal Victoria Hospital.&#xD;
