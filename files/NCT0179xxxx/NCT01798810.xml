    <textblock>
      The OXYGEN Study is a double blinded prospective randomized controlled trial that will&#xD;
      compare the proportion of surgical site infections within 6 months in patients treated with&#xD;
      Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compared to those treated without Supplemental&#xD;
      Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the proportion of surgical site infections within 6 months in patients treated&#xD;
      with Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compared to those treated without Supplemental&#xD;
      Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare species and antibacterial sensitivities of the bacteria in the patients who&#xD;
      develop surgical site infections in study patients treated with Supplemental Perioperative&#xD;
      Oxygen compared to those treated without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the previously developed risk prediction model for the development of surgical&#xD;
      site infections after fracture surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure and compare resource utilization and cost associated with surgical site infection&#xD;
      in study patients treated with Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compared to those treated&#xD;
      without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To compare the proportion of surgical site infections within 6 months in&#xD;
      patients treated with Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compared to those treated without&#xD;
      Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The proportion of surgical site infections will be lower for patients treated&#xD;
      with Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim #1: Compare bacterial species and antimicrobial susceptibilities in the&#xD;
      patients who develop surgical site infections in study patients treated with Supplemental&#xD;
      Perioperative Oxygen compared to those treated without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: In the patients who develop infections, the bacterial species and antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility profiles of those treated with Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen will be&#xD;
      similar to those treated without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim #2: To validate the previously developed risk prediction model for the&#xD;
      development of surgical site infections after fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The previously developed RIOTS score will be highly predictive of infection&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim #3: Measure and compare resource utilization and cost associated with surgical&#xD;
      site infection in study patients treated with Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen compared to&#xD;
      those treated without Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Supplemental Perioperative Oxygen will be associated with lower resource&#xD;
      utilization and cost.&#xD;

    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome measure will be the presence of clinically significant surgical site infection (SSI) in the first 26 weeks after surgery, as determined by CDC guidelines.&#xD;
Wound characteristics will also be evaluated using the ASEPSIS score. In this system wounds are scored using the weighted sum of points assigned for predetermined criteria including the need for Additional treatment, presence of Serous drainage, Erythema, Purulent exudates, Separation of deep tissues, the Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of patients Stay (ASEPSIS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catalog and Compare Bacterial Species</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures in this study include culture data in the group that becomes infected. Sensitivities of the isolated bacteria, which are also determined routinely in current clinical practice, will be recorded for analysis.&#xD;
We will also describe the type of antibiotic resistance experienced in both groups. There are 3 specific types of antibiotic resistance that will be analyzed. These have been chosen because they are currently of most clinical importance in the treatment of surgical site infection after civilian fracture surgery.&#xD;
MRSA: Methicillin resistance staph aureus rates will be analyzed.&#xD;
VRE: Vancomycin resistant enterococcus rates will be analyzed.&#xD;
MDR GNR: Multi drug resistant gram negative rates will be analyzed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk Factors for Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our previous work in the pilot study allowed us to propose a novel score to the risk of surgical site infection after high energy fracture surgery: the RIOTS (Risk of Infection for Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery. We will attempt to better validate our previous score on this larger multi-center dataset and further investigate if other risk factors for infection should be included.&#xD;
Data collected includes all demographic characteristics of the patient, the descriptors of the injury, and details of the surgical treatment that would be available prior to the definitive surgery will be collected for analysis regarding determination of a model to predict infection risk in this patient population. These factors have been defined in previous work by this study team.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resource Utilization and Cost</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Previous research has shown that SSI increases length of stay and overall cost of treatment for surgery patients. Three data sets in the case report forms will be used to document medical resource utilization associated with surgical site infections in this trial: initial hospital admission, hospital readmission for SSI, and follow-up visit forms. During scheduled follow-up visits study participants will be queried regarding post-discharge treatment that may be associated with SSI such as antibiotic infusion therapy.</description>
