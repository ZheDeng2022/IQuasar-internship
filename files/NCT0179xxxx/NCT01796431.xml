  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications: tenofovir,&#xD;
      emtricitabine, and rilpivirine in blood after the drug intake has been stopped in order to&#xD;
      understand how long these drugs persist in the blood. The study will specifically look at&#xD;
      blood levels of these three drugs (taken as a 3-in-1 tablet) after taking them every day for&#xD;
      14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the subjects involvement in the study will be up to 23 days plus a screening&#xD;
      visit which will take place up to 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, and a follow up&#xD;
      visit which takes place 16-22 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not randomised which means that all participants will receive all study&#xD;
      medications in the same order. The participant and the study doctor will know which study&#xD;
      medications you are taking at all times during the study.&#xD;
