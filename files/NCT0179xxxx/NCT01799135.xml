  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. A pilot study is done with a small number of participants to see if a&#xD;
      technique works before using it in a larger research study. This pilot study is evaluating a&#xD;
      special kind of MRI scan of the lungs called dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-MRI can demonstrate how much blood flows through the tumor and lungs and tell us how&#xD;
      active the tumor is, as well as how functional the lungs are. As part of this scan,&#xD;
      participants will receive an intravenous (into the blood via puncture of a vein) injection of&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast, a dye that helps us see the tumor and lung tissue more clearly.&#xD;
      Gadolinium is approved by the FDA and is routinely used for MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to determine whether DCE-MRI can provide images of the response of&#xD;
      the tumor and the normal lung tissue to SBRT and to potentially hep improve&#xD;
      treatment-planning methods for patients treated with SBRT in the future. We will also study&#xD;
      how the final DCE-MRI scan compares with another form of imaging, called 4-dimensional&#xD;
      computed tomography (4D-CT), that looks at the breathing capacity of the lungs. Although we&#xD;
      are researching the usefulness of DCE-MRI in early stage non-small cell lung cancer treated&#xD;
      with SBRT in this study, DCE-MRI with the dye injection is not an experimental technology and&#xD;
      is routinely used in the clinic for other indications. The 4D-CT scan is also not&#xD;
      experimental and is used for radiation planning and imaging of the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SBRT you will receive will be standard treatment and will not be affected by your&#xD;
      participation in this study or by these DCE-MRI scans. That means that the findings on the&#xD;
      scan will not be used to alter your planned treatment in any way. Additionally, participants&#xD;
      will undergo the routine work-up prior to SBRT and surveillance studies after treatment is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some&#xD;
      screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. Many of these&#xD;
      tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it&#xD;
      turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these&#xD;
      tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and&#xD;
      procedures include: a medical history, performance status, physical exam, assessment of&#xD;
      tumor, assessment of breathing function and blood tests. We will also confirm that you have&#xD;
      no contraindications to MRIs. If these tests confirm that you are eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the research study, you will begin the study scans. If you do not meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria you will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you qualify for this research study, you will come for the first study visit that will&#xD;
      last about one and a half hours. We will use the first 30 minutes to make sure you can&#xD;
      undergo a MRI scan (MRI screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the MRI scan, we will explain how we want you to breathe during the scan. You will&#xD;
      breathe in small and regular breaths for one part of the exam. In another part of the exam,&#xD;
      you will hold your breath as much as possible and breathe in between breath-holds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An MRI contrast agent called gadolinium will be injected into a vein in your arm through an&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) line. A contrast agent is a dye that is injected into the body to allow for&#xD;
      better visualization (images) during an MRI exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be aked to lie down on your back on a platform that can slide into the scanner. The&#xD;
      scan will last 60 minutes. You will hear a loud knocking or hammering noise while the MRI is&#xD;
      taking pictures, but the process itself will be painless. You will be given disposable&#xD;
      earplugs to help make the noise less noticeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, you will be able to talk to the MRI technician through an intercom. If&#xD;
      you feel too uncomfortable to continue the scan for any reason, the procedure will be&#xD;
      immediately stopped and you will be removed from the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then undergo a standard treatment planning session for SBRT. This will include a&#xD;
      standard 4D-CT scan and a standard planning CT scan. As part of the standard planning CT&#xD;
      scan, an intravenous (IV, through a vein) line will be placed, and you will receive an&#xD;
      injection of IV contrast. The planning process will be conducted exactly as it would if you&#xD;
      were not participating in this research study; it is not experimental in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One to two weeks later, you will start standard SBRT treatment for your early stage non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. This treatment will be delivered exactly as it would if you were not&#xD;
      participating in this research study; it is not experimental in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first treatment, you will undergo your second study DCE-MRI, which is identical to&#xD;
      the initial DCE-MRI scan as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then have two more study visits for the post-treatment research scans. The first&#xD;
      visit will occur 1-2 weeks after completion of SBRT. It will involve a 30-minute routine&#xD;
      clinic visit with your radiation oncologist to assess your recovery from treatment, and then&#xD;
      you will undergo your third study DCE-MRI, which is identical to the DCE-MRI scans described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will then undergo the fourth (final) study DCE-MRI scan 3-4 months after completion of&#xD;
      SBRT. This scan will be identical to the three previous DCE-MRI scans. At this visit, you&#xD;
      will also have a repeat 4D-CT scan which is study related. You will also have a routine&#xD;
      clinic visit with your radiation oncologist at this time. You will then undergo the standard&#xD;
      post-treatment re-evaluation imaging including a repeat PET/CT and a pulmonary function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have completed the DCE-MRI scans, no further study follow-up will be necessary.&#xD;
      However, you will continue with routine follow-up with your radiation oncologist as part of&#xD;
      standard care. You will be in this research study for approximately four months.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility Rate of Using Pulmonary DCE-MRI to Identify Regions of Functional Lung for SBRT Treatment Planning</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be defined as the ability to perform a retrospective comparative treatment planning study using the DCE-MRI images acquired prior to treatment for each participant. Regions of functional and non-functional lung will be defined on each MRI, and the images will be registered to the 4DCT used for treatment planning. The functional-lung contours will be transferred to the 4D-CT based on this registration. the treatment plan will attempt to maximize sparing of functional-lung regions while maintaining adequate target coverage and not exceeding other normal-tissue constraints. The functional-lung based treatment plans generated in this manner will be compared to the corresponding standard plans that were used to treat the patient. Changes in the functional-lung V20 and V5 will be used to analyze changes in functional-lung sparing</description>

        <title>Feasibility Rate of Using Pulmonary DCE-MRI to Identify Regions of Functional Lung for SBRT Treatment Planning</title>
        <description>Feasibility will be defined as the ability to perform a retrospective comparative treatment planning study using the DCE-MRI images acquired prior to treatment for each participant. Regions of functional and non-functional lung will be defined on each MRI, and the images will be registered to the 4DCT used for treatment planning. The functional-lung contours will be transferred to the 4D-CT based on this registration. the treatment plan will attempt to maximize sparing of functional-lung regions while maintaining adequate target coverage and not exceeding other normal-tissue constraints. The functional-lung based treatment plans generated in this manner will be compared to the corresponding standard plans that were used to treat the patient. Changes in the functional-lung V20 and V5 will be used to analyze changes in functional-lung sparing</description>
