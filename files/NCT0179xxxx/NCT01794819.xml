  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness in Russian general practice of C-reactive&#xD;
      protein testing in patients with acute cough or lower respiratory tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to studying the effect of C-reactive protein testing on the prescription of&#xD;
      antibiotics, the purpose is to find out whether the frequency of referral to radiography&#xD;
      could be reduced.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eighteen general practitioners, from both urban and rural offices, were randomised into&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. All registrations were made by general practitioners in&#xD;
      their offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case report form was similar to that used in the GRACE study (Genomics to combat&#xD;
      Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in&#xD;
      Europe (www.grace-lrti.org) describing symptoms, findings, and treatment in lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical examination included a chest examination and the axillary temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the clinical examination, the general practitioners recorded their provisional&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest radiography was accessible for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The C-reactive protein test was performed in the intervention group at both the first and&#xD;
      second consultations. The Afinion test system was used, which provides results within 5&#xD;
      minutes and before treatment was determined. This test is based on solid-phase sandwich&#xD;
      immunometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners could prescribe any treatment, including antibiotics and other drugs&#xD;
      for the cough and additional medication if deemed necessary.&#xD;
