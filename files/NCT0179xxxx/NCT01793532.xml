      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with epilepsy have an epileptic focus, a small part of the brain that is the&#xD;
      starting point of the seizure. This focus is like an irritant or an inflammation, and helps&#xD;
      cause the seizure. People with epilepsy that affects the temporal lobe of the brain often&#xD;
      have an epileptic focus. Researchers want to look at the epileptic focus by using a drug that&#xD;
      attaches to a protein associated with inflammation. An imaging study with the drug will show&#xD;
      how much inflammation is in the area of the brain where the seizures start. The drug, called&#xD;
      [11C]DPA-713, will be tested for its effectiveness in people with temporal lobe epilepsy. Its&#xD;
      effects will be compared with imaging studies given to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if [11C]DPA-713 can show the inflammation in the epileptic focus of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have temporal lobe epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have three outpatient visits to the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
           Clinical Center. The visits will last from 2 to 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, neurological exam, and medical&#xD;
           history. Blood samples will be collected before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This scan will be used&#xD;
           to look at brain chemistry and function. The study drug will be given during the scan to&#xD;
           see how well it shows points of inflammation in the brain. Some participants will&#xD;
           provide additional blood samples during the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This scan will look&#xD;
           at the structure of the brain.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is highly expressed in activated microglia and reactive&#xD;
      astrocytes in brain, and it may, thereby, be a useful biomarker of neuroinflammation. We&#xD;
      developed [11C]PBR28 as a positron emission tomographic (PET) radioligand to bind to TSPO and&#xD;
      measure its density. The purpose of this study is to assess a new TSPO radioligand,&#xD;
      [11C]DPA-713, and to compare it with [11C]PBR28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although [11C]PBR28 has high in vivo specific signal, it is very sensitive to the high and&#xD;
      low affinity states of TSPO, which are caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in&#xD;
      the fourth exon of the TSPO gene. This co-dominant mutation yields three genetic groups: HH,&#xD;
      HL, and LL, where H is the high-affinity form and L is the low affinity form. The frequency&#xD;
      of the L allele is approximately 30%; thus, the frequency of the LL homozygote is&#xD;
      approximately 9%. The affinity of PBR28 to H and L forms differs about 50 fold; thus, LL&#xD;
      carriers provide no measureable signal in brain from [11C]PBR28. In contrast, the affinity of&#xD;
      DPA-713 differs by only four-fold and LL carriers provide measureable brain uptake, although&#xD;
      diminished in comparison to HH and HL carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently reported that [11C]PBR28 binding is increased in epileptogenic mesial temporal&#xD;
      lobe in HH and HL carriers, using the ratio of brain uptake in ipsilateral and contralateral&#xD;
      regions. This study will compare [11C]DPA-713 and [11C]PBR28 in two ways. First, what is the&#xD;
      relative robustness of absolute quantitation of TSPO in healthy subjects and patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy, using an arterial input function and pharmacokinetic modeling? Second, what is the&#xD;
      relative sensitivity of [11C]DPA-713 and [11C]PBR28 to detect the seizure focus in patients&#xD;
      with epilepsy and measured as the ratio of brain uptake ipsilateral and contralateral to the&#xD;
      seizure focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will study a total of 30 patients with epilepsy and 30 healthy human volunteers&#xD;
      using [11C]DPA-713. Studies with [11C]PBR28 in the same subjects will be performed under&#xD;
      other protocols, including 12-N-0182 ( Positron emission tomography measurement of&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and P-glycoprotein in localization-related epilepsy, PI: W. Theodore).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      For absolute quantification of TSPO, 10 patients with epilepsy and 25 healthy controls will&#xD;
      have arterial blood sampling concurrent with PET imaging using [11C]DPA- 713. Scans of&#xD;
      healthy subjects will also be used to study effect of the polymorphism to the binding of&#xD;
      [11C]DPA- 713. The subjects will choose to undergo the PET scan with or without the arterial&#xD;
      line. Most, but not all, subjects will also have a scan with [11C]PBR28 under another&#xD;
      protocol. LL homozygotes would be excluded from [11C]PBR28 but would be included with&#xD;
      [11C]DPA- 713.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For detection of increased TSPO receptor binding in epileptogenic foci as a ratio of&#xD;
      ipsilateral to contralateral regions, about 20 patients with epilepsy will be studied with&#xD;
      [11C]DPA-713. Since the ratio of brain uptake will also be obtained as part of absolute&#xD;
      quantitation in ten patients, this ratio of brain uptake will require an additional ten&#xD;
      subjects, who would not require an arterial catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for dropouts and data variability, we request a ceiling of 30 epilepsy patients&#xD;
      (about 10 of whom will have an arterial line) and 30 controls. All subjects will have blood&#xD;
      drawn to genotype the TSPO SNP and to perform in vitro radioligand binding to TSPO on&#xD;
      lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess absolute quantitation of TSPO with [11C]DPA-713, we will primarily use two outcome&#xD;
      measures: the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume calculated with&#xD;
      compartmental modeling. By comparing data of HH, HL, and LL, we will also estimate&#xD;
      nondisplaceable distribution volume. To assess the sensitivity of [11C]DPA-713 to localize&#xD;
      the epileptogenic focus, we will compare ratio of brain uptake in medial temporal lobe,&#xD;
      ipsilateral and contralateral to the seizure focus.&#xD;
