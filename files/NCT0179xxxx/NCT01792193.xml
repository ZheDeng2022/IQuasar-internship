  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous work, the investigators analyzed the concentration of gut-derived peptides&#xD;
      (ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide [PP]) in serum of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that the secretion pattern differs between PD patients and&#xD;
      controls. Beside ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide other gut-derived peptides (e.g.&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-Peptide 1[GLP-1], Amylin, etc.) might be relevant for PD as well. The rational&#xD;
      to investigate gut-derived peptides in the neurological disorder Parkinson's disease (PD) is&#xD;
      based on the following considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receptors for gut-derived peptides are expressed in Central Nervous System (CNS)&#xD;
           structures that are affected by the neurodegenerative process underlying Parkinson's&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gut-derived peptides are involved in the modulation of higher brain functions (mood,&#xD;
           cognition, reward-related behaviour) that are frequently altered in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secretion of gut peptides is (co-)regulated by the vagal nerve that is dysfunctional&#xD;
           in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Certain gut-derived peptides (ghrelin, GLP-1) stimulate neurogenesis and might be able&#xD;
           to prevent cell death in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of CSF and serum samples in a standardized way in order to quantitatively measure&#xD;
      the concentration of gut-derived peptides (ghrelin, leptin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic&#xD;
      peptide [GIP], GLP-1, amylin, PP, peptide YY [PYY], and insulin). Scientific questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do CSF (and serum) concentrations of these gut peptides differ between PD patients and&#xD;
           controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do CSF (and serum) concentrations of the investigated peptides correlate with clinical&#xD;
           and / or epidemiological characteristics of the investigated subjects (age, gender, BMI,&#xD;
           disease duration, severity of motor impairments, presence of non-motor symptoms,&#xD;
           co-morbidities, medication, etc.)?&#xD;

    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed only once, after an overnight fast between 7 and 8 AM. Study-related procedure will be performed on one singel day. There will be no follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>CSF and corresponding serum samples will be collected in the fasting state in the morning. A standardized collection of the samples is crucial to avoid potential confounders (daytime, metabolic state, etc.). Samples will be frozen immediately and kept at minus 20째C until analysis. Samples will be analysed using a multiplex approach.</description>
