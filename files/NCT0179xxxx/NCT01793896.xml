    <textblock>
      Both dietary caloric restriction (CR) and physical exercise (PE) exert beneficial effects,&#xD;
      which retard or prevent age-related diseases and prolong life span. Subjects with the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome age prematurely, therefore preventive measures should be initiated early.&#xD;
      The present study intends to demonstrate that physical exercise and/or Mediterranean diet, in&#xD;
      middle aged volunteers with the metabolic syndrome, preserve adequate adipose tissue&#xD;
      functionality and retard skeletal muscle aging (assessed by mitochondrial biogenesis and&#xD;
      accumulation of ROS), by activating several pathways, homologous to CR. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to study this by using two approaches: 1) A cross- sectional model, in which the&#xD;
      expression of the mentioned metabolic mediators, indicators of muscle mitochondrial&#xD;
      biogenesis and muscle oxidative damage will be compared between men with different body&#xD;
      compositions, fat distribution, muscle strength and exercise capacity (VO2max). Also, in&#xD;
      these men the investigators will assess the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in&#xD;
      subcutaneous white adipose tissue (as a measure of adaptive thermogenesis), and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers (Interleukin 1-6, Interleukin 1ß and CCL2 chemokine (C-C motif ligand 2)) in&#xD;
      preperitoneal adipose tissue, plus inflammation and adipogenesis potential of their cultured&#xD;
      preadipocytes. Moreover, in vitro studies will evaluate the functional effects of exposure of&#xD;
      a cell lyne of human adipocyte cells (LS14)to factors secreted by media conditioned by the&#xD;
      patients´ adipose tissue explants. 2) A prospective intervention in overweight/moderately&#xD;
      obese middle aged volunteers that will be assigned to a weight-maintenance period (as a&#xD;
      control group), and then randomly y assigned to a Mediterranean diet, exercise training or&#xD;
      diet plus training. Before and after 3 months of intervention the investigators will obtain&#xD;
      muscle tissue samples to study the expression of Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor&#xD;
      (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), AMP activated protein&#xD;
      kinase (AMPK), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1), mitochondrial DNA and oxidative damage indicators&#xD;
      (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (oxodG), carboxymethyllysine (CML and its receptor&#xD;
      (RAGE)). In vitro studies will evaluate the effect of circulating factors from the patients&#xD;
      (serum) on LS14 inflammatory and adipogenic potential, at baseline and after 3 months of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>selected subjects will adopt a Mediterranean low-AGE diet. We will not include red wine in the Mediterranean diet (7 Kilocalories (KCal)/g), in order to attain more weight loss. Each subject will be instructed to reduce 500 Kcal of their estimated total daily energy requirements, so theoretically they will be able to reduce 5 - 10 % of their body weight in 3 months.</description>
