  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem among children and women in developing&#xD;
      countries. Despite ongoing national program of supplementing pregnant women with iron-folate,&#xD;
      prevalence of anemia is 39% among pregnant women and 78% among infants in Bangladesh. Vitamin&#xD;
      B12 deficiency is a more prevalent cause of megaloblastic anemia than folate in many&#xD;
      developing countries. This data raises the interest to address the role of vitamin B12&#xD;
      deficiency in nutritional anemia. Low dietary intake of animal products, a predominant source&#xD;
      of vitamin B12 may cause anemia. Besides maintaining normal erythropoiesis, B12 is essential&#xD;
      for immune function. However, no studies have evaluated the effect of maternal B12&#xD;
      supplementation on reduction of anemia and improving immunity of their infants. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that vitamin B12 supplementation plus iron-folate during pregnancy&#xD;
      and 3-mo postpartum would: (a) Decrease anemia among mothers and infants; (b) Improve vaccine&#xD;
      specific cellular and humoral immune responses among mothers; (c) Improve vaccine specific&#xD;
      immunity in infants by passive transfer; (d) Improve DNA methylation and one-carbon&#xD;
      metabolism in mother-child pairs; (e) Reduce antenatal/postnatal depression. Results from&#xD;
      this study will guide and provide support to the policy makers to identify effective&#xD;
      strategies to reduce nutritional anemia in population at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct a double-masked placebo controlled trial to investigate the&#xD;
      added effect of vitamin B12 on the iron-folate supplementation among pregnant women. Anemic&#xD;
      (Hb level &lt;11.0 g/dl) mothers at 11-14 weeks of gestation will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      supplement group will receive 250 ug vitamin B12 plus 400 ug folate and 60 mg iron; placebo&#xD;
      group will receive folate and iron only. This daily supplementation will continue up to 3-mo&#xD;
      postpartum. At 26-28 wk of gestation mothers will be given inactivated influenza vaccine.&#xD;
      Data on anthropometric indices of mothers and children, birth size, infant growth and&#xD;
      morbidity (mothers and children) throughout the study period will be recorded. 24-h dietary&#xD;
      recall data will be collected from the mothers bimonthly throughout the study. Biochemical&#xD;
      indicators of anemia including Hb, vitamin B12, ferritin, folate and α-glycoprotein (AGP)&#xD;
      will be assessed in plasma of mothers (pre- and post-supplementation) and infants (cord blood&#xD;
      and 3-months). Additional measurements include serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) in plasma&#xD;
      and methyl malonic acid (MMA) and total homocysteine (tHcy) in the urine of mothers. Plasma&#xD;
      vaccine specific antibody responses will be measured in mothers (pre- and post&#xD;
      supplementation) and in infants (cord blood and 3-months). In breast milk, B12, folate and&#xD;
      s-IgA will be determined. Genetic polymorphism (one-carbon metabolism) and DNA methylation&#xD;
      will be studied in mothers and in cord blood.&#xD;

      Study Area: A maternity clinic in Mirpur with substantial numbers of pregnant women enrolling&#xD;
      each month (about 300-400/month) will be selected for recruitment of local pregnant women.&#xD;
      The community in Mirpur has a low out-migration rate. Pregnant women attending the clinic at&#xD;
      11-14 weeks of gestation and planning to deliver at the clinic to ensure safe delivery will&#xD;
      be selected. The structured service and standard antenatal care of the clinic for safe&#xD;
      delivery and antenatal care will be provided to each study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Pregnant women (n=120) will be screened during 11-14 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
      Infants (n=120) at 3 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb level in the range of 7.0-11 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: 22-35 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers at the beginning of second trimester (i.e. at 11-14 weeks of gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to stay in Dhaka during pregnancy and willing to get admitted in the clinic for&#xD;
           delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported Last Menstrual Period (LMP) and urine pregnancy test will be used to&#xD;
           determine the gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with severe anemia; hemoglobin concentration &lt;7.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History or presence of systemic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H/O of previous complicated pregnancies or of pre-term delivery, abortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receipt of influenza vaccine Definition: According to WHO, anemia is defined as a&#xD;
           hemoglobin concentration &lt;12 g/dL in adult women. Anemia is further categorized as mild&#xD;
           (10-11.9 g/dL), moderate (7.0-9.9 g/dL) and severe (&lt;7.0 g/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind controlled trial; After informed consent is obtained, pregnant&#xD;
      women will be randomly assigned either to Placebo group (N=60) that will receive 60 mg of Fe&#xD;
      and 400µg of folate daily or Supplementation group (N=60) that will receive 250 µg of vitamin&#xD;
      B12 in addition to 60 mg of Fe and 400µg of folate. A third party (GlaxoSmithKline,&#xD;
      Bangladesh) will prepare and supply vitamin B12 or placebo capsule in bottles. The two&#xD;
      capsules will be similar in appearance and taste. They will label the bottles as A and B. The&#xD;
      responsible personnel from the Company will keep it confidential until the end of study. The&#xD;
      capsule either A or B to be received by the 1st participant will be determined by a lottery,&#xD;
      and thereafter every alternate participant will receive that capsule. The IDs of the&#xD;
      participants will be given sequentially. The daily supplementation of iron-folate as well as&#xD;
      of B12 will continue up to 3-months postpartum. At 26-28 weeks of gestation, all mothers will&#xD;
      receive a single inactivated, trivalent influenza virus vaccine intramuscularly (IM).&#xD;
      Standard inactivated trivalent influenza as recommended by WHO for the Northern Hemisphere&#xD;
      will be obtained from commercial sources for this project (GlaxoSmithKline; Dresden,&#xD;
      Germany). Field workers (FW) will deliver two weeks' dose of either placebo or supplements to&#xD;
      mothers in person and will check the compliance by card and left over pills. The pregnant&#xD;
      women will be clearly instructed about the times for their subsequent follow-up visits, and&#xD;
      when followed up in respective homes they will be reminded of the dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine Service: The routine care provided by the clinic includes Hb measurement, physical&#xD;
      examination (weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, abdominal check-up, fetal heart rate,&#xD;
      ultrasonographic examination as necessary), counseling on diet, descriptions of normal&#xD;
      procedures during pregnancy, associated potential complications, how and when to go to the&#xD;
      clinic during such events etc. This service is provided by the clinic physician with&#xD;
      assistance from the nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens: Fasting peripheral blood will be collected from mothers at 11 to 14 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, cord blood at delivery, colostrums within 24 hours and breast milk and peripheral&#xD;
      blood from mothers after three months postpartum. Peripheral blood from infants will be&#xD;
      collected at three months of age. Blood will be collected in anticoagulant (EDTA) coated&#xD;
      tubes and layered on Ficoll-paque for density gradient centrifugation; plasma will be&#xD;
      separated from the top and stored at -70ºC for later analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMC) will be separated for studying cellular immune responses. Urine will be&#xD;
      collected from mothers at 11 - 14 weeks of gestation and at three months. For gene based&#xD;
      studies, the DNA samples will be delinked and the identity will be made anonymous according&#xD;
      to the standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Total hemoglobin (Hb) in whole blood will be measured by spectrophotometry using&#xD;
      Drabakins Reagent (Sigma Diagnostics). Standardized blood smear stain will be used for&#xD;
      evaluating megaloblastic anemia (presence of macroovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils).&#xD;
      Ferritin, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) and α-glycoprotein (AGP) will be measured in&#xD;
      plasma by enzyme immune assays. Vitamin B12 and folate in plasma and vitamin B12 in breast&#xD;
      milk will be assayed in Roche autoanalyzer Cobas e411. Urinary methyl malonic acid (MMA) will&#xD;
      be measured by fluorescence detector assisted HPLC method (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO.&#xD;
      Briefly MMA will be extracted from urine sample with ethyl acetate. The extract is dried and&#xD;
      derivatized with monodansylcadaverine and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide prior to injection on the&#xD;
      HPLC. Ethylmalonic acid will be used as an internal standard. Influenza vaccine-specific&#xD;
      antibody responses (IgA, IgG) in plasma and colostrum/ breast milk [secretory IgA (s-IgA)]&#xD;
      will be measured by ELISA. PBMC will be stimulated with Flu vaccine for blastogensis&#xD;
      response. Genomic DNA methylation will be measured by the methyl acceptance assay based on&#xD;
      the ability of isolated DNA to &quot;accept&quot; radiolabeled methyl groups from S-[3H-methyl]&#xD;
      adenosylmethionine, using the bacterial CpG methyltransferase SssI. Total homocysteine (tHcy)&#xD;
      will be measured in urine samples by using HPLC with fluorimetric detection in which Thiols&#xD;
      in the column effluent are detected by a single gold-mercury electrode. NaBH4 is used as a&#xD;
      reductant, and no derivatization of sample is required. Mutations in the ALPL, MTHFR C677T&#xD;
      and FUT2 genes will be determined by PCR- RFLP assay and DNA sequencing. All these assays&#xD;
      will be performed in the Nutritional Biochemistry Lab which has the facilities to determine&#xD;
      the biochemical markers of anemia, vaccine specific antibody responses, DNA methylation and&#xD;
      polymorphism assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of anthropometry and morbidity: Maternal anthropometrical measurements will be&#xD;
      taken at the beginning of supplementation and monthly during the post supplementation period&#xD;
      by trained FWs. Birth weight and recumbent length will be taken within 72 hours after birth&#xD;
      and monthly measurements will be taken by FW up to 3 mo of age. At each visit (fortnightly),&#xD;
      Field Research Assistant (FRA) will collect data from mothers on morbidity of mothers and&#xD;
      their infants (e.g. diarrhoea, respiratory infections, skin diseases, assessment of severity&#xD;
      of disease episodes) of the previous 7 days using structured questionnaires. The FRAs will&#xD;
      inform the women about the times of the first and subsequent follow-up visits, and ensure if&#xD;
      they have understood clearly. In addition, study participants will be contacted over cell&#xD;
      phones when available to remind them about the visit dates. When followed up in respective&#xD;
      homes, they will be reminded of the next visit dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression score: Participants will be interviewed on their mental status using the Centre&#xD;
      for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 20&#xD;
      items comprising six major aspects of depression: depressed mood, hopelessness,&#xD;
      worthlessness, fatigue, appetite and sleep disturbances. It was translated to Bengali and&#xD;
      piloted in earlier studies and involves how the women felt during the preceding 7 days. It&#xD;
      has been previously used in rural and urban Bangladeshi women (Hamadani, unpublished data)&#xD;
      and found to correlate sensibly to children's growth and development. The FRAs will be&#xD;
      extensively trained to interview the women and inter-observer reliabilities will be obtained&#xD;
      before and during the study. The interview will be conducted twice at the homes of the women&#xD;
      during FRAs' visits, first at baseline and at 3 mo postpartum. The data will be analyzed and&#xD;
      interpreted by one of the co-investigators (JDH) who has knowledge and experience in dealing&#xD;
      with this type of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food security and dietary diversity: The effect of food insecurity on food intake, health and&#xD;
      nutritional status has been observed in many developing countries showing significantly lower&#xD;
      total daily per capita food expenditures in food-insecure households than food-secure&#xD;
      households. Food insecurity was associated with maternal anxiety and depression, which can&#xD;
      have strong negative influence on infant care practices including breastfeeding duration as&#xD;
      well as child nutritional status. About half of the Bangladeshi population is food-insecure.&#xD;
      Hunger and childhood malnutrition in Bangladesh are among the highest in the world. About 31%&#xD;
      of the rural population in Bangladesh suffers from &quot;chronic poverty&quot; and about 19% of rural&#xD;
      households cannot have &quot;full three meals&quot; a day. Thus, household food insecurity in relation&#xD;
      to its enormous impact on health and nutritional status on human is a growing concern in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. Household food security status and dietary diversity of the study participants&#xD;
      (including maternal dietary energy, protein, vitamin B-12 and folate intake) will be assessed&#xD;
      first, at the baseline when the pregnant women will be enrolled in the study and thereafter&#xD;
      fortnightly throughout the study. USDA food composition database will be used for assessing&#xD;
      vitamin B-12 intake. Any seasonal variation of the food security status will be assessed that&#xD;
      might have significant impact on the outcome measures. Structured questionnaire on food&#xD;
      security module will be used to measure household food security status. The FRAs will be&#xD;
      trained to interview the women; they will take interviews when they make visits during the&#xD;
      antenatal and postnatal periods at the home. The data will be analyzed and interpreted by one&#xD;
      of the co-investigators (KKS) who has knowledge and experience in dealing with this type of&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
