    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of everolimus,&#xD;
      letrozole, and metformin can help to control recurrent or progressive endometrial cancer. The&#xD;
      safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is designed to block a protein inside cancer cells that is involved in cancer&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is designed to block a protein from making estrogen. This may interfere with the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is commonly used to control blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. It is&#xD;
      designed to lower insulin levels, which may slow or stop the growth of endometrial cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you are not already taking&#xD;
      metformin, you will take metformin before you begin the regular study cycles (Cycles 1 and&#xD;
      beyond). This will be called &quot;Cycle 0.&quot; You will take metformin by mouth 1 time a day on Days&#xD;
      1-4 of Cycle 0 and then 2 times a day (about 12 hours apart) every day after that. You will&#xD;
      take metformin for 7-10 days in Cycle 0 before Cycle 1 begins. If you are already taking&#xD;
      metformin, you will continue your regular dose and start Day 1 of Cycle 1. If you are already&#xD;
      taking metformin but your dose is less than 1000mg/day, your dose will be slowly raised up to&#xD;
      the study dose over the course of 7-10 days and then you will start Cycle 1. In Cycles 1 and&#xD;
      beyond, all participants will take all 3 drugs at a time. You should take metformin with&#xD;
      food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting in Cycle 1, you will take everolimus 1 time a day by mouth at about the same time&#xD;
      every day. You should take it either consistently with food every day or consistently without&#xD;
      food every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting in Cycle 1, you will take letrozole 1 time a day by mouth at about the same time&#xD;
      every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important for you to take the study drugs just as the study doctor tells you. Do&#xD;
      not skip any doses unless your study doctor tells you to skip doses. If you throw up after&#xD;
      taking the study drugs, you should NOT take another tablet that day. Let your study doctor&#xD;
      know that you got sick. If you forget to take the study drugs one day, do not take any extra&#xD;
      doses the next day. Call your study doctor and ask for advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 weeks in each cycle (except Cycle 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every cycle (+/- 10 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check for&#xD;
           hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycles 2, 4, and 6 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 9, 12, 15, and so on)&#xD;
      (+/- 10 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have scans such as a CT scan and/or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have chest disease, you will have a CT scan of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease could be felt in the pelvis at the beginning of the study, you will have&#xD;
           a pelvic exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every other cycle (Cycles 2, 4, and so on), blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital&#xD;
           signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have scans such as a CT scan and/or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have chest disease, you will have a CT scan of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits as often as the doctor thinks is needed. At every visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have scans such as a CT scan and/or MRI to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have chest disease, you will have a CT scan of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As often as the doctor thinks is needed, the study staff will call you to ask about side&#xD;
      effects you may have had. These calls should last 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat kidney, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Letrozole is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available to treat breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Metformin is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available to treat diabetes. The combination of everolimus, metformin, and&#xD;
      letrozole in this study to treat endometrial cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 64 patients will be enrolled in this study. Up to 59 may take part at MD Anderson. Up&#xD;
      to 5 patients per site may be enrolled at MD Anderson Cooper and Spartanburg Regional&#xD;
      Healthcare System and Harris Health System.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically-confirmed advanced or recurrent endometrial&#xD;
             carcinoma (endometrioid and mixed tumors, any grade) that is refractory to curative&#xD;
             therapy or established treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have had no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for recurrent&#xD;
             management of endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with&#xD;
             primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer is not counted as a prior treatment for&#xD;
             recurrent or advanced disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior radiation therapy of any kind is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 defined as at least one&#xD;
             target lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (&gt;/=10mm&#xD;
             longest dimension to be recorded; Lymph nodes must be &gt;/=15 mm per short axis). Each&#xD;
             lesion must be &gt; 20 mm when measured by palpation or conventional imaging techniques&#xD;
             (CT or MRI - based on primary physician preference) or &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
             Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice thickness in millimeters. Tumors&#xD;
             within a previously irradiated field will be designated as non-target lesions unless&#xD;
             progression is documented. Ascites and pleural effusions are not considered measurable&#xD;
             disease. If the measurable disease is confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic&#xD;
             nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must not be of child-bearing potential. Patients are considered not of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a total&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal for greater than 12 months. Patients in whom ovaries are present and&#xD;
             were not previously menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum&#xD;
             estradiol &lt;10 pm/mL to confirm ovarian senescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be off all other anti-tumor therapies (including immunologic or hormonal&#xD;
             agents) for at least four weeks prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Age &gt;/= 18 years&#xD;

             10^9/L, Hb &gt;9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate liver function as shown by: a. serum bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN b. ALT and AST&#xD;
             &lt;/= 2.5x ULN (&lt;/= 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases); Adequate renal&#xD;
             function:serum creatinine &lt; 1.4mg/dL (per manufacturer, metformin is contraindicated&#xD;
             in the presence of renal dysfunction defined as a serum creatinine&gt; 1.4 mg/dL in&#xD;
             females and in patients with abnormal clearance) ; Fasting serum cholesterol &lt;/= 240&#xD;
             mg/dL OR &lt;/=7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN. NOTE: In case one or&#xD;
             both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after&#xD;
             initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
