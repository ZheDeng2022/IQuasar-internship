  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Suubi+Adherence is to examine the impact and cost associated with an innovative&#xD;
      intervention to increase adherence to HIV treatment for HIV-infected adolescents. Multiple&#xD;
      intervention studies by our team in Rakai and Masaka Districts of southern Uganda with&#xD;
      AIDS-orphaned adolescents have revealed that if given an opportunity to participate in&#xD;
      economic empowerment interventions, youth and their caregivers take full advantage of these&#xD;
      interventions to save and invest in their future, show improvements in family financial&#xD;
      outcomes, future aspirations, health functioning, sexual-risk taking behaviors, and mental&#xD;
      health. The Suubi+Adherence study capitalizes on this prior work, positing that economic&#xD;
      empowerment may be a missing, yet critical ingredient to HIV treatment adherence&#xD;
      interventions for adolescents and young people. Suubi+Adherence incorporates an economic&#xD;
      empowerment design, with a savings-led income generating component, to promote economic&#xD;
      stability, and apply it to adherence to HIV treatment regimens for HIV-positive adolescents&#xD;
      in a region of southern Uganda with the highest HIV incidence and prevalence in the country.&#xD;
