    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of and the body's immune response to experimental HIV&#xD;
      vaccine regimens using different vaccine priming combination, and boosting with the vaccines&#xD;
      NYVAC and AIDSVAX® B/E.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although multiple candidate HIV vaccines are being studied, there is not yet an effective&#xD;
      preventive HIV vaccine. This study will test 4 experimental HIV vaccine regimens, each&#xD;
      boosting with the NYVAC + AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine combination. Priming will be done with NYVAC&#xD;
      or DNA vaccines, alone or in combination with AIDSVAX® B/E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 96 healthy participants, ages 18 - 50 years. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. In each group, there will be 20 participants who receive&#xD;
      the vaccine regimen and 4 receiving only placebo. Injections will take place at months 0, 1,&#xD;
      3, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will enroll simultaneously. Enrollment will be restricted to a maximum of 2&#xD;
      participants per day, with no more than (1) participant in group 1 or 2 and (1) participant&#xD;
      in group 3 or 4 until 20 participants have been enrolled with 5 in each group (4 vaccine&#xD;
      recipients and 1 placebo recipient in each group). The HVTN 096 PSRT will review the safety&#xD;
      and immune response data for the first 168 hours postvaccination on each of these&#xD;
      participants, and will determine whether it is safe to proceed with full enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration will be 60 months: 18 months of clinic visits followed by annual health&#xD;
      contacts to a total of 5 years after initial study injection. At the screening visit,&#xD;
      participants will give a medical history and undergo a complete physical exam, cardiac&#xD;
      symptom assessment (including ECG), urine collection, blood collection, interview, HIV test,&#xD;
      and pregnancy test (for participants who were born female). On Days 0, 28, 84, and 168&#xD;
      participants will receive intramuscular (IM) vaccination (vaccine or placebo) into the right&#xD;
      and left deltoids. On vaccination visits, participants will also undergo an abbreviated&#xD;
      physical exam, cardiac symptom assessment, Social impact assessment, a pregnancy test (for&#xD;
      participants who were born female), risk-reduction counseling, and blood collection.&#xD;
      Immediately following vaccination, participants will remain in the clinic for observation for&#xD;
      30 minutes; participants will be given a post-vaccination symptom log and instructed on how&#xD;
      to complete it. Follow-up visits will consist of a brief physical exam, blood collection, and&#xD;
      interview; some follow-up visits may also consist of a urine collection, HIV test, or ECG.&#xD;
      Optional mucosal secretion collection, if the participant agrees, will be done on days 0,&#xD;
      168, and 364.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last clinic visit will be at Day 545; after this visit, participants will be contacted&#xD;
      for annual health follow-up consisting of confirming vital status, collecting safety&#xD;
      information, and reporting a new HIV diagnosis or a pregnancy. A clinic visit will only be&#xD;
      required if HIV confirmatory testing is necessary.&#xD;
