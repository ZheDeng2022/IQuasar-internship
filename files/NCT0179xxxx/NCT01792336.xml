      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The brain has natural electrical rhythms of brain activities. These rhythms may be&#xD;
           different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle&#xD;
           movement, cramps, or tremors). Understanding these rhythms may provide more information&#xD;
           about movement disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focal hand dystonia, also known as &quot;writer's cramp&quot; or &quot;musician's cramp,&quot; is a painful&#xD;
           condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial&#xD;
           magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand&#xD;
           dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand&#xD;
           dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will&#xD;
           determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be&#xD;
           in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to&#xD;
           5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will&#xD;
           look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held&#xD;
           on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a&#xD;
           magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right and&#xD;
           left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger muscles,&#xD;
           and see how much TMS is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS involves repeated&#xD;
           magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst.&#xD;
           Participants will have multiple bursts during the test. This test will look at how the&#xD;
           muscles of the hand and fingers respond to brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for focal hand dystonia will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia&#xD;
      by performing an electrophysiological study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
      The study may reveal new information about the role of gamma frequency oscillations in&#xD;
      cortical facilitation in dystonia patients versus healthy volunteer subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study may also help to determine if abnormal gamma frequency&#xD;
      facilitation might become a potential diagnostic tool for dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. We intend to study 13 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with a diagnosis of focal hand&#xD;
      dystonia. Thirteen subjects for each group are needed based on the power analysis, with an&#xD;
      additional three added to the requested accrual to account for drop-outs, yielding a maximum&#xD;
      of 16 subjects per group. Up to 15 focal hand dystonia patients and 15 healthy volunteers may&#xD;
      be involved in the pilot experiment. The pilot study will be stopped when a trend in the data&#xD;
      emerges, so the total number of subjects who participate in the pilot study may end up being&#xD;
      less than the maximum requested accrual of 15. Subjects in the pilot experiment are eligible&#xD;
      to later participate in the main experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be seated with EMG surface electrodes over the First Dorsal Interosseous&#xD;
      (FDI) muscle of each hand monitoring muscle activity. The TMS coil will be placed on the&#xD;
      surface of the head and the region of motor cortex corresponding to the respective hand&#xD;
      muscle control. The baseline motor evoked potential (MEP) for the FDI muscle will be&#xD;
      determined by TMS stimulation and EMG monitoring. A pilot experiment will be performed first.&#xD;
      Conditioning stimuli, consisting of repetitive subthreshold TMS stimulation with three pulses&#xD;
      at one of eight frequencies, will be delivered. A test stimulus, consisting of a single TMS&#xD;
      pulse, will follow the conditioning stimuli at the same interval as the conditioning train,&#xD;
      but at a suprathreshold intensity in order to determine the MEP amplitude. After every 5&#xD;
      subjects the pilot data will be analyzed to check for a trend in the frequencies that lead to&#xD;
      facilitation. Once a trend emerges, the pilot study will be stopped. The four frequencies&#xD;
      with the greatest trend toward facilitation will then be selected and used in the main&#xD;
      experiment. The main experiment will be performed the same way as the pilot experiment, but&#xD;
      will use only the four frequencies found in the pilot experiment. Conditioning stimuli,&#xD;
      consisting of repetitive subthreshold TMS stimulation with three pulses at one of the&#xD;
      selected four frequencies, will be delivered. A test stimulus, consisting of a single TMS&#xD;
      pulse, will follow the conditioning stimuli at the same interval as the conditioning train,&#xD;
      but at a suprathreshold intensity in order to determine the MEP amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the MEP amplitude following TMS conditioning with the baseline MEP amplitude&#xD;
      prior to conditioning. The effect on MEP will then be compared between healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      dystonia patients.&#xD;
