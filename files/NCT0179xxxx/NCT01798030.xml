  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a heightened risk for developing type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed&#xD;
      to sunlight and it is also obtained from the diet and dietary supplements. Older people,&#xD;
      individuals with high skin pigmentation, obese and sedentary individuals have low levels of&#xD;
      Vitamin D because pigmentation blocks Vitamin D production in the skin, aging and physical&#xD;
      inactivity are associated with reduced exposure to sunlight, and obesity is associated with&#xD;
      the storage of Vitamin D in fat preventing its utilization by muscle, bone and other tissues&#xD;
      that require its metabolic action. These conditions are also associated with heightened risk&#xD;
      for developing type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and&#xD;
      osteopenia/osteoporosis in older and obese individuals. This is particularly heightened in&#xD;
      older women who tend to have increased body fat, are more physically inactive and are at high&#xD;
      risk for central obesity and its metabolic consequences of diabetes, hypertension and&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The heightened prevalence of obesity in aging especially in postmenopausal women suggests&#xD;
      that interventions to raise Vitamin D levels might be preventive of these diseases.&#xD;
      Investigators have completed studies of the effects of weight loss and exercise interventions&#xD;
      in approximately 400 older women and men over the last 15 years, many of whom are obese.&#xD;
      Investigators have data on glucose tolerance, blood pressure and bone density in these&#xD;
      studies and stored plasma in which investigators can analyze Vitamin D levels. Vitamin D may&#xD;
      be an important risk factor for these metabolic diseases and the availability of these&#xD;
      samples for Vitamin D analysis will allow investigators to perform a cross-sectional study to&#xD;
      address relationships of Vitamin D levels to glucose intolerance and diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension/blood pressure status, bone mineral density, the degree of obesity, and physical&#xD;
      activity status measured as maximal aerobic capacity and accelerometry in these older men and&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study have the potential to impact clinical practice in the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. This would circumvent&#xD;
      the current dilemma for prevention of these chronic diseases through treatment of obesity, as&#xD;
      these data would provide immediate prospects for changing the recommended doses of Vitamin D&#xD;
      beneficial for reducing risk for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in obese,&#xD;
      older men and postmenopausal women and 2) the association of Vitamin D levels to glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, blood pressure, bone mineral density, and hyperlipidemia, as well as association&#xD;
      with Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms affecting metabolic responses to Vitamin D.&#xD;

      Vitamin D, IGF-1, and PTH levels will be measured in coded plasma samples belonging to the PI&#xD;
      and collaborating Investigators within the GRECC that are stored in our freezers (from&#xD;
      previously approved studies: HP-00040261,HP-00040975, HP-00041166 and HP-00041199) . The&#xD;
      Nutrition Obesity research center genetics core will determine Vitamin D receptor&#xD;
      polymorphisms on de-identified samples. No clinical information will accompany the samples.&#xD;
