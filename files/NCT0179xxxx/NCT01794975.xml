      The primary objective of the study is to further investigate whether striatal [11C]ORM-13070&#xD;
      uptake can be reduced by physiological and pharmacological challenges that increase the&#xD;
      synaptic concentrations of noradrenaline in the human brain. Each subject will undergo 3 PET&#xD;
      scans, a baseline PET scan and two scans with noradrenaline challenges: intravenous&#xD;
      administration of ketamine and oral administration of atomoxetine combined with a cold&#xD;
      pressor test where the subject's foot is placed in an 8 °C water basin. Eight healthy male&#xD;
      subjects will be included in the study.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to further investigate whether striatal [11C]ORM-13070&#xD;
      uptake can be reduced by physiological and pharmacological challenges that increase the&#xD;
      synaptic concentrations of the endogenous alpha2C-adrenoceptor agonist, noradrenaline, in the&#xD;
      human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET will be used to study the effects of two different noradrenaline challenges on the&#xD;
      striatal uptake of the novel alpha2C-adrenoceptor imaging agent, [11C]ORM-13070. Each of the&#xD;
      eight study subjects will undergo one baseline PET scan without any pretreatment and two&#xD;
      scans with two different noradrenaline challenges: i.v. infusion of ketamine and a single&#xD;
      oral dose of atomoxetine combined with cold pressor test. The sequence of the baseline scan&#xD;
      and the other scans for each subject will be based on balanced randomization. Double-blind&#xD;
      administration of the pretreatments will not be possible, but the PET scanning data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by a person who is not aware of the treatment identity. Venous blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for determination of concentrations of the [11C]ORM-13070 tracer and its&#xD;
      radioactive metabolites, the test drugs atomoxetine and ketamine, and endogenous&#xD;
      noradrenaline as a biomarker of the employed challenges. Blood pressure and heart rate will&#xD;
      be measured as physiological indicators of sympathetic activation. Subject safety will be&#xD;
      monitored by vital signs, questioning and clinical observation. The binding potential of the&#xD;
      tracer in the striatum at baseline will be compared with the tracer binding potential after&#xD;
      each of the noradrenaline challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight healthy male subjects will be included in the study. Discontinued subjects may be&#xD;
      replaced by new subjects as decided by the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening visit, there will be an interval of no more than 45 days before the first&#xD;
      PET visit. Each subject will undergo 3 PET scans: a baseline PET scan, and two scans with&#xD;
      noradrenaline challenges. The PET experiments of each subject will be separated by intervals&#xD;
      of at least 5 days. An end-of-study visit will take place within 21 days after the last PET&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Alpha2C-adrenoceptor occupancy in the caudate nucleus and putamen will be assessed&#xD;
      using the PET imaging agent [11C]ORM-13070 after the administration of two noradrenaline&#xD;
      challenges, ketamine and atomoxetine combined with the cold pressor test. Differences in&#xD;
      striatal receptor occupancy of the tracer will be assessed using established reference tissue&#xD;
      models and the binding potentials of the non-displaceable compartment (BPND) according to the&#xD;
      equation: Occupancy = [(BPND bl - BPND challenge) / BPNDbl x 100%]. Plasma noradrenaline&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured as a biochemical biomarker before and after the interventions&#xD;
      to validate the employed noradrenaline challenges. Blood pressure and heart rate will be used&#xD;
      as physiological biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Vital signs, subjective symptoms and ECG will be monitored during the PET visits.&#xD;
      Subjects will remain at the study center for a minimum of 4 h after each PET scan, after&#xD;
      which the subject will be discharged based on clinical evaluation with a safety check list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics: Venous blood samples will be collected for determination of concentrations&#xD;
      of the [11C]ORM-13070 tracer and its radioactive metabolites, and the pretreatment agents&#xD;
      atomoxetine and ketamine at pre-defined time points in order to provide information on the&#xD;
      fraction of intact tracer in blood and to document the exposure to the pharmacological agents&#xD;
      during the PET scans. No formal pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics: Differences in striatal [11C]ORM-13070 uptake between&#xD;
      the baseline condition and the different pretreatments will be considered a primary outcome&#xD;
      variable and statistical analysis will be carried out with analysis of variance. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistical analysis of the tracer fractions in blood during the scans and the concentrations&#xD;
      of the employed pretreatment agents will be carried out. Demographic and other baseline data,&#xD;
      laboratory safety determinations, physical examination, BP, HR, ECG, AEs and concomitant&#xD;
      treatments will be summarised with descriptive statistics or listed.&#xD;
