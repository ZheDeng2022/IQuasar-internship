  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide with a crude incidence of lung&#xD;
      cancer in the European Union of 52/100.000 per year and a mortality of 47/100.000 per year.&#xD;
      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all cases. The five year&#xD;
      survival of NSCLC patients is quite poor (16%), mainly due to patients being diagnosed at&#xD;
      advanced stages. However if lung cancer can be detected and treated at an earlier stage the&#xD;
      outcome and survival is much more favorable with five year survival rates up to 77%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for small volume tumors is surgical resection in medically fit&#xD;
      patients, consisting in lobectomy or pneumonectomy accompanied by a systematic mediastinal&#xD;
      lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy. For the patient population with small volume disease&#xD;
      at early stage surgery offers the potential of local tumor control in up to 96% of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, about one quarter of the patients is medically inoperable because of coexisting&#xD;
      morbidities or poor general condition, mostly the result of a long smoking history and&#xD;
      consecutive chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of IG-SBRT (Image guided&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy) in patients with medically inoperable early stage, centrally&#xD;
      located NSCLC and in those who are not willing to undergo surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess safety of the treatment modality by collecting data about acute and late&#xD;
           toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patterns of local and distant recurrence and relation between the site of local&#xD;
           recurrence and the clinical (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  survival and cause of death&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) has been the standard of care for medically&#xD;
      inoperable NSCLC with prescribed doses of usually 60 - 66 Gy.This moderate irradiation&#xD;
      regimen resulted in a local failure rate of approximately 50% and local failure- not distant&#xD;
      - has been shown to be the most frequent pattern of disease recurrence. Still, conventional&#xD;
      RT resulted in overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) superior to best&#xD;
      supportive care, though it is clearly an insufficient treatment with CSS rates of only about&#xD;
      30% after 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies reported a dose-response relationship for local tumor control: higher&#xD;
      irradiation doses resulted in improved rates of local tumor control which was found to&#xD;
      translate into improved OS. Simultaneously, a dose- response relationship with a&#xD;
      volume-effect relation has been demonstrated for radiation induced pneumonitis, being the&#xD;
      most relevant toxicity after RT. These relations are known to apply to other organs at risk&#xD;
      (OAR)including esophagus and spinal cord. Consequently, traditional target volume concepts&#xD;
      conducting nodal irradiation in clinically node negative patients and traditional RT-&#xD;
      planning and delivery techniques, with low accuracy and broad safety margins, do not allow&#xD;
      the routine application of sufficient irradiation doses due to high toxicity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mid-90s, after encouraging success in the treatment of cerebral malignancies, the&#xD;
      concept of stereotactic RT was taken over from the cranium to the body. Only the primary&#xD;
      tumor was targeted and precise stereotactic tumor localization combined with techniques&#xD;
      reducing breathing- induced target motion allowed small safety margins. These small volumes&#xD;
      were treated with hypo-fractionated, escalated irradiation doses. Since then, the technique&#xD;
      of image guided (IG) -stereotactic body RT (SBRT) also known as Stereotactic Ablative Body&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (SABR) was further developed in multiple clinical and technological aspects e.g.&#xD;
      Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / computed tomography&#xD;
      (FDG-PET/CT) based nodal staging, respiration correlated CT-imaging for target volume&#xD;
      definition and image-guided treatment delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in a large series of patients with stage I NSCLC.&#xD;
      The majority of patients were medically inoperable and SBRT was practiced instead of&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated RT. However, safety of SBRT has been demonstrated even in high&#xD;
      risk patients with advanced age, severe COPD and very poor pulmonary function, which would&#xD;
      have made any curative approach except SBRT difficult or even impossible. On the other side&#xD;
      of the patient spectrum, retrospective studies suggested equivalent outcome compared to&#xD;
      sub-lobar resection, which is confirmed by Markov modelling studies.&#xD;
