  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
      binocular treatment in improving vision in strabismic amblyopes (i.e., patients with lazy&#xD;
      eye, or poor vision in one eye due to a present or former eye misalignment). Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the study treatment either before or after strabismus surgery (i.e.,&#xD;
      corrective eye alignment surgery) or sham treatment before surgery. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that there will be no significant change in vision in neither the pre nor post-surgery groups&#xD;
      and no significant change in vision in neither the sham nor actual treatment groups.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, partially-randomized clinical trial. The patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups, Treatment Group A or Treatment B group. To help minimize bias,&#xD;
      a blinded staff member will perform the visual acuity assessments throughout the study. The&#xD;
      PI and Sub-I's will remain blinded to the treatment groups so that they may perform the&#xD;
      visual exams throughout the study, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had strabismus surgery prior to being recruited will be allowed to&#xD;
      participate in the study and, if eligible, will be automatically assigned to Treatment Group&#xD;
      A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are scheduled to have strabismus surgery at least six weeks from their screening&#xD;
      clinic visit will be allowed to participate, once eligibility is determined. These patients&#xD;
      will be included in Treatment Group B and randomized to either actual treatment or sham&#xD;
      treatment. Each eligible participant will be included in the study and blinded as to which&#xD;
      treatment group s/he has been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be about 7.5 months. All&#xD;
      subjects will have a baseline visit to assess eligibility. Subjects in Treatment Group A will&#xD;
      undergo strabismus surgery, if it was not previously performed, followed by 6 weeks of&#xD;
      binocular treatment and a 3-6 month follow-up period. NOTE: There will be 4-6 weeks between&#xD;
      surgery and the start of treatment to allow for full post-surgery recovery before starting&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects in Treatment Group B will undergo 6 weeks of treatment/sham followed by&#xD;
      strabismus surgery and a 3-6 month follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a treatment effect on vision is found, participants enrolled in the sham treatment arm&#xD;
      will be offered the binocular treatment at the conclusion of the study and following surgery.&#xD;
      Sham participants will be allowed to receive the study treatment so long as they have&#xD;
      completed the study and there is no presence of any new medical condition following surgery&#xD;
      that would be considered reasons for exclusion by the treating physician.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Binocular Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>The binocular treatment involves the completion of visual tasks via virtual reality goggles. The stimulus is presented to each eye separately, allowing for varying levels of contrast to be presented to each eye. (The visual task is therefore made more or less difficult with the variation of contrast presented to either eye.) Subjects will complete the computer-based visual tasks for approximately 36 hours total over the course of six weeks, or six hours per week for six weeks.</description>
