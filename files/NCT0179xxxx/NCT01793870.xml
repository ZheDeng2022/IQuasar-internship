  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, single dose, 4-period, period balanced, crossover&#xD;
      study. There will be at least 5 days between dosing in each session. The study consists of&#xD;
      Screening period (30 days prior to Day 1), Treatment period consisting of 4 dosing periods&#xD;
      (Day 1 is the dosing day and Day 2) and Follow-up period (7-14 days post-last dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed treatment regimen will be A and B (27.5 mg total maximum dose): Single oral dose&#xD;
      of carvedilol 25 mg immediate release tablet and up to 2.5 mg of enriched carvedilol powder&#xD;
      under fasted conditions; C (33.75 mg total maximum dose): Single oral dose of carvedilol&#xD;
      31.25 mg as 25 mg immediate release tablet, a 6.25 mg immediate release tablet and up to 2.5&#xD;
      mg of enriched carvedilol powder under fasted conditions; D (27.5 mg total maximum dose):&#xD;
      Single oral dose of carvedilol 25 mg immediate release tablet and up to 2.5 mg of enriched&#xD;
      carvedilol powder under fed conditions. Approximately 15 subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one of four treatment sequences (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, or DCAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic sampling and safety data will be collected in the Treatment period (Day 1&#xD;
      and 2).&#xD;
