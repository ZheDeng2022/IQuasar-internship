      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that&#xD;
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the&#xD;
      side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different diseases. It&#xD;
      also means that the FDA has not yet approved clofarabine for your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clofarabine is a chemotherapy drug that has been used in the treatment of leukemia in&#xD;
      children and adults. Information from other research studies suggests that this drug may also&#xD;
      be effective in patients with LCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the response rates of participants with recurrent&#xD;
      LCH to clofarabine within each of two strata: a) low-risk participants with disease&#xD;
      reactivation, and b) high-risk participants with risk-organ involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other purposes are to estimate the progression-free survival after clofarabine treatment,&#xD;
      estimate survival of participants with refractory multi-system LCH with risk organ&#xD;
      involvement treated with clofarabine and to describe toxicities of clofarabine in&#xD;
      participants with LCH.&#xD;

      If you are willing to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some&#xD;
      screening test or procedure to find out if you are eligible. Many of these tests and&#xD;
      procedures are likely to be part of regular care and may be done even if it turns out that&#xD;
      you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures&#xD;
      recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include the&#xD;
      following: a medical history, performance status, blood tests, assessment of disease and&#xD;
      pregnancy test. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you&#xD;
      will not be able to participate in this research study. After confirming eligibility you will&#xD;
      also have a bone marrow test, electrocardiogram and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of study treatment. Each treatment cycle will last&#xD;
      approximately 4 weeks. In each cycle, you will receive the study drug clofarabine daily on&#xD;
      the first 5 days (days 1 to 5) and rest for the remaining days. Clofarabine will be&#xD;
      administered into the vein (IV) over two hours in the clinic or in the hospital. If you have&#xD;
      high-risk disease, the dose of clofarabine will be higher during the first two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of each cycle, and at the end of your therapy, you will have a physical exam&#xD;
      and you will be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about any&#xD;
      problems that you are having and any medications you are taking. You will also have blood and&#xD;
      urine tests done to monitor organ functions. You will also undergo an assessment of your&#xD;
      disease by x-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET or bone scans, which wil be performed every two cycles&#xD;
      and at the end of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of the study drug there will be a follow up period. Once every three&#xD;
      months for the first year, twice yearly for the second and third years, and then annually,&#xD;
      you will have a physical exam and be asked questions about your general health. You will also&#xD;
      have blood and urine tests performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice yearly for the first three years, x-ray, CT scan, MRI, PET, and/or bone scans will be&#xD;
      repeated if your doctor feels they are necessary.&#xD;
