      This is a Phase II multicentre study. Patients will be administered eltrombopag 50 mg/daily.&#xD;
      If patients don't achieve response after 2 months of therapy they will stop eltrombopag; if&#xD;
      patients will achieve response after 2 months of therapy, they will continue eltrombopag for&#xD;
      a maximum period of 24 months; 40 patients are needed. In stage I, 22 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled; if ≤ 4 responses at the first evaluation after 2 months (18%) will be seen, the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped; if 5 or more responses will be seen, the accrual will continue. In&#xD;
      stage II, 18 more patients will be enrolled. If ≤ 12 (30%) responses will be observed out of&#xD;
      40 patients, it will be concluded that the study drug is not active enough. If ≥ 13 responses&#xD;
      will be observed, it will be concluded that eltrombopag is worth of further studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of delayed thrombocytopenia in patients who undergo allogeneic hemopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant (SCT) is nearly 20-40% (1-2). Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) seems&#xD;
      to be the most frequent pathologic condition associated with post SCT delayed&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia. Previous studies indicated the occurrence of delayed thrombocytopenia as a&#xD;
      poor prognostic factor for the outcome of patients undergoing SCT, particularly for those&#xD;
      patients with cGVHD. In our experience, 27 out of 71 patients (38%) developed post SCT&#xD;
      delayed thrombocytopenia, with a median platelet count of 29 x 109/L (range 7-86 x 109/L);&#xD;
      cGVHD was associated with delayed thrombocytopenia in 54% of cases. The platelet count was&#xD;
      &gt;50 &lt;100 x 109/L in 8 patients (30%) patients and 50 x 109/L in 19 (70%) among whom 9 had 20&#xD;
      x 109/L. The median post SCT survival was 12 months in patients who developed delayed&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia vs. &gt; 36 months in patients without delayed thrombocytopenia. The rate of&#xD;
      patients alive 12, 24 and 33 months after SCT was 41%, 41% and 7% among patients with delayed&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia vs. 93%, 87% and 87% (p&lt; 0.0001). In patients with cGVHD the incidence of&#xD;
      mortality was significantly higher in those who developed post SCT thrombocytopenia, i.e. 8&#xD;
      out of 13 (61.5%) vs. 2 out of 19 (10.5%) (p=0.005). Our data confirms the results of&#xD;
      previous studies. Therefore, the occurrence of delayed thrombocytopenia in patients&#xD;
      undergoing SCT is a very poor prognostic factor and the improvement of this condition may&#xD;
      favourably affect patients' outcome. The pathophysiology of cGVHD relayed post SCT delayed&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia is complex and only partial understood. Biological and clinical evidences&#xD;
      support an autoimmune-like thrombocytopenia with increased platelet destruction; this&#xD;
      mechanism is also suggested by the response to some therapeutic strategies generally adopted&#xD;
      to treat classical immune thrombocytopenia as steroids, high dose intravenous immunoglobulin,&#xD;
      splenectomy, rituximab. However a mechanism consistent with impaired platelet production has&#xD;
      also been suggested. Adopting an index for plasma glycocalicin, plasma thrombopoietin (TPO),&#xD;
      and circulating B cells producing anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibodies, Yamazaki et al. studied 23 SCT&#xD;
      recipients who had prolonged and isolated thrombocytopenia with no apparent causes such as&#xD;
      engraftment failure, recurrence of the underlying malignancy, microangiopathy or drugs and&#xD;
      compared data with those observed in a similar cohort of SCT recipients with no&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and aplastic anemia.&#xD;
      Despite the frequent occurrence of an antiplatelet antibody response, patients with post SCT&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia showed a glycocalicin index and TPO status similar to that seen in aplastic&#xD;
      anemia. TPO levels were normal in nearly 30% of patients. Recently, Bao et al. showed an&#xD;
      improved regulatory T-cell (T-regs) activity in patients with chronic primary immune&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (ITP) treated with thrombolytic agents, suggesting a possible role of&#xD;
      platelet count in improving T-reg function and restore immune tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this grounds and similarly to ITP, the stimulation of thrombopoiesis with the thrombolytic&#xD;
      agents could be beneficial in some patients with persistent post SCT thrombocytopenia both on&#xD;
      platelet count and on cGVHD manifestations. Eltrombopag (Revolade) is a thrombopoietin&#xD;
      receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ITP relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      to splenectomy; eltrombopag may be considered as second line treatment for adult&#xD;
      non-splenectomised patients where surgery is contraindicated. Eltrombopag is also under&#xD;
      development for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to hepatitis C virus HCV, for&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and in MDS/AML.&#xD;

The primary endpoint will be considered for all the treated population according to the intention-to-treat and in the evaluable population, i.e. all patients treated with eltrombopag for at least 3 weeks or who interrupted eltrombopag because of toxic events. A transient increase of platelet count after the administration of iv immunoglobulin given for anti- microbial purpose will not be considered criteria of response.</description>
