  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a large-scale, randomized longitudinal evaluation of Second Step: Student&#xD;
      Success Through Prevention (Second Step - SSTP), a middle school intervention (Committee for&#xD;
      Children, 2008), which targets the shared underlying risk and protective factors for&#xD;
      bullying, sexual harassment, and dating aggression. This program is unique in its emphasis on&#xD;
      the role of peer group norms, attitudes, and behavior in the initiation and maintenance of&#xD;
      bullying and other forms of violence. Because of this, this investigation will involve a&#xD;
      direct test via social network analysis the extent to which peer norms or shifts in peer&#xD;
      attitudes are impacted by the intervention. Bullying is conceptualized as including verbal,&#xD;
      physical, relational, and cyber-aggression. Sexual violence is conceptualized as including&#xD;
      sexual harassment, sexual coercion in dating relationships, and homophobic teasing.&#xD;
      Thirty-six schools were drawn from four school districts in Illinois and one large district&#xD;
      in Wichita, Kansas and randomly assigned to Second Step - SSTP or a control condition. Second&#xD;
      Step -SSTP program draws from the risk/protective factors model and social-cognitive theories&#xD;
      of aggression. Lessons focus on the outcomes of bullying, relational aggression, sexual&#xD;
      harassment, dating relationships, and substance use. Risk factors targeted include&#xD;
      inappropriate classroom behavior, favorable attitudes toward aggression and substance abuse,&#xD;
      deviant peer affiliation, peer rejection, and impulsiveness are targeted as risk factors.&#xD;
      Targeted protective factors include empathy, problem-solving skills, school connectedness,&#xD;
      assertiveness and adoption of conventional norms. The P3R: Stories of Us - Bullying program,&#xD;
      composed of a series of film-based education will be used in the control schools. All 6th&#xD;
      graders at each school will be recruited and followed for the three year study period.&#xD;
      Students and teachers will complete self-report and nomination tasks. Growth curve analysis&#xD;
      via hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992) will be utilized to assess&#xD;
      change in the major dependent variables (bullying, sexual harassment perpetration, dating&#xD;
      aggression), structural equation modeling will test for mediators across the study period,&#xD;
      and social network analysis will be instrumental in identifying peer norms and attitudes.&#xD;

      Seven outcome measures were evaluated including bullying perpetration, peer victimization,&#xD;
      physical fighting, homophobic name calling (victimization and perpetration), and sexual&#xD;
      violence (victimization and perpetration). Given that students in the intervention received&#xD;
      only one-year (15 lessons; 50 minutes/week) of the developmentally-sequenced three-year&#xD;
      curriculum, it was hypothesized that the strongest intervention effect would be seen for&#xD;
      overt physical aggression, followed by more subtle effects for bullying and peer&#xD;
      victimization outcomes. Because students were not introduced to concepts of prejudice, bias,&#xD;
      and sexual violence (referred to sexual harassment) until the 7th and 8th grade curriculum,&#xD;
      it was hypothesized that no significant intervention effects would emerge for these&#xD;
      constructs at this point in time.&#xD;
