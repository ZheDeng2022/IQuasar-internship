  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major healthcare problem in the developed and developing world. Recent&#xD;
      clinical trials have demonstrated that it may be prevented by lifestyle intervention focused&#xD;
      on diet and physical activity. These trials have been expensive and labour intensive and this&#xD;
      has limited translation of the known benefits to the population at large.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose using a mobile phone intervention for lifestyle change and will assess it in a&#xD;
      clinical trial(study) in people with impaired glucose regulation (high risk at developing&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in both India and the UK. The purpose of the study is to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness and acceptability of a text messaging system to prevent the progression to&#xD;
      diabetes in people with high risk. The study involves five visits to clinic over 2 year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be divided into two groups by the computer generated random method -&#xD;
      one is 'Usual Care' group and the other 'Text Messaging' group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual care will consist of a 30 minute interview, delivering personalized diet and&#xD;
           exercise advice, supplemented by written material and education regarding diabetes. This&#xD;
           will be delivered once at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group will undergo the same initial interview and, in addition, will&#xD;
           receive 3 times weekly text messaging with education, advice, support and motivation.&#xD;
           These messages will be personalized to individual targets set at the initial interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be progression to diabetes, with and without SMS intervention.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be improvements in physical activity (reported and directly&#xD;
      measured), body weight and other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, total and HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol and serum triglycerides).&#xD;

      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target recruitment number will be 1834 in total (1134 for India and 700 for UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In India people at risk will be ascertained using the Indian Diabetes Risk Score&#xD;
           followed by measurement of a single blood sample to assess glucose regulation (HbA1c) in&#xD;
           those with high scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the UK, high risk subjects will be ascertained from the National Health service (NHS)&#xD;
           Health Check Scheme and from routine screening in primary careÍ¾ UK recruitment will also&#xD;
           be based on HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit 1 (Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Potential subjects will be invited to clinic for screening to determine their&#xD;
                prediabetic state (defined as an HbA1c of 6.0-6.4%)and suitability to take part in&#xD;
                the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening involves clinical measurements, physical measurements and laboratory&#xD;
                measurements. Also, baseline questionnaires will be carried out at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ActiGraph, physical activity monitoring device will be fitted on that is to be kept&#xD;
                for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit 2 (Education and Randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One-to-One structured education on healthy lifestyle will be given to all&#xD;
                successfully screened subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The subjects then will be randomized using computer generated numbers either to&#xD;
                usual care (control arm) or usual care with text messaging (intervention arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visit 3 (6 month follow up), Visit 4 (12 month follow-up) and Visit 5 (24 month&#xD;
           follow-up) - each visit involves&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  clinical measurements, physical measurements and laboratory measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fitting ActiGraph on subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the course of the study visits some data will be stored on laptop computers, not&#xD;
           connected to the internet, for later statistical analysis. These data will be coded and&#xD;
           non identifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a secure room in Imperial&#xD;
           College Healthcare NHS Trust. Only the research team (clinical research fellow and&#xD;
           research nurse) will have access to the filing cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of each visit the anonymised data will be transferred immediately to the&#xD;
           secure NHS computers and will be deleted from the laptop. Access to NHS computers is&#xD;
           only by members of NHS staff with appropriate log in privileges.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data will be stored in an anonymised form by using study numbers for identification&#xD;
           of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NHS code of confidentiality will be followed and all activity will meet the&#xD;
           requirements of the data protection act.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only members of the clinical research team and those responsible for direct care will&#xD;
           have access to subjects' data during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data generated by the study will be analyzed by the research team from Imperial&#xD;
           College. The analysis will be on anonymised data and will take place in Imperial College&#xD;
           Healthcare NHS Trust and in Imperial College academic buildings in the Faculty of&#xD;
           Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Access to Source Data/Documents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, and&#xD;
      regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size is based on previous data from the Indian Diabetes Prevention studies. We&#xD;
           estimate that the two year conversion rate to diabetes in the control group will be 25%.&#xD;
           A total of 1134 individuals per group are required across both countries to detect a 20%&#xD;
           reduction in risk of progression with 80% power at 5% significance. A study of this size&#xD;
           will be able to address the question of whether, overall, the text messaging system is&#xD;
           effective in reducing progression to diabetes in high risk individuals. It will not be&#xD;
           sufficiently powered to address this question in each country separately, nor to detect&#xD;
           differences of effect between them. However, a study of this size is extremely well&#xD;
           powered to detect an impact on the continuously distributed secondary outcome of&#xD;
           moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as assessed by Actigraph. The standard&#xD;
           deviation of MVPA in the ProActive trial was 17 minutes per day. Thus the study overall&#xD;
           has &gt;99% power to detect a difference of 4 minutes per day of extra walking between&#xD;
           groups. It will be possible, therefore, to examine country specific effects of the&#xD;
           intervention on MVPA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing, unused, and spurious data will be assessed on an individual basis and may be&#xD;
           ignored, withdrawn or the visit may be removed from the analysis with appropriate&#xD;
           justification adjudicated by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistical methods for the&#xD;
           primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethics Approval The Chief Investigator has obtained approval from the Westminster&#xD;
           Research Ethics Committee. Local Research and Development(R&amp;D) Approval at each&#xD;
           participating NHS Trust is also required before accepting participants into the study.&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in accordance with the recommendations for physicians&#xD;
           involved in research on human subjects adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly,&#xD;
           Helsinki 1964 and later revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent to enter the study must be sought from each participant only after a full&#xD;
           explanation has been given, an information leaflet offered and time allowed for&#xD;
           consideration. Signed participant consent should be obtained. The right of the&#xD;
           participant to refuse to participate without giving reasons must be respected. All&#xD;
           participants are free to withdraw at any time from the protocol treatment without giving&#xD;
           reasons and without prejudicing further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Chief Investigator will preserve the confidentiality of participants taking part in&#xD;
           the study and is registered under the Data Protection Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indemnity Imperial College London holds negligent harm and non-negligent harm insurance&#xD;
           policies which apply to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imperial College Academic Health Science Centre will act as the main Sponsor for this&#xD;
           study. Delegated responsibilities will be assigned to the NHS trusts taking part in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study may be subject to inspection and audit by Imperial College London under their&#xD;
           remit as sponsor and other regulatory bodies to ensure adherence to GCP and the NHS&#xD;
           Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care (2nd edition).&#xD;
