      This is a study to collect and analyze tissue specimens from metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (mCRC) patients for the development of a molecularly profiled tissue repository for the&#xD;
      primary purpose of maintaining a patient registry for future clinical trials based on the&#xD;
      molecular profile of the tumors. The main purpose of testing these tissue specimens is to&#xD;
      identify genetic alterations or biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer such that if new&#xD;
      agent(s) become available, particularly those that target these genetic&#xD;
      alterations/biomarkers, participants may be offered the opportunity to take part in a&#xD;
      National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) treatment protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue blocks from the primary tumor site and an uninvolved margin of resection (normal&#xD;
      tissue) from consenting patients will be submitted and stored at the NSABP Division of&#xD;
      Pathology, in the NSABP Biospecimen Profiling Repository. Tissue specimens will be used to&#xD;
      profile molecular characteristics, including actionable mutations most commonly identified in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Specimens may be further interrogated by other methods to discover&#xD;
      additional mechanisms and targetable genetic alterations that may predict sensitivity or&#xD;
      resistance to drug therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repository will be populated, maintained, and analyzed through continuous patient&#xD;
      recruitment. Patient tumor specimens will be interrogated to characterize an individual's&#xD;
      molecular profile. At a future date for discovery purposes, the normal tissue may be profiled&#xD;
      for comparison with the profile of the tumor tissue. NSABP will hold a database with&#xD;
      molecular profiles and relevant patient information. As agents become available for clinical&#xD;
      study, particularly those matching specified profiles, the treating physician will be&#xD;
      contacted so that the patient may be offered participation in that trial via a separate&#xD;
      consent process. Each NSABP trial will have a defined molecular profile for entry which will&#xD;
      be specific to the agent(s) under study. The MPR-1 patient registry and tissue repository and&#xD;
      all treatment protocols associated with MPR-1 are being developed as part of the NSABP&#xD;
      Oncology-Genome Assessment Guided Medicine (N-GAMe) Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry and repository platform uses a translational science approach for more&#xD;
      personalized therapy for patients with mCRC. This analysis provides an individual molecular&#xD;
      profile in an attempt to direct each patient's treatment based on the pattern of genetic&#xD;
      alterations. These efforts also may aid in the discovery of with or without new gene targets&#xD;
      for future drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1000-2000 tumor (with or without) normal tissue specimens from living mCRC&#xD;
      patients will be collected, stored, and analyzed as part of this biospecimen repository. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that 200-400 participants will be registered within the first year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from the primary&#xD;
             colorectal tumor surgery with corresponding pathology report must be available for&#xD;
             release by the local pathology department (an adequate amount of tumor tissue is&#xD;
             required for analysis). If available for release, a separate FFPE tissue block from an&#xD;
             uninvolved margin of colorectal resection (normal tissue) is also requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a life-expectancy of greater than or equal to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of non-CRC malignancy unless the patient is considered by the physician to be&#xD;
             disease-free and at low risk for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known comorbid medical conditions that would preclude investigational treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
             active hepatitis B or C; symptomatic cardiac disease; renal insufficiency; bone marrow&#xD;
             impairment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would preclude investigational treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Colonoscopy biopsies or diagnostic core biopsy procedures without surgery or&#xD;
             resection.&#xD;
