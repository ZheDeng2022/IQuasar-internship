  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that a diet high in sugars will increase abnormalities in&#xD;
      blood lipids which are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, relative to a&#xD;
      diet which is low in sugar. We predict that this potentially adverse effect of dietary sugars&#xD;
      on blood lipids will be more pronounced in people with a raised level of stored fat inside&#xD;
      their liver, as compared to people with a low level of stored fat.&#xD;

      This study aims to determine the metabolic mechanism(s) by which dietary extrinsic sugars&#xD;
      (sucrose and fructose), promote the formation of a high risk dyslipidaemia, known as an&#xD;
      atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (raised plasma triglyceride, low HDL and predominance of&#xD;
      small, dense LDL), in men with raised cardio-metabolic risk and percentage of liver fat, as&#xD;
      determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The study examined the impact of diets&#xD;
      high and low in extrinsic sugars, on the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in vivo, of&#xD;
      two groups of men with a high (&gt;10%)and low (&lt;2%)percentage of liver fat, by the&#xD;
      trace-labelling of these lipid moieties with stable isotopes, and detection by gas&#xD;
      chromatography mass spectrometry. The study had a two-way cross-over design, with two, 12&#xD;
      week dietary interventions separated by a six week wash-out period. The dietary intervention&#xD;
      with high and low sugars was achieved by a dietary exchange with supermarket foods, which&#xD;
      were consumed within the homes of the participants.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited over a period of 24 months (2009-2011) at the 'CEDAR' Centre for Endocrinology and Diabetes Research, Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Men were selected on the basis of expressing increased cardio-metabolic risk and APOE E3E3 genotype. The men were screened for intracellular hepatic fat by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and divided into two groups: low liver fat Controls (&lt;5% liver fat) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with percentage liver fat &gt;5%.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Acetyl CoA (Co-enzyme-A) is labelled in vivo by the consumption of [2H20] (2H20=deuterated 'heavy'-labelled water). Recovery and detection of this label in VLDL-1 by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry), provides a measure of fatty acid and TAG synthesis in the liver in terms of its contribution to the production rate of VLDL-1 TAG in units of grams/day.</description>

          <title>High Sugar Diet in Controls (n=14)</title>
          <description>A high sugar (28% total energy), low starch diet was provided by the exchange of 66% of the participants daily intake of carbohydrate. This was achieved by exchanging foods with a low sugar to starch content, with foods containing a high sugar to starch content to reach a target ratio of starch to sugar 1: 1.2.</description>

          <title>Low Sugar Diet in Controls (n=14)</title>
          <description>A low sugar (10% total energy), high starch diet was provided by the exchange of 66% of the participants daily intake of carbohydrate. This was achieved by replacing foods with a high sugar to starch content, with foods containing a low sugar to starch content to reach a target ratio of starch to sugar of 5:1.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A limitation of metabolic studies is their small sample size, which is a consequence of the invasive nature, extent, labour intensity, and high cost ($850,000) of the metabolic investigations e.g. infusion/ingestion of 4 stable isotope tracers.</limitations_and_caveats>
