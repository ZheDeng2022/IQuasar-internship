    <textblock>
      Background: Acute pancreatitis is characterized by a high mortality rate (10%-15%), and a&#xD;
      remarkably unpredictable clinical course. Approximately 50% of deaths in acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      occur early-within the first 14 days-and early mortality is attributable to sequelae of a&#xD;
      severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is associated with multi-organ&#xD;
      dysfunction syndrome (MODS) that can escalate to renal failure, respiratory failure, and&#xD;
      death. Significant improvements in acute pancreatitis mortality will demand innovative&#xD;
      approaches to counteract early organ failure. A series of destructive cellular processes&#xD;
      begins within minutes of initial pancreatic injury, and the ensuing inflammatory cascade is&#xD;
      compounded by disease sequelae including edema, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. Early&#xD;
      interventions to reduce inflammation within the first 36 hours have been shown to have&#xD;
      significant effects in minimizing progressive organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothermia is clinically employed to combat cellular injury and systemic responses following&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion, and is been studied as a mechanism of acute inflammatory inhibition in&#xD;
      processes including cardiogenic shock, lung injury, local intestinal injury, and reperfusion&#xD;
      injuries to the lung, liver, and endothelium. In numerous studies, effective&#xD;
      immunomodulations have been observed including reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      (TNF-α, IL-6), stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), inhibition of&#xD;
      pro-apoptotic JNK signaling, reduction of systemic oxidative stress, and inhibition of&#xD;
      neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Most saliently, in the caerulein&#xD;
      model of murine acute pancreatitis, therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce serum&#xD;
      IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, increased serum IL-10, decrease serum amylase and lipase, lower the&#xD;
      histological grade of pancreatic injury as compared to normothermic mice, and significant&#xD;
      survival benefit. Although therapeutic hypothermia is actively employed in the treatment of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, neonatal asphyxia, spinal cord injury, and cardiac arrest, no studies&#xD;
      have yet been made of its application to acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (32-34°C) will sustain reduced&#xD;
      organ-specific injury in acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal: In a Phase IIa pilot clinical trial, we will examine the effects of therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia on organ-specific outcomes during the early stage of acute pancreatitis. We will&#xD;
      recruit five patients aged 18 to 80 receiving medically-necessitated ventilator support under&#xD;
      ICU monitoring with core temperatures ≥36°C and severe acute pancreatitis defined as either a&#xD;
      Ranson Score ≥7, a CT indicating ≥50% pancreatic necrosis, or a significant deterioration in&#xD;
      clinical status including dysfunction of two or more organ systems (defined by ACCP/SCCM&#xD;
      Organ Failure Guidelines, Chest 2009). All patients will receive current standard management&#xD;
      for severe acute pancreatitis and a standardized protocol for application of therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia and rewarming. Our primary endpoints are organ-specific cardiovascular,&#xD;
      respiratory, hematological, renal, and metabolic dysfunction as measured at 28 days. Logistic&#xD;
      Organ Dysfunction Scores (LOD) will be compared before and after therapeutic hypothermia,&#xD;
      establishing day 4 versus day 1 changes in LOD. Secondary endpoints include D-dimer, IL-6,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, APACHE II scores on day 1 and day 4, inpatient and ICU length-of-stay,&#xD;
      infection, mortality, and hypothermia-associated side effects including cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
      electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia, major bleeding, and acute pancreatitis. We believe that&#xD;
      such a study will supply preliminary answers to our chief research questions: does&#xD;
      therapeutic hypothermia reduce morbidity as assessed by organ-specific outcomes, does&#xD;
      therapeutic hypothermia attenuate the steep rise in inflammation observed in severe acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and does therapeutic hypothermia shorten the clinical course for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
