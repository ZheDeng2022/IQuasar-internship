  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this split-mouth controlled study, implants placed using the alveolar ridge expansion&#xD;
      technique will be compared to those placed in native bone with sufficient horizontal bone&#xD;
      width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Piezosurgery device and Bone expanders (Mectron,Italy) will be employed in an alveolar&#xD;
      ridge expansion technique.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success rate of endosseous implant placement in native bone has been proven to be highly&#xD;
      predictable. Reliable long term result requires sufficient bone thickness surrounding the&#xD;
      implant's body. This is especially true in the maxillary aesthetic zone where buccal bone&#xD;
      thickness of 2mm or more is necessary to prevent loss of buccal bone margin and maintain the&#xD;
      integrity of the gingival architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ridge expansion technique, an alternative to bone graft, widens the alveolar ridge prior to&#xD;
      implant placement, thus permits the preservation of buccal and lingual bone thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow atrophy edentulous alveolar ridges (study site) in the maxillary aesthetic zone will&#xD;
      be split lengthwise using piezo-electric surgery (Piezosurgery, Mectron, USA). The prepared&#xD;
      osteotomy will subsequently be expanded using threaded osteotomes (Bone Expanders, Mectron,&#xD;
      Italy). Implants will immediately be inserted in the prepared osteotomy. In the edentulous&#xD;
      alveolar ridges with sufficient thickness (controlled site) in the maxillary aesthetic zone,&#xD;
      implants will be placed directly using conventional drilling technique. Outcome measures will&#xD;
      be compared.&#xD;
