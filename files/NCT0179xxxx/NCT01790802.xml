      progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LEAD is a patient and assessor masked, multi-centre randomized controlled exploratory medical&#xD;
      device clinical investigation of 240 participants (1:1 active to shame laser procedure)&#xD;
      designed to assess the effectiveness of nanosecond laser treatment of patients with early&#xD;
      high-risk AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No less than 240 participants will be randomized into either active laser treatment or sham&#xD;
      laser procedure groups at a ratio of 1:1. Patient eligibility based on ocular inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be evaluated using measures of vision, fundus photography, OCT imaging, and&#xD;
      macular integrity (MAIA) performed during the qualifying period. Fundus images and MAIA&#xD;
      results will be sent to a coordinating centre where these will be reviewed to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility based on lesion attributes and the criteria specified in the protocol. Following&#xD;
      confirmation of eligibility by the coordinating centre, participants whom satisfy all the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria can be randomized. Allocation to treatment group will be&#xD;
      stratified by smoking status. All participants will receive either active laser treatment or&#xD;
      sham laser procedure at the treatment visit and be assessed for retreatment on a semi-annual&#xD;
      basis. All participants will be contacted by telephone at 1 week and present for clinical&#xD;
      examination visits at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males or females from 50 to 95 years of age at the time of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral high-risk early AMD: At least one druse ≥125um within an inner macular zone&#xD;
             (a circle with a radius of 1500 microns centred on the fovea) with or without pigment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A MAIA static threshold sensitivity less than 25 dB at any point, within a customized&#xD;
             grid, as measured using a Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA) device), at the same&#xD;
             location of the one eye on two separate occasions.&#xD;

             Leventinese, Sorsby fundus dystrophy, Alports syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular disease in either eye, other than AMD, which significantly compromises the&#xD;
             ability to treat or visualize the fundus or would compromise the ability to assess any&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known allergic hypersensitivity to fluorescein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous retinal or other ocular surgical procedures, the effects of which may now or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to contact lens application.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant cataract: Nuclear cataract grade 2 or 3, cortical cataract Grade 2 or 3 or&#xD;
