  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment to treat&#xD;
      tumors near or around vulnerable structures, such as central liver tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the safety and efficacy of IRE in the treatment of colorectal liver&#xD;
      metastases, patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases undergo IRE and resection of&#xD;
      the metastases in the same session. After resection, the specimen is examined macroscopically&#xD;
      to determine vitality using a specific vitality staining (triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride) and&#xD;
      to visualize the exact ablation zone. Subsequently, histopathologic examination is used to&#xD;
      determine type of cell death and the microscopic ablation zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that IRE is a safe effective method to treat colorectal liver&#xD;
      metastasis and that cell damage and cell death is demonstrated as soon as 1 hour after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot-study is designed to determine the safety of IRE using the NanoKnife on colorectal&#xD;
      liver metastases. Secondary, feasibility, histological effect on the ablated cells and exact&#xD;
      shape and size of the ablated area will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with resectable CRLM (1 lesion or more) undergoing surgical resection of the&#xD;
      metastases will receive study information to participate in this pilot-study. Limited&#xD;
      extrahepatic disease is not contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a general pre-procedural work-up: total body FDG PET-CT, ceCT of the&#xD;
      abdomen, anesthetic review with special attention to cardiac history, baseline full blood&#xD;
      examination, urea and electrolytes, renal function tests, liver enzymes and coagulation&#xD;
      profile test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is conducted under general anaesthesia with muscle relaxants to prevent patient&#xD;
      motion and epidural analgesia. A laparotomy will be performed at the surgeon's discretion for&#xD;
      optimal liver exposure. Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) will be carried out by an&#xD;
      experienced interventional radiologist for exact evaluation of maximum diameter, number and&#xD;
      location of all lesions and to confirm resectability (if lesions prove not to be resectable,&#xD;
      only RFA will be performed according to standard of care). All lesions will be biopsied. The&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed under ultrasound guidance according to manufacturer's guidelines in&#xD;
      the lesions that are eligible for resection. After correct placement of the electrodes the&#xD;
      lesions will be ablated according to protocol with ECG synchronization and the ablation zone&#xD;
      is determined by US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure the cardiac rhythm will be closely monitored and a defibrillator will be&#xD;
      present at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After IOUS confirmation of complete ablation (at least 30 minutes after ablation of the&#xD;
      lesion) the surgeon will perform a partial liver resection / metastasectomy including the&#xD;
      ablated lesions and the surgical procedure is ended as usual. After the treatment of all&#xD;
      lesions with the NanoKnife and before resection (and RFA of unresectable CRLM if indicated),&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn to determine renal function and liver enzymes since cell&#xD;
      destruction may cause biochemical abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resected specimen will be transported to the department of pathology. After sectioning,&#xD;
      the specimen will be photographed extensively to determine exact shape and size of the&#xD;
      ablated area. One slice is stained in vitality-staining (TTC), to macroscopically distinguish&#xD;
      viable from nonviable tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After formalin fixation, the specimen is stained and examined under light microscopy&#xD;
      according to standard protocol to determine radicality of the resection margins.&#xD;
      Additionally, special attention will be given to indications for cellular damage, vessel wall&#xD;
      damage and size and shape of the ablation zone. Caspase-3 and BAX/BCL-2 analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to investigate the induction of apoptosis. The results will be compared to the&#xD;
      result of the biopsy taken prior to ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day one and day three post-operatively regular blood samples will be drawn, including&#xD;
      liver enzymes and renal function tests. After discharge, out of hospital follow-up will be&#xD;
      according to liver surgery protocol. The investigators aim to include 10 patients in this&#xD;
      pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent monitor (quality officer) will monitor all study data according to Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP). The informed consent of selected individual participants will be&#xD;
      checked. Source Data verification will be performed during onsite monitoring (to verify if&#xD;
      all data on the Case Report Form are in accordance with the source data). The intensity of&#xD;
      this verification is in relation to the risk associated with the intervention investigated.&#xD;
      Data that by all means will be checked are the informed consent form, in- and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and the primary outcome. The monitor will also verify if all (S)AE's and SUSAR's are&#xD;
      reported adequately and within the time that is determined by legal rules and regulations.&#xD;
