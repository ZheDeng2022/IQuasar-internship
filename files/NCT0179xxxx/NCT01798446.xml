      1. Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor occurring most frequently&#xD;
           of primary malignant tumors in kidney.1 According to Korea Central Cancer Registry&#xD;
           (KCCR) data, renal cancer affects 4.4 out of 100,000 males and 2.1 out of 100,000&#xD;
           females. About 30% of renal cancer patients accompany remote metastasis at the time of&#xD;
           diagnosis and renal cancer even recurs in about 40% of the patients who underwent&#xD;
           surgery for radical treatment of renal cancer as a local disease.1 New treatment&#xD;
           strategies against renal cell carcinoma have been developed, but they have not obtained&#xD;
           satisfactory therapeutic outcomes. Thus, constant clinical studies are necessary to&#xD;
           improve therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma The treatment for metastatic renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma has been improved a lot for the recent few years, which is, however, limited&#xD;
           to clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The drugs showing antitumor activity against clear&#xD;
           cell renal cell carcinoma include axitinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab,&#xD;
           temsirolimus, and everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Of them, axitinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, etc. are neovascularization&#xD;
           inhibitors which inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor&#xD;
           (VEGFR). As a first-line treatment, sunitinib prolongs progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
           compared to interferon-alpha, being recognized as a first-line standard therapy.&#xD;
           Sorafenib, a second-line treatment, shows significant prolongation of PFS against clear&#xD;
           cell renal cell carcinoma compared to the placebo control group, establishing itself as&#xD;
           a second-line drug. Concomitantly administered with interferon-alpha, bevacizumab shows&#xD;
           significant prolongation of PFS compared to the single use of interferon-alpha,&#xD;
           establishing itself as another first-line therapy. Temsirolimus, an mammalian target of&#xD;
           rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, extended survival time in a clinical study of both clear and&#xD;
           non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, this clinical study was limited to&#xD;
           patients with renal cell carcinoma having bad prognostic factors. This renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma with bad prognostic factors only accounts for 10-20% of entire metastatic&#xD;
           renal cell carcinoma. Everolimus, an another mTOR inhibitor, showed a significant&#xD;
           prolongation of PFS in the placebo-controlled phase III clinical study of patients with&#xD;
           clear cell renal cell carcinoma in whom sunitinib therapy failed, establishing itself as&#xD;
           a second-line therapy in case the first-line standard sunitinib therapy fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment of Metastatic Non-clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (nccRCC) In fact, VEGF&#xD;
           antagonists are shown to have some efficacy also in nccRCC. Sunitinib was effective&#xD;
           against nccRCC. A worldwide expanded access trial of sunitinib has been undertaken. A&#xD;
           subgroup analysis of patients with non-clear-cell histology was performed and 276&#xD;
           patients (11.8%) with non-clear-cell histology were identified, although distinction&#xD;
           between different subtypes was not made. A response rate of 5.4%, clinical benefit&#xD;
           (defined as response and stable disease was more than 3 months) of 47% and median PFS of&#xD;
           6.7 months was seen in this subgroup. This result compared with an overall response rate&#xD;
           for the entire patient group of 9.3%, clinical benefit of 52.3%, and median PFS of 8.9&#xD;
           months. The investigators concluded that sunitinib was active in the non-clear-cell&#xD;
           subgroup; however, these data need to be interpreted with caution because of the&#xD;
           nonrandomization of patients in the expanded access trial and the lack of pathology&#xD;
           verification. Also, recently, phase 2 trial of sunitinib in non-clear cell renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma showed remarkable efficacy with response rate of 36% and median PFS of 6.4&#xD;
           months. The study enrolled non-clear cell RCC patients who did not receive previous&#xD;
           anti-angiogenic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sorafenib also showed some efficacy in nccRCC, though not so efficacious. The Advanced&#xD;
           Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib Expanded Access Program allowed patients in the United&#xD;
           States and Canada with metastatic RCC to receive treatment with sorafenib prior to its&#xD;
           regulatory approval. This non-randomized, open-label program treated 158 subjects with&#xD;
           papillary RCC of a total of 1891 evaluable subjects (81% clear cell, 8% non-clear, and&#xD;
           11% unclassified histology). Of the 107 evaluable subjects with papillary RCC, 90 (84%)&#xD;
           had a measurable response to treatment with 3 partial responders and 87 with stable&#xD;
           disease for at least 8 weeks, while 17 (16%) subjects demonstrated early progression on&#xD;
           treatment. The side effect profile for sorafenib was similar across histologic subtypes,&#xD;
           and the authors concluded that sorafenib has some activity in papillary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the other hand, in randomized phase 3 trial of single-agent Axitinib in 723 renal&#xD;
           cell carcinoma patients who progressed despite first-line therapy containing sunitinib,&#xD;
           bevacizumab plus interferon-alpha, temsirolimus or cytokines, the median PFS duration&#xD;
           was significantly longer with axitinib than with sorafenib in the entire population (6.7&#xD;
           months versus 4.7 months, respectively: p less than 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rationale In short,&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. There is no standard treatment option for non-clear cell RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients with non-clear cell RCC is strongly assumed to have benefit from anti-VEGF&#xD;
                treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. There is no trial of axitinib for non-clear cell RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Axitinib is expected to show more potent efficacy over sorafenib or sunitinib in&#xD;
                renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on above, this clinical study is designed to examine efficacy and adverse events of&#xD;
      axitinib for non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
