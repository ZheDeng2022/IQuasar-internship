    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 is an experimental cancer treatment drug. It damages DNA in tumor&#xD;
      cells. Tumor cells with damaged DNA may die, resulting in cell death. Researchers want to see&#xD;
      if this drug is a safe and effective treatment for solid tumors and lymphomas that have not&#xD;
      responded to earlier treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 is a safe and effective treatment for advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors or lymphomas that have not&#xD;
      responded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Tumor samples may also be collected. The size and location of&#xD;
           the tumors will be determined with imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 is given in a 28-day cycle. Participants will receive the drug&#xD;
           by intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, followed by a break of 13&#xD;
           days without the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Tumor samples&#xD;
           will be optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue their cycles of treatment as long as the cancer does not grow&#xD;
           and there are no severe side effects.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin topoisomerase (Top1) inhibitors that form&#xD;
           stable DNA-Top1 cleavage-complexes, have a preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, and&#xD;
           are active against camptothecin-resistant cell lines. Unlike camptothecins,&#xD;
           indenoisoquinolines are chemically stable and active in cells that over-express&#xD;
           ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG2 and multidrug resistance (MDR-1). Top1&#xD;
           inhibitors are potent anticancer agents because stabilizing cleavage complex formation&#xD;
           induces replication-and transcription-mediated DNA damage and delays DNA repair, leading&#xD;
           to apoptosis. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that baseline tumor levels of Top1&#xD;
           correlate strongly with ability to respond to Top1 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first-in-human Phase I study conducted at the NCI of the indenoisoquinoline LMP400&#xD;
           (NSC 743400) on a QD x 5 q28 schedule in patients with refractory solid tumors and&#xD;
           lymphomas (10-C-0056) established that this agent is well tolerated. LMP400 shows linear&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics with evidence of drug accumulation following 5 days of dosing. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that weekly dosing (days 1, 8, 15 q28-day cycle) will increase LMP400 peak&#xD;
           levels and exposures, improving clinical activity and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the safety and tolerability of weekly (days 1, 8, 15 q28-day cycle) LMP400&#xD;
           in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly LMP400 in patients with&#xD;
           refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of weekly LMP400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the level of Top1 in tumor biopsies pre- and post- administration of LMP400.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of LMP400 on markers of DNA damage and apoptosis, such as &gt;=H2AX and&#xD;
           caspase 3, in tumor biopsies pre- and post- LMP400 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas; adequate organ&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial evaluating weekly administration of LMP400, on days&#xD;
           1, 8, and 15, in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starting dose is based on the MTD determined from the QD x 5, q28 day schedule currently&#xD;
           being evaluated. The study will follow a 3 plus 3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the MTD is established, 10 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to&#xD;
           further define the pharmacokinetics and evaluate effect of study drug on DNA damage and&#xD;
           apoptosis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered to at least eligibility levels due to adverse events&#xD;
             (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not have&#xD;
             had major surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy within 3 weeks (6&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C, or 2 months for UCN-01). Patients must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part&#xD;
             of a Phase 0 study (also referred to as an early Phase I study or pre-Phase I study&#xD;
             where a subtherapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI s discretion, and&#xD;
             should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities. However, patients&#xD;
             receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
             for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy. Prior therapy with topoisomerase I&#xD;
             inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             Patients with brain metastasis stable for at least 4 weeks following surgery and/or&#xD;
             radiation are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled incurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LMP400. Appropriate studies will&#xD;
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
