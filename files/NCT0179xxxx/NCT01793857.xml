  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a survey aiming to describe the healthcare seeking behaviour of primary&#xD;
      caregivers when their child aged 6 months to less than 30 months was suspected to have an&#xD;
      episode of acute otitis media in Panama.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cross sectional survey in which primary caregivers will be asked if they&#xD;
      recall having observed an ear infection in the child in the age range 6 months to less than&#xD;
      30 months in the last 6 months. During the interview, the primary caregivers will be asked&#xD;
      what they did for the child during that episode and whether they sought medical care or not.&#xD;
      They will be also asked about the demographic characteristics (such as age range) of the&#xD;
      child who experienced that episode and the household environment of the child at the time of&#xD;
      the episode (such as number of household members), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No questions will be asked about the episode itself if the primary caregiver does not recall&#xD;
      that the child had one in the last six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1300 primary caregivers will be interviewed in multiple clinics / well-baby&#xD;
      clinics in Panama.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinics will be stratified into 'former clinical trial sites' and 'non-clinical trial&#xD;
      sites' in urban areas of Panama, based on participation in the COMPAS trial. Both 'former&#xD;
      clinical trial sites' and 'non-clinical trial sites' will include private and public&#xD;
      facilities. Sites will be selected by convenience sampling and eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled on an on-going basis, in proportion to the population coverage of each site. The&#xD;
      participating sites have thus been stratified to be able to assess whether the healthcare&#xD;
      seeking behaviour of primary caregivers enrolled at former clinical trial sites are different&#xD;
      from those enrolled at non clinical trial sites.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who the investigator/interviewer believes can and will comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. availability of time for completion of the&#xD;
             interview).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent obtained from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects aged 18 years or above, being the primary caregiver of at least one child&#xD;
             aged 6 months to less than 30 months, visiting a clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Although the child will most likely be present at the time of interview, his/her&#xD;
        presence is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. If more than one primary caregiver fulfilling the inclusion criteria is present per&#xD;
        child, only one will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
