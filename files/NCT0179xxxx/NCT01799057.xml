  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of metformin on functional capacity&#xD;
      (pain-free and maximum walking times) in individuals with peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      (PAD)-related intermittent claudication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin has demonstrable efficacy in slowing or reversing the progression of various&#xD;
      insulin-resistant disease states - most notably type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. In seeking&#xD;
      to establish proof-of-concept that insulin resistance is a suitable pathophysiological target&#xD;
      in the treatment of PAD-related intermittent claudication (pain in the leg muscles during&#xD;
      walking, which resolves on exercise cessation), this study will determine whether the known&#xD;
      insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin translate to alleviation of the functional&#xD;
      limitations imposed by claudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 individuals with PAD-related intermittent claudication will be randomised (1:1)&#xD;
      to either metformin or matching placebo for 16-18 weeks (double-blind, parallel group&#xD;
      design). The maximum daily dose of metformin will be 2000mg (up-titrated from half this dose&#xD;
      at 2 weeks if tolerated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement in functional capacity follows metformin therapy in individuals with PAD-related&#xD;
      intermittent claudication. Change in functional capacity will be assessed by the co-primary&#xD;
      endpoints of pain-free and maximum walking times during a standard graded treadmill exercise&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise testing for functional performance will be complemented by assessments of perceived&#xD;
      physical functioning / quality of life in the daily life setting (using standard&#xD;
      questionnaires). As previous studies have indicated cardiovascular effects of metformin&#xD;
      incremental to blood glucose-lowering, this study will also investigate potential mechanisms&#xD;
      of efficacy relating to the primary endpoints, including changes in endothelial function,&#xD;
      blood flow responses to various stimuli (including insulin and acute exercise), insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, and physical activity / sedentary behaviours. Changes in relevant clinical data&#xD;
      (including ankle-brachial index and limb hemodynamics by duplex scanning) will also be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unmet clinical need of efficacious medical therapies for intermittent claudication is a&#xD;
      growing problem given the increasing prevalence of PAD worldwide. If positive, this study&#xD;
      will identify a new potential treatment that is already widely available. The study will also&#xD;
      inform on novel mechanistic targets with relevance to existing and future therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
