  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of two weeks of daily dosing of&#xD;
      inhaled salt water mist (hypertonic saline - HS) on actual measurements of mucociliary and&#xD;
      cough clearance in patients with the chronic bronchitis type of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defective mucociliary clearance (MCC) is central to the development and/or worsening of&#xD;
      several kinds of lung diseases, including COPD/chronic bronchitis (CB), cystic fibrosis (CF),&#xD;
      and bronchiectasis. In each case, defective MCC leads to the development of lung infections&#xD;
      and damage to the airways from ongoing inflammation caused by a person's inability to clear&#xD;
      mucus from the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous studies have shown that the administration of inhaled HS&#xD;
      (hypertonic saline) not only acutely accelerates MCC in CF, but also that repetitive use&#xD;
      &quot;resets&quot; the baseline rate of MCC within 2 weeks. It is likely that the sustained effect of&#xD;
      HS on MCC was responsible for the ~60% reduction in the frequency of pulmonary disease&#xD;
      exacerbations, reduced antibiotic use and improved lung function in a long-term study of HS&#xD;
      in CF volunteers. As a result, HS has now become a standard therapy for CF lung disease and&#xD;
      its success raises optimism that similar benefits might occur in patients with CB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will use mildly radioactive particles, technetium bound to&#xD;
      sulfur colloid, to measure and compare the sustained effects on mucus clearance of two weeks&#xD;
      of daily dosing of 7% hypertonic saline versus a low salt control treatment for subjects with&#xD;
      CB. We will also be collecting sputum and breath condensation to analyze for protein and&#xD;
      inflammatory changes that might occur with exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long term goals are to improve our understanding of MCC in health and disease and to&#xD;
      develop better therapies that support and/or restore MCC in patients with these diseases to&#xD;
      reduce lung infections.&#xD;

The intervention consists of the subject receiving both concentrations of inhaled sodium chloride solution, each during a different home treatment periods. Subjects randomized to order AB will receive inhaled 7% NaCl (sodium chloride solution) mist during the first home treatment period, then 0.12% NaCL during the second home treatment period.</description>
