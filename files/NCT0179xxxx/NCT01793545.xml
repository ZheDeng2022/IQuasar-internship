      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecologic cancers. If it is caught at an&#xD;
      early stage, it can be treated more easily. Women who have this type of cancer often have a&#xD;
      history of irregular menstrual bleeding. They may also have abnormal findings during&#xD;
      gynecologic exams. Pap smears and cervical cell collection may be able to collect cell&#xD;
      samples for cancer testing. However, samples from the vagina or endometrium may produce more&#xD;
      accurate results. Researchers want to collect vaginal and endometrial cell samples to improve&#xD;
      their tests for and understanding of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect vaginal and endometrial cell samples to study endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women at least 18 years of age who have had symptoms of abnormal uterine or post-menopausal&#xD;
      bleeding, or abnormal ultrasound findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a pelvic exam. Before the exam, they will insert a small tampon&#xD;
           in the vagina. The tampon will stay in place for about 10 to 30 minutes. The tampon will&#xD;
           then be removed and collected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the pelvic exam, tissue will be collected from the uterine lining with a special&#xD;
           brush. An additional sample (biopsy) will be collected from the lining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will also be collected as part of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer will account for approximately 47,310 incident cases and 8,010 related&#xD;
      deaths in 2012. Most endometrial cancers develop slowly through progression of well&#xD;
      characterized precursors, many of which regress with progesterone treatment or are curable&#xD;
      with hysterectomy. Thus, early detection of endometrial cancer precursors can prevent many&#xD;
      endometrial cancers and reduce mortality. Using DNA methylation profiling in the Polish&#xD;
      Endometrial Cancer Study (PECS) and the Benign Reproductive Tissue Evaluation (BRTE) Study,&#xD;
      we identified a panel of markers that is strongly and specifically linked to endometrial&#xD;
      cancer. Concurrently, we have developed two sampling methods for detecting endometrial cancer&#xD;
      and its precursors via DNA methylation analysis: vaginal tampons and endometrial brushings.&#xD;
      Preliminary data demonstrate that DNA methylation markers are detectable in tampons and&#xD;
      endometrial brushings and can identify women with endometrial cancer. We propose to extend&#xD;
      the effort by collecting vaginal tampons and endometrial brushings from about 2000 women who&#xD;
      are at increased risk of endometrial cancer and who present at the Mayo Clinic Division of&#xD;
      Medical Gynecology. We will test our candidate panel of DNA methylation markers in this&#xD;
      population and evaluate the clinical performance to detect endometrial hyperplasia and&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. Success of this project could lead to development of early detection&#xD;
      tests, including self-sampling strategies that would improve management of abnormal vaginal&#xD;
      bleeding, endometrial cancer and its precursors.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women should meet at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal uterine bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thickened endometrial stripe&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hereditary predisposition to endometrial cancer (e.g. HNPCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women referred for endometrial biopsy to evaluate suspicion or high risk of&#xD;
             endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women (There will be a verbal screen by the clinic nurse and the physician&#xD;
             about a potential pregnancy and a pregnancy test may be conducted if there is any&#xD;
             doubt)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior pelvic radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervical stenosis that renders Tao brush sampling impossible&#xD;
