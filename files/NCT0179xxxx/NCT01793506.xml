  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel screening test to detect patients with&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiencies(PIDs). The investigators plan to use information gained from this&#xD;
      study in order to advance the field of clinical immunology, thus improving the diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment, and well-being of future patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      this screening test is able to detect patients with immune problems, and the investigators&#xD;
      will test patients with known PIDs to determine if the test is accurate&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that detecting serum immunoglobulins from dried blood spots&#xD;
      will be effective in detecting patients with known primary immunodeficiencies. If our&#xD;
      hypothesis is confirmed, it opens the possibility of using point of care testing to screen&#xD;
      for primary immune deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age of study subjects will range from 1 year to 80 years of age, and will be recruited form&#xD;
      the Immunodeficiency clinic at the Medical College of Wisconsin/Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Wisconsin (MCW/CHW). Any subject having testing done to evaluate the immune system is&#xD;
      eligible for this study. This will include patients with known PIDs as well as patients&#xD;
      evaluated for a suspected immunodeficiency. It is anticipated that 150 subjects will be&#xD;
      analyzed over a two year period.&#xD;

      After consent is obtained, blood will be obtained. The total amount of blood to drawn in one&#xD;
      day will not exceed 1.5 mL (1/3 tsp) per pound of body weight. All samples will be collected&#xD;
      at the same time as routine blood draws as ordered by your physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject samples will be de-identified by the Principal Investigator (PI) and given a serial&#xD;
      number. The PI will retain a secured log of the serial numbers and basic identifiers (name,&#xD;
      Date of Birth (DOB0, sex, preliminary diagnosis, and test results), and the subject samples&#xD;
      will be stored in a secured freezer. Only the PI will have access to the secured log book.&#xD;
      All study test results will be kept on compact discs, or similar computer storage devices, in&#xD;
      a secured area that will only be accessible by the PI. Study test results will not kept on&#xD;
      computers accessible by other individuals. The samples will not be sold to any third party.&#xD;
      The results of this research will not be conveyed to any third party. If the subject&#xD;
      withdraws or is withdrawn from the study all identifiable biological samples from that&#xD;
      subject will be discarded. The sample will not be available for any other type of testing&#xD;
      outside of this study.&#xD;
