      Early intervention with the Marte Meo method. Aim to study whether the program have effect&#xD;
      on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal confidence, maternal stress, maternal mood (EPDS), dyadic synchrony (Infant care&#xD;

      Relations between infant and vulnerable first time's mothers - Does video guidance with the&#xD;
      Marte Meo method promote the process? Intervention study in a community setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Infants develop their mentality, social and psychologically competencies in&#xD;
      relations with parents and sensitive and responsive caregiving is important for infant's&#xD;
      healthy development. Maternal responsiveness defined as the mother's ability to recognise&#xD;
      infant's cues and act on those is a key to promote a secure child. At risk are&#xD;
      unsecure/uncertain mothers, postpartum depressed mothers, mothers with preterm children and&#xD;
      infants who in the perspective of the mother cries persistent and/or does not sleep well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Danish public health nurses do home-visiting parents and they have opportunity to support&#xD;
      parents in the development of relations to the infants. Some nurse's uses video-guidance with&#xD;
      the Marte Meo method to promote the development of a healthy parent-infant relations, but&#xD;
      knowledge about the effect of parent's having received video-guidance with the method is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 1 Aim: To develop a screening tool to help public health nurses to identify&#xD;
      unsecure mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Intervention Mapping step 1. Need assessment and development of few questions as a&#xD;
      screening tool. Test of questions by face and content validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 2 Develop a standardised preventive program step 2-4 in Intervention Mapping. The&#xD;
      intervention is done by public health nurses, in home visits to first times mothers in the&#xD;
      period from the child 2 to 6 months aged. The intervention includes 2-5 home visits with&#xD;
      video-guidance's and has focus on the mother's ability to recognise infant's cues and act on&#xD;
      those.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded are families at sever risk who have been referred to treatment by psychiatric,&#xD;
      psychological or social apartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3 Test the program. Goal: to promote mothers parental self-efficacy, minimise mother's&#xD;
      stress and mother's depressive mood. To promote infants social competences and promote&#xD;
      mothers responsiveness and interaction with the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Quasi-experimental design. The intervention within 5 municipals with 36&#xD;
      &quot;interventions public health nurses&quot; (having a 1 Â½ year educations as a Marte Meo therapist)&#xD;
      and 85 &quot;control public health nurses&quot; who works as usually. The intervention group will&#xD;
      includes 60 families and they will be matches with 60 families from the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test: All first times mothers in the 5 municipals, when the children are 8 weeks old and&#xD;
      after the intervention has stopped, when the children are 6 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test: All public health nurses when the interventions start and when the intervention stops.&#xD;
