  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 16 patients with confirmed low- or intermediate risk prostate cancer scheduled for a&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy will be asked to have the Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) procedure&#xD;
      approximately 30 days prior to the prostatectomy. Ablation with IRE will be performed using&#xD;
      similar planning criteria, procedure protocol, instruments and software used for&#xD;
      brachytherapy, a conventional targeted radiation therapy where radioactive seeds are&#xD;
      implanted into prostate tumours. Patients will have an ultrasound of the prostate and the&#xD;
      imaging data will be entered into the Planning Software system. The volume of the prostate is&#xD;
      measured and a specified ablation zone will be determined. The IRE will be performed under&#xD;
      general anaesthetic and the specified zone identified in the planning stage will be ablated.&#xD;
      Four IRE electrode needles will be placed into the prostate under ultrasound image guidance.&#xD;
      When the needles are in place, electric pulses of one to two minutes duration are used to&#xD;
      ablate the specified zone. The total procedure time will be approximately 1 hour. Safety data&#xD;
      will be collected and patients will be followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks post IRE, pre-&#xD;
      prostatectomy, post prostatectomy and 1 week post prostatectomy. The safety data collection&#xD;
      is at 2 weeks post IRE. Before the IRE procedure, patients will have a Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) of the prostate. The patients will have&#xD;
      their scheduled prostatectomy at approximately 30 days after the IRE procedure.&#xD;
      Pre-prostatectomy, the ablation zone will be radiologically assessed by a control MRI/CEUS.&#xD;
      Post prostatectomy, efficacy of ablation will be determined by histological examination of&#xD;
      the prostate by the Pathology Department and measured as complete or incomplete ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is safety as measured by the composite of procedural device and post&#xD;
      procedural adverse events, measured with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v&#xD;
      4 (CTCAE), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score, International Prostate&#xD;
      Symptom Score (IPSS) or required catheterization time and International Index of Erectile&#xD;
      Function (IIEF) and efficacy of ablation determined by histological examination post&#xD;
      prostatectomy. Secondary outcomes will be patients procedure satisfaction measured by patient&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire, post procedural pain management and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      pain score, time to ambulation, length of hospital stay.&#xD;
