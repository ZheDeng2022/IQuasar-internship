      Title: The effectiveness of learning to collaborate interprofessionally on healthcare&#xD;
      processes and outcomes in nursing homes: a cluster randomized controlled trial in primary&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ageing of the population is expected to be a major driver of increasing demand for more&#xD;
      complex and continuous care. The delivery of health care for this population requires high&#xD;
      level of coordinated teamwork and efforts. Interprofessional collaboration can improve&#xD;
      healthcare processes and outcomes. It assumes a model of working together. It is a process by&#xD;
      which professionals develop an integrated and cohesive answer to the needs of the patients.&#xD;
      In this study the possible effects of learning to interprofessionally collaborate will be&#xD;
      investigated on health care processes and outcomes for chronic geriatric patients in nursing&#xD;
      homes.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           The extent to which different health care professionals work together can affect the&#xD;
           quality of the health care that they provide. Government bodies and organizations of&#xD;
           different medical and paramedical professions emphasize the importance of&#xD;
           interprofessional collaboration in health care (IPCIHC). It assumes a model of working&#xD;
           together particular with attention for the process by which professionals develop an&#xD;
           integrated and cohesive answer to the needs of the client/family/population. The outcome&#xD;
           is rather difficult to be evaluated and therefore it is important to understand the&#xD;
           effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving IPCIHC and so improving quality of&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite the large number of publications on interprofessional collaboration, a higher&#xD;
           quality of research, evidence and more rigorous evaluation is needed to support decision&#xD;
           makers. It is especially required to be specific when conclusions for certain population&#xD;
           and context should be drawn. The ageing of the population is expected to be a major&#xD;
           driver of increasing demand for long-term care services. Delivery of health care for&#xD;
           this population requires high levels of coordinated teamwork and efforts to provide a&#xD;
           good quality of care. But what is quality of care? To assess 'quality of care' it first&#xD;
           has to be defined and that depends on whether one assesses only the performance of&#xD;
           practitioners or also the contribution of patients and the health care system. As&#xD;
           described by the American Medical Association, quality of care is &quot;care that&#xD;
           consistently contributes to the improvement or maintenance of quality and/or duration of&#xD;
           life&quot;. Donabedian conceptualized quality of care as having an inter-related structure,&#xD;
           process and outcome components. Structured such as for example 'staffing', process as&#xD;
           actions on the patients such as for example restraint. And outcome indicators assess&#xD;
           patient's end result such as for example falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interprofessional collaboration as an intervention seems to result in a positive effect&#xD;
           for health care outcomes. Nevertheless there is need for more concrete information on&#xD;
           effect of interprofessional collaboration for chronic geriatric patients. Overall the&#xD;
           positive effect of interprofessional collaboration as an intervention for chronic&#xD;
           geriatric care is mainly found for outcomes such as fall incidence, transition, quality&#xD;
           of life, medication change and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research question What are the effects of learning to collaborate according an&#xD;
           interprofessional model on healthcare processes and outcomes for chronic geriatric&#xD;
           patients in nursing homes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Primary objective To investigate the effectiveness of learning to interprofessional&#xD;
      collaborate on quality indicators of 'care and safety' (fall incidence, medication, hospital&#xD;
      visits) and on quality indicators of 'caregivers and care organization' (absenteeism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Second objective To investigate the effectiveness of learning to interprofessional&#xD;
      collaborate on the level of intensity of care and knowledge of interprofessional&#xD;
      collaboration as a working model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Third objective To investigate the effectiveness of learning to interprofessional&#xD;
      collaborate for the chronic geriatric patient on the level of health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      independence and cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will set up a cluster randomized controlled trial in primary health care&#xD;
      aiming to investigate the effectiveness of training in interprofessional collaboration.&#xD;
      Patient oriented outcomes will be assessed in chronic geriatric patients in nursing homes,&#xD;
      including a pre-post assessment of the intervention with short and long term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible nursing homes will be invited to participate in this study as intervention group or&#xD;
      as control group. When informed consent is received, baseline measurements will be performed.&#xD;
      The nursing homes will be randomly allocated to control or intervention group. Data&#xD;
      collection in their residents will be performed by researcher assistants blind for&#xD;
      allocation, and not involved in data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group data will be gathered only at baseline and at 12 months. For the&#xD;
      intervention group data will be gathered at baseline, some measurements will be done at 6&#xD;
      months and then again at 12 month point. All data will be managed by a researcher who will&#xD;
      not be involved in data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After allocation, the research team will discuss an allocation specific measurement schedule&#xD;
      with the management board of the nursing homes. Once the schedule is agreed by management&#xD;
      board and research team, all nursing home personnel will also receive allocation specific&#xD;
      information. All personnel will be asked to actively participate in the study and will be&#xD;
      asked for informed consent. Finally, also the eligible residents of the nursing homes will&#xD;
      receive the allocation specific information and will be asked for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists an educational module titled 'to learn to collaborate&#xD;
      interprofessionally'. The intervention concerns two educational modules. The first module&#xD;
      (module 1) is a 10 hours course. It is a problem-based interactive learning method with real&#xD;
      life cases. This first module concerns definition, getting to know each other (the other&#xD;
      disciplines), making a care plan, discus ethical cases, reflecting on the competence of&#xD;
      'interprofessional collaborator' and finally presenting reflection and feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the second module (module 2) is a 10 hours course. In this module 2 it is important to&#xD;
      get on the personal level. Small teams will be formed. The teams will be guided by a&#xD;
      tutor/educator. In 3 sessions of 3 hours participating professional will have to reflect upon&#xD;
      their competence as collaborator and check what has to be learnt. Also in this module bottle&#xD;
      necks in collaboration will be collected by the tutor/educator. The intervention will take&#xD;
      place at the nursing homes and if needed for logistic issues it will take place at the&#xD;
      University of Antwerp. In the last session of one hour the team members have to present what&#xD;
      insight they gained through the sessions about themselves as collaborators. Finally they&#xD;
      formulate a learning goal for themselves for the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study quality of care is described for this population in terms of the healthcare&#xD;
      processes and outcomes expressed in the chosen outcomes (on macro, meso and micro level) and&#xD;
      the interrelation of these. The investigators are aware of the fact not all outcomes for&#xD;
      quality of care can be measured for this specific population. So the investigators chose on&#xD;
      basis of the literature and discussion with experts the outcomes. The main hypothesis for&#xD;
      this study is: the intervention will have effect on the quality of care for chronic geriatric&#xD;
      patients in nursing homes.&#xD;
