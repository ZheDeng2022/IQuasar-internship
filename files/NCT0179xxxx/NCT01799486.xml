  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious clinical problem because of its&#xD;
      worldwide distribution and potential adverse outcome, including cirrhosis, which is a major&#xD;
      cause of HBV related death. Studies show the use of nucleot(s)ide analogs treatment can&#xD;
      alleviate, even reverse the progress of HBV-related cirrhosis. In cirrhosis stage, some&#xD;
      potential factors, including endocrine disorder, renin, aldosterone, vasopressin increasing,&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus related nephritis, hepatorenal syndrome, may cause renal damage. With the&#xD;
      exposure of NAs, adverse reports of rhabdomyolysis, renal dysfunction, and lactic acidosis&#xD;
      are increasing. So when choosing NAs, the potential renal function impairment should be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Gane, Xiaoxi Li have separately reported that Telbivudine can improve estimate of&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of patients with chronic hepatitis B, while eGFR of&#xD;
      patients with Lamivudine, adefovir and entecavir have a trend of decrease, which suggested&#xD;
      Telbivudine may have renal protective effects. This effect on patients with HBV-related liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis has not been studied, which is not clear now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled study to prospectively observe Telbivudine's effect on&#xD;
      renal function, which aims to provide evidence in antiviral treatment for the patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;
