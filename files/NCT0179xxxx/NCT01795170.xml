      Restricting dietary lysine intake in infants from age 3 months or less with confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due to Antiquitin (ATQ) deficiency will: reduce&#xD;
      the accumulation of neurotoxic substratesα-aminoadipicsemialdehydeandits cyclic equivalent&#xD;
      1-piperideine-6-carboxylate;and will improve overall neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years of&#xD;
      age by acting as an effective intervention into the complex pathophysiology of the condition.&#xD;

      I Purpose: The purpose of this multi-centre study is to further assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the proposed lysine restricted diet in confirmed ATQ deficient PDE patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II Hypothesis: Restricting dietary lysine intake in infants from age 3 months or less with&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy due to Antiquitin (ATQ) deficiency will:&#xD;
      reduce the accumulation of neurotoxic substratesα-aminoadipicsemialdehydeandits cyclic&#xD;
      equivalent 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate;and will improve overall neurodevelopmental outcome at&#xD;
      3 years of age by acting as an effective intervention into the complex pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III Justification: We hope that participants have a much improved chance to avoid the same&#xD;
      degree of developmental delay and associated problems. If this study demonstrates a&#xD;
      significant improvement of normal development and proves to be safe to use this would provide&#xD;
      a positive benefit to the child, the families involved as well as decreasing the burden on&#xD;
      the health care system which currently must provide for life long care of these affected&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Objectives: To determine the safety and efficacy of the lysine restricted diet on numerous&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures as listed in the protocol. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome based on neuropsychological assessments&#xD;
      using Bayley-III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitement - Infants and/or children ranging from less than 3 months up to 3 years of&#xD;
           age who have been diagnosed with PDE and with confirmed ATQ deficiency will be recruited&#xD;
           within the 3 participating TIDE clinics (Medical Genetics, Biochemical Diseases,&#xD;
           Neurology). Families may choose to participate in the TEST group or CONTROL group if&#xD;
           they do not wish to undergo the lysine restricted diet regimen or decline to participate&#xD;
           altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study visits - For participants in the TEST group, this will include a baseline visit&#xD;
           and follow up visits at ages 3 months, 6 months then every 6 months until 3 years of&#xD;
           age. For participants in the CONTROL group study visits include a baseline visit and 1&#xD;
           follow up visit at age 3 years. Routine clinical care visits can be scheduled as per&#xD;
           treating physician's discretion at shorter intervals if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedures: The following safety and efficacy measures will be performed at the&#xD;
           specified study visits (Refer to table1 protocol or consent): medical history, vital&#xD;
           signs, anthropometric measurements, Physical and Neurological exams, vision &amp; hearing&#xD;
           assessments, blood and urine samples tested for biomarkers, electroencephalogram,&#xD;
           cognitive function test, ages and stages questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire,&#xD;
           MRI, Cerebral Spinal fluid request only if lumbar puncture is being performed for&#xD;
           clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Outcomes: The following outcomes will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive development at age 3 years defined by total developmental index measured&#xD;
           using the Bayley Scales for Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of biochemical marker-α- aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA) its cyclic equivalent P6C&#xD;
           in plasma and urine Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seizure frequency: clinical and electrical (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life through a HR-QOL questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological deficits through neuro exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma lysine and branched chain amino acid levels Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global nutritional assessment with plasma levels for albumin, prealbumin, total protein,&#xD;
           iron parameters, zinc, selenium, CBC, folic acid, vitamin B12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral sensory neuropathy (relevant because the lysine restriction is expected to&#xD;
           reduce chemical inactivation of pyridoxine, thus potentially increasing the risk of&#xD;
           toxicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN Structure: We will conduct a multicenter, open label,&#xD;
      negative-controlled observational cohort study to assess the safety and the efficacy on&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome of early dietary lysine restriction as an adjunct to pyridoxine&#xD;
      therapy for infants with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy resulting from ATQ deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Exposure: Patients receiving a lysine restricted diet adjunct to pyridoxine therapy&#xD;
      will be considered as participants in the 'exposure'/test group and patients on pyridoxine&#xD;
      mono-therapy will be participants in the 'control' group. The ratio of test participants to&#xD;
      controls in the study will be 1:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: All participants will be monitored for safety and neurodevelopmental outcome until&#xD;
      the age of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy &amp; Safety Analysis: Data will be summarized with descriptive statistics, frequency&#xD;
      tabulations, and data listings. Analyses include comparison of treatment effect before and&#xD;
      after diet restriction within each participant, and comparison between test and control&#xD;
      groups. Analysis will be performed on intent-to-treat population including all enrolled&#xD;
      participants. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome&#xD;
      based on neuropsychological assessments using Bayley-III. The evaluation comprises the&#xD;
      following scales: Cognitive Scale, Language Composite Scale with Receptive and Expressive&#xD;
      Language subscales, and Motor Composite Scale with Fine- and Gross-Motor subscales. A&#xD;
      composite score of all the scales gives the total developmental index. For the composite&#xD;
      score and each scale, a hypothesis test can be performed to compare test group and the&#xD;
      control group. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean change in Treatment minus mean&#xD;
      change in control groups will be calculated for the total developmental index and each&#xD;
      individual scale of Bayley-III to evaluate any particular nonnegative quantity of clinical&#xD;
      interest. Similar analysis using appropriate parametric (ANOVA, ANCOVA, Fishers exact test)&#xD;
      and nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon rank sum test) will be done for all efficacy and safety&#xD;
      outcomes. Severity and relationship to treatment of the adverse events will be summarized.&#xD;

    <description>Daily lysine intake will be managed to maintain a plasma lysine level of 50-80 µmol/L (normal range: 52-196 µmol/L). Diet prescriptions will be based on international guidelines for glutaricaciduria type I, another inborn error of lysine catabolism. In order to meet the recommended daily protein intake (DRI) [23,24], the diet may include commercially available lysine-free amino acid formulas approved for use in conditions affecting lysine metabolism, as well as commercially available low-protein products based on the participant's taste.</description>
