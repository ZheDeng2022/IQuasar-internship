  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the use of new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      coils. An MRI takes pictures of body parts using a large magnet and a computer. A coil is the&#xD;
      part of the MRI system that collects data to make the MR images. The investigators have&#xD;
      designed, developed, and built two child-sized coils to use when imaging elbows, wrists,&#xD;
      knees, and ankles. These new coils will be better suited to fit infants through teenagers&#xD;
      rather than the conventional coils used which were created for adults These MRI coils have&#xD;
      not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are considered&#xD;
      investigational devices.&#xD;

      The safety and the clinical efficacy/equivalence of two pediatric 1.5T coils will be&#xD;
      evaluated/demonstrated in two phases. Patient safety and image quality will be&#xD;
      evaluated/demonstrated in Phase One by collecting images on healthy participants using a&#xD;
      combination of the existing commercially available coils and the new coils. Clinical&#xD;
      efficacy/equivalence will be evaluated/demonstrated in Phase Two by collecting standard MRI&#xD;
      exams in pediatric patients. In Phase Two, the imaging data for a given patient will be&#xD;
      collected by one of the two following scenarios : 1) the clinically ordered exams will be&#xD;
      completed using a combination of the existing commercially available coils and new coil, with&#xD;
      the images from each directly compared, or 2) the clinically ordered scans will be collected&#xD;
      using one of the new coils and the images compared to historical de-identified MR exam, age&#xD;
      and gender matched patient data (which were acquired using the existing commercially&#xD;
      available coils). Results of Phase One will be reported to the IRB. Phase Two will not begin&#xD;
      until the IRB has reviewed the results of Phase One and approved the commencement of Phase&#xD;
      Two.&#xD;
