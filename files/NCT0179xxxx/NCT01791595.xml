  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given&#xD;
      safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed and&#xD;
      what happens to AZD3965 inside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD3965 is a type of drug called a monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor which is being&#xD;
      used to stop the growth of cancer cells and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of one&#xD;
      of the proteins involved in moving chemical compounds in and out of the cells of the body.&#xD;
      This will be the first time that this type of drug has been given to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug is a capsule and is taken daily. The study is in two parts. In Part 1 of the study,&#xD;
      small groups of patients were treated at increasing doses to find the highest safe dose and&#xD;
      best dose to give to patients in Part 2 of the study. 43 patients with advanced solid tumours&#xD;
      were treated in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the dose found to be safe in Part 1 is given to patients with diffuse large B cell&#xD;
      lymphoma and Burkitt's Lymphoma. 15 - 20 patients will be treated in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will need to visit the hospital weekly for two months and then every fortnight.&#xD;
      Patients will have regular blood and urine tests, scans, heart traces and eye tests amongst&#xD;
      other clinical tests. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to&#xD;
      the drug inside the body. Treatment will continue until a patient's cancer starts growing but&#xD;
      can continue for up to a maximum of 12 months if the cancer is responding to the drug. It is&#xD;
      important to explain that this is the first study of this drug and patients will have&#xD;
      advanced cancer so it is unlikely that patients will benefit directly from taking part but&#xD;
      the study may help improve future treatment of cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1 followed a rolling six dose escalation schedule of AZD3965 until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) was defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      43 patients with advanced solid tumours were treated in Part 1 of the study. A recommended&#xD;
      Phase II dose (RP2D) has been proposed from the safety, pharmacokinetic, and proof of&#xD;
      mechanism of lactate transport inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&#xD;
      results from Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in Part 2 will be treated at this RP2D to further explore the tolerability of&#xD;
      this dose and schedule and to explore proof of principle of MCT1 inhibition in tumour types&#xD;
      that were shown to express MCT1 and in which AZD3965 showed some effect pre-clinically&#xD;
      (diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt's Lymphoma).&#xD;

             form plus a barrier method) [oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception and&#xD;
