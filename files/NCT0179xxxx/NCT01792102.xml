      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open label, dose-escalation, nonrandomized study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of a 60-minute infusion of carfilzomib&#xD;
      for patients with progressive multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period, followed by a treatment period of up to eight&#xD;
      28-day treatment cycles, followed by a period of maintenance treatment. Subjects are to be&#xD;
      treated until disease progression.&#xD;

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose will be established by the number of dose limiting toxicities and the overall safety and tolerability of the study drug.&#xD;
Safety and tolerability will be determined by the following:&#xD;
incidence and frequency of adverse events throughout the study&#xD;
clinical laboratory test results at study visits&#xD;
vital signs measurements at each study visits&#xD;
medical history and physical examination findings&#xD;
ECOG performance status at study visits&#xD;

    <measure>Establish efficacy as assessed by the overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>monthly, up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be determined by the following:&#xD;
SPEP, UPEP, and quantification of immunoglobulins and immunofixation&#xD;
bone marrow aspirates and biopsies to confirm CR&#xD;
roentgenographic skeletal survey&#xD;
Response rate will be assessed by the following:&#xD;

    <description>Phase 1: Carfilzomib will be administered at an escalating dose by cohort as 60-minute IV infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle. On Cycle 1 Days 1 and 2, carfilzomib will be given at 20 mg/m^2. For all subsequent doses, carfilzomib will be administered at the dose assigned to the cohort (56, 70, or 88 mg/m^2). Dexamethasone (8 mg IV or PO) will be administered prior to carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.&#xD;
Phase 2: Carfilzomib will be administered at the MTD determined in phase 1. Maintenance: From Cycle 9 onward, carfilzomib and dexamethasone will be administered in the same fashion as during the previous treatment cycle, but only on days 1, 2, 15, and 16.</description>
