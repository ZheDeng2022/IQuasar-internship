  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integrated pulmonary index (IPI) is a tool that monitors respiratory status. It takes into&#xD;
      account four parameters: respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, heart rate and O2 saturation using&#xD;
      a pulse oximeter and specialized sidestream CO2 monitor. The device can continuously monitor&#xD;
      and display the patient's ventilatory state as a single digit, 1-10. In addition, trends can&#xD;
      be kept and it can provide early indication of changes in respiratory status. IPI has only&#xD;
      been studied in pediatric patients who are under sedation; however, more uses for the&#xD;
      monitoring tool are a possibility. One of those possibilities is to use IPI to monitor&#xD;
      pediatric patients during the weaning and extubation process to determine if a specific&#xD;
      number, or less than a specific number, is associated with extubation failure. Therefore,&#xD;
      clinicians and physicians would be better able to determine if the patient is ready for&#xD;
      extubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an prospective observational study designed to collect data on the IPI in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated pediatric patients undergoing the weaning process and extubation&#xD;
      using the FDA approved Capnostream 20Â® bedside monitor (CS20) (Covidien Inc., Mansfield, MA,&#xD;
      USA). Inclusion criteria include patients intubated at least 24 hours who are less than 18&#xD;
      years of age but greater than 1 year of age. Exclusion criteria include patients less than 1&#xD;
      year of age or the presence of a tracheostomy tube. The IPI number will be blinded throughout&#xD;
      the study but directly monitored values (SpO2, HR, PETCO2, RR) will be available for clinical&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon meeting inclusion criteria, the subject will be given a code number to protect their&#xD;
      identity. Study personnel will verify that the CS20 monitor matches the institutional&#xD;
      time/date prior to use and the de-identified subject ID will be entered in the CS20 monitor.&#xD;
      The subject will be connected to the CS20 device via a pulse oximeter probe and a CO2&#xD;
      sampling line attached to the ventilator circuit, both are standard of care in monitoring&#xD;
      ventilated pediatric patients. Subjects will be monitored for 10 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of physician directed weaning evaluation or extubation. Study personnel will&#xD;
      verify that the IPI number on the monitor is not visible to clinicians in order to prevent&#xD;
      changes on routine interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will record date, time, and mechanical ventilator settings when the CS20&#xD;
      monitor is started to collect baseline data. Physician directed weaning trials or ventilator&#xD;
      changes to test readiness for extubation will be recorded to correlate IPI values at a later&#xD;
      date. Venous and/or arterial blood gas (ABG) data and nebulizer treatments occurring during&#xD;
      the study will be recorded along with the PETCO2 when the ABG is drawn or nebulizer treatment&#xD;
      administered and CS20 monitor will be marked with an event. For nebulizer treatments, mark&#xD;
      event and also push the pump off button to pause IPI monitoring for 15 minutes in order to&#xD;
      prevent sample line from becoming clogged. CS 20 IPI monitoring will automatically resume 15&#xD;
      minutes after pausing the pump. If the weaning trial is stopped or the patient is extubated,&#xD;
      the date and time will be recorded and the monitor will be marked with an event. Subjects&#xD;
      that fail the weaning readiness determination will have the process repeated for up to three&#xD;
      weaning attempts. If not weaned from mechanical ventilation after the third attempt,&#xD;
      participation in the trial will be terminated. Participation in the study will be terminated&#xD;
      if extubation does not occur within 72 hours of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If extubated, the event will be marked on the monitor and the date and time will be recorded&#xD;
      on the case report form (CRF). After extubation, the subject will remain reconnected to the&#xD;
      CS20 monitor via a PETCO2 sampling nasal cannula capable of providing supplemental oxygen and&#xD;
      a pulse oximeter. Subjects will continue to be monitored for up to 48 hours post extubation&#xD;
      or until transferred out of the ICU. If a subject fails extubation and requires re-intubation&#xD;
      or use of noninvasive ventilation, the event and time will be recorded and the study will be&#xD;
      terminated. The subject may withdraw from the study at anytime or the attending physician may&#xD;
      terminate their participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necessary protected health information (PHI) includes subject name and medical record number&#xD;
      to track the subject at 48 hours post extubation. PHI will be maintained on a site enrollment&#xD;
      log separate from any collected data in a locked file cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data for this study will include the time stamped electronic parameter data by&#xD;
      subject ID from the CS20; the CRF with de-identified demographic information, significant&#xD;
      pulmonary medical history, ventilator parameters prior to extubation, method used to&#xD;
      determine readiness to discontinue mechanical ventilation, number of days on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator, rapid shallow breathing index, VD/VT, ABG and co-morbidity, date and time of&#xD;
      extubation and 48 hour post extubation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time stamped electronic parameter data from the CS20 will be obtained from the monitor via a&#xD;
      USB drive. Data from the CS20 will be stored in a secure computer by subject ID number. The&#xD;
      de-identified subject demographic information, medical and pulmonary history will be obtained&#xD;
      from the subject's electronic medical record by the study staff and recorded on the CRF. The&#xD;
      CRFs will be stored in a Study Binder in a locked filling cabinet in the College of Sciences.&#xD;
      The Study Binder will be stored in a secure location and the data will be retained for three&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
