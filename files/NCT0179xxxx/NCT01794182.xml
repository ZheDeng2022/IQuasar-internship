  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, prospective, double blind study. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy and safety of glyburide (RP-1127) compared to placebo in participants&#xD;
      with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who are likely to develop malignant&#xD;
      edema.This objective will be addressed by comparing the proportion of glyburide treated&#xD;
      particpants and placebo treated participants with a Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 4&#xD;
      without decompressive craniectomy (DC). The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      RP-1127 compared to placebo in participants with a severe anterior circulation ischemic&#xD;
      stroke who were likely to develop malignant edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of participants with a clinical diagnosis of acute severe&#xD;
      anterior circulation ischemic stroke, a baseline diffusion weighted image (DWI) lesion&#xD;
      between 82 and 300 cm3, age 18-80 years, and time from symptom onset to start of study&#xD;
      infusion of ≤10 hours. The study will enroll both participants that do not receive&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and those that receive IV&#xD;
      rtPA within 4.5 hours of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be randomized controlling for site, age ≤60 (yes/no), and IV rtPA treatment&#xD;
      at baseline (yes/no). Participants will be randomized equally between glyburide and placebo.&#xD;
