    <textblock>
      Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Type I (CDAI) is a recessive autosomal disease caused by&#xD;
      ineffective erythropoiesis that causes Anemia &amp; accumulation of iron due to increased&#xD;
      absorption of iron in the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iron is being accumulated in the body &amp; causes damage of the liver, heart &amp; endocrine&#xD;
      glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard follow up of iron levels is done by ferritin blood test &amp; although the test is&#xD;
      not accurate it is the most available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment to removal of iron excess from the body is given in ferritin levels of&#xD;
      500-1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 drugs are approved in the market:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deferoxamine, given subcutaneous during the night, 5-7 nights/week and therefore is less&#xD;
           used today.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deferiprone-given 3 times a day, is a weaker chelator, although it seems like it is good&#xD;
           to give it in combination with one of the 2 other drugs because it removes the iron from&#xD;
           the heart's cells better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rare but severe adverse effect is Agranulocytosis. This drug is usually not given in&#xD;
      childbirths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The 3rd drug which is mostly in use today is Deferasirox, given once daily, but has also&#xD;
      adverse effects, among them- damage of liver &amp; kidney function, damage to the digestive&#xD;
      system, hearing and seeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron is being absorbed in acidic area, &amp; thus drugs which decrease the acidity like hydrogen&#xD;
      pump's inhibitors, can inhibit the absorption of iron, and indeed there are reports that&#xD;
      these drugs decrease the absorption of iron and were used as treatment to hemochromatosis as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those hydrogen pump's inhibitors have also adverse effects. The rarest but most severe is&#xD;
      intestine infection by Clostridium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, reports of adverse effects are minimal- mostly headaches &amp; abdominal pains and&#xD;
      nosocomial infections. In adults, there are reports of fractures, magnesium deficiency &amp;&#xD;
      vitamin B12 deficiency. All in all, the adverse effects are rare &amp; uncommon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to check whether treatment with drug which inhibits the hydrogen&#xD;
      pump and therefore decreases acidity, will reduce the iron's absorption in patients with CDA&#xD;
      TYPE I and whether it will be possible to use it for a period instead of giving drugs which&#xD;
      have much more adverse effects, for removal of iron excess from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we would like to enroll 10-12 patients over 30 kg who can swallow tablets (age&#xD;
      over 12) and whose ferritin levels are higher from the normal range, but still don't require&#xD;
      medical treatment (ferritin levels between 400-700).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be given LOSEC 20 mg X 1/day for 6 months. That group will be her own&#xD;
      control group in the 6 months later. Drug will be dispensed to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the beginning of the study, after signing Informed Consent Form, blood tests will be taken&#xD;
      for Complete Blood Count, iron levels, iron saturation, ferritin, complete chemistry panel,&#xD;
      including calcium &amp; magnesium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same tests will be taken after 3 and 6 months and also 3 and 6 months after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every event of fever, headaches, abdominal pain or diarrhea, patients need to apply the&#xD;
      doctor and report.&#xD;
