    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving two-year failure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Reported will be the percentage of participants achieving either a biochemical or clinical failure or positive biopsy. Biochemical Failure will be evaluated using the Phoenix definition wherein failure occurs when the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is ≥ 2 ng/ml more than the lowest PSA measurement before the current one. Clinical failure will be reported as any clinical evidence of local progression or recurrence. A positive biopsy will be concluded via histological evaluation.</description>

    <measure>HRQOL as assessed by MAX-PC questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5.25 years</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured using the scores on the Modified 18-item Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) from pre-treatment to post-treatment. The scale consists of 18 items (e.g. &quot;I thought about prostate cancer even though I didn't mean to.&quot;) scored on a scale from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;often&quot;). Total scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HRQOL as assessed by EPIC-SF-12 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5.25 years</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Medical Outcomes Study SF-12 (EPIC SF-12) to evaluate patient function and satisfaction after prostate cancer treatment. The questionnaire has 5 subscales (Urinary Function, Urinary Symptoms, Bowel Habits, Sexual Function and Hormonal Function). Each subscale has a total score ranging from 0-100, with higher scores representing better HRQOL.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gleason score 2-7 (reviewed by reference lab at UM).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Biopsy within one year of date of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical stage ≤ T2 based on DRE and/or ≤ T3a based on MRI (if done); N0-Nx; M0-Mx&#xD;
             (AJCC 7th Edition)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T-stage and N-stage determined by physical exam and available imaging studies&#xD;
                  (CT, and/or MRI of the pelvis; see section 4.5). For MRI, questionable&#xD;
                  extracapsular extension is permitted. To distinguish blood from tumor the ideal&#xD;
                  study would be to acquire T2, T1 noncontrast and T1 dynamic contrast enhanced&#xD;
                  sequence, although this is not required. A small amount of extracapsular&#xD;
                  extension is permitted, as long as it can be included in the clinical target&#xD;
                  volume (CTV) and the constraints are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  M-stage determined by physical exam, CT or MRI. Bone scan not required unless&#xD;
                  clinical findings suggest possible osseous metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) &lt; 20 ng/ml, obtained no greater than 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;

                    -  Clinical stage T2b-T2c; Gleason ≤ 6, PSA ≤ 10 &amp; &lt;50% biopsy cores positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinical stage T1-T2; Gleason ≤ 6, PSA ≤ 10 &amp; ≥50% biopsy cores positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinical stage T1-T2; Gleason = 7, PSA ≤ 10 &amp; &lt;50% biopsy cores positive or&#xD;
                       T1-T2; Gleason ≤ 6 &amp; PSA &gt;10 and &lt; 20 &amp; &lt; 50% biopsy cores positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  MRI stage T3a with evidence of extraprostatic extension is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinical stage is based on digital rectal exam (DRE). Seminal vesicle&#xD;
                       invasion on MRI is not eligible. T1a should be permitted if subsequent&#xD;
                       peripheral zone biopsies show tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prostate volume: ≤ 80 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Determined using: volume = π/6 x length x height x width.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measured from CT or MRI ≤90 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Zubrod performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No prior total prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior suprapubic prostatectomy, transurethral resection and laser ablation are&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. No prior radiotherapy to the prostate or lower pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No implanted hardware or other material that would prohibit appropriate treatment&#xD;
             planning or treatment delivery, in the investigator's opinion.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. 4-6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are allowed for intermediate risk&#xD;
             patients. This must be declared prior to randomization. This may not have been started&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Patient must be able to have gold fiducial markers placed in the prostate (if on&#xD;
             anticoagulants, must be cleared by a primary care physician or cardiologist), or if&#xD;
             patient already has fiducial marker placed, they must be in accordance with the&#xD;
             protocol specifications (Section 4.2.2). NOTE: If a method of intrafraction prostate&#xD;
             tracking is available which does not require fiducial markers, this will be adequate&#xD;

             already placed that are not in accordance with the protocol (Section 4.2.2). NOTE: If&#xD;
             a method of intrafraction prostate tracking is available which does not require&#xD;
             fiducial markers, this will be adequate for this trial (i.e. 4D transperitoneal&#xD;
             ultrasound, onboard MRI guidance).&#xD;
