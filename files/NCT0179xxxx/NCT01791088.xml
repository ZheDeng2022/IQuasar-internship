      This clinical trial studies sirolimus in treating patients with solid tumors that are&#xD;
      metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Sirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the magnitude, inter-individual variability and time course of&#xD;
      sirolimus-induced changes in fasting serum glucose and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess candidate genetic variants for their correlation with changes in fasting glucose&#xD;
      and/or triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,&#xD;
      version 1.1) and explore whether there is any correlation between response and changes in&#xD;
      fasting glucose and/or triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version&#xD;
      4.0) and explore whether there is any correlation between toxicities and changes in fasting&#xD;
      glucose and/or triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To quantify and determine the functional status of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs)&#xD;
      before and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>These data will be analyzed by fitting mixed effects models for longitudinal data. A model linear in time with random patient intercept and slope effects will be fit initially and residuals examined. If a linear model does not fit the data adequately a quadratic term will be added. Simple paired t-tests of the glucose and triglyceride levels on day 8, 15, and 29 relative to baseline will also be performed.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Serious underlying medical or psychiatric illnesses that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
