  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are very aggressive and among the most common of brain tumors. A diagnosis&#xD;
      carries with it a median survival of approximately 24 months. The current standard treatment&#xD;
      of surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy has not substantially&#xD;
      prolonged survival and even the few treatment options shown to exhibit small increases in&#xD;
      survival primarily benefit certain (i.e., young) patient subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer vaccines represent one novel therapy for malignant gliomas. The goal is for the body&#xD;
      to recognize the tumor cells are foreign and produce its own response to fight off recurring&#xD;
      tumor cells. A promising means of causing an immune response so the body can create this&#xD;
      immunity is through the use of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Dendritic cells are a small group of cells contained in everyone's white blood cell&#xD;
      population. These cells are responsible for letting the immune system know that something&#xD;
      foreign is in the body. Dendritic cells help the body ward off disease by alerting the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imiquimod in an FDA-approved cream that is an immune response modifier, which will be used&#xD;
      off-label in this study. Imiquimod cream (5%, 250 mg) will be self-applied topically by&#xD;
      patients to a 4 x 5-cm outlined area of healthy skin overnight on days 1-5 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Application and removal times will be recorded in treatment diaries. Dendritic cells will be&#xD;
      injected intradermally into the imiquimod-treated site on day 3. Cycles will be repeated&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for a total of three injections. This study will examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      using Imiquimod with DC vaccines, as previous studies within the oncology department have&#xD;
      studied the effectiveness of DC vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imiquimod (Aldara, 3M) is one of the better characterized imidazoquinolines and is the only&#xD;
      one currently approved for clinical use as a topical ointment. It has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      possess antiviral and antitumor properties, and it is approved for the treatment of genital&#xD;
      warts. Vaccination studies in animal models have indicated that imidazoquinolines can boost&#xD;
      the magnitude and quality of T cell responses. It is considered a Toll-like receptor agonist&#xD;
      which controls the activation of dendritic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, it was shown that topical imiquimod treatment may enhance the immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      melanoma vaccine. Additionally, injection of immature DCs into imiquimod-pretreated skin lead&#xD;
      to DC activation in situ and enhanced migratory capacity to draining lymph nodes in cancer&#xD;
      patients. In this study, the investigators test the safety and feasibility of imiquimod in a&#xD;
      vaccine against brain cancer to induce a more potent immune response that what has previously&#xD;
      been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prior Phase I and Phase II studies, patients who received chemotherapy following DC&#xD;
      demonstrated longer progression free and overall survival than the patients who received DC&#xD;
      or chemotherapy alone. The use of DC vaccines is considered investigational and has not yet&#xD;
      been approved by the FDA, but the investigators have obtained an IND for use of the vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether after standard therapy of tumor resection&#xD;
      surgery followed by DC vaccines with Imiquimod will not only generate (start) an immune&#xD;
      response, but will provide longer progression-free survival. Subjects will have clinically&#xD;
      indicated resection surgery and will consent to our screening study for vaccine trials (IRB&#xD;
      #9225), under which subjects will have their tumor tissue analyzed in order to verify&#xD;
      eligibility into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures include the following: laboratory blood draws, urinalysis at screening,&#xD;
      immunological testing, administration of the quality of life questionnaire, neurological&#xD;
      exams, MRI testing, leukapheresis for dendritic cells, review of adverse events/concomitant&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were screened and not enrolled in this clinical trial due to screen failure will&#xD;
      be notified of the reason for screen failure. Pre HIV counseling and appropriate referral&#xD;
      resources will be provided. If the screen failure is due to the positive HIV test,&#xD;
      appropriate post HIV counseling will be provided and appropriate referrals will be made. The&#xD;
      charts of the patients with screen failures will be destroyed. The patients' charts who will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study will be kept in the locked cabinet in the research office. Patients&#xD;
      will be assigned a unique identifying code known only to the research team. Data will be&#xD;
      captured by various source documents, or, as necessary, abstracted from hospital medical&#xD;
      records by an experienced registered nurse. The electronic data for viral testing will be&#xD;
      accessible to research personnel only.&#xD;
