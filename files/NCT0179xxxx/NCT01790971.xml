  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) appear to be especially vulnerable to medications&#xD;
      that suppress pharyngeal muscle activity such as general anesthetics and opioids. Opioids can&#xD;
      depress the ventilator response to airway obstruction and inhibit the awakening response to&#xD;
      hypoxia and hypercarbia, resulting in central respiratory depression. OSA is therefore an&#xD;
      important risk factor for serious postoperative complications, including perioperative death.&#xD;
      While OSA is increasingly recognized as a serious perioperative concern, current clinical&#xD;
      practices are highly inconsistent with regard to the management of surgical patients with&#xD;
      OSA. Additionally, the relative safety of intrathecal opioids in this patient population&#xD;
      remains unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) are among the most common orthopedic procedures&#xD;
      performed worldwide1. They have been shown to reduce chronic pain, increase the ability to&#xD;
      function independently, and improve quality of life2,3. With an aging and increasingly obese&#xD;
      North American population, the uses of THA and TKA are increasing 4. One of the main&#xD;
      challenges associated with THA as well as TKA continues to be the perioperative management of&#xD;
      patients who are elderly or obese, and their associated co-morbidities. Both THA and TKA are&#xD;
      commonly performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial anesthesia has been reported to&#xD;
      provide multiple benefits when compared to general anesthesia and/or systemic analgesia&#xD;
      including superior post-operative analgesia5, reduced opioid consumption6, improved&#xD;
      rehabilitation7, and reduced morbidity and mortality8-12. The addition of opioids to the&#xD;
      neuraxial local anesthetic solution has been common practice since 1979, when morphine was&#xD;
      first shown to provide effective and prolonged analgesia after intrathecal administration13.&#xD;
      For both THA and TKA surgeries, intrathecal morphine provides effective analgesia14-16&#xD;
      allowing for a reduction of the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic (thus minimizing side&#xD;
      effects)17, and has a marked postoperative opioid-sparing effect14-16. However, these&#xD;
      benefits of intrathecal morphine must be weighed against its risks of pruritis,&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting, urinary retention, and, of most concern, respiratory depression18.&#xD;
