      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 physical exercise training&#xD;
      programs, with a supplementation in fruits and vegetables, on energy cost of walking. 60&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into 2 groups. The first program will be consist of an interval&#xD;
      strength training for 30 min on bicycle ergometer (which include strengthening exercises in&#xD;
      an high intensity interval training). The second program will be conducted at a relatively&#xD;
      low intensity of effort, corresponding to 50% of oxygen uptake (VO2) peak measured by&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry. All subjects will receive a free supplement of 5 fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      per day during all the intervention. The intervention will last 9 months in total : 5 month&#xD;
      at the hospital fallow by 4 month at home.&#xD;

      Background: in Reunion Island in 2000, the REDIA study showed a prevalence of obesity among&#xD;
      women and men of 20% and 10%, respectively. Obesity is associated with several diseases,&#xD;
      including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart diseases.&#xD;
      Regular physical activity associated with a hypocaloric diet and an intake of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables can reduce body fat mass and obesity-associated complications. However there is no&#xD;
      consensus on the physical training protocols for prevention and treatment of obesity. As a&#xD;
      consequence, future studies are required to improve obesity management and decrease&#xD;
      obesity-associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to compare the effects of two programs of rehabilitation training associated&#xD;
      with a diet supplemented with fruits and vegetables on reducing energy cost of walking in&#xD;
      obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to compare the effects of two programs of rehabilitation training&#xD;
      associated with a diet supplemented with fruits and vegetables on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mechanical properties of the lower extremity muscles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the biomechanics of walking,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the walking intensity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the quality of life, and physical activities compliance and motivation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the alimentary behaviour,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and the oxidative stress and the inflammatory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity associated with a hypocaloric diet and an intake of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables can reduce body fat mass and prevent the inflammatory and oxidative stress which&#xD;
      are associated with obesity. Daily physical activities such as carrying bags, making&#xD;
      housework, stair climbing, or simply walking, are recommended to increase total daily energy&#xD;
      expenditure. However, obese individuals have a higher energy cost of walking compared with&#xD;
      their lean counterparts. This higher energy cost of walking does not induce higher total&#xD;
      daily energy expenditure by an increase in activity energy expenditure, but inversely,&#xD;
      increases exercise intensity and reduces walking practice. It has been shown that this higher&#xD;
      energy cost of walking could be due to reduced lower extremity muscle strength of obese&#xD;
      individuals. Moreover, muscle strength is also reduced after a weight loss due to a decrease&#xD;
      in lean body mass. However, it has been shown in lean and over-weight individuals, that&#xD;
      strength training could induce a decrease of the energy cost of walking, making easier&#xD;
      walking activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we propose in obese patients to compare the short- and medium-term results of two&#xD;
      training protocols for 5 months, both associated with a diet supplemented with fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, on reducing energy cost of walking. The study will last 9 months in total with a&#xD;
      5 months training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into 2 arms: arm 1 will consist of an interval strength&#xD;
      training for 30 min on bicycle ergometer (which include strengthening exercises in an high&#xD;
      intensity interval training), and arm 2 will consist of a isocaloric continuous exercise&#xD;
      realised at moderate intensity (50 % of Vo2max) for 40 min on bicycle ergometer too.&#xD;
      Participants will meet for training three times per week for 5 months under supervision of an&#xD;
      exercise physiologist. All the participants will have an initial nutritional education&#xD;
      session at the beginning of the study and will answer to questionnaires on training&#xD;
      experience during the 5 months training period (Exercise difficulties, pain...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study and at each follow-up visit (5th and 9th month), all&#xD;
      participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biological analysis : blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, cholesterol total, HDL, LDL,&#xD;
           triglycerides, C reactive protein (CRP), albumin, creatinine, urinary parameters,&#xD;
           antioxidant status, inflammatory markers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximal cardiopulmonary exercise,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anthropometric and functional examinations : weight, height, waist, hip and thigh&#xD;
           circumferences, blood pressure and body composition assessed by dual x-ray&#xD;
           absorptiometry,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory tests : measurements of energy cost of walking, walking pattern on treadmill,&#xD;
           and muscle strength,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  questionnaires on quality of life, alimentary behaviour, experience of physical&#xD;
           activities and on physical activities compliance and motivation.&#xD;
