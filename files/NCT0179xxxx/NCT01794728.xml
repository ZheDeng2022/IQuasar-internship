      The How the Elderly Live with Pain in Heart Failure (HELP-HF) study provides the opportunity&#xD;
      to assess the complaints of pain in a cohort of HF patient admitted to Thomas Jefferson&#xD;
      University Hospital (TJUH). Additional information on their existing co-morbid conditions, an&#xD;
      inventory of their prescribed medications, and details regarding the type of treatment&#xD;
      interventions (over the counter analgesia and other comfort practices) they report using will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;

      Study Events Patients admitted to TJUH with a HF diagnosis will be identified by intensive&#xD;
      clinical research coordinator screening methods. The potential subjects will be approached in&#xD;
      the acute care area for interview and consent to participate. At that visit, the variables of&#xD;
      interest will be collected and the questionnaires completed. Following discharge, the&#xD;
      subjects will be re-interviewed at follow-up clinic visits or by telephone, depending on&#xD;
      whether the visit is to a Jefferson University Physician provider or to an outside provider&#xD;
      or as circumstances allow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will sign an informed consent to participate in HELP-HF. A selection of assessment&#xD;
      questionnaires (listed below) and performance measures will be completed during the index&#xD;
      hospitalization and at a subsequent follow up clinic visits or by telephone call. Some of&#xD;
      these assessments involve data collection from standard of care encounters or tests and will&#xD;
      be abstracted from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) The KCCQ is a valid, reliable and&#xD;
      responsive health status measure for HF patients and serves as a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      outcome assessment tool that is widely used in cardiovascular research, patient management,&#xD;
      and quality of life self-assessment.12 The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) The BPI is one of the&#xD;
      most widely used measurement tools for assessing clinical pain. It allows patients to rate&#xD;
      the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain interferes with common&#xD;
      dimensions of feeling and function. Initially developed to assess pain related to cancer, the&#xD;
      BPI has validated as an appropriate measure for pain caused by a wide range of clinical&#xD;
      conditions. , The Charlson Co-Morbidity Index (CCI) Comorbidity describes the effect of all&#xD;
      other diseases an individual patient might have other than the primary disease of interest.&#xD;
      The CCI is used to characterize comorbid medical conditions and allows inferences about the&#xD;
      extent to which symptoms and other factors related to quality of life may be attributable to&#xD;
      conditions other than HF. The CCI designates comorbid conditions in 19 categories and each&#xD;
      category has an associated weight based on the adjusted risk of one-year mortality, and the&#xD;
      overall comorbidity score reflects the cumulative increased likelihood of one-year mortality.&#xD;
      Charlson scores can range between 0 and 35, with a higher score indicating increase in burden&#xD;
      of comorbid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTC Medication Inventory A comprehensive list of any over the counter (OTC) medications will&#xD;
      be collected and reconciled via review of the electronic medical records and by subject&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Interventions Measures (BIM) The BIM questionnaire is a novel tool developed for use in&#xD;
      the HELP-HF study. It is adapted from similar questionnaires used in palliative oncology care&#xD;
      and incorporates an inventory of comfort measure identified in the literature. These include&#xD;
      measures like application of heat or cold, massage, and other self-selected therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Report Form and Data Capture A paper case report form (data collection tool) will be&#xD;
      developed for each subject's study records. All data will be entered by study personnel into&#xD;
      a password-protected database using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system.&#xD;
      REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support electronic data capture for&#xD;
      research studies. REDCap is used by selected areas within the University. It is a service&#xD;
      available via a free collaboration with the NIH CTSA structure and accessed at TJU with&#xD;
      permission and oversight via internal Information Systems at the University's Kimmel Cancer&#xD;
      Center. REDCap allows for monitored dual data entry via a web-based system that is maintained&#xD;
      on a protected server and will be used by the study investigators, coordinators and&#xD;
      statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Plan Subject demographics and co-morbidities as well as characteristics&#xD;
      of the self-reported pain, treatment selections, and efficacy will be reported as medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables and as percentages of non-missing values&#xD;
      for categorical variables. Patients will be stratified by pain scores. Univariate comparisons&#xD;
      between patients with and without pain will be performed using the Pearson χ2 test for&#xD;
      categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous and ordinal variables.&#xD;
