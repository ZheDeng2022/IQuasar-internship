  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal surgery is a common surgery for the treatment of colon and rectal cancers as well&#xD;
      as other bowel diseases. Recovery from colorectal surgery is difficult because of the many&#xD;
      potential negative side effects. These side effects include surgical complications,&#xD;
      infections, and long hospital stays. It usually takes several months for patients to recover&#xD;
      the strength required to return to their typical daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program was established in Alberta in 2013 and uses&#xD;
      several strategies to improve short-term patient recovery, including earlier discharge from&#xD;
      hospital. Whether the ERAS program also improves long-term patient recovery, including&#xD;
      quality of life and return to activities of daily living, is unclear. Whether the ERAS&#xD;
      program would benefit from the addition of a prehabilitation element is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehabilitation programs are designed to use the waiting period before colorectal surgery to&#xD;
      better prepare patients emotionally and physically for their operation. To date, successful&#xD;
      prehabilitation programs have used a personalized care strategy where each patient is&#xD;
      provided specific care instructions by healthcare professionals to meet their unique&#xD;
      exercise, nutrition, and psychological needs. This prehabilitation strategy has been&#xD;
      criticized for not being sustainable in our healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new prehabilitation program in response to this criticism is proposed. The prehabilitation&#xD;
      program will be conducted in a more sustainable way by offering the program as a group class&#xD;
      with a home-based component. ERAS patients at the Peter Lougheed Center are already offered a&#xD;
      group class as part of the standard ERAS program. The prehabilitation class will be an&#xD;
      extension of this group class that provides general nutrition, exercise, and&#xD;
      anxiety-reduction/relaxation strategies to help patients prepare physically and emotionally&#xD;
      for their operation. At this class, patients will learn to eat well, practice deep breathing&#xD;
      exercises for relaxation, perform simple functional exercises, and to walk for exercise&#xD;
      before their surgery. The surgical experience and outcomes of patients who received the&#xD;
      additional prehabilitation care will be compared to those who received ERAS care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to better understand how ERAS supports recovery after&#xD;
      surgery and whether a prehabilitation program offers any additional benefits to the ERAS&#xD;
      program currently in place.&#xD;
