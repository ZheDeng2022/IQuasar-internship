      5. Subject enrollment 5.1 Participant Inclusion Criteria The study population will consist of&#xD;
      males and females aged 18 years and older who have chosen to participate in this clinical&#xD;
      trial as evidenced by execution of the informed consent document. 10 subjects will receive&#xD;
      treatment and 10 subjects will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 Informed Consent Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects (or their&#xD;
      guardians or legal representatives) before any study-related procedures, including any&#xD;
      pre-treatment screening procedures, are performed. Investigators, or delegated study&#xD;
      personnel, may discuss the availability of the study and the possibility for entry with a&#xD;
      potential subject without first obtaining consent. Informed consent must be obtained and&#xD;
      documented prior to initiation of any procedures that are performed solely for the purpose of&#xD;
      determining eligibility for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have ethical and legal responsibilities to ensure that the protocol is clearly&#xD;
      explained to each subject considered for enrollment in the study. Compliance with this&#xD;
      requirement should be documented on a written Informed Consent Form approved by the reviewing&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board. Each Informed Consent Form will include the elements required by&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration regulations in 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institutional Review Board approved Informed Consent Form will be signed by the study&#xD;
      personnel obtaining consent. The subject will be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form. The investigative site will keep the original on file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Study Drug BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection, is a sterile, vacuum-dried&#xD;
      purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of Hall strain Clostridium&#xD;
      botulinum type A intended for intramuscular use. It is purified from the culture solution by&#xD;
      dialysis and a series of acid precipitations to a complex consisting of the neurotoxin, and&#xD;
      several accessory proteins. The complex is dissolved in sterile sodium chloride solution&#xD;
      containing Albumin Human and is sterile filtered (0.2 microns) prior to filling and&#xD;
      vacuum-drying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary release procedure for BOTOX Cosmetic uses a cell-based potency assay to determine&#xD;
      the potency relative to a reference standard. The assay is specific to Allergan's products&#xD;
      BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic. One Unit of BOTOX Cosmetic corresponds to calculated median&#xD;
      intraperitoneal lethal dose in mice. Due to specific details of this assay such as the&#xD;
      vehicle, dilution scheme and laboratory protocols, Units of biological activity of BOTOX&#xD;
      Cosmetic cannot be compared to nor converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin or any&#xD;
      toxin assessed with any other specific assay method. The specific activity of BOTOX Cosmetic&#xD;
      is approximately 20 Units/nanogram of neurotoxin complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each vial of BOTOX Cosmetic contains either 50 Units of Clostridium botulinum type A&#xD;
      neurotoxin complex, 0.25 mg of Albumin Human, and 0.45 mg of sodium chloride; or 100 Units of&#xD;
      Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex, 0.5 mg of Albumin Human, and 0.9 mg of&#xD;
      sodium chloride in a sterile, vacuum-dried form without a preservative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Study Procedures and Schedule 7.1 Study Images Standardized baseline and follow-up images&#xD;
      will be taken. To ensure consistent, reproducible study photos from baseline photographs to&#xD;
      the follow-up photographs, Moradi MD's study specific photography guidelines and procedures&#xD;
      should be followed.&#xD;

           and completing pregnancy tests, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. Pre-Treatment Medications For this protocol, pre-treatment medication will be at the&#xD;
           investigator's discretion and will be documented accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12. Subject Preparation for Treatment The investigator, sub-investigator, or delegated&#xD;
           clinician will first identify the skin areas to which treatment is to be performed.&#xD;
           Treatment records for all regions will be maintained in accordance with this protocol.&#xD;
           Skin in target treatment area should be cleansed with mild cleaner. No lotion, make-up,&#xD;
           perfume, powder, or oil should be present on the area to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13. Treatment All study treatments will be performed by the Investigator. For the study&#xD;
           treatment 4.5 units of Botox Cosmetic will be injected per side in three injection&#xD;
           points. Each injection point is 1.5 units of Botox for a total of six injection point,&#xD;
           with a total of nine units. First injection is just below and lateral to the oral&#xD;
           commisure where the skin dimples upon activation of the Depressor Anguli Oris. The&#xD;
           second injection is between 1st and 3rd injection points along the same oblique line.&#xD;
           The third injection is more laterally and at the mid distance from oral commisure to&#xD;
           Jawline, along the line of Depressor Anguli Oris&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo subjects will have injections in the same manner, but will be injected with&#xD;
      Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be monitored during the treatment for Adverse Events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. Concomitant Medications All concomitant prescription, non-prescription and&#xD;
      over-the-counter medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the&#xD;
      appropriate study-specific data form. For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined&#xD;
      as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician.&#xD;
