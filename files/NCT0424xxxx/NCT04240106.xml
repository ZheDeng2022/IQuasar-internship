      This is a Multicenter, Open-label, Phase II Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and&#xD;
      Safety of Niraparib plus Aromatase Inhibitors for Hormone Receptor (HR)-positive/Human&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative Metastatic Breast Cancers with either&#xD;
      Germline BRCA-mutated or Germinal BRCA-wild-type and Homologous Recombination Deficiency&#xD;
      (HRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objetive is to assess the efficacy -as determined by the clinical benefit rate&#xD;
      (CBR)- of niraparib in combination with AIs in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients harboring either gBRCAms or gBRCAwt and HRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon meeting all selection criteria, patients enrolled in the study will receive the&#xD;
      combination of niraparib either 300 mg or 200 mg orally (according to baseline criteria&#xD;
      described in Table 4), once daily, flat- fixed, continuously in 28-day cycles and AI that&#xD;
      must be identical to the last AI-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 23 patients will be recruited as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage I: N=6 patients in the cohort A;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage II: N=8 patients in the cohort A; N=9 patients in the exploratory cohort B&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study period is 36 months follow until 5 years of follow up.&#xD;
