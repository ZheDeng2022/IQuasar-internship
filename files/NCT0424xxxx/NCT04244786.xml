  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the tolerability and effectiveness of transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a potential treatment for non-suicidal self-injury&#xD;
      (NSSI). NSSI is the deliberate attempt to harm oneself, most often through cutting or&#xD;
      burning, without suicidal intent. NSSI is a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy often&#xD;
      triggered by negative emotions, especially those involving feelings of rejection. tDCS is a&#xD;
      low-cost, portable, well-tolerated, non-invasive form of brain stimulation that delivers a&#xD;
      low current to a specific area of the brain via electrodes. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      its effectiveness in treating an array of conditions, depending on electrode placement,&#xD;
      including depression and chronic pain. tDCS may also facilitate adaptive emotion regulation;&#xD;
      researchers have also successfully used tDCS to reduce negative emotions and aggressive&#xD;
      responses to social rejection. The investigators therefore seek to explore tDCS as a&#xD;
      potential treatment for NSSI. This pilot feasibility study seeks 1) to examine how at-home,&#xD;
      self-administered tDCS is tolerated in a sample of individuals who engage in frequent NSSI;&#xD;
      2) to gather pilot data regarding changes in emotional and neural responses during a social&#xD;
      task after a series of tDCS sessions in this clinical population of individuals who engage in&#xD;
      NSSI; 3) to gather pilot data on the effects of tDCS on NSSI behaviors and urges. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to recruit a sample of 22 individuals who engage in frequent NSSI to&#xD;
      complete all study procedures. Individuals will be randomized to receive active- or sham-tDCS&#xD;
      for two twenty-minute applications on each of six alternating days over approximately two&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will be trained on tDCS self-administration, which will be supervised&#xD;
      during each session over a videoconferencing platform by a researcher. Functional MRI (fMRI)&#xD;
      may be performed at baseline and again after the completion of 12 sessions of tDCS. Subjects'&#xD;
      NSSI and urges to engage in NSSI will be recorded for four weeks in real-time, using an iPod-&#xD;
      based system that reminds subjects to stop at certain times during the day to record their&#xD;
      thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This will allow measurement of NSSI urges and behaviors&#xD;
      for one week before, two weeks during, and one week after the tDCS intervention. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this study is to identify a novel form of treatment for NSSI and to better&#xD;
      understand NSSI pathophysiology.&#xD;

    <description>A questionnaire to evaluate side-effects related to tDCS administration. This questionnaire asks about the presence and severity of possible side-effects of tDCS procedures, and was recently published as a gold-standard tool for this purpose: Aparício LVM, Guarienti F, Razza LB, Carvalho AF, Fregni F, Brunoni AR.

EMA is a tool through which participants can respond to a brief questionnaire on a smartphone device while going about their daily lives. Participants will be prompted to complete a brief questionnaire 6 times per day over a 3 week period, which asks questions about urges to engage in NSSI and in actual NSSI behavior.</description>
