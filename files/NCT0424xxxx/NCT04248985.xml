  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting following out of hospital cardiac arrest will undergo bedside ultrasound&#xD;
      as per the hospital clinical practice. Initial 6 months include recording of current state of&#xD;
      practice and timing of pauses and timing of ultrasounds. The second 6 months will follow an&#xD;
      educational intervention to teach &quot;pre-imaging&quot;. This is the technique of imaging the heart&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to find the heart and center it on the ultrasound&#xD;
      screen before CPR is stopped. The goal is to decrease CPR pause times when ultrasound is&#xD;
      performed post out of hospital (OOH) cardiac arrest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two educational Interventions where residents will be trained in how to improve on&#xD;
      sonographic imaging techniques performed during resuscitation following cardiac arrest. The&#xD;
      two techniques are 1) Sonographic Pre-Imaging and 2) Sonographic Pulse Checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonographic pre-imaging Sonographic pre-Imaging involves identification of minimal cardiac&#xD;
      details when CPR is ongoing. It involves placing the ultrasound transducer on the epigastric&#xD;
      region during CPR to identify the general location of the heart and to center the heart in&#xD;
      the screen prior to the point when CPR is halted. Pre-imaging produces images of the heart&#xD;
      that insufficient for diagnostic evaluation, but allows the clinician to be in place once CPR&#xD;
      is halted to obtain higher quality images rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents will be filmed during the resuscitation using two digital video cameras mounted in&#xD;
      the resuscitation bay in the Emergency Department. One camera will be isolated to the cardiac&#xD;
      monitor display. The other camera will be focused on the area of the room where CPR is&#xD;
      performed. The view of this camera will focus on the torso of the patient where CPR and&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging occurs. The camera is located in an area of the emergency department where&#xD;
      only the patient undergoing resuscitation will be imaged. Filming will be reviewed the&#xD;
      following day to record timing measurements of CPR and information on cardiac rhythm during&#xD;
      CPR. All video images will be deleted within 3 days of recording to allow for recording over&#xD;
      the weekends. No images will be saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Baseline measurements of CPR activity Residents overseeing resuscitation efforts&#xD;
      post-cardiac arrest will be eligible for inclusion in the study when providing care for&#xD;
      patients experiencing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation at the&#xD;
      University Campus Emergency Department. Education on advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) is&#xD;
      standardized through participation in an ACLS training program. A review of ACLS protocols&#xD;
      and additional education on the importance of limiting pauses during CPR will be provided to&#xD;
      all residents in the residency prior to initialing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records and video recordings will provide information on 1) Patient demographics 2)&#xD;
      Resuscitation Interventions 3) Ultrasound Imaging 3) Timing of CPR 4) Cardiac Rhythm.&#xD;
      Information on the actions during pauses in CPR will be used to categorize each pause. Pulse&#xD;
      Check Pauses are occurrences when CPR is halted to feel for the presence of any pulse. Rhythm&#xD;
      Check Pauses are occurrences when CPR is halted to determine the underlying cardiac rhythm.&#xD;
      Defibrillation Pauses are occurrences when CPR is halted to deliver defibrillation. Vascular&#xD;
      Access Pauses are occurrences when CPR is halted to facility the placement of central or&#xD;
      peripheral vascular access. Airway Pauses are occurrences when CPR is halted to facilitate&#xD;
      placement of an airway device or check the location of an airway device. Ultrasound Pauses&#xD;
      are occurrences when CPR is halted to facilitate ultrasound imaging of the heart. Medication&#xD;
      Pauses occur when CPR is halted to deliver intravenous or intra-osseous medications. Rhythm&#xD;
      Change Pauses occur when CPR is halted due to a change in rhythm that does not require CPR.&#xD;
      Patients may have pauses that involve more than one category, or no pauses at all. Summarized&#xD;
      in Table below&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categories of Pauses in CPR Action Occurring During Pause&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Pulse Check Pauses Palpation for pulse in groin or neck&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Rhythm Check Pauses Interpret rhythm on monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Defibrillation Pauses Defibrillate patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Vascular Access Pauses Insert peripheral or central vascular access&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - Airway Pauses Insert of check location of airway device&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Ultrasound Pauses Obtain ultrasound images of heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. - Medication Pauses Administer medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. - Rhythm Change Pauses Change in rhythm resulting in no need for CPR&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome will be the length and number of pauses in CPR during resuscitation.&#xD;
           Measurements will be standardized by length of resuscitation (time patient arrives in&#xD;
           emergency department to time resuscitation efforts halted) and multivariate logistic&#xD;
           regression will be used to control for variability between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 2 - Ultrasound Education Phase - Pre-imaging Education Similar to phase one,&#xD;
           Residents overseeing resuscitation efforts post-cardiac arrest will be eligible for&#xD;
           inclusion in the study when providing care for patients experiencing an out-of-hospital&#xD;
           cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation at the University Campus Emergency Department.&#xD;
           Residents will undergo standardized training on sonographic pre-imaging prior to&#xD;
           participation in the study. They will be instructed on how to obtain pre-images and how&#xD;
           to record images as quickly as possible during pauses in CPR. All measurements and&#xD;
           recordings during phase 2 will be identical to phase 1. All other methodologies will&#xD;
           remain unchanged. Primary outcome will be the length and number of pauses in CPR during&#xD;
           resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All measurements and recordings during phase 1 and 2 and all other study methodology&#xD;
           will be identical to phases 1 and 2. All other methodologies will remain unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria - As appropriate, explain what steps will be taken to&#xD;
           insure that subjects meet the criteria (e.g. healthy, not pregnant, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion Residents who have consented to the study will be included during episodes&#xD;
           when a patient presents to the Emergency Department in Cardiac Arrest receiving ACLS in&#xD;
           the Emergency Department&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Residents who do not consent to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Residents episodes where resuscitation efforts are terminated due to end of life&#xD;
                decisions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Residents episodes involving the resuscitation of a trauma patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Residents episodes involving patient who are not imaged with ultrasound during the&#xD;
                resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
                c. Discuss the number of experimental and control subjects, and explain the&#xD;
                statistical basis for the numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is limited data on pauses during CPR in the emergency department. We assumed that&#xD;
           pauses in CPR average 15 seconds based on clinical experience. For the purpose of a&#xD;
           power calculation, we assumed that education on pre-imaging will decrease pauses during&#xD;
           ultrasound imaging by 5 seconds and imaging in the groin will decrease pauses by 10&#xD;
           seconds. Assuming an 80% power and an alpha of 0.05 we need 79 patients in phase one and&#xD;
           63 patients in phase two and 16 patients in phase three. Because of clustering around&#xD;
           individual providers we will need to enroll two times that amount be account for&#xD;
           clustering by provider. This means we need to enroll a total of 300 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase 3 -&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sonographic Pulse Checks - Exploring the use of doppler imaging of the femoral artery&#xD;
           during and between CPR to replace palpation of the pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Similar to phases one and two, residents overseeing resuscitation efforts post-cardiac&#xD;
           arrest will be eligible to participate in the study when providing care for patients&#xD;
           experiencing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation at the Emergency&#xD;
           Department. Clinicians or research staff will perform sonographic pulse checks by&#xD;
           imaging the femoral or cardiac artery and visualize any flow within the vessel.&#xD;
           Sonographic pulse checks will occur either a) during CPR b) during pauses in CPR c)&#xD;
           during transitions from CPR to pause or d) during transition from pause to CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria are identical to phase 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will undergo standard of care as per UMass practice. This includes ACLS&#xD;
           interventions based on published ACLS protocols. During pauses in CPR clinicians perform&#xD;
           brief echocardiography of the heart, with attention to not delaying CPR pauses. During&#xD;
           the same pause doppler imaging of the CFV will be performed by research or clinical&#xD;
           staff. Clips of any of the 4 time periods listed above will be digitally recorded.&#xD;
           Simultaneous clips of the patients heart will be digitally recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be followed to survival endpoints including a) ROSC b) survival to&#xD;
           hospital admission c) survival to hospital discharge and d) death in ED. Survival&#xD;
           endpoints will be abstracted from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Digital images will be de-identified and paired by patient and pause. (Patient X, pause&#xD;
           1; Patient X, pause 2...). Interpretation of the brief echo will be to identify the&#xD;
           presence or absence of cardiac activity and to identify if the cardiac activity is&#xD;
           organized or not. In addition, the images will be reviewed to identify ventricular&#xD;
           fibrillation. Interpretation of the CVF doppler images will be performed to identify a)&#xD;
           VTI and maximal velocity of arterial pulses from CPR b) VTI and maximal velocities of&#xD;
           arterial pulses secondary to cardiac activity c) Rate and regularity of CPR pulses, d)&#xD;
           rate and regularity of cardiac activity pulses e) inherent noise level of doppler signal&#xD;
           between pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a proof-of-concept, descriptive study without a specific power analysis. The&#xD;
           goal is to describe the amount of cardiac activity as visualize during brief echo that&#xD;
           corresponds to measurable pulse activity by doppler. The secondary goal is to determine&#xD;
           if the presence of an &quot;irregular pulse&quot; during regular CPR is associated with ROSC.&#xD;
