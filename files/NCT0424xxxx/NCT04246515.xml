  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Blood Flow Restriction Training on the&#xD;
      elasticity of the hamstring muscle after an acute injury. Therefore a group of football&#xD;
      players with a recent hamstring strain injury (HSI) will be recruited and randomly assigned&#xD;
      in one of the three following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Classic rehabilitation + Blood Flow Restriction Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham group: Classic rehabilitation + sham Blood Flow Restriction Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Classic rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedure will be as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HSI (onset) -&gt; recruitment via football clubs, physiotherapy practices, leaflets,…&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI scan (day 0-4) -&gt; injury location, grade and extend (The British Athletics Medical&#xD;
           Team Classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) measurement (day 0-4) of the injured site and the exact&#xD;
           same location at the contralateral leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rehabilitation in one of the three groups + Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the first therapy session a standardized initial assessment sheet will be filled in&#xD;
           comprising of all the necessary information regarding patient information and history&#xD;
           (recent hamstring injury and past injuries) . Furthermore, a weekly assessment of the&#xD;
           strongest predictors of rehabilitation duration will be conducted. Between day 12 and 16&#xD;
           a second shear wave elastographic measurement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Return to play (RTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RTP decision will be made by the head physician and the attending physiotherapist.&#xD;
           The decision will be based on clearly predefined criteria. At moment of RTP a third&#xD;
           shear wave elastographic measurement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The football players will be contacted regularly by phone to inquire about possible&#xD;
      re-injuries, this for a period of 6 months after injury onset. At week 12 after injury onset,&#xD;
      a fourth and last shear wave elastographic measurement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of the hamstring elasticity and other outcome measures will be compared between&#xD;
      groups and also within groups between the injured leg and the healthy contralateral leg.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 90 participants with an acute hamstring strain injury will participate. Age&#xD;
      restrictions will be delimited between 18 and 35 years old to rule out age-related&#xD;
      confounding factors. Potential participants will be excluded from this study if they had a&#xD;
      history of hamstring injuries, or a recent severe trauma or surgery in the lower extremity. A&#xD;
      hamstring injury is defined as a football-related injury in the posterior thigh muscle&#xD;
      region, preventing a player from participating in training or competition for at least 1&#xD;
      week. In addition, any contra-indication for occluding vascular flow (such as hypertension,&#xD;
      risk factors for and/or history of cardiovascular pathologies or thromboembolism, surgery,&#xD;
      fractures, severe obesity,…) will entail an immediate exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 4 days after the onset of a suspected HSI the participant will undergo a magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (MR) scan in order to acquire more insight in the severity, location and extend of&#xD;
      the injury. The British Athletics Medical Team Classification will be used to classify HSI on&#xD;
      the basis of grade (1: small tear, 2: moderate tear, 3: extensive tear or 4: complete tear)&#xD;
      and injury site (a: myofascial, b: MTJ or c: tendon). [Pollock et al.2014] Each participant&#xD;
      will be assigned an unique number and subsequently randomly assigned to either the control,&#xD;
      experimental treatment or sham group by using an online research randomizer&#xD;
      (http://www.randomizer.org) which is already used in previous literature [van der Horst et&#xD;
      al. 2015]. This will result in a total of 30 participants per treatment group. The&#xD;
      experimental group will perform, on top of a classic rehabilitation protocol, exercises while&#xD;
      occluding the vascular blood flow. The use of low-intensity exercises with vascular blood&#xD;
      flow restriction (BFR) has been found, in previous studies, to induce the same hypertrophic&#xD;
      muscle adaptations as high-intensity exercises without BFR. The combination of increased&#xD;
      metabolic stress, due to an Ischemic and hypoxic muscular environment, and exercise induced&#xD;
      mechanical tension is suggested to be responsible for this effect. [Hughes et al. 2017] The&#xD;
      patients in the sham BFR group will receive the same protocol as the experimental group with&#xD;
      the exception of not inflating the Blood flow restriction cuff, causing no real vascular&#xD;
      occlusion. Furthermore, the intervention in the control group will consist out of a classic&#xD;
      rehabilitation program suitable for treating a hamstring injury. Shortly after the MR scan,&#xD;
      still in the first week after injury onset, a shear wave elastography measurement of the&#xD;
      injured site and at exact same location at non-injured site will be performed. Appendicular&#xD;
      to the first, three more elastographic measurements will be performed at fixed moments in&#xD;
      time: between day 12 and 16, at moment of return to play (RTP) and at week 12 after injury&#xD;
      onset. All the participants will undergo a standardized rehabilitation protocol in one of the&#xD;
      three groups until the medical team cleared the patient for returning to sport participation,&#xD;
      based on clearly defined and standardised criteria. Tests and questionnaires for evaluation&#xD;
      of hamstring strength, flexibility, pain and functionality will be conducted at three major&#xD;
      moments in the rehabilitation process: within the first therapy session, weekly during the&#xD;
      complete rehabilitation process and at moment of return to play. After RTP, athletes will be&#xD;
      contacted regularly, until six months after injury onset, to determine the number of&#xD;
      re-injuries. A questionnaire concerning demographic and anthropometric data, sport activities&#xD;
      and injury history will be completed by the participants, prior to the testing protocol, as&#xD;
      these factors will be additionally investigated for their possible influence on the primary&#xD;
      outcome measures. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of vascular occlusion&#xD;
      (Blood Flow Restriction Training), within the rehabilitation program, on the healing proces&#xD;
      (outcome measures predictive for the duration of the rehabilitation: average pain at each&#xD;
      therapy session, eccentric mid and outer range strength, total painful palpation length,&#xD;
      maximal hip flexion active knee extension test) and especially on the elasticity of the&#xD;
      injured hamstring muscle tissue (measured with shear wave elastography).&#xD;
