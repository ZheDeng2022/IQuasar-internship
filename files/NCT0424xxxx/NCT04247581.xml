                  either wrist. Severe symptomatic (or active) overly dry/injured skin, skin&#xD;
                  disorders, or allergic skin reactions such as eczema, rosacea, impetigo,&#xD;
                  dermatomyositis or allergic contact dermatitis on wrist and locations where the&#xD;
                  electrodes will be placed (e.g. chest, forearms, stomach), as determined by the&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Known allergy or significant sensitivity to medical adhesives, isopropyl alcohol,&#xD;
