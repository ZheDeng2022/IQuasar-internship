  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity rate in Malaysia is higher than the average world obesity rate. Central obesity&#xD;
      is a component of metabolic syndrome (MetS) which is also made up of dyslipidemia, impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance, and hypertension. MetS is a continuum in the risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiometabolic complication. Time Restricted Feeding (TRF) involves an extended&#xD;
      physiological overnight fast. Researchers believe that the timing of meal intake that matches&#xD;
      with the circadian rhythms is as important as the calories intake to prevent obesity and its&#xD;
      complications. The investigators hypothesize that TRF is effective in weight control and&#xD;
      improvement of metabolic severity. Subjects will be randomized into either the control group,&#xD;
      which practices QQH dietary plan or intervention group, which practices TRF as an adjunct to&#xD;
      QQH dietary plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed up at week 12 and week 24 to assess adherence, efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of TRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to fill a few research gaps as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Longer study duration of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This is the first study amongst the Asian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adherence level to TRF in real life setting is measured. This information can&#xD;
           potentially predict the intensity level of TRF that are feasible for practice in real&#xD;
           life and also its association with the efficacy of TRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TRF is defined as eating within aâ‰¤12-hour period and fasting for at least 12 hours per&#xD;
           day. This is the shortest fasting window studied so far.&#xD;

Subjects of the intervention group can eat during the pre-determined 8-12 hours eating window, but they are only allowed to drink water and calorie-free drinks for the remaining 12-16 hours. Subjects are allowed to decide the time of their first and the last meal of the day as long as they eat within the 8-12 hour window period. However, skipping breakfast and having late dinner are discouraged.</description>
