    <description>The CGI-S is an observer-rated scale that will be used to measure symptom severity. It is a 7-point scale depicting a participants rating of overall improvement. Participants rate their change as 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I is an observer-rated scale that will be used to measure the participant's symptom severity compared with before initiation of treatment with IMP. It is a 7-point scale depicting a participant's change from baseline in symptom severity using the following response choices: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 71</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life in Epilepsy - 31 (QOLIE-31) contains 7 multi-item scales that tap the following health concepts: emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, seizure worry, medication effects, and overall quality of life. A QOLIE-31 overall score is obtained using a weighted average of the multi-item scale scores. The QOLIE-31 also includes a single item that assessed overall health. The QoLIE-31 score range is from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating a better outcome for quality of life.</description>

In HUI, utility values range from -0.03 and -0.36 for the HUI-2 and HUI-3, respectively, to 1.00. A health utility value of 1.00 indicates perfect health while a score of 0.00 indicates death.</description>
