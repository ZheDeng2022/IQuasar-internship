  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women are highly underrepresented in the construction skilled trades. In addition to facing&#xD;
      the industry's well-known physical risks, women are subjected to discrimination, harassment,&#xD;
      and skills under-utilization. As a result, tradeswomen have increased risk for injury,&#xD;
      stress-related health effects, and high attrition rates from apprenticeship programs, thus&#xD;
      perpetuating their minority status. Mentoring is a well-established technique for learning&#xD;
      technical and personal navigation skills in new or challenging social environments. The&#xD;
      investigators propose development and dissemination of a mentorship program through local&#xD;
      unions of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers&#xD;
      (SMART), and evaluating its success in reducing women's injury and work stress, while&#xD;
      improving retention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Journey-level workers will be trained on effective mentoring techniques, and matched to&#xD;
      approximately 100 women apprentices within their own local union. Mentees will be followed&#xD;
      for two years within the mentorship program, with another 100 women apprentices in locals not&#xD;
      receiving the mentorship training similarly followed as controls. The impact of participation&#xD;
      in mentoring programs will be measured through apprentices' experience of stress, coping&#xD;
      mechanisms, safety climate, and retention in the apprenticeship programs. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop a mentorship training program for journey-level sheet metal workers to assist&#xD;
      women apprentices in navigating the challenges faced by women in trades&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Disseminate the training and assist locals in developing effective mentorship programs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the mentoring programs specified in Aims 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Disseminate the best practices for supporting women apprentices in the skilled trades.&#xD;
