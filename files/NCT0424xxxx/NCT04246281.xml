  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare standard of care treatments for back pain to&#xD;
      electrical stimulation. Stimulation is delivering small amounts of electricity to the nerves&#xD;
      in your low back. This study will use a device called the SPRINT Peripheral Nerve Stimulation&#xD;
      (PNS) System. The device is cleared by the FDA for up to 60 days of use for the relief of&#xD;
      chronic or acute pain (including back pain)&#xD;

    <measure>Reduction in average pain intensity and/or reduction in disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3-months after Start of Therapy (SOT)</time_frame>
    <description>Average pain is measured using question 5 from the Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI-5). BPI-5 is a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain. Disability is measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The ODI asks subjects to rate how their back pain impacts ten components of everyday life. For each section, the answers correlate to a scale which ranges from 0 to 5, where 0 is no disability and 5 is maximum disability.</description>
