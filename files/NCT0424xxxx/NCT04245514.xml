  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resectable, locally advanced NSCLC with involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes (N2) is&#xD;
      associated with a high risk of (systemic) recurrence despite neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Neo-adjuvant immunotherapy is a promising additional treatment modality aiming at increasing&#xD;
      local control and better tackling micrometastases at the time of radical local treatment.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is thought to act synergistically with immunotherapy through release of tumor&#xD;
      antigens and modulation of the local immune microenvironment in favor of a better&#xD;
      antigen-presentation and (systemic) anti-tumor immune response (abscopal effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed SAKK 16/18 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding&#xD;
      immune-modulatory radiotherapy to the SAKK 16/14 treatment regimen by combining neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      radio-immunotherapy. Due to the lack of evidence for an optimal radiotherapy regimen for an&#xD;
      &quot;in-situ vaccination&quot; effect three different radiotherapy regimens will be tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In resectable locally advanced lung cancer there is an urgent need for more efficacious&#xD;
      therapy, since most of the patients will eventually have a relapse and will die of the&#xD;
      disease. Distant metastases are the main site of recurrence. Therefore, the most promising&#xD;
      treatment strategy is to better eliminate micrometastases present at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
      through improved systemic treatment. In this regard, the SAKK 16/14 trial is investigating&#xD;
      the efficacy of the anti-PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab before and after surgery added to&#xD;
      standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/docetaxel. It has just completed accrual as&#xD;
      of Q1 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the SAKK 16/18 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding&#xD;
      immune-modulatory radiotherapy to the SAKK 16/14 treatment regimen by combining it with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Due to the lack of evidence for an optimal immune-modulatory&#xD;
      radiotherapy regimen we test 3 different radiotherapy regimens to investigate differences in&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability as key exploratory endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapy is the optimal setting to test the combination of immune-modulatory&#xD;
      radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Resection of the primary tumor and&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph nodes will allow to investigate pathological responses and nodal&#xD;
      downstaging at an early time point. Furthermore, this setting allows for extensive&#xD;
      translational research evaluating cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAKK 16/18 is a prospective, multicenter, phase II trial with 3 radiotherapy cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consists of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel: 3 cycles of 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab: 1 cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant immune-modulatory radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concurrent with neoadjuvant immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Random assignment to one of the following fractionation regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  20x2 Gy (weekdaily, 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  5x5 Gy (weekdaily, 1 week)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  3x8 Gy (on alternate days, 1 week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Between 4 and 6 weeks after the application of durvalumab (independent of the&#xD;
           radiotherapy regimen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If indicated: Postoperative radiotherapy (should start between 3 to 6 weeks after&#xD;
           surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab: 13 cycles of 28 days&#xD;
