      Retrospective observational, multicentric study assessing the immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
      based test IHC4 score in infiltrating early breast cancer: comparison of the score performed&#xD;
      in local laboratory vs in a central laboratory and concordance with a molecular gold standard&#xD;
      classifier (EndoPredict).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IHC4 prognostic signature is an algorithm based on a combination of biomarkers evaluated&#xD;
      in immunohistochemistry and anatomical-clinical parameters. Immunohistochemistry is routinely&#xD;
      performed as a diagnostic procedure for estrogen receptor (ER; H-score 0-300), progesterone&#xD;
      receptor (PR; % of marked cells), HER2 (positive vs negative status) and Ki67 (% of marked&#xD;
      cells evaluated by counting). Clinical parameters include lymph node status (0N+, 1-3N+,&#xD;
      &gt;3N+, &gt;3N+), tumour size in mm (≤10mm, 11-20, 21-50, &gt;50mm), histologic grade (1, 2, 3),&#xD;
      patient's age at diagnosis (&lt;65 years, ≥65 years), and type of treatment (anti-estrogen or&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method for reading and scoring conditions is very precise and currently guarantee the&#xD;
      validity of the test (validated centrally in TransATAC). However, there is not yet an open&#xD;
      access web platform available for the calculation of the IHC4 score, due to the prior need&#xD;
      for homogenisation of the interpretation of immunochemistry (standardisation of the protocol)&#xD;
      to generate a reliable and validated IHC4 under decentralised &quot;real life&quot; conditions. There&#xD;
      is currently few published data on the weight of technical parameters (antibody clones,&#xD;
      automaton type, etc.) or interpretation methods (scoring) in the calculation of the IHC4&#xD;
      score (IHC4 robustness). However, only one study, published recently, shows a good tolerance&#xD;
      of the test to variations in technical protocol or reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a study coordinated by the GEFPICS group, composed of expert pathologists in&#xD;
      breast cancer, has been set up to better define the robustness and the scope of IHC4 score.&#xD;
      These project will assess 2 main aspects: (i) validate the local &quot;real life&quot; technique for&#xD;
      the calculation of the IHC4 score; and (ii) homogenise the IHC reading method (especially for&#xD;
      Ki67), on a cohort of cases from the GEFPICS, tested in a prognostic molecular signatures.&#xD;

    <description>The IHC4 score is a prognostic tool that incorporates immunohistochemical parameters of ER (H-score), PR (% of positive cells), HER2 (positive or negative status), and Ki67 (% of positive cells).&#xD;
IHC4 score, combined with nodal status and tumor grade, age, and the type of endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) provides a clinical score IHC4+C.&#xD;
IHC4+C provides a prognostic risk of distant recurrence at 10 years for patients who underwent endocrine therapy for 5 years. IHC4+C defined three distinct risk categories:&#xD;
&lt;10%: low risk&#xD;
[10-20%]: intermediate risk&#xD;
&gt;20%: high risk</description>
