  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicohort, multicenter study to evaluate&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of JCAR017 in adult subjects with r/r FL or MZL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation&#xD;
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pretreatment, which consists of screening assessments, leukapheresis and the&#xD;
           Pretreatment evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment, which starts with the administration of lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy and&#xD;
           continues through JCAR017 administration at Day 1 with follow-up through Day 29;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posttreatment, which includes follow-up assessments for disease status and safety for 2&#xD;
           years.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

    <description>is questionnaire that will be used as a measure of health-related quality of life.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.</description>

The FACT-LymS items are scored on a 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;) response scale. Items are aggregated to a single score on a 0-60 scale. High scores indicate lower symptom burden.</description>
