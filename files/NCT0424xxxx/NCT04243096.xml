  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm clinical trial to investigate the outcome of exercise-based physical&#xD;
      therapy in people with knee osteoarthritis through the use of wearable sensors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, single arm, 19-week study to investigate the utility of digital&#xD;
      assessments to measure the efficacy of exercise-based physical therapy (PT) for reducing pain&#xD;
      and improving function in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 participants will be included. Participants will receive a supervised&#xD;
      exercise-based PT for 12 weeks and will undergo multiple assessments of strength, balance,&#xD;
      gait and joint movement while being monitored with a motion capture system and wrist and&#xD;
      lumbar wearable sensors. Additionally, participants' activities will be monitored in the real&#xD;
      world with the same wrist and lumbar wearable sensors. After completion of the PT program,&#xD;
      participants will be monitored for an additional 6-week period to measure persistence of&#xD;
      treatment effect. During that time, they will continue to follow an exercise program at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to measure the effect of exercise-based PT on functional&#xD;
      performance and pain reduction using both patient reported outcomes questionnaires (PROs) and&#xD;
      digital metrics obtained from the laboratory assessments and wearable sensors worn in the&#xD;
      real world. Pain phenotyping questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing assessments will&#xD;
      also be used to evaluate the effect of specific pain phenotypes in treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy will be undertaken to assess reproducibility of sensor-based measures during&#xD;
      physical performance testing across at-home and in-lab implementation, as well as,&#xD;
      reproducibility of these measures over repeated at-home implementation.&#xD;
