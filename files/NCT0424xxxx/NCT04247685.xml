  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With MRI's increasing role in detecting central nervous system and orthopedic diseases,&#xD;
      patients with ischemic history are increasingly referred for MRI exams. Currently, 3-lead ECG&#xD;
      gating systems are utilized during cardiac MRI scanning as standard of care. However, this&#xD;
      monitoring system is often insufficient to evaluate for the development of important&#xD;
      arrhythmias or ischemia during MRI scanning. Morevoer, MRI associated magnetic fields and&#xD;
      radio frequency pulses can produce interference in the ECG signal that leads to&#xD;
      non-diagnostic ECG signals. MiRTLE Medical, a Massachusetts-based medical device company, has&#xD;
      developed a high-fidelity, MRI-conditional 12-lead ECG monitoring system. This 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      system is a first of its kind that addresses the MRI-induced interference and safety issues.&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of this 12-lead ECG system in the clinical setting.&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this system will be helpful for image-guided therapeutics&#xD;
      especially electrophysiology.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will aim to recruit 2-3 patients per month, with a total of 40 patients over two years. These 40 patients will be assigned into two MRI groups -12-lead ECG gating system as the study group and 3-lead ECG gating system as the control group. The study group patients will have MRI with 12-lead ECG monitoring device produced by a Massachusetts-based medical device company MiRTLE Medical, while the control group will have MRI with 3-lead ECG gating which is standard of care. Diagnostic image quality and severity of artifact will be evaluated to compare these two groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>qualitatively comparison will be done for ECG signal quality and artifact between the 12-lead and 3-lead ECG arms using a standard scale. A 5 point Likert scale will be used with the below scores:&#xD;
