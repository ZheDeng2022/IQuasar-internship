  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the clinical efficacy of micro water jet technology in the&#xD;
      debridement and healing of chronic lower extremity ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, single-center, open-label study in subjects with chronic lower&#xD;
      extremity wounds. The study will enroll up to 20 subjects. Subjects will undergo screening&#xD;
      evaluations to determine eligibility to enroll in the study. All study subjects will receive&#xD;
      micro water jet technology debridement as opposed to other debridement methods as part of&#xD;
      their wound care treatment. The other aspects of subjects wound care protocol will remain&#xD;
      unchanged. In the case of bilateral limb ulcers, or multiple ulcers, subjects will have the&#xD;
      option to receive micro water jet debridement on one or all of the ulcers.&#xD;
