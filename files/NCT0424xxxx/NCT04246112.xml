    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized handwriting&#xD;
      training protocol (MovAlyzeR), through daily practice of handwriting on an electronic device&#xD;
      to improve handwriting skills in children with tic disorders (TD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Handwriting is a functional skill underlying almost all academic performance of school-aged&#xD;
      children, and handwriting impairment is highlighted by the World Health Organization as a&#xD;
      barrier to school participation. The available evidence mentioned in the literature suggests&#xD;
      handwriting skills are academically crucial, and handwriting deficits may lead to challenges&#xD;
      in performing various academic activities both in and outside the classroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that children with TD are more likely to have handwriting deficits as suggested in a&#xD;
      recent study, they are also more likely to have challenges in their academic performance and&#xD;
      success as evidenced in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of education, strong evidence indicated that handwriting has more cognitive&#xD;
      and neurological benefits than using a keyboard when taking notes in the classroom.&#xD;
      Therefore, reducing tics and improving handwriting skills rather than an adaptation approach&#xD;
      using a word processor or computer may be the goal of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the investigator's previous study showed that children with Tourette Syndrome (TS)&#xD;
      or tic disorders (TD) demonstrated handwriting deficits when compared to the general children&#xD;
      population, and were consistent with a recent study conducted in France showing that children&#xD;
      with TS exhibited handwriting problems. In addition to illegibility issues in handwriting as&#xD;
      indicated by the low score on the Test of handwriting skills (THS-R), children with TS or TD&#xD;
      also demonstrated writing deficits in the areas of speed of writing and correct letter case&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since handwriting deficit is an area of concern among children with TS or TD, one way to&#xD;
      improve these children's handwriting skills is through handwriting practice. NeuroScript,&#xD;
      LLC., has developed a software program (MovAlyzeR) that allows children to practice&#xD;
      handwriting on an electronic device (such as tablet, laptop, etc). Given that the practice is&#xD;
      completed on an electronic device with immediate feedback, this handwriting program may serve&#xD;
      as a strong incentive to motivate children practicing handwriting. In order to provide&#xD;
      evidence for the educators and therapists on the effectiveness of this software program, it&#xD;
      is important to evaluate its effectiveness on improving handwriting skills among children&#xD;
      with TS or TD.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A handwriting skills training software program MovAlyzeR® will be given and downloaded to the children's laptop computer. Participants will be requested to use the software program to practice handwriting 15-20 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 12 weeks. The MovAlyzeR® keeps track (records) all the participants' practice. MovAlyzeR is HIPPA compliant. We use the MovAlyzeR as a training device for handwriting, not for data collection. Since MovAlyzeR provides instant feedback to the user on their handwriting movement, it is a fun way for the children to practice handwriting.</intervention_model_description>
