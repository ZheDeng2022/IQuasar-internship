  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Tanzania, according to the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), malaria prevalence&#xD;
      has declined from an average of 18.1% in 2008 to 7% in 2017, marked as an epidemiological&#xD;
      transition from meso-endemic to hypo-endemic levels with variation across and within regions&#xD;
      and/or councils. Children of school-age have become increasingly more vulnerable as compared&#xD;
      to those aged less than five years. In high-transmission settings, up to 70% of school-aged&#xD;
      children harbour malaria parasites which is mostly asymptomatic, accounting for around 50% of&#xD;
      the mortality, 13-50% of all school absenteeism. The NMCP developed a supplementary malaria&#xD;
      midterm strategic plan (SMMSP 2018-2020) to customise malaria interventions by stratifying&#xD;
      the burden of malaria in Tanzania mainland and recommended use of&#xD;
      Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for intermittent preventive treatment in school children&#xD;
      (IPTsc) in high malaria strata. The investigators plan to evaluate the implementation of&#xD;
      IPTsc using DP, given three times a year, for evidence on the operational feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of IPTsc on clinical malaria incidence at a high endemic area in Handeni&#xD;
      District Council (DC), Handeni Town Council (TC) and Kilindi DC of Tanga region, Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to assess feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of IPTsc using DP against standard of care (control). Wards in the three study&#xD;
      districts (Handeni DC, Handeni TC and Kilindi DC) will be the randomisation unit (clusters).&#xD;
      Each ward will be randomised to implement IPTsc or not (control). In all wards in the IPTsc&#xD;
      arm, the interventional drugs (DP) will be given at an interval of four months, three times a&#xD;
      year. For study evaluation of the impact of intervention, in each district representative&#xD;
      randomly selected wards, will provide randomly selected school per ward (24 in total) to&#xD;
      formulate part of evaluable children per intervention. Mixed design methods will be used to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing IPTsc as part of a more&#xD;
      comprehensive school children health package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to be operationally feasible given existing school health programme for&#xD;
      Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) control and the school net programme (SNP). IPTsc is&#xD;
      expected to increase malaria case management effectiveness and to have additional effect in&#xD;
      reducing the burden of disease on top of optimal access to malaria case management (MCM) and&#xD;
      malaria vector control (MVC) initiatives e.g. early diagnosis and treatment, and&#xD;
      insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) coverage, respectively.&#xD;
