  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing has become first line screening for&#xD;
      cervical cancer in high-income countries. The feasibility of this approach in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries (LMICs) is less clear, as is the role of hrHPV testing among women&#xD;
      living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The proposed study seeks to evaluate the&#xD;
      accuracy of cervical cancer screening algorithms using primary hrHPV testing followed by&#xD;
      various forms of visual evaluation, including visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA),&#xD;
      colposcopy and automated visual evaluation (AVE) for the detection of high-grade cervical&#xD;
      dysplasia, using histology as the gold standard. We will validate the AmpFire Assay for hrHPV&#xD;
      self-testing in our setting. We also seek to understand in-depth the attitudes, acceptability&#xD;
      and preferences regarding cervical cancer screening, HPV testing, and self-sampling, for&#xD;
      women in Botswana through interviews of a sub-set of women recruited for the cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening study. Finally, we will analyze the cost of two-stage cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      algorithms using high-risk HPV testing in Botswana.&#xD;
