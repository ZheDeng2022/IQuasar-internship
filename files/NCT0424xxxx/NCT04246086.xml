    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      mosunetuzumab + lenalidomide, glofitamab + lenalidomide, and glofitamab + lenalidomide +&#xD;
      obinutuzumab in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). This&#xD;
      study will also compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of IV mosunetuzumab + len vs subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab + len.&#xD;
