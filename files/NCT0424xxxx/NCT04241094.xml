  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD occurs in as many as 17% of US military Veterans and is associated with a host of&#xD;
      negative, long-term consequences to the individual, their families, and society at large.&#xD;
      EBPs, such as Prolonged Exposure, result in clinically significant symptom relief for many.&#xD;
      Yet, these therapies have proven less effective for military personnel and Veterans and&#xD;
      treatment dropout rates are high. The investigators' team surveyed Veterans initiating EBPs&#xD;
      for PTSD and a family member across four VA medical centers (N = 598; Project HomeFront). The&#xD;
      investigators found that Veterans were more than twice as likely to complete EBPs when loved&#xD;
      ones encouraged them to confront distress and that Veterans experienced greater treatment&#xD;
      gains when they shared more with their loved ones about their treatment. A couples-based,&#xD;
      exposure therapy for PTSD that integrates intimate partners into every session of PE could&#xD;
      provide the opportunity to mobilize the whole household in the service of EBP engagement,&#xD;
      while extending the goals of therapy beyond symptom reduction to family functioning. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate this intervention will teach couples to embrace a lifestyle that&#xD;
      supports confronting trauma-related distress, so the Veteran and his/her family can achieve&#xD;
      optimal functional outcomes.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to improve the mental health, family functioning, and well-being of&#xD;
      Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through developing and evaluating a&#xD;
      trauma-focused, couple therapy for PTSD. The investigators will use strategies from&#xD;
      Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (ICBT) to help intimate partners support Veterans&#xD;
      during exposure therapy for PTSD (Prolonged Exposure; PE). The investigators anticipate this&#xD;
      approach will increase Veterans' engagement in PE, but also improve relationship functioning,&#xD;
      family functioning, and social functioning. Family involvement has been highlighted as a&#xD;
      fertile avenue for improving the outcomes for patients with PTSD, yet families are&#xD;
      infrequently integrated into evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs). The investigators' goals&#xD;
      are highly consistent with RR&amp;D's mission to promote research that leverages family support&#xD;
      as a pathway to reintegration and optimizes meaningful recovery and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The investigators will complete stages 1A and 1B of the Stage Model of Treatment&#xD;
      Development. Specifically, the investigators will: (1) Expand the treatment outline using&#xD;
      content experts and feedback from key stakeholders (Veterans, intimate partners, providers,&#xD;
      and VA mental health leadership). (2) Conduct a pilot open trial to assess (a) the&#xD;
      acceptability of treatment components, structure, and materials, (b) the feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention (retention and intervention fidelity), and (c) the study approach (screening,&#xD;
      recruitment, and assessment process). (3) Explore the preliminary effects of the intervention&#xD;
      on select outcomes including overall functioning, mental health functioning, social&#xD;
      functioning, family functioning, and potential mechanisms (social control, subjective norms,&#xD;
      and the degree to which Veterans rely on their partners for support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To accomplish Aim 1, the investigators will expand the outline for the intervention&#xD;
      into an initial treatment manual through meetings with content experts and stakeholder&#xD;
      feedback. Next, the investigators will develop fidelity checklists and revise the treatment&#xD;
      manual through conducting the intervention with 2-3 couples. To accomplish Aims 2 and 3, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the intervention in a non-randomized, open trial with 10 Veterans&#xD;
      diagnosed with PTSD and their intimate partners. Veterans will complete baseline and&#xD;
      posttreatment structured diagnostic interviews. Both members of the couple will complete&#xD;
      baseline surveys, posttreatment surveys, and posttreatment qualitative exit interviews. Using&#xD;
      data obtained from the open trial, the investigators will assess the intervention's&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. Upon completion of this proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators will be well positioned to apply for Merit funding for a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (Stage 2 of the Stage Model of Treatment Development) of this innovative, exposure&#xD;
      based, couple therapy.&#xD;
