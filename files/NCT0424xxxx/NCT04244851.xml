  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnourished patients are at risk of many complications, including infections, pressure&#xD;
      ulcers and readmissions. Little is known about their care pathway after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine care pathways of malnourished patients after hospital discharge&#xD;
      and to determine what they need to better take care of their malnutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients hospitalized in the post-emergency unit of Rennes University Hospital during the&#xD;
      study period will be screened for malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning newly diagnosed malnourished patients will be recorded and those patients&#xD;
      will be contacted 3 months after their hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative study will be conducted among malnourished patients and their families : a&#xD;
      sample of patients and their caregivers will be interviewed to better understand their&#xD;
      perception of malnutrition and what they need to better take care of malnutrition.&#xD;
