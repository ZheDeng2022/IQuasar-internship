  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial, which aims to validate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the ODISEA 2.0 Video-feedback intervention compared to a non-intervention&#xD;
      group. While this methodology can be used with caregivers of children from 0 to 8 years, in&#xD;
      this first study the sample will be caregivers and children from 10 to 47 months. The data&#xD;
      collection will be through a pre post evaluation using the parenting skills questionnaire&#xD;
      (E2P V2), parental stress index - short form (PSI-SF), and assessment of interaction videos&#xD;
      with the Adult Sensitivity Scale (E.S.A) and PICCOLO methodology. Additionally, caregivers&#xD;
      will be screened for ACES and with a sociodemographic characterization questionnaire. The&#xD;
      primary outcome aims to measure the effectiveness of the intervention within the parenting&#xD;
      skills of the caregivers. The secondary outcomes will be to assess parental self-efficacy,&#xD;
      parenting stress, parenting practices, parental sensitivity, and implementation fidelity&#xD;
      compared to accumulated risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is designed as a randomized controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation ratio. The&#xD;
      randomization will be performed through block randomization. For the study setting, to extend&#xD;
      the generalizability of the intervention results, the participating sites for this study will&#xD;
      be various cities along Chile, therefore having urban and rural situations, collecting data&#xD;
      through different social programs where the trained professionals are currently working.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this research is to determinate the effectiveness of the basic&#xD;
           ODISEA 2.0 Video-feedback intervention in strengthening parenting skills controlled by&#xD;
           accumulated risk and parenting stress in caregivers of children aged 10 to 47 months&#xD;
           compared to the control group. Furthermore, the key secondary objectives are the&#xD;
           following: Firstly, to measure the effect of ODISEA 2.0 video-feedback on the pre-post&#xD;
           evaluation of parental self-efficacy through the E2P positive parenting scale. Secondly,&#xD;
           to measure the effect of ODISEA 2.0 video-feedback on a pre-post evaluation of the&#xD;
           parenting stress levels through the PSI-SF parental stress index - short form. Thirdly,&#xD;
           to measure the effect of ODISEA 2.0 video feedback intervention on pre-post positive&#xD;
           parenting behaviors evaluation through the Piccolo scale. Fourthly, to measure the&#xD;
           effect of ODISEA 2.0 video-feedback intervention on pre-post parental sensitivity&#xD;
           evaluation through the adult sensitivity scale E.S.A. And lastly, to explore the&#xD;
           relationship between intervention fidelity and accumulated risk (ACES).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible caregivers will be randomized in equal ratio, between 5 sessions of ODISEA 2.0&#xD;
      Video-feedback and a nonintervention control group. The control group, after two months&#xD;
      without intervention, will receive it either way as an ethical consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ODISEA 2.0 Video-feedback strategy is sequenced in three moments, a) a video recording of&#xD;
      the caregiver-child dyad interaction, b) the selection of specific interactions sequences&#xD;
      which are later discussed by the professional in charge of the dyad, and c) a feedback and&#xD;
      reflective process guided by the professional with the caregiver. In this research, the basic&#xD;
      five-session ODISEA 2.0 model will be implemented, consisting of (1) a game session recorded&#xD;
      on video between the caregiver and the child, (2) followed by a reflective session between&#xD;
      the professional and the caregiver, which will be guided using different segments of the&#xD;
      video, concentrating on the resources of the caregivers, (3) succeeded by the second recorded&#xD;
      game session between the caregiver and the child, (4) continuing with a second reflective&#xD;
      session between the caregiver and the professional, integrating more challenging aspects of&#xD;
      the interaction, (5) concluding with the last recorded video session of the dyad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All families assigned to the control group will receive the intervention two months after the&#xD;
      pre-test as an ethical decision. Therefore, the comparator will be set as untreated,&#xD;
      assigning the families as a non-intervention control group. Being this research the first RCT&#xD;
      study where the ODISEA Video-feedback 2.0 methodology will be applied, the rationale for this&#xD;
      decision is to assess whether the families receiving this intervention will benefit in&#xD;
      comparison of people that do not. Considering the counterfactual deliberations from this&#xD;
      methodology, for instance the differentiation between the specific's intervention -ODISEA&#xD;
      Video-feedback 2.0- influence against common elements such as the professional's empathy,&#xD;
      warmth, listening skills, among others, this elements will be embedded and assessed through a&#xD;
      thoughtful fidelity criteria evaluation of the implementation process in order to&#xD;
      differentiate the treatment's contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a given caregiver, the intervention may be needed to be discontinued by the researchers&#xD;
      for reasons of withdrawal of the participant consent. Even though there are no risks&#xD;
      associated to this intervention, in a rare case of withdrawal because of emotional damage,&#xD;
      this will be considered as an adverse event and a protocol has been constructed for managing&#xD;
      this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For managing the co-intervention bias, every caregiver will be asked to complete different&#xD;
      questions of other interventions that they be considered as concomitant care in addition to&#xD;
      the video-feedback intervention that may impact on this trial, such as parenting schools,&#xD;
      psychotherapy, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After gathering the sample, an external research professional, through a random numerical&#xD;
      assignment will generate a block randomization for the dyads. Once assigned to the control&#xD;
      group or experimental group, the dyads will be given a document that will reinforce what is&#xD;
      explained in the informed consent, in informing in which group they been placed, and&#xD;
      acknowledging that both groups will have the same intervention. This document is named &quot;The&#xD;
      road that we will travel&quot;, and there will be a different format for each group. Due to the&#xD;
      characteristics of the intervention and the allocation, neither caregivers nor the&#xD;
      professionals will be blinded, nevertheless the encoders of PICCOLO and E.S.A will be masked,&#xD;
      considered as an outcome assessor masking procedure. They will be external researchers of&#xD;
      this study. No emergency unblinding procedures were created, because only the external&#xD;
      decoders will be masked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in the analysis stage that is typified in the following diagram, the professionals&#xD;
      will have to analyze the videos will be masked, not knowing if they are pre or post&#xD;
      intervention videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-randomization information will be recorded, regarding the interested caregivers that did&#xD;
      not meet all the inclusion criteria, for example not giving their consent. Post-randomization&#xD;
      losses will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By July 2020 it is expected a sample of 100 participating dyads from different regions of the&#xD;
      country. Participants will be identified and contacted by the intervention professional,&#xD;
      having no relationship with the principal investigator. Their participation is voluntary and&#xD;
      has no economic cost to them. For the control group an economic remuneration of $ 10,000&#xD;
      chilean pesos will be delivered after concluding the two months on nonintervention, being a&#xD;
      retention strategy for capturing the post evaluation data of this group. The sample will be&#xD;
      recruited through social networks in the media of Fundación América por la Infancia, and&#xD;
      through specific strategies of the intervention professionals who will participate in the&#xD;
      study, adapting to their local realities where they practice their profession, such as&#xD;
      hospitals and mental health services. There will be a participation agreement signed by the&#xD;
      directors of the different institutions that will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external professional will proceed to generate the blocked randomization, using a random&#xD;
      number generator. When a caregivers agree to participate in the study, the coordinator will&#xD;
      give the data to this researcher who till inform the intervention professional the&#xD;
      corresponding allocation. All caregivers who gives consent for the study and fulfil the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be randomized. After the enrollment of each professional, the data&#xD;
      will be requested by the study coordinator, which will be assigned to the external researcher&#xD;
      to proceed to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenting skills will be measured through four evaluation instruments that will be used as&#xD;
      dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANCOVA will be used to measure the effect of the intervention for each of the different&#xD;
           evaluation instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relationship between the number of adverse experiences experienced in&#xD;
           childhood and the fidelity of the treatment, a linear relationship measure between the&#xD;
           two variables (simple regression) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure post-hoc data if the intervention has different effects on each of the&#xD;
           dimensions of each instrument (post-hoc ANCOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After proceeding with the data analysis, an outcome research paper will be provided for the&#xD;
      scientific community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention professionals will provide the gathered data to the research coordinator&#xD;
      through two platforms, both password protected: The first platform is&#xD;
      https://academia.americaporlainfancia.com/, a website designed to be used as a virtual&#xD;
      classroom for the students of America por la Infancia. Therefore, it will be implemented a&#xD;
      special section for researches, in which all the intervention professionals will have a&#xD;
      username and password to access. In this platform, the different professionals will access&#xD;
      the banner associated with this research - which only they can access with their user and&#xD;
      personal and non-transferable passwords -, where they will enter the evaluation documents and&#xD;
      family data. Only the research coordinator will be able to view and download the documents,&#xD;
      and after downloading them they will be stored on the external hard drive that will be stored&#xD;
      in the dependencies of Fundación América por la Infancia, being later eliminated from the&#xD;
      virtual platform. The hard drive will remain in Providencia 201, fourth floor, commune of&#xD;
      Providencia, Chile. The second platform is https://wetransfer.com/, a website on which,&#xD;
      through the foundation's account, the professionals will send the videos to the coordinator's&#xD;
      e-mail, videos that will be sent using a password. This platform allows sending large&#xD;
      documents to emails. As the data, the videos will be downloaded, eliminated from the webpage,&#xD;
      and stored on the same hard drive mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator, Dr. Gómez, and the co-investigator, M.D. Maureira will be given&#xD;
      access to the cleaned data sets. The study coordinator, M.D. Gabriel will retrieve the&#xD;
      password protected data sets, having access to the multi-center data that will be housed on&#xD;
      the Academia America por la Infancia Web site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data monitoring committee (DMC) will not be necessary for this trial, because of the short&#xD;
      durations and known minimal risks. Likewise, no interim analyses are considered for this&#xD;
      study. Also, as this study is a multicenter trial, auditing will be considered both as an&#xD;
      overall process, and for each recruiting center and their professionals, with the objective&#xD;
      to monitor consents, completeness, adherence to the protocol, among other relevant data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No ancillary studies are considered in the implementation of the study. If any tieried&#xD;
      consent are constructed for future research unrelated to the this study and for different&#xD;
      purposes form the main trial should be sent to the ethics committee and implemented in a&#xD;
      protocol amendment.&#xD;
