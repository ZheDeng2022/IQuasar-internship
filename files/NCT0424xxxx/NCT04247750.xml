  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In β-thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), a significant production of fetal&#xD;
      haemoglobin (HbF) may reduce the severity of clinical course and reactivation of γ-globin&#xD;
      gene expression in adulthood. HbF induction is one of the best strategies to ameliorate the&#xD;
      characteristic symptoms of these diseases. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only medication, approved&#xD;
      by the US Food and Drug Administration, inducing HbF. However, treatments with HU induce&#xD;
      sufficient HbF levels in only half of the patients, and side effects including leukopenia and&#xD;
      neutropenia are frequently reported. Therefore, novel therapeutic inducers must be identified&#xD;
      to develop a personalized treatment in β-thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia. The&#xD;
      availability of new treatments depends on drugs already approved for other indications, and&#xD;
      on pharmacokinetics and pharmacovigilance already assessed. Rapamycin (as Sirolimus) is an&#xD;
      immunosuppressant agent, approved by the FDA for acute rejection prevention in renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients. The ability of this drug to induce γ-globin gene expression in&#xD;
      erythroleukemia cell line and erythroid precursors cells (ErPCs) in ß-thalassaemia patients&#xD;
      is already known. A clinical investigation on the effects of sirolimus in ß-Thalassaemia aims&#xD;
      to evaluate several parameters related to red blood cell status and HbF levels and is a first&#xD;
      step for the full clinical development in this new indication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this protocol is to demonstrate the applicability of a personalised and&#xD;
      precision medicine approach in beta-thalassaemia; the clinical trial setting repurposes a&#xD;
      drug, namely sirolimus. The presence of high Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) levels is considered a&#xD;
      condition predictive of a favourable outcome in thalassaemia. Its increase induced by&#xD;
      pharmacological agents is considered a potential way to improve the clinical status of the&#xD;
      patients. In terms of efficacy analysis, the investigators will focus their attention on HbF&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The suitability evaluation of sirolimus for the treatment of beta-thalassemia patients&#xD;
      within the frame of a comprehensive project aimed at the reduction of their transfusions&#xD;
      need, with consequent amelioration of their quality of life. The purpose can be achieved&#xD;
      through increasing of HbF levels pharmacologically mediated, with verification of a&#xD;
      prerequisite, namely the correlation between the induction of HbF in vitro and in vivo in&#xD;
      single patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of sirolimus and correlation between administered dose and blood&#xD;
           levels in beta-thalassemia patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the influence of sirolimus on transfusion regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of sirolimus on the hematopoietic and immune system of thalassemia&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

On a total scale of 0-100, higher values always represent a better outcome. The questions are grouped into four domains: physical health, emotional health, family functioning, and school and career functioning. The adult self-report questionnaires include a fifth category on sexual activity which is only one item. Subscales are summed</description>
