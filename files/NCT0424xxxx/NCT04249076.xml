  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. In fact,&#xD;
      in 2017, 3.8 million cataracts procedures were performed in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite of surgical advances, pain and inflammation after ophthalmic surgery continues to be&#xD;
      a burden on both patients and physicians. The treatment of postoperative pain is essential&#xD;
      for hospitalized patients, but it is even more important for patients who are treated on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the efficacy and safety of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic&#xD;
      nanoemulsion 0.05% to placebo, when administering one drop four times a day during 14 days&#xD;
      after routine unilateral cataract surgery. Participants will undergo routine cataract surgery&#xD;
      according to the ophthalmologist's normal procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, 210 participants are planned to take part in the study. They will be screened across&#xD;
      20 centers in the US. Participants who experience postoperative inflammation on the first day&#xD;
      following routine cataract surgery and who meet all other eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned by chance to one of two study groups in a 2:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      clobetasol propionate ophthalmic nanoemulsion 0.05 % (N=140) or placebo (N=70) for the&#xD;
      treatment of inflammation and pain associated with cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) study visits are planned: Visit -1 (Screening), Visit 1 (Baseline; 24h after the&#xD;
      surgery), Visit 2 (Day 3), Visit 3 (Day 8), Visit 4 (Day 15), and Visit 5 (Day 29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ophthalmologist will administer the first dose of the study medication 24 hours after the&#xD;
      surgery, at the end of the Baseline visit, at the study center. Study medication will be then&#xD;
      dispensed to patients for self-administration during the study at a dosage of one drop four&#xD;
      times a day, during 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct instillation is the most efficient method for delivery to the ocular surface and is an&#xD;
      accepted and widely used method for topical application to the eye. This study will examine&#xD;
      effect and tolerability for 14 days of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic nanoemulsion 0.05%&#xD;
      dosed four times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to support an application for approval to market clobetasol&#xD;
      propionate ophthalmic nanoemulsion 0.05% in the US for the indication of inflammation and&#xD;
      pain after ocular surgery. The reference (comparator) product in this study, the vehicle, is&#xD;
      expected to provide a lower efficacy rate when compared to clobetasol 0.05%.&#xD;

             energy used for phacoemulsification exert additional stress on iris and other anterior&#xD;

             body which may lead to partial luxation of the lens / lens capsule and is a serious&#xD;
             complication of cataract surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence of Fuchs´ endothelial dystrophy (loss of endothelial cells that may result in&#xD;
             chronic corneal edema after cataract surgery especially if high energy was used during&#xD;
             phacoemulsification)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Presence of cornea guttata&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Presence of IOP ≥24 mmHg at Baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Participation in any study of an investigational topical or systemic new drug or&#xD;
             device within 30 days prior to the Screening visit, or at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Prior participation in the study described in this protocol, unless patient was not&#xD;
             randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. In the opinion of the investigator or study coordinator, be unwilling or unable to&#xD;
             comply with study protocol or unable to successfully instill eye drops&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Disease, condition (including monocular participants), or disorder that in the&#xD;
             judgement of investigator could confound study assessments or limit compliance to&#xD;
             study protocol&#xD;
