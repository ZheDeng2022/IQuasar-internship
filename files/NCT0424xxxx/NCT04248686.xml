  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Online, guided self-help interventions have been used for weight-loss (WL), as well as for&#xD;
      treatment of eating disorders (EDs), separately, but no program exists to manage these&#xD;
      conditions together. To date, a combination ED and WL intervention has been piloted in&#xD;
      adolescents who endorsed high-risk ED behavior and had overweight, and revealed moderate&#xD;
      improvement in ED behavior and WL. Thus, the use of online intervention for ED&#xD;
      psychopathology and WL in individuals with clinical and sub-clinical EDs is the next step.&#xD;
      Given Dr. Wilfley's past expertise with ED and WL interventions, and particularly her&#xD;
      involvement with online interventions for these issues her mentorship will support the&#xD;
      carrying out of aims for this proposal. The goal of this proposal is to implement a program&#xD;
      to reduce weight and shape concerns, reduce disordered eating symptoms such as binging and&#xD;
      compensatory behaviors associated with binge-type EDs, while also reducing weight for college&#xD;
      students with comorbid overweight/obesity. This project will pilot an online, guided&#xD;
      self-help ED intervention that offers cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based tools to&#xD;
      improve ED symptoms, while also teaching them healthy methods of behavioral WL, for&#xD;
      individuals with clinical/sub-clinical binge-type EDs with comorbid overweight/obesity in&#xD;
      order to examine effectiveness compared to referral to Student Health Services for ED and WL&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intersection of eating disorders and overweight/obesity reveals a large, and mostly&#xD;
      underserved, population. Having overweight/obesity as a child is a risk factor for an ED, as&#xD;
      many adolescents with overweight/obesity utilize disordered eating methods in order to lose&#xD;
      weight. Conversely, binge-type EDs increase risk for overweight/obesity as binge episodes can&#xD;
      lead to further weight gain. Additionally, treatment of overweight early is especially&#xD;
      important as individuals with overweight have an increased likelihood of moving from&#xD;
      overweight to obesity status. Despite this intertwined problem, few interventions exist that&#xD;
      address ED pathology combined with a healthy weight loss (WL) intervention. A particular&#xD;
      population in need of intervention for EDs with comorbid overweight/obesity is the college&#xD;
      student population. Intervention at the college level is important as it is also prevention&#xD;
      for future complications of EDs and overweight/obesity. Combined intervention for EDs and&#xD;
      overweight for young adults, specifically college students, is needed programming which could&#xD;
      potentially have substantial long-term health benefits. This project will pilot an online,&#xD;
      guided self-help ED intervention that offers cognitive behavioral therapy based tools to&#xD;
      improve ED symptoms while also teaching the healthy WL methods and maintenance of behavioral&#xD;
      WL for individuals with clinical/sub-clinical binge-type EDs with comorbid&#xD;
      overweight/obesity. Participants will take the online screen by going to the URL address&#xD;
      listed on the study advertisement. Before answering any survey questions, they will read a&#xD;
      consent information sheet on the study, and consent to having their information stored so&#xD;
      that they can be reached later if eligible for the long term study. They will then complete&#xD;
      screening questions asking about their eating habits and weight and shape concerns. Lastly,&#xD;
      they will be asked if they are interested in taking part in the long term study, and if so,&#xD;
      at what email address would they like to be reached. Eligible criteria include endorsing&#xD;
      clinical/sub-clinical symptoms of a binge-type ED, having a BMI &gt; 25, and wanting to lose&#xD;
      weight. If an individual screens positive for having low weight, as characterized by a BMI &lt;&#xD;
      18.5, they will automatically be provided a referral to student health services at the end of&#xD;
      their survey. Those that are eligible to participate will be sent emails to ask if they are&#xD;
      interested in participating in this study. If they are interested, they will come into the&#xD;
      lab to read and sign consent information. To minimize coercion, they will have as much time&#xD;
      as they like to read and consider participation.&#xD;
