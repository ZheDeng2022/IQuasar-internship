  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether immune cells modified to recognize B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL) can be successfully manufactured at the University of Colorado Anschutz and whether&#xD;
      these cells can be administered with an acceptable safety profile. Adults who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that has relapsed or no longer responds to&#xD;
      chemotherapy (relapsed or refractory) may be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use participants own immune cells, called T cells, to kill the&#xD;
      lymphoma. These T cells are involved in fighting infections and in some cases, can also kill&#xD;
      cancer cells. The investigators will extract T cells from the participant's blood, modify the&#xD;
      cells in a laboratory, and then return teh cells to the participant's body via intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) injection. In the laboratory, the investigators will add a new gene into the T cells&#xD;
      that allows the T cells to recognize and kill the lymphoma cells, and allows these modified&#xD;
      cells to multiply and increase in numbers. To put the new gene into your T cells, the&#xD;
      investigators will use a weakened virus. The virus is modified so that it cannot multiply or&#xD;
      spread once the cells are infused.&#xD;

      The objective of this Phase 1 open-label study is to assess the feasibility of UCD19 Chimeric&#xD;
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells manufacture onsite, successful infusion of eligible subjects,&#xD;
      and safety of UCD19 CAR T Cells infusion in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-Cell&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) subjects will participate in the initial cohort of this open-label, single arm,&#xD;
      single site study to assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and safety; the first set of 3&#xD;
      subjects will initiate treatment with lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T cell&#xD;
      infusion staggered 30 days from CAR T cell dosing of the previously treated subject.&#xD;
      Depending on the assessment of DLTs, the second set of 3 subjects may be enrolled and dosed&#xD;
      without stagger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial 6 subjects have received treatment, an additional 14 subjects will&#xD;
      participate in the Phase 1 expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include adults with relapsed/ primary refractory CD19 positive (i.e. CD19&#xD;
      expressing) B-NHL as confirmed by either flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or both&#xD;
      who are not candidates for other curative forms of therapy. Enrolled participants will&#xD;
      receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by infusion of UCD19 CAR T Cells (Lentiviral&#xD;
      Vector [LV] Transduced Autologous Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes). Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled up to 1 month before anticipated date of apheresis, and will be considered completed&#xD;
      at 12 months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Follow Up will be conducted under a separate protocol and will occur for up to 15&#xD;
      Years to collect data on the long-term safety of UCD19 CAR T Cells, and for the observation,&#xD;
      detection, and evaluation of latent adverse reactions including secondary malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this study focuses on primary endpoints for feasibility of the manufacturing and&#xD;
      infusion processes and safety of the administered UCD19 CAR T Cells, preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      effectiveness will be collected and analyzed for use in planning future CAR T cell therapy&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
