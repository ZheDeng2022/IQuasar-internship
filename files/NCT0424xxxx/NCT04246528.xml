  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) is an organization established&#xD;
      by researchers, health care providers, and people living with scleroderma (systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis; SSc) from Canada, the United States, Mexico, Australia, France, Spain, and the&#xD;
      United Kingdom. The objectives of SPIN are (1) to assemble a large cohort of SSc patients who&#xD;
      complete outcome assessments regularly in order to learn more about important problems faced&#xD;
      by people living with SSc and (2) to develop and test a series of internet-based&#xD;
      interventions to help patients manage problems related to SSc, including a self-management&#xD;
      program (SPIN-SELF Program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPIN-SELF Program was designed by SPIN members based on key tenets of behaviour change&#xD;
      that have been successfully incorporated in programs for more common diseases and on patient&#xD;
      input. It utilizes social modelling through educational videos of SSc patients describing&#xD;
      their challenges and what they have done to cope with SSc, as well as videos teaching key&#xD;
      self-management techniques. After an introduction to self-management and instructions on how&#xD;
      to navigate the program, patients will have access to modules that are most relevant to their&#xD;
      symptoms and disease management challenges. The program's modules address (1) pain; (2) skin&#xD;
      care, finger ulcers, and Raynaud's; (3) sleep problems; (4) fatigue; (5) gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms; (6) itch; (7) emotions and stress; (8) body image concerns due to disfigurement;&#xD;
      and (9) effective communication with healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a feasibility trial with progression to full-scale randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT), depending on whether stoppage criteria are met, of the SPIN&#xD;
      Self-Management Program. The SPIN-SELF Program was previously feasibility tested as an online&#xD;
      only, self-help intervention. However, uptake was low, thus the investigators have moved to a&#xD;
      group-based format. SPIN-SELF participants randomized to intervention will access and use&#xD;
      online self-management material, and this will be supported by videoconference group&#xD;
      sessions, led by trained peer facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SPIN-SELF feasibility trial with progression to full-scale trial, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the disease management self-efficacy of participants who use SPIN-SELF compared&#xD;
      to usual care. Eligible SPIN Cohort participants and externally recruited participants, with&#xD;
      low disease-management self-efficacy, will be randomized to the SPIN-SELF Program or to usual&#xD;
      care only. In the feasibility portion, 40 eligible participants will be randomized. Unless&#xD;
      the trial team determines, based on stoppage criteria, that trial procedures need important&#xD;
      modifications thereby re-setting the full scale trial as a new trial, the outcome data of the&#xD;
      participants in the feasibility portion will be utilized in the analyses of the full-scale&#xD;
      trial. In the full-scale RCT, 524 participants will be randomized.&#xD;

      ----------------------- OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the SPIN-SELF feasibility trial with progression to full-scale RCT&#xD;
      is to evaluate the disease management self-efficacy of participants who use SPIN's online&#xD;
      self-management program (SPIN-SELF), compared to usual care. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess the effect of SPIN-SELF on patient activation (i.e. the extent to which patients&#xD;
      effectively engage with and manage their own health), social appearance anxiety, functional&#xD;
      health outcomes, as well as usage of the SPIN-SELF program and patient satisfaction with the&#xD;
      format and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ----------------------- RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPIN Cohort currently includes over 2000 SSc patients from 47 sites in Canada, the United&#xD;
      States, Mexico, Australia, and France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. SPIN Cohort&#xD;
      participants complete outcome measures via the Internet upon enrolment and subsequently every&#xD;
      three months. Eligible patients, based on questionnaire responses (Self-Efficacy for Managing&#xD;
      Chronic Disease (SEMCD) Scale ≤ 7), will be invited to participate in the SPIN-SELF&#xD;
      feasibility trial with progression to full-scale trial. Additionally, recruitment&#xD;
      announcements for the SPIN-SELF feasibility and full-scale trials will be posted on SPIN's&#xD;
      Facebook page and Twitter account and distributed for posting via SPIN's patient organization&#xD;
      partners in countries with large English and French-speaking populations. The non-SPIN Cohort&#xD;
      participants' eligibility will be assessed with the SEMCD Scale. In the feasibility portion,&#xD;
      only English-speaking participants will be included. In the full-scale trial, English and&#xD;
      French-speaking participants will be included. An anticipated 40 eligible participants will&#xD;
      be recruited into the feasibility portion, and an anticipated 524 eligible participants will&#xD;
      be recruited into the SPIN-SELF full-scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ----------------------- PROGRESSION FROM SPIN-SELF FEASIBILITY TRIAL TO FULL-SCALE TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will launch the SPIN-SELF trial as a feasibility trial with possible&#xD;
      progression to full-scale trial. Thus, in the feasibility portion of the proposed study, the&#xD;
      trial team will collect data to improve several aspects of the trial's processes. At the&#xD;
      completion of the feasibility portion, the trial team plans to proceed directly to the&#xD;
      full-scale trial, including results from the feasibility stage in the full-scale trial,&#xD;
      unless one or more of the stoppage criteria occur. In that case, the trial team will address&#xD;
      issues that are identified and begin the full-scale trial anew, separate from the feasibility&#xD;
      trial. The stoppage criteria are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and enrolment of trial participants: If participants who are eligible based&#xD;
           on their self-efficacy scores (SEMCD ≤ 7) are not recorded as eligible in the&#xD;
           eligibility report on the new SPIN Cohort platform (gen2) and not recruited, then the&#xD;
           programming errors in the new platform will need to be addressed and procedures will&#xD;
           need to be re-set before the full-scale trial can commence. If more than 6 non-eligible&#xD;
           participants (15% of 40 enrolled in feasibility trial) are erroneously identified as&#xD;
           eligible and assigned to the intervention or waitlist control, the trial team would&#xD;
           address programming errors, modify procedures and conduct the full-scale trial as a new&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fidelity of the delivery of the intervention (i.e., group sessions): If by the end of&#xD;
           the feasibility trial &gt; 20% of the components of the 8 sessions were not delivered&#xD;
           according to the pre-specified program, the trial team will investigate to identify&#xD;
           barriers to the delivery of the intervention and will modify the intervention procedures&#xD;
           accordingly, before proceeding to the full-scale trial. The full-scale trial would need&#xD;
           to commence as a new trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group format of the SPIN-SELF sessions: If participants across groups consistently&#xD;
           suggest similar changes to the format of the SPIN-SELF program, then the trial team&#xD;
           would modify the format of the intervention sessions according to this consensus&#xD;
           feedback. These modifications would be made before commencing the full-scale trial as a&#xD;
           new trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the SPIN-SELF feasibility trial, the investigators will use the collected&#xD;
           information and evaluation of the stoppage criteria to decide whether to: (1) Continue&#xD;
           to the full-scale RCT without modifications to the trial procedures, (2) Modify trial&#xD;
           procedures based on participant feedback before continuing to the full-scale trial, or&#xD;
           (3) Modify the trial procedures before re-setting them and conducting the full-scale RCT&#xD;
           as a new trial (in this case, outcome data collected during the feasibility phase will&#xD;
           not be included in the analyses of the full-scale trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ----------------------- RANDOMISATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monthly, consented participants will be entered into pools based on language and&#xD;
           scheduling availability. De-identified codes for participants in each pool will be&#xD;
           provided to an external randomisation service. Starting with the largest pool, the&#xD;
           service will randomly select the largest possible even number of participants (12 to 20&#xD;
           participants) then randomly allocate half to intervention and half to control via single&#xD;
           block randomisation using R version 3.6.3. This will be repeated to form as many groups&#xD;
           of 6-10 participants and paired waitlist participants as possible each month until the&#xD;
           enrolment target is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ----------------------- INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SPIN-SELF Program is an 8-session group videoconference intervention that is&#xD;
           delivered over the course of 12 weeks. Each videoconference-based intervention group&#xD;
           will be led by a facilitator who has been trained in the SPIN- Scleroderma Support Group&#xD;
           Leader Education (SSLED) Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ----------------------- STATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consistent with the feasibility trial design and small sample size, no hypothesis tests&#xD;
           are planned for the feasibility portion of the trial. Instead, the investigators will&#xD;
           present a description of the feasibility elements, including participants' eligibility&#xD;
           and recruitment and numbers and percentages of participants who respond to follow-up&#xD;
           measures. Use of the internet intervention will be described by presenting the frequency&#xD;
           of logins and usage of the specific SPIN-SELF modules. Analysis of outcome measures will&#xD;
           include the completeness of data and presence of floor or ceiling effects. Descriptive&#xD;
           statistics will be used to provide means and standard deviations for the measures.&#xD;
           Qualitative information on participants' experience using the SPIN-SELF intervention&#xD;
           will be used to interpret acceptability related to the group-sessions format, content of&#xD;
           the sessions and online program, webpage organization, and navigation. Information&#xD;
           related to required resources and management of the program during feasibility will&#xD;
           inform any necessary changes to intervention or trial procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the full-scale trial, for continuous outcomes, the investigators will use an&#xD;
           intent-to-treat analysis to estimate score differences between intervention and waitlist&#xD;
           participants with a linear mixed-effects model fit using the lmer function in lme4.&#xD;
           Score differences and Hedges' g SMD effect size will be presented with 95% confidence&#xD;
           intervals (CIs). To estimate odds ratios for the dichotomous MCID, intent-to-treat&#xD;
           analysis will be done with a binomial generalized linear mixed-effects models with a log&#xD;
           link function fit using the glmer function in lme4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For all models, to account for clustering in the blocked PN-RCT design, the&#xD;
           investigators will fit a random intercept and slope for treatment effect by&#xD;
           randomisation block and an additional random slope for treatment by intervention group&#xD;
           cluster. In main analyses, in addition to a fixed effect for assignment to the&#xD;
           intervention arm, the investigators will include a fixed effect for baseline score. In&#xD;
           adjusted analyses, the investigators will also control for age (years), sex (male vs.&#xD;
           female), SSc disease subtype (diffuse vs. limited), disease duration (years since&#xD;
           diagnosis), and country (Canada, France, USA, other) as fixed effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the event of missing outcome data, to minimize the possibility of bias, the&#xD;
           investigators will use multiple imputation by chained equations using the mice package&#xD;
           to generate 20 imputed datasets, using 15 cycles per imputed dataset. Variables in the&#xD;
           mice procedure will include randomisation block, intervention arm, number of&#xD;
           intervention sessions attended, measures of all primary and secondary outcomes at&#xD;
           baseline and post-intervention, age, sex, SSc disease subtype, years since diagnosis,&#xD;
           country, and race/ethnicity. Pooled standard errors and associated 95% CIs will be&#xD;
           estimated using Rubin's rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To estimate average intervention effects among compliers, which will be defined based on&#xD;
           the number of sessions completed, the investigators will use an instrumental variable&#xD;
           approach to inflate intent-to-treat effects from main models by the inverse probability&#xD;
           of compliance among intervention arm participants; 95% CIs will be constructed via a&#xD;
           cluster bootstrap approach, resampling at study randomisation block and participant&#xD;
           levels. For transparency, results for participants with complete data will also be&#xD;
           shown. Participant satisfaction scores for the intervention group will be reported&#xD;
           descriptively. All outcome analyses will be conducted in R (R version 3.6.3; R Studio&#xD;
           version 1.2.5042). All analyses will be 2-sided with alpha = 0.05. The investigators&#xD;
           will not adjust for multiple analyses since a single primary outcome was identified a&#xD;
           priori.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient activation is determined by the extent to which patients effectively engage with and manage their own health. The 13-item patient activation measure (PAM-13) includes statements related to participants' attitudes and perspectives about their health, with four possible responses ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (4) strongly agree, with an additional &quot;Not applicable&quot; option. Using calibration tables (accessed with a purchased license), participants' responses are converted into raw scores ranging from 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher activation. Raw scores are sorted into four activation levels, with higher levels characterizing higher patient activation: (level 1) disengaged and overwhelmed, (level 2) becoming aware but still struggling, (level 3) taking action, (level 4) maintain behaviours and pushing further.</description>

    <description>Changes in appearance that can occur due to systematic sclerosis (SSc) can cause a fear of social situations in which one's appearance is evaluated, or social appearance anxiety. The SAAS consists of 16 items that measure patients' self-reported anxiety related to situations where one's appearance will be evaluated, with response options ranging from 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Extremely&quot;). To calculate total scores the first item (&quot;I feel comfortable with the way I appear to others&quot;) is reverse-coded, all items are summed, and total scores range from 16-80, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety.</description>
