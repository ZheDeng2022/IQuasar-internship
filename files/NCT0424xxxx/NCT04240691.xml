  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate two ways to help people re-engage with healthcare. The first is&#xD;
      to assess if providing HIV treatment on the first visit (or within 1 week) can help people&#xD;
      re-engage with care and ultimately stay in care after 24 and 48 weeks. It will also assess&#xD;
      the success of starting treatment immediately by measuring the HIV virus in people's&#xD;
      bloodstream after 24 and 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of this study is to assess a new behavioral treatment called&#xD;
      60-Minutes-for-Health which aims to help people identify and overcome barriers to HIV care,&#xD;
      to help with motivation maintaining in care, to help cope with negative feelings about HIV,&#xD;
      and to help increase self-reliance in seeking healthcare amid other things that are happening&#xD;
      in your life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to cause significant illness and death in&#xD;
      the USA despite availability of effective treatment. People who are aware of their HIV&#xD;
      status, but who are out of care and not on medications, are therefore at risk of developing&#xD;
      HIV related health problems. In addition, people with HIV who are out of care are at greater&#xD;
      risk of transmitting HIV compared to people on HIV treatment with suppressed levels of virus&#xD;
      in plasma. To date, there are no interventions that have been shown to successfully link this&#xD;
      &quot;out of care&quot; population back into care and successfully maintain viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test a strategy of providing immediate HIV therapy drugs, linkage to care,&#xD;
      and a randomized intervention (60-minutes for health or diet and nutrition session). The goal&#xD;
      of the study is to demonstrate that the 60-Minutes-for-Health intervention improves the rate&#xD;
      of viral suppression at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of rapid antiretroviral therapy (rapid ART), defined as the initiation of ART within&#xD;
      7 days of HIV diagnosis, has been associated with improved rates of linkage to care,&#xD;
      retention in care and virological suppression after 1 year among persons newly diagnoses with&#xD;
      HIV. In addition, the behavioral intervention, &quot;60-Minutes-for-Health&quot;, was shown in a pilot&#xD;
      study to improve retention in care among PWH-OOC. We aim to undertake a study to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of providing rapid-ART to people who are aware of their HIV status, but have been&#xD;
      out of care at the time they re-engage in care. In addition, study participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the &quot;60-Minutes-for-Health&quot; intervention or a 60 minute diet and&#xD;
      nutrition control session.&#xD;

Mean scores for the seven acceptability metrics below will be computed for the total sample and each study arm (intervention, control).Among a subset of participants enrolled in four focus groups (10 participants each) will be held. Our interview guide will elicit feedback on the seven theory-based acceptability/feasibility metrics:affective attitudes towards rapid ART,perceived burden or reasons for discontinuation/dropout, perceived effectiveness, potential consequences (ethical, unintended, or side-effects) of rapid ART,willingness to participate in rapid ART,perceived costs (financial,social,emotional,physical) of rapid ART,perceived user experiences and satisfaction with rapid ART.</description>

    <description>60-Minutes-for Health: this is a psychological intervention which seeks to correct factors underlying decisions to delay or avoid HIV care and strengthen abilities to overcome HIV care utilization barriers. This is achieved through assistance identifying and reducing misinformation guiding HIV care attendance decisions; enhancing motivation to maintain HIV care via personal health goals; building skills for coping with negative feelings related to living with HIV; and increasing self-efficacy for navigating structural barriers and maintaining HIV care amidst competing priorities.</description>

             their local HIV surveillance data in conjunction with other data to identify PWH who&#xD;
             may be OOC33. This Data to Care program results in the evaluation of ~ 250 new cases&#xD;
             per year in San Diego (~20-21 PWH-OOC a month), many of whom are found to be viremic&#xD;
             and out-of-care. Once located, SDPHD will offer immediate transportation vouchers&#xD;
             (Lyft) to and from the AVRC to expedite study enrollment and rapid ART start.&#xD;
