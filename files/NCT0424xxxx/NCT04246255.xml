  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performing intravenous (IV) cannulation to pediatric patients might be much harder than adult&#xD;
      ones according to their anxiety levels. However, managing adult patients during intravenous&#xD;
      cannulation is also challenging if he or she had a noxious memory about the situation or has&#xD;
      a low pain threshold. Therefore, it is essential to relieve the pain of an IV needle or an IV&#xD;
      cannula insertion in the pediatric patient population. Lidocaine Hcl spray (Xylocaine 10%&#xD;
      Oral ) will be utilized to the research group, and Serum Physiologic (Serum Fizyolojik %0,9&#xD;
      10 ml ampule, Biofarma İlaç San. ve Tic A.Ş., İstanbul, Turkey) will be utilized to the&#xD;
      control group of the study. Both medications will be administrated by spraying the formula&#xD;
      three times to an adhesive bandage and placing it to the skin that IV cannulation will be&#xD;
      performed. After waiting for a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 15 minutes ( waiting time is&#xD;
      closely associated with the patient's anxiety level), IV cannulation will be performed from&#xD;
      the same area by an experienced pediatric nurse. The investigator hypothesizes that utilizing&#xD;
      the spray form of the Lidocaine Hcl formula to the skin with an adhesive bandage before IV&#xD;
      cannulation might lower the pain of the manipulation in pediatric patients, which might cause&#xD;
      lower anxiety levels with stable vital signs.&#xD;

      The G-Power 3.0.10. Computed required sample size (alpha:0.05, effect size:0.3 and power 0.8)&#xD;
      related to t-test of the difference between two dependent means(matched pairs) according to&#xD;
      the 5% change of before and after heartbeat outcome parameters with Standard derivations of (&#xD;
      -/+12 to +/-15). The total sample size of ninety participants is evaluated to be enough for&#xD;
      the study. However, fifty participants are planned to be enrolled in each group (a total of&#xD;
      100 participants) to compensate for possible losses in this prospective, randomized clinical&#xD;
      study. Six parameters will be evaluated, and three scales will be performed in each group.&#xD;
      The six parameters are Heart Rate-1, Spo2-1, Body Temperature-1, Heart Rate-2, Spo2-2, Body&#xD;
      Temperature-2. The three scales are 11 point Verbal Numeric Rating Scale-1, 11 point Verbal&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale-2, and Visual Analog Scale. Those parameters will be measured&#xD;
      non-invasively, without causing any pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is planned to be done with the sealed envelope modeling. One of the&#xD;
      envelopes is planned to be chosen by each participant after the written consent form approval&#xD;
      from the child and his/her parents. The envelopes have either a &quot;C&quot; letter or &quot;L&quot; letter&#xD;
      inside representing C as {Group C: &quot;The Control Group&quot;}, representing L as {Group L: &quot;The&#xD;
      Lidocaine Group&quot;} will be opened by the principal investigator. The bottle 1(Serum&#xD;
      Physiologic inside) or bottle 2( Lidocaine inside) will be given to the ward nurse according&#xD;
      to the letters in the envelope. The ward nurse will be blinded according to the ingredients&#xD;
      in the bottles. The outcome parameters and the scales will be recorded by the nurse in the&#xD;
      investigation. The nurse in the investigation will be blinded about the groups, the envelopes&#xD;
      and the ingredients performed to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to last in 4 months (16 weeks) time. However, in the middle of the&#xD;
      study( 25 participants undertaken within each group), post-doc tests are planned to be done.&#xD;
      If the power of the study according to the post-Hoc tests are more than 80%, the study will&#xD;
      be stopped.&#xD;
