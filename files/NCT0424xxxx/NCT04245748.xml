      Acute, double-blind, adaptively randomized treatment with duloxetine or escitalopram,&#xD;

      The study will consist of 2 phases (Figure 1). Eighty-four adults will be enrolled in Phase 1&#xD;
      and will be adaptively randomized (initially 1:1) to acute, double-blind treatment with&#xD;
      escitalopram or duloxetine for 11 weeks. Remission status will be determined at week 10.&#xD;
      Remitting patients (CGI-S ≤2) will resume treatment as usual, which may consist of outpatient&#xD;
      referral. Non-remitting patients (CGI-S ≥3), will continue into Phase 2 and will be&#xD;
      randomized to adjunctive clonazepam or pregabalin for 8 weeks. Twenty adults treated with&#xD;
      escitalopram (or its racemic equivalent, citalopram) or duloxetine for ≥6 weeks (at&#xD;
      screening) will be enrolled into Phase 2 and will be randomized to receive adjunctive&#xD;
      clonazepam or pregabalin for 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The HAM-A rating scale is a test of 14 items measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Total scores range from 0 to 56. A lower score is favorable.</description>
