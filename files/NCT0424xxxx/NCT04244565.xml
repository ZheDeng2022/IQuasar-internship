      Effect of Self-Directed Versus Traditional Clinical Learning Model on Nurses' Airway&#xD;
      Management Competencies and Patients' Airway Related Incidents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Airway crisis situations in ICUs (Intensive Care Units) are common, complex,&#xD;
      dynamic and time-sensitive contexts, that pose a significant threat to patient safety, and&#xD;
      are a major source of preventable errors. Airway management has the highest priority in&#xD;
      patient care, it is the first step in the (ABCDE) approach. The concept of Airway management&#xD;
      in nursing perspective includes any nursing procedures and techniques required to keep the&#xD;
      airway open and prevent aspiration. Adult learning is a practice in which adults engage in&#xD;
      systematic and sustained learning activities in order to gain new forms of knowledge, skills&#xD;
      or values. Most adult education is voluntary; therefore, the participants are generally&#xD;
      self-motivated. Continuing education (CE) of nurses is increasingly necessary to keep abreast&#xD;
      of rapid changes in patient care due to advancements in knowledge and technology and improve&#xD;
      their ability to serve the patients safely. Although nursing care has been changed&#xD;
      significantly over the past 30 years, methods for clinical training nurses have not. A&#xD;
      popular or traditional model for clinical teaching of nurses, including but not limited to;&#xD;
      integrating lectures, skills laboratory training and supervised clinical experience. A&#xD;
      benefit of this model is the opportunity to assist nurses to integrate the concept learned in&#xD;
      class or skill lab in patient care. Also, the instructor can select clinical activities that&#xD;
      best meet nurses' needs and are consistent with hospital goals. While, Self-directed learning&#xD;
      (SDL) is one of modern approaches of clinical learning, the concept of SDL originates from&#xD;
      the Adult Learning Theory, it is a process in which the instructors play a facilitating role&#xD;
      while, learners actively participate in identifying their own learning needs, learning goals,&#xD;
      allocating resources &amp; decide whether learning method can be used, and engaging in&#xD;
      self-reflection &amp; evaluation. The positive outcomes of SDL including but not limited to,&#xD;
      greater self-control, self-confidence, autonomy, and lifelong learning skills. In essence the&#xD;
      aim of this study will be examining the effect of Self-directed clinical learning model as&#xD;
      compared to the traditional models to improve nurses' Airway management competencies and&#xD;
      minimize airway related incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis H1: Critically care nurses who will approach self-directed clinical&#xD;
      learning model (μ1) will have a higher level of Airway management skills (μ2), (H1: μ1 &gt; μ2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Intensive care units who will approach self-directed clinical learning model to learn&#xD;
      their working nurses (μ1) will have a lower frequency of patients' airway-related incidents&#xD;
      (μ2), (H1: μ1 &lt; μ2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods True experimental, prospective, and comparative research design will be&#xD;
      utilized in the current study. This study will be conducted at selected two Adult Intensive&#xD;
      Care Units, A convenience sample of 60 male and female Critically Care Nurses who are working&#xD;
      in the selected Intensive Care Unit, will be recruited to the study. The sample size&#xD;
      estimated by (G Power analysis) (independent t tests - One tail, Effect size = 0.65, α =&#xD;
      0.05, Power (1-β) = 0.80, balanced allocation ratio 1:1). The total sample size will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups (study and control). All nurses should be corresponded to specific&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five tools will be formulated to collect data pertinent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The study will be conducted through three phases; preparation &amp; designation,&#xD;
      implementation, and follow up &amp; evaluation phase. The 1st Part will be initiated by&#xD;
      allocating the selected ICUs randomly into two paired settings, one for applying traditional&#xD;
      learning (control ICU) and the other for self-directed learning experimentation (study ICU).&#xD;
      the nurses who are working in selected ICUs and correspond to the inclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      randomly distributed into two equal groups (30 nurses in each group). The nurses who are&#xD;
      working in study ICU will be asked to fill out the nurses' readiness assessment sheet to&#xD;
      learn independently. The nurses who will demonstrate a high readiness score (&gt;80%) for&#xD;
      independent learning will be included. Once implantation is complete, the follow-up and&#xD;
      evaluation phase will be initiated by daily monitoring of the occurrence of patients' airway&#xD;
      related incidents in both control and study ICUs for a continuous three months. Then, the&#xD;
      nurses' knowledge and practices (in the control group) will be evaluated two times, 1st time&#xD;
      will be 1 month after the implementation phase, and the second time will be after 3 months&#xD;
      from the 1st evaluation (to measure the retention of given education and training). Upon&#xD;
      completion of data collection, descriptive and inferential statistics will be utilized to&#xD;
      test for differences among the study and control group subjects.&#xD;

      Effect of Self-Directed Versus Traditional Clinical Learning Model on Nurses' Airway&#xD;
      Management Competencies and Patients' Airway Related Incidents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway crisis situations in ICUs (Intensive Care Units) are common, complex, dynamic and&#xD;
      time-sensitive contexts, that pose a significant threat to patient safety, and are a major&#xD;
      source of preventable errors [1]. Although, only a few studies have demonstrated the airway&#xD;
      incidents in ICUs, 7.04% of ICU patients developed airway incidents [2]. The UK National&#xD;
      Reporting and Learning Centre identified that 82% of ICU airway incidents occurred in patient&#xD;
      with ETT, with 25% contributing to the patient's death [3]. The concept of Airway management&#xD;
      in nursing perspective includes any nursing procedures and techniques required to keep the&#xD;
      airway open and prevent aspiration [4]. In fact, Airway management has the highest priority&#xD;
      in patient care, it is the first step in the (ABCDE) approach. Several nursing related&#xD;
      factors that can directly or indirectly cause a patient to have airway crises either patient&#xD;
      intubated or even non-intubated, such factors include a partial or complete airway&#xD;
      obstruction, injury or infection [5,6]. However, Airway management procedures and techniques&#xD;
      (Table 1) are rapidly changing, there is a need for structured innovative training models&#xD;
      related to Airway management education for critical care nurses to develop nurses'&#xD;
      competences and subsequently will enhance patients' outcomes [7,8,9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult learning has speciﬁc characteristics, adult education is a practice in which adults&#xD;
      engage in systematic and sustained learning activities in order to gain new forms of&#xD;
      knowledge, skills or values. Adults have already accumulated knowledge and work experience&#xD;
      which can add to their learning experience. Most adult education is voluntary; therefore, the&#xD;
      participants are generally self-motivated. Furthermore, adults apply their knowledge in a&#xD;
      practical fashion to learn effectively. They must have a reasonable expectation that the&#xD;
      knowledge they gain will indeed help them further their goals [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing education (CE) of nurses is increasingly necessary to keep abreast of rapid&#xD;
      changes in patient care due to advancements in knowledge and technology, nurses also should&#xD;
      be well motivated to enroll in CE hospital activity to upgrade their professional skills and&#xD;
      knowledge to remain current in their professional practices and improve their ability to&#xD;
      serve the patients safely [11]. Clinical placements provide opportunities for nurses to learn&#xD;
      experientially. To create a constructive learning environment nursing staff, need to be&#xD;
      friendly, approachable, available and willing to learn. Also, CE should be providing adequate&#xD;
      opportunities for nurses to develop conﬁdence and competence in clinical skill with a focus&#xD;
      on nurses' learning needs rather than service needs of the facilities [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although nursing care has been changed significantly over the past 30 years, methods for&#xD;
      clinical training nurses have not [13]. A popular or traditional model for clinical teaching&#xD;
      of nurses, including but not limited to; integrating lectures, skills laboratory training and&#xD;
      supervised clinical experience. A benefit of this model is the opportunity to assist nurses&#xD;
      to integrate the concept learned in class or skill lab in patient care. Also, the instructor&#xD;
      can select clinical activities that best meet nurses' needs and are consistent with hospital&#xD;
      goals [14]. In addition, the low confidant nurses prefer this type of clinical teaching&#xD;
      because they feel more secure [15]. On the other side, the traditional model for clinical&#xD;
      teaching contributes to poor critical thinking and reasoning development among nurses and&#xD;
      results in task-oriented approaches to teaching and learning. Consequently, nurses may lack&#xD;
      the capacity to think through interventions that lead to positive patient outcomes [16].&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to find innovative approaches to effectively train nurses to&#xD;
      better prepare them for today's health care environment. These innovative approaches may&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the clinical nursing education system [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-directed learning (SDL) is one of these modern approaches of clinical learning, the&#xD;
      concept of SDL originates from the Adult Learning Theory. This theory suggests that adults&#xD;
      are pragmatic and problem-focused individuals whose learning are mainly affected by&#xD;
      experiential rather than passive approaches [17]. Self-directed learning was applied and&#xD;
      examined on nursing students as well as working nurses who are engaged in an on-going&#xD;
      continuing training [18]. Self-directed learning is a process in which the instructors play a&#xD;
      facilitating role while, learners actively participate in identifying their own learning&#xD;
      needs, learning goals, allocating resources &amp; decide whether learning method can be used, and&#xD;
      engaging in self-reflection &amp; evaluation. The positive outcomes of SDL including but not&#xD;
      limited to, greater self-control, self-confidence, autonomy, and lifelong learning skills&#xD;
      [17]. While, SDL may helpful, there is an increasing awareness that SDL is not universally&#xD;
      applicable to all learners and all situations. Also, the majority of nurses not familiar with&#xD;
      SDL approach of learning they preferred and felt more secure with traditional&#xD;
      teacher-centered approach as they usually learned in schools [19]. Self-directed learning can&#xD;
      be challenging, even for the brightest and most motivated nurses. Therefore, it should apply&#xD;
      in a systematic way to maximize the benefits. four key stages to apply SDL; being ready to&#xD;
      learn independently, setting learning goals, engaging in the learning process by&#xD;
      understanding themselves and their needs (the discrepancy between the present level of&#xD;
      competence and the required level of competency), and evaluating learning [20, 21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful independent study requires certain responsibilities or roles of both nurses and&#xD;
      instructor. It is useful for both to communicate as to whether each feels the other is&#xD;
      fulfilling their share of the responsibility. nurses' roles include; self-assess readiness to&#xD;
      learn, define your learning goals, monitor learning process, be self-motivated, re-evaluate&#xD;
      and alter goals as required, consult with instructor as required. While, instructors' roles;&#xD;
      Build a co-operative learning environment, help to motivate and direct the nurses' learning&#xD;
      experience, facilitate learning, be available for consultations as appropriate during the&#xD;
      learning process, serve as an advisor rather than a formal instructor [22]. In essence the&#xD;
      aim of this study will be examining the effect of Self-directed clinical learning model as&#xD;
      compared to the traditional models to improve nurses' Airway management competencies and&#xD;
      minimize airway related incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis H1: Critically care nurses who will approach self-directed clinical&#xD;
      learning model (μ1) will have a higher level of Airway management skills (μ2), (H1: μ1 &gt; μ2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Intensive care units who will approach self-directed clinical learning model to learn&#xD;
      their working nurses (μ1) will have a lower frequency of patients' airway-related incidents&#xD;
      (μ2), (H1: μ1 &lt; μ2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      True experimental, prospective, and comparative research design will be utilized in the&#xD;
      current study. The study will be conducting a nursing self-directed clinical learning model&#xD;
      as compared to the traditional models to improve nurses' Airway management competencies and&#xD;
      minimize patients' airway related incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An official permission to conduct the proposed study will be obtained from the ethical&#xD;
      committee. Also. Participation in the study is voluntary; each subject has the right to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study when he or she wants. Informed consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      subjects. Confidentiality and anonymity of the subjects are assured through coding of all&#xD;
      data; subjects will be assured that these data will not be reused in another research without&#xD;
      their permission, collected data will be used for the purpose of the research only and The&#xD;
      entire needed sample in the study will be followed until been analyzed. All information taken&#xD;
      will be protected and will not affect their annual appraisal by any mean. The formulated&#xD;
      database and the result of the current study will be raising the awareness of all health&#xD;
      professionals and incorporating in the future plan of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted through three phases; preparation &amp; designation, implementation,&#xD;
      and follow up &amp; evaluation phase. The preparation &amp; designation phase will be concerned with&#xD;
      taken the official permission and ethical approval. Also, it includes a recent review of&#xD;
      related literatures, and preparation of the different (constructed and adapted) study tools&#xD;
      and formulate the latest evidenced educational content and materials related to airway&#xD;
      nursing management. These tools and educational content will be revised by medical and&#xD;
      nursing expert to ensure its content validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the official permission and ethical approval are granted to proceed the proposed study,&#xD;
      the implementation phase will be applied in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st Part will be initiated by allocating the selected ICUs randomly into two paired&#xD;
      settings, one for applying traditional learning (control ICU) and the other for self-directed&#xD;
      learning experimentation (study ICU). the nurses who are working in selected ICUs and&#xD;
      correspond to the inclusion criteria, will be randomly distributed into two equal groups (30&#xD;
      nurses in each group). The nurses who are working in study ICU will be asked to fill out the&#xD;
      nurses' readiness assessment sheet to learn independently (tool 4). The nurses who will&#xD;
      demonstrate a high readiness score (&gt;80%) for independent learning will be included. if the&#xD;
      nurses number exceeding the intended number (30 nurses), the highest scores will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-directed clinical learning model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of Airway management will be nominated for participant nurses to be an area of&#xD;
      investigation. each nurse will be asked to fulfill the pre-structured Learning contract&#xD;
      between nurses and instructors within one week, the contract will include the following&#xD;
      items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Goals for the area of learning (the researcher will confirm the congruence with the&#xD;
           expected goals).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structure and sequence of activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timeline for completion of activities (maximum one month).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Details about resource materials for each goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feedback and evaluation as each goal is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meeting plan with the instructors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reflection and self-evaluation methods. the researchers will facilitate all nurses'&#xD;
           stated resources incorporation with hospital manager such as (Sill lab., computer lab.,&#xD;
           internet, hard books, digital books, clinical instructions, or Egyptian Knowledge Bank).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional clinical learning model It will concern the Airway management competencies; it&#xD;
      will be given within one month and it will take place during working hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the researcher will divide the participant (30 nurses) into two main groups (15 nurses&#xD;
           in each), each group will be given pre-scheduled integrated lectures related to&#xD;
           theoretical background of Airway management. Four lectures will be given once per-week,&#xD;
           2 hours long, written handouts will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After each driven lecture, the researcher will give a supportive four hours skill&#xD;
           laboratory training by traditional 2 stages, methods (&quot;see one, do one&quot;). This&#xD;
           traditional &quot;2-stage approach&quot; was standard for improving clinical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Then, the researchers will provide a clinical supervision and guidance for the&#xD;
           participant nurses to ensure that they will able to apply what they learned in real&#xD;
           settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once implantation is complete, the follow-up and evaluation phase will be initiated by daily&#xD;
      monitoring of the occurrence of patients' airway related incidents in both control and study&#xD;
      ICUs for a continuous three months (tool 3). Then, the nurses' knowledge and practices (in&#xD;
      the control group) will be evaluated two times, 1st time will be 1 month after the&#xD;
      implementation phase, and the second time will be after 3 months from the 1st evaluation (to&#xD;
      measure the retention of given education and training), tools (1, 2) will be utilized, and it&#xD;
      will be completed by blinded assessors (who were not part of the research team). On the other&#xD;
      side, the study group of self-directed learning will be self-evaluated by using tools (1, 2)&#xD;
      and also will be evaluated two times like control group. Finally, the researcher will compare&#xD;
      the results (outcome given by self-directed learning) to the collected baseline data (control&#xD;
      group) which will be given as usual ongoing traditional learning.&#xD;
