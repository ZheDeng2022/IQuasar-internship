    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment with either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is essential in patients with atrial fibrillation for&#xD;
      the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) a condition that happens when a blood clot&#xD;
      forms elsewhere in the body and travels through the blood stream to plug another vessel.&#xD;
      While there are significant number of real-world publications on the use and outcomes of&#xD;
      NOACs for stroke prevention, evidence from routine clinical practice on the use and outcomes&#xD;
      of reduced doses of NOACs is scarce. By evaluating routine clinical practice data from&#xD;
      national registers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, researchers want to gather&#xD;
      information about the safety and how well reduced doses of NOACs work in patients with&#xD;
      irregularly heartbeats which are not caused by a heart valve problem (non-valvular atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, NVAF). As a primary aim of this study, treatment with low doses of NOACs&#xD;
      (Xarelto [generic name rivaroxaban], Eliquis [generic name apixaban] or Pradaxa [generic name&#xD;
      dabigatran]) will be compared with VKAs (warfarin) in Nordic patients with NVAF to assess the&#xD;
      occurrence of stroke and systemic embolism [effectiveness]) and intracranial hemorrhage a&#xD;
      type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull [safety]).&#xD;
