  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the growth of hospice, older adults have the opportunity to receive home-based care&#xD;
      aimed at reducing suffering and focusing on quality of life at the end of life. While use of&#xD;
      technology and educational videos has yet to be fully developed, structured, and evaluated in&#xD;
      home hospice care, it has shown promise to improve care in other settings. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study aims to develop and evaluate a multi-component technology-based care intervention,&#xD;
      i.e., Improving Home hospice Management of End of life issues through technology (I-HoME),&#xD;
      that focuses on assessing and addressing patient symptoms and caregiver burden in the home&#xD;
      hospice setting through synchronous live video visits and educational videos. The aim of the&#xD;
      second phase of the project is to conduct a single armed (N=10 dyads) pilot study with a&#xD;
      focus on optimizing data collection protocols and the intervention before transitioning to a&#xD;
      randomized pilot study evaluating the feasibility and potential efficacy of I-HoME (N=50&#xD;
      dyads) compared to usual care (N=50 dyads).&#xD;
