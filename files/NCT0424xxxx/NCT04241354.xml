  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of one leukocyte-poor platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma (LP-PRP) injection to the intra-articular (IA) space in comparison to one LP-PRP&#xD;
      injection to the IA space with an additional injection into the surrounding extra-articular&#xD;
      (EA) structures for the treatment of hip OA (Kellgren Lawrence Grades 1-3). Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that patients receiving both IA and EA LP-PRP injections will have equivalent improvements on&#xD;
      HOOS JR and VAS scores over a 12-month period compared to those in the active comparator&#xD;
      group (IA LP-PRP injection).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel comprehensive approach through which the joint and its surrounding structures are&#xD;
      treated as an integrated system may offer a clinically superior treatment to hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) compared to only an intra-articular (IA) infiltration. The efficacy of&#xD;
      autologous leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma (LP-PRP) for the treatment of OA is a growing&#xD;
      area of regenerative orthopedic research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a LP-PRP treatment to both the IA space and EA&#xD;
      supporting capsular ligament and tendon structures provides a significant clinical benefit&#xD;
      when compared to an IA treatment alone. In this clinical study of 84 patients, both study&#xD;
      arms receive effective treatments that are supported by sound medical evidence, making this&#xD;
      an ethically strong model to address our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-site, randomized, comparative study of LP-PRP treatment into the IA space&#xD;
      versus the IA space and EA hip structures. This study is sponsored by Regenerative&#xD;
      Orthopedics and Sports Medicine (ROSM) and EmCyte Corporation. Patients who meet the study&#xD;
      criteria with at least mild pain as indicated by &gt;25/100 on a 100mm visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (Sanchez et al. 2011), or &lt;80/100 on HOOS JR with radiographic evidence of&#xD;
      Kellgren-Lawrence grades 1-3 hip OA will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation of PRP is a simple tissue fractionation using centrifugation with EmCyte&#xD;
      PurePRP Supraphysiologic SP kit [EmCyte Corp. Fort Myers FL]. Platelet quantification&#xD;
      analysis is performed using the Horiba ABX Micros ES 60 [Plymouth Medical]. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are indicated by overall hip pain severity by HOOS JR and VAS patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
