  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well progressive resistance training works in improving the physical&#xD;
      function of sarcoma survivors. Treatments for sarcoma can cause side effects such as fatigue,&#xD;
      muscle loss, and weakness, which can negatively impact a patient's ability to physically&#xD;
      function and enjoy an independent lifestyle. Engaging in a resistance training exercise&#xD;
      routine may improve physical function, body composition, and bone density of sarcoma&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of a home-based individualized progressive resistance&#xD;
      training (PRT) program in sarcoma survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess secondary measures of feasibility of a home-based, individualized PRT program in&#xD;
      sarcoma survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if a 3-month PRT program improves physical function in sarcoma survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if a 3 month resistance training program improves body composition and bone&#xD;
      mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a series of progressive resistance training exercises at home twice weekly&#xD;
      over 1 hour and receive instructional guidance from an exercise physiologist via&#xD;
      videoconferencing once per week during one of these sessions for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.&#xD;
