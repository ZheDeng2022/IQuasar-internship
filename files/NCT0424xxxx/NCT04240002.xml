  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase 1 portion (dose escalation) of the study will be to establish an&#xD;
      optimally safe and biologically active recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or to determine&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for gilteritinib in sequential combination with fludarabine,&#xD;
      cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The purpose of the phase 2&#xD;
      portion (dose expansion) is to determine complete remission (CR) rates and composite complete&#xD;
      remission (CRc) rates after two cycles of therapy. The study will also assess safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and toxicities of gilteritinib in combination with FLAG, evaluate FLT3&#xD;
      inhibition, assess pharmacokinetics (PK), perform serial measurements of minimal residual&#xD;
      disease, obtain preliminary estimates of 1-year event free survival (EFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) rate and assess the acceptability as well as palatability of the formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment. A participant completing 2 cycles in phase 1 or&#xD;
      2 will have the option to participate in long term treatment (LTT) with gilteritinib (for up&#xD;
      to 2 years).&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (phase 1/dose escalation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as any of the events meeting the DLT criteria that occur during the DLT observation period and that is considered to be possibly or probably related to gilteritinib.&#xD;
Nonhematologic Dose-limiting Toxicity will be defined as grade 3 or 4 clinically significant nonhematologic toxicity attributable to gilteritinib that persists for &gt; 48 hours without resolution to grade ≤ 2. Gilteritinib dosing will be interrupted if non-hematologic DLT occurs. Exceptions include the toxicities commonly seen with intensive AML reinduction regimens.&#xD;
Hematologic Dose-limiting Toxicity will be defined as failure to recover a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500/μL and non-transfusion dependent platelet count &gt; 20000/μL due to documented bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia for greater than or equal to 50 days from the start of cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
Failure to recover peripheral counts due to disease involvement of the bone marrow will not be considered dose-limiting toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Complete Remission (CR) rate after 2 cycles of therapy (phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days</time_frame>
    <description>CR rate is defined as the number of participants who achieve the best response of CR divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. Complete remission is defined as having bone marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells and achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state and must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 10^9/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and normal marrow differential with &lt; 5% blasts, and they will be red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independent (defined as 1 week without RBC transfusion and 1 week without platelet transfusion). There should be no evidence of extramedullary leukemia.</description>

    <measure>Composite complete remission (CRc) rate after 2 cycles of therapy (phase 2)</measure>

    <description>CRc rate is defined as the number of participants who achieve the best response of CRc (CR, CRp,or CRi) divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. Complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) is defined as achieving CR except for incomplete platelet recovery (&lt; 100 x 10^9/L) at a post baseline visit. Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) is defined as achieving CR except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual neutropenia &lt; 1 x 10^9/L with or without complete platelet recovery at a post baseline visit. Red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independence is not required.</description>

    <description>EFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of documented relapse (excluding relapse after PR), treatment failure or death, whichever occurs first. If a participant experiences relapse or death, the participant is defined as having EFS event related to either &quot;relapse&quot; or &quot;death&quot;, and the event date is the date of relapse or death.
