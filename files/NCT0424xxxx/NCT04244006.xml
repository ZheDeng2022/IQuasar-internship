  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no effective therapy for the management of Netherton Syndrome (NS)&#xD;
      Patients use emollients with a limited efficacy on scaling and no efficacy on skin&#xD;
      inflammation and pruritus. They may also use topical corticosteroids or calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitors in case of eczematous lesions. The use of therapies targeting skin inflammation&#xD;
      has been reported in a few case reports. Their efficacy is very limited and their uses are&#xD;
      limited because of the chronicity of the disease, the impaired skin barrier function and the&#xD;
      risk for skin infections and skin cancers. Therefore, there is a huge medical need for novel&#xD;
      therapies in NS.The expected consequences of this study are that a 16-week course of&#xD;
      dupilumab will be more effective than placebo for the treatment of moderate to severe NS&#xD;
      Dupilumab could therefore improve skin condition and quality of life.&#xD;

      This is a proof of concept (pilot) double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of NS. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive dupilumab (2 doses of 300 mg), or placebo, at baseline&#xD;
      and then 1 dose of dupilumab 300 mg, or placebo, every 2 weeks until week 14 (total of 8&#xD;
      administrations).Moderate to severe NS were selected in order to be able to measure the&#xD;
      improvement of skin condition.&#xD;
