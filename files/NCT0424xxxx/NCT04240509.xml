  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Several major studies have demonstrated the success of Truvada as pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV infection.The CDC guidelines recommend PrEP for people&#xD;
      who are at elevated risk of HIV including men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who use&#xD;
      injection drugs. People who are incarcerated bear a disproportionate of disease burden,&#xD;
      including HIV. Furthermore, men who have been involved with the criminal justice system are&#xD;
      more likely to engage in risky behaviors following their release, including condomless sex&#xD;
      with partners of unknown serostatus, and injection drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incarceration setting provides a place to engage men who may be at risk of HIV after they&#xD;
      are released.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following release, community clinics, including the STD clinic at The Miriam Hospital (TMH)&#xD;
      Immunology Center, that perform routine testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      diseases (STDs) may be ideal settings to engage vulnerable populations in care, including&#xD;
      PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the demonstrated clinical efficacy of PrEP in reducing HIV transmissions, few&#xD;
      clinical programs have piloted the use of PrEP in real-world settings, particularly criminal&#xD;
      justice settings. Furthermore, studies demonstrate numerous challenges to PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence, including a lack of access or discontinuing care. Engaging at risk men in PrEP&#xD;
      care before they leave prison and potentially lost to care during the transition may increase&#xD;
      uptake, adherence, and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study protocol will evaluate a clinical program that aims to prevent new HIV&#xD;
      infections among recently-incarcerated men using a once daily dosing of&#xD;
      tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This protocol presents&#xD;
      an overview of the clinical program, which uses standard-of-care clinical practices and&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing and monitoring&#xD;
      PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male inmates at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) will be screened for HIV&#xD;
      risk and, if eligible and interested, will be prescribed and given a one-month supply of PrEP&#xD;
      shortly before their release, and receive follow up care at The Miriam Hospital (TMH)&#xD;
      Immunology Center following their release.&#xD;
