      INTRODUCTION Trauma-affected refugees are at high risk of developing mental health problems&#xD;
      including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. In addition to traumatic&#xD;
      stress, refugees are furthermore subject to a range of post-migration stressors e.g.&#xD;
      unemployment, poor finances and language difficulties. These stressors can moderate or&#xD;
      exacerbate mental health outcomes in refugees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectoral collaboration and coordination of municipal social interventions and regional&#xD;
      mental health services are currently limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a psychosocial treatment with a&#xD;
      focus on social stressors in an integrated cross-sectoral collaboration with the municipality&#xD;
      for trauma-affected refugees&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS The study is being conducted at Competence Centre for Transcultural&#xD;
      Psychiatry (CTP) in Denmark. Included in the study are refugees with post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), who are unemployed and attending a municipal job centre in one of the five&#xD;
      collaborating municipalities. Approximately 200 patients will be included. The randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial is comparing treatment as usual (TAU) comprising 10 sessions with a medical&#xD;
      doctor (pharmacological treatment and psycho-education) and 16-21 sessions with a&#xD;
      psychologist (manual-based cognitive behavioural therapy) with add-on of the social&#xD;
      intervention. Overall, the intervention seeks to integrate working with social stressors&#xD;
      alongside treatment for trauma-related mental health problems. This is done in two ways; by a&#xD;
      cross-sectoral collaboration with municipality through collaborative meetings and by a&#xD;
      systematic focus on social stressors during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is functioning, measured by WHODAS 2.0 12 item version together with a&#xD;
      variety of secondary outcomes measuring mental health symptoms, quality of life and degree of&#xD;
      social stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS The study is expected to bring forward new perspectives and knowledge on psychosocial&#xD;
      treatment of trauma-affected refugees as well as cross-sectoral collaboration.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Treatment-seeking trauma-affected refugees possess a complexity involving past&#xD;
      trauma and ongoing social stressors, which challenges treatment of mental health problems.&#xD;
      There is therefore a great need for developing holistic cross-sectoral interventions, where&#xD;
      dealing with these complex challenges are integrated in treatment for trauma-related mental&#xD;
      health problems. This research gap has led to the present research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to examine a psychosocial intervention with an integrated&#xD;
      cross-sectoral collaboration for refugees with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) supplemented by a qualitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the RCT the objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the treatment effect of a psychosocial, cross-sectoral intervention on&#xD;
           outcomes of functioning, quality of life and mental health symptoms compared to&#xD;
           treatment as usual (TAU) at Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study social stressors as a predictor of severity of mental health symptoms, quality&#xD;
           of life and functioning at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine predictors for positive outcomes of treatment including social stressors as a&#xD;
           predictor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course of treatment and data collection will follow the SPIRIT statement&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT RECRUITMENT Patients can be referred to the clinic by any MD. A senior psychiatrist&#xD;
      at CTP assess all referrals, and based on the referral, patients are invited for an initial&#xD;
      assessment by an MD at CTP. If it is clear from the referral that the patient does not belong&#xD;
      to the clinic's target group, the patient is not invited for an assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously randomised trials in the CTP have included about 150 patients per year, and the&#xD;
      most recent project included 100 patients per year. In all trials 65-75 % of the patients&#xD;
      have completed the project. For the present trial the collaborating municipalities cover&#xD;
      about 80 % of the referred patients' municipal affiliation. Counteracting this, the&#xD;
      investigators expect more patients to be interested in participating in the present trial&#xD;
      compared to previous trials that have included psychopharmacological interventions. Therefore&#xD;
      approximately 200 project patients are deemed realistic within the given time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIAL ASSESSMENT The initial assessment is scheduled for all patients that are assessed to&#xD;
      be in the target group of CTP. The content of the assessment is not specific for this trial&#xD;
      but applies to all initial assessments at CTP. The initial assessment is planned as 2-4&#xD;
      sessions of approximately 45 minutes with an MD, resulting in a total of about two-three&#xD;
      hours assessment and consists of; recording of the trauma history, the migration process,&#xD;
      social situation, somatic and psychiatric medical history, as well as a clinical and&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment. Standardised diagnostic tools such as part of Schedules for Clinical&#xD;
      Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), the ICD-10 research criteria and the International&#xD;
      Trauma Interview (ITI) for ICD-11 section one (PTSD) will be applied in the interview.&#xD;
      Various instruments of symptom severity and functioning are completed as self- and observer&#xD;
      ratings. Oral and written information about the treatment and the trial is given. If the&#xD;
      patient fulfils eligibility criteria and consents to participate, the patient will be&#xD;
      randomised after the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION All patients will be randomised after a total of two to three-hour initial&#xD;
      assessment with an MD in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. An equal number of&#xD;
      patients are randomised in to the two groups (TAU and intervention). The actual randomisation&#xD;
      is carried out in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Stratification by the five&#xD;
      municipalities will be carried out before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING Blinding patients and practitioners are not assessed to be appropriate due to the&#xD;
      different nature of the treatment interventions. However, an intervention-group blinded&#xD;
      Hamilton (depression and anxiety) rating will be carried out at the beginning and at the end&#xD;
      of treatment. Hamilton-raters will be trained at the clinic and will take part in regular&#xD;
      joint ratings to ensure high quality and interrater reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessment and data analysis will be performed blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPRESENTATIVITY Patients have not been selected based on more specific criteria than&#xD;
      elsewhere in the treatment system and are therefore representative for the population at&#xD;
      other clinics treating trauma-related mental health problems in refugees. The results can&#xD;
      thus be generalised to other corresponding patient groups and are directly applicable in the&#xD;
      planning of treatment for this patient population in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL FIDELITY In order to determine trial fidelity, patient attendance will be registered&#xD;
      and after each consultation with an MD, psychologist or social counsellor, the topics&#xD;
      addressed will be registered, as well as the methods used during the consultation and whether&#xD;
      the patient has completed his/her exercises between sessions as planned. At each consultation&#xD;
      with an MD any changes in medication will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABILITY IN THE COURSE OF TREATMENT All patients will follow the predefined treatment&#xD;
      course as accurate as possible, but due to the pragmatic nature of the study there will&#xD;
      possibly be some variation in attendance and timing of meetings and sessions, as the patients&#xD;
      may become ill or for some other reason not show up for sessions or meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FREQUENCY OF RATINGS Patients will be asked to complete self-ratings several times during&#xD;
      treatment: at the diagnostic interview/assessment, transition between phase 1 and phase 2,&#xD;
      and at the end of the treatment course. Observer ratings and blinded Hamilton ratings will&#xD;
      take place at the beginning and end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, ratings will also be carried out at follow-up 6 months after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Data will only be collected at CTP and the municipalities are not involved in&#xD;
      any data collection or processing. After each session the clinicians will fill out the case&#xD;
      report form (CRF) in the research database through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).&#xD;
      All ratings will be carried out by a CTP practitioner (MD, psychologist or social&#xD;
      counsellor). Blinded observer Hamilton ratings will be carried out by medical students not&#xD;
      linked to the team of practitioners, but to an independent Hamilton rating team with thorough&#xD;
      training in using the Hamilton rating scale. In order to ensure quality and inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability, the members in the Hamilton team participate regularly in joint ratings under&#xD;
      the guidance of one of the senior psychiatrists at CTP (six joint ratings per year). The&#xD;
      investigator is overall responsible for the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SECURITY All data collected for this project will be protected according to the General&#xD;
      Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), Act on Processing of Personal Data as well&#xD;
      as the Danish Health Act. Information regarding the patients' health concerning trauma&#xD;
      history, the migration process, social situation, somatic and psychiatric medical history,&#xD;
      medicine, allergies, abuse of drugs or alcohol and ratings will be passed on from the patient&#xD;
      record to investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOURCE DATA All data registered about the patients will be kept as source data in the form of&#xD;
      original rating forms completed by the patients or practitioners, as well as structured&#xD;
      patient records. Data will be saved for 15 years after the trial has ended, which will be&#xD;
      stated in a letter of attorney signed by the patients. Case Report Form is source data, this&#xD;
      will be described in the source data document, which will be filed in the Trial Master File.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY ASSURANCE Quality control and quality assurance will follow regular procedures as&#xD;
      described in sections 3 and 4 of the Danish Executive Order on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).&#xD;
      The previous RCTs at CTP has been under GCP monitoring, but the GCP unit has assessed that&#xD;
      GCP monitoring is not necessary for the current trial as CTP is assessed to have high-quality&#xD;
      internal monitoring. The internal monitoring during the trial follows a manual and is carried&#xD;
      out by a team not directly involved in the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency through the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark. Managing and filing data will be in accordance with current guidelines for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manuals are used in sessions with all clinicians to establish shared standard procedures. In&#xD;
      order to ensure interrater reliability, all MDs will attend a SCAN course and regular joint&#xD;
      ratings including clinical assessment and observer-ratings will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATION A Minimal Clinically Important Difference score for the WHODAS 2.0 has not&#xD;
      yet been established. In the literature it has been difficult to find studies with&#xD;
      populations comparable to the present study. Based on clinical experience and the sparse&#xD;
      available literature a conservative Minimal Clinically Important Difference was taken to be 5&#xD;
      scale points on &quot;WHODAS 2.0 12-item version&quot; and within-groups SD was taken to be 10 scale&#xD;
      points. With a power level of 80 % and alpha 0.05 the investigators estimate a sample size of&#xD;
      each group of 64 and a total of 128. The completion rate in the preceding randomised trials&#xD;
      at CTP was two-thirds, and the investigators therefore set expected drop-out rate to 35 % for&#xD;
      this study. Therefore, the investigators increased the number of patients included to 128 x&#xD;
      (1/(100%-35%)) and consequently estimated a total sample size of 197 patients. Inclusion will&#xD;
      be stopped when approximately 197 patients have been included in the trial. It must be noted&#xD;
      that in the case that a Minimal Clinically Important Difference for WHODAS 2.0 is established&#xD;
      during the time frame of the trial, it will be considered in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DROP-OUT ANALYSIS Drop-out analysis is based on the patients who show up at the pre-treatment&#xD;
      assessment. The participant will be compared to the patients, who were excluded at the&#xD;
      initial assessment on several dimensions in order to identify possible systematic selection&#xD;
      bias. The participants included in the trial, but who eventually drop out and do not complete&#xD;
      the trial, will be analysed in an intention-to-treat analysis. In addition, completer&#xD;
      analyses will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROCESSING&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome variables are differences during the treatment course calculated as&#xD;
           differences between baseline and end of treatment ratings. The differences between the&#xD;
           two intervention groups can be measured with adjustment for baseline and stratification&#xD;
           variables by ANCOVA/linear regression and with multiple imputations to handle missing&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The role of social stressors as a predictor for baseline mental health symptom severity,&#xD;
           functioning and quality of life will be examined by linear regression with mental health&#xD;
           indices, respectively, as dependent variable and social factors as independent&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Potential predictors of outcome can be analysed by linear regression. A number of&#xD;
           analyses are planned with changes in outcome measures as dependent variables and&#xD;
           independent variables of social stressors including age, gender and other demographic&#xD;
           and baseline data in an attempt to isolate predictors of positive outcome.&#xD;
