  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study with a safety lead-in phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the isatuximab plus bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (VCD) combination is safe and highly effective even in those with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency (RI) from myeloma. In this study, we seek to improve the efficacy of VCD by&#xD;
      adding isatuximab in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem&#xD;
      cell transplant (ASCT) irrespective of renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine if the addition of isatuximab to VCD will increase the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects achieving very good partial response (VGPR), as defined by the&#xD;
      International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and by the time of completion of&#xD;
      post-ASCT consolidation treatment.&#xD;

                  of contraception are accepted:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and&#xD;
                       progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;

                       sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods). The use of double-barrier&#xD;
                       methods should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. Female&#xD;
                       condom and male condom should not be used together.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Male sterilization (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of&#xD;
                       the patient and that the sterilized partner has received medical assessment&#xD;

                       drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last&#xD;
                       dose of study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy), who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study&#xD;
                  treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through and&#xD;
                  through four months after the last dose of study drug(s) (female and male condoms&#xD;
                  should not be used together), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Agree to practice true abstinence during the entire study treatment period from&#xD;
                  the time of signing the informed consent through 16 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
                  study drug(s), when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and&#xD;
                  lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
