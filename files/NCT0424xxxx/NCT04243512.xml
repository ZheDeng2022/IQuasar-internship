    <textblock>
      In this study, the feasibility of delivering a time-restricted eating (TRE) intervention&#xD;
      among fatigued cancer survivors will be assessed. The participants will be asked to eat ad&#xD;
      libitum only within a self-selected 10-h window each day for 14 days. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      assess the adherence of the participants to the 10-h TRE intervention.&#xD;
