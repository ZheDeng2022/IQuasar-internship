  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is the most frequent motor deficiency in children. Among other, it can leads&#xD;
      to spastic diplegia or hemiplegia. Walking abilities is an important skill to the families'&#xD;
      point of view in term of independence in curent life. Improving the walking parameters has&#xD;
      been the main objective in several studies of rehabilitation. The G-EO system is a last&#xD;
      generation robot assisting gait training that can adjust cadence, walk lengh, ankle and hip&#xD;
      angles and other walking parameters to movement captation. Its superiority in terms of&#xD;
      walking abilities has been demonstrated in adults with stroke sequelae. Only one study was&#xD;
      realized in pediatric patients with spastic diplegia with promising results. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that intensive robot-assited gait training using the G-EO system in&#xD;
      hemiplegic children can improve their walking abilities.&#xD;

      Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate walking velocity with the GRAIL (gait real-time analysis and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemiplegic children aged from 4 to 18 years, with a GMFCS (Gross Motor Function&#xD;
      Classification System) score between I and III with lower limb involvement. Children must&#xD;
      walk alone with or without aid at least 10 meters, must have acquired sitting position, must&#xD;
      be able to understand simple orders to follow the rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No lower limb involvement, spasticity = 4 on the modified Ashworth scale, severe&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory disease forbidding the rehabilitation program, orthopedic surgery or&#xD;
      botulinic toxin injections in the last 6 months before the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study calendar:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starting inclusions: March 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental procedure: March 2020 to March 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analyses and synthesis: April 2021 to Dember 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata 13 software&#xD;
      (Stata-Corp, College Station, TX) by an experimented statistician (Bruno Pereira) working in&#xD;
      the university hospital of Clermont-Ferrand. A type-I error set at α=0.05 will be considered.&#xD;
      Monovariate and multivariate analyses considering age as a covariable will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations This study has already been presented at the local ethical committee&#xD;
      and will be presented in July 2019 at the national &quot; comité de protection des personnes &quot;.&#xD;
      Written informed consent from both parents will be collected at the inclusion. This study&#xD;
      will be in agreement with the declaration of Helsinki and the current regulations of clinical&#xD;
      trials. It will be declared on the internet site &quot;clinicaltrials.gov&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive robot-assisted gait training using the G-EO system may improve the walking&#xD;
      abilities in children with infantile hemiplegia and consequently improve their independence&#xD;
      and quality of life. Musculo-squeletal parameters and profile of cerebral activated areas&#xD;
      involved in praxia may also be modified by this intensive rehabilitation.&#xD;
