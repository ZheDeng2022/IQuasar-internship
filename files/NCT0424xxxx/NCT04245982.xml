      Objective: Diabetes and periodontitis are two chronic inflammatory diseases sharing specific&#xD;
      etiopathogenetic mechanisms, and both cause severe inflammation and destruction. The aim of&#xD;
      the present study was to determine the receptor expressions of Peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferative-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α, Vitamin D receptor&#xD;
      (VDR), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expressions in healthy gingiva and diseased&#xD;
      gingival samples with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 45 participants as 1; healthy controls (C), 2; periodontitis group (P), and 3;&#xD;
      diabetes and periodontitis group (DP) were enrolled. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI)&#xD;
      and clinical attachment levels (CAL) were recorded in all participants. Two gingival biopsies&#xD;
      from each participant were obtained, and one underwent histological tissue processing while&#xD;
      the other underwent RT-PCR analysis of nuclear receptors. Inflammatory and fibroblast cell&#xD;
      counts, PPAR-γ, RXR-α, and VDR were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Fibroblast cells were lowest in the DP group and highest in the healthy group.&#xD;
      PPAR-γ, VDR, RXR, and NF-κB expressions were higher in the healthy controls in the RT-PCR&#xD;
      analysis and similar in the other groups. Immunohistochemistry analysis also showed similar&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Results concluded that healthy gingival samples had higher PPAR-γ, RXR, VDR, and&#xD;
      NF-κB expressions, and the immunohistochemistry results also supported this finding. The&#xD;
      healthy gingiva contained higher fibroblast cells and lower inflammatory cells.&#xD;

      The present study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of Tokat Gaziosmanpasa University. The study was designed as a cross-sectional&#xD;
      clinical study and conducted at Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University Faculty of Dentistry&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and&#xD;
      detailed oral and radiological examination was performed by an experienced clinician&#xD;
      (H.B.Y.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-two participants, 14 participants in each group, were enrolled in the study. The study&#xD;
      groups were as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls (C, mean age 41.05±1.80, seven men, seven women) Periodontitis patients with&#xD;
      stage 3 grade B, (P, mean age 42.35±1.92, seven men, seven women) Patients with diabetes and&#xD;
      periodontitis with stage 3 grade C, (DP, mean age 41.09±1.28, seven men, seven women)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and healthy individuals went through a detailed oral examination, and&#xD;
      periodontal health and periodontitis diagnosis were based on the criteria defined by the&#xD;
      recent classification of periodontal health and diseases in the 2017 International World&#xD;
      Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were never smokers. Exclusion criteria were conditions which might affect&#xD;
      the inflammatory state, the existence of less than ten or over missing teeth, tobacco or any&#xD;
      drug use, presence of pregnancy or lactation, and existence of antibiotic or periodontal&#xD;
      therapy within previous six months. Diabetes patients in the present study had HbA1c values&#xD;
      greater than 7.0 even though they were under diabetic treatment. And the diabetic patients&#xD;
      who had HbA1c values below 7.0 were not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements Clinical parameters were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and&#xD;
      clinical attachment levels (CAL), and all analyses were performed before the biopsy&#xD;
      procedure. Full mouth measurements and the measurements of the relevant teeth were recorded&#xD;
      separately. CAL was measured from the cement-enamel junction to the bottom of the periodontal&#xD;
      pocket and Williams's type periodontal probe was used for measurements (Hu-Friedy Co.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). PI and GI measurements were performed via an explorer (Hu-Friedy Co.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). All analyses were performed from six points, three from buccal aspect and&#xD;
      three from the palatal aspect as mesial, middle, and distal sites for both teeth. A mean&#xD;
      value of six measurements was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Gingival Samples Gingival biopsies were obtained according to a protocol by a&#xD;
      previous study [22]. Two gingival biopsies were obtained from each participant. Gingival&#xD;
      sampling in periodontally healthy individuals was performed by crown lengthening procedure in&#xD;
      the routine treatment protocol or before orthodontically indicated tooth extraction. In the&#xD;
      periodontitis groups, biopsies were obtained from the inflamed gingival tissue with minor&#xD;
      surgical periodontal procedures. All biopsies were obtained from posterior maxillary teeth&#xD;
      (tooth #4, #5, #6 or #7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, local anesthesia was performed, and a gingival sample was dissected with a tissue&#xD;
      scissor from an area with requiring either gingivectomy/crown lengthening procedures from&#xD;
      patients with impaired gingival topography or before tooth extraction indicated for&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment in healthy individuals. As for the periodontitis patients, a gingival&#xD;
      sample was dissected using a tissue scissor during the scaling and root planning procedure&#xD;
      from the gingival areas with severe gingival inflammation. One gingival sample from each&#xD;
      participant was immediately placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours and&#xD;
      underwent histological tissue processing. The other samples of each participant were&#xD;
      immediately frozen at -80⁰C until the day of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological Evaluation All histological procedures were performed by an experienced&#xD;
      blinded researcher (F.G.). Gingival samples which underwent histological tissue processing&#xD;
      were first washed and cleansed from formalin and were dehydrated with alcohol series. Then&#xD;
      all tissues were cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin blocks. Each block sectioned&#xD;
      throughout as serial sections and three sections from each block were selected for&#xD;
      Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Fibroblast and inflammatory cell infiltration were&#xD;
      evaluated from H&amp;E stained slides under 1000x magnification via a light microscope .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For fibroblast and inflammatory cell evaluation, the gingival area at the connective tissue&#xD;
      border neighboring gingival epithelium was evaluated. A cell counting frame of 10.000 µm2&#xD;
      area was selected under 1000x magnification. The total inflammatory cells (neutrophil,&#xD;
      lymphocyte, eosinophil, and macrophage cells) within the frame were counted as inflammatory&#xD;
      cell counting. The fibroblasts were also counted likewise. The measurements were performed&#xD;
      from three different points, and the mean of these three measurements was recorded [23].&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPAR-γ, RXR-α, and VDR Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed as reported in&#xD;
      previous studies [23-26]. Three sections were chosen for each immunohistochemistry staining&#xD;
      from each participant. Firstly, all slides were deparaffinized and dehydrated with alcohol&#xD;
      series. After washing with distilled water, antigen retrieval was performed via sodium&#xD;
      citrate buﬀer (pH 6.0) for two h at 70°C, and then endogenous peroxidase activity was&#xD;
      suppressed with 3% hydrogen peroxide treatment. After hydrogen peroxide treatment, all slides&#xD;
      were incubated with normal rabbit serum for 30 min. After normal serum incubation, primary&#xD;
      antibody diluents were prepared and applied to the samples overnight at a humidified chamber&#xD;
      at 4⁰C. The primary antibodies were goat polyclonal anti-PPAR-γ antibody (1:250), anti-RXR-α&#xD;
      antibody (1:250), and anti-VDR antibody (1:250). After primary antibody incubation, all&#xD;
      slides were washed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) three times for five minutes (3x5)&#xD;
      and biotinylated immunoglobulin G was applied for 30 min. Again a wash of 3x5 PBS, all&#xD;
      samples were exposed to a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated reagent for another&#xD;
      30 min. After washed with 3x5 PBS, all sections were treated with AEC chromogen to visualize&#xD;
      staining. Counterstaining was performed with Meyer's hematoxylin, and sections were mounted.&#xD;
      After allowing dry for two days, samples were examined under 400x magnification using light&#xD;
      microscopy [23, 24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical semi-quantitative H SCORE Analysis Immunohistochemistry evaluation was&#xD;
      performed on three different areas in each section, and three sections were evaluated for&#xD;
      each patient. Nine measurements were performed for each participant. All cells were marked&#xD;
      according to their staining as no staining '0', low staining '1', mild staining '2', and&#xD;
      dense staining '3'. Staining scores were converted to a numeric value as 'H score' through a&#xD;
      formula (∑Pi(i+l)) which is a frequently used value for immunohistochemistry [23, 24]. In&#xD;
      this formula, i shows the staining intensity score and Pi: indicates the percentage of the&#xD;
      stained cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT-PCR Analysis The primers to be used for the genes were shown in table 1. The RNA isolation&#xD;
      and RT-PCR analysis performed according to a previous study [27]. Briefly, for RT-PCR&#xD;
      analysis, first gingival tissues were homogenized and subjected to sonication to reveal RNA&#xD;
      in the tissues and tissue supernatants were obtained. Then the supernatants were submitted to&#xD;
      the total mRNA isolation step. The tissues treated with Qiazole, then allowed to incubate in&#xD;
      the shaker for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, chloroform was added to the medium&#xD;
      containing the cells and incubation continued for 3 minutes at room temperature and then the&#xD;
      samples were centrifuged. At the end of the centrifuge, the supernatant at the top of the&#xD;
      tube transferred to another tube. Afterward, isopropanol was added to the supernatant and&#xD;
      incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, and the centrifugation step was repeated. At&#xD;
      the end of the centrifugation, the pellet deposited at the bottom was washed with 75%&#xD;
      ethanol, remaining supernatant was centrifuged again and suspended in pure, sterile water&#xD;
      without RNase. mRNAs were determined by spectrophotometric method. Then using the qRT-PCR&#xD;
      kit, one µg mRNA were transformed into single-step cDNA using specific primers targeting the&#xD;
      gene of interest, later the genes were identified with the help of qRT-PCR (Verso, Thermo&#xD;
      Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). The results were normalized to the β-actin control&#xD;
      gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The power of the study was over 85% based on a previous study with a&#xD;
      similar study design [25]. IBM SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. One Sample&#xD;
      K-S test was used to test the normality. For the fibroblast cell counts, inflammatory cell&#xD;
      counts, and CAL, One Way ANOVA followed by Tukey test used. For other parameters, Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests were used. Data were presented as mean ± SD or percentage&#xD;
      as appropriate. p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
