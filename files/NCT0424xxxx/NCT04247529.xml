  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many population-level public health strategies-including media campaigns and other behavioral&#xD;
      interventions, screening recommendations, and vaccination policies-rely on messaging to&#xD;
      promote cancer prevention and control. These strategies do not take place in a vacuum;&#xD;
      rather, they occur in the context of a broader public information environment, which is&#xD;
      increasingly characterized by conflicting and often controversial health information.&#xD;
      Although studies have documented that such information is prevalent, a critical question&#xD;
      remains unanswered: does exposure to conflicting health information in people's routine&#xD;
      interactions with the broader information environment threaten the success of message-based&#xD;
      population-level public health strategies? And, if so, who is most susceptible to the effects&#xD;
      of such exposure? This study will provide a rigorous empirical test of these critical&#xD;
      answered questions, guided by two specific aims: First, to evaluate whether prior exposure to&#xD;
      conflicting health information influences responses to subsequent unrelated and uncontested&#xD;
      health messages, a phenomenon that has been described as &quot;carryover effects&quot; (Primary Aim);&#xD;
      and second, to identify whether there are individual-level differences in how conflict&#xD;
      affects responses to these unrelated and uncontested health messages (Secondary Aim).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To accomplish these aims, an online survey-based experiment using a population-based sample&#xD;
      of U.S. adults (anticipated N=1,800) will be conducted. At 2 time points across a 28-day&#xD;
      period, participants will be exposed to news stories and social media posts about 6 health&#xD;
      topics: mammography screening, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, Vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation, carbohydrate consumption, alcohol consumption, and breastfeeding.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups that differ only in the amount of&#xD;
      conflict presented in these news and social media posts (conflict, no conflict). At a third&#xD;
      time point, after the exposure to conflict period, all participants will be exposed to 3 (out&#xD;
      of a possible 9) messages from existing health campaigns about 3 behaviors for which there is&#xD;
      scientific consensus: fruit and vegetable consumption, colorectal cancer screening, and&#xD;
      physical activity. To assess carryover effects (Primary Aim), participants' receptivity to&#xD;
      these messages-as measured through several affective and cognitive responses (e.g.,&#xD;
      confidence in the evidence presented)-will be measured. Message receptivity is expected to be&#xD;
      lower among those who were randomized to receive conflicting health information.&#xD;
      Individual-level differences in message receptivity are possible; thus exploratory analyses&#xD;
      (Secondary Aim) will be conducted to assess whether carryover effects of exposure to conflict&#xD;
      may be more pronounced among certain groups (e.g., those with greater trust in media sources,&#xD;
      those of lower socioeconomic position).&#xD;
