  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to elucidate the influence of fibre-based hydrogels differing in&#xD;
      their mechanical properties (characterized both instrumentally and sensorially) in terms of&#xD;
      low/ high lubricity on satiety, satiation and salivary biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An acute, randomized cross-over study that compares two types of fibre-based hydrogels&#xD;
      differing in their lubrication properties, resulting in different pastiness and instrumental&#xD;
      mechanical properties (lubricity). The gels are prepared using dietary fibres (kappa&#xD;
      carrageenan, alginate). Both hydrogels contain added watermelon flavor, food grade color and&#xD;
      sweetener. Water acts as a control and has the same flavor, color and sweetness to match the&#xD;
      hydrogels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked come to the laboratory on three occasions. Before participating, each&#xD;
      participant is screened for eligibility criteria using an online health screening&#xD;
      questionnaire and Three Factors Eating Questionnaire. Participants are offered one of the&#xD;
      three products (water or either of the two gels), the order of which is randomized and&#xD;
      counterbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are instructed to fast for 11 hours and to restrict from drinking alcohol for 24&#xD;
      hours before each session. In the first session, weight and height are measured. Participants&#xD;
      then provide baseline (- 5 minutes) appetite ratings on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
      After that they are given a standardized breakfast (females - 250kcal, males - 350 kcal).&#xD;
      Then, participants are asked to rate their appetite on a 100-mm VAS in every 30 minutes for&#xD;
      the next 2.5 hours. After that, they are given the preload - either hydrogels differing in&#xD;
      their structure complexity or water. After consuming the preload, appetite ratings are&#xD;
      recorded by the participants on three time points on 100-mm VAS. Ad libitum food is offered&#xD;
      as lunch after 30 minutes after ingesting the preload and the last VAS is taken. Food intake&#xD;
      is measured. Saliva is taken three times during each session after breakfast, before and&#xD;
      after preload consumption to measure protein, mucin content, amylase activity, and salivary&#xD;
      lubricity (tribology).&#xD;
