      A phase 2 open label study to evaluate safety and activity of Rituximab(HLX01) in combination&#xD;
      with Pegylated interferon α-2b in patients with newly diagnosed advanced indolent B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Indolent B-cell lymphomas (iBCL), including follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma&#xD;
      (MZL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL, including Waldenström macroglobulinemia), and some&#xD;
      cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), disproportionally affect older individuals.Treatment&#xD;
      options are heterogeneous, varying from watchful waiting to intensive combination therapy.&#xD;
      Historically, rituximab based regimens have been used as standard immunochemotherapy for&#xD;
      iBCL.Use of immunotherapy for indolent lymphoma had been advocated for many years and several&#xD;
      studies reported benefit with interferon (IFN) in combination with chemotherapy or rituximab.&#xD;
      The positive rate of HBsAg in B-cell NHL is about 30% in China.Pegylated interferon&#xD;
      contribute to convert HBsAg to negative. We aim to evaluate safety and activity of&#xD;
      Rituximab(HLX01) in combination with Pegylated interferon α-2b in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed advanced iBCL and HBsAg clearance rate of hepatitis B patients.&#xD;
