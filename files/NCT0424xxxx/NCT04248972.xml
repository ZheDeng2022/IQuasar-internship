  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of an integral and global treatment to improve the quality of life in those&#xD;
      with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is challenging, thus a whole body Photobiomodulation (PBM)&#xD;
      therapy program is proposed as an effective option.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      in a private care practice and randomized to receive either a whole body Photobiomodulation&#xD;
      (PBM) therapy program or placebo. Primary outcomes will be pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale;&#xD;
      Widespread Pain Index; Symptom Severity Score), functionality (Fibromyalgia Impact&#xD;
      Questionnaire; The Leisure Time Physical Activity Instrument), quality of soft tissue&#xD;
      (elastography) and central sensitisation (pain pressure threshold and the Autonomic Symptom&#xD;
      Profile). Secondary outcomes will be psychological factors (Pain Catastrophising scale, Tampa&#xD;
      Scale, Self-Efficacy questionnaire). Assessments will be at baseline, after treatment 6,&#xD;
      immediately following the last treatment (4 weeks), and then 2 weeks and at 3 monthly follow&#xD;
      up intervals to 6 months after completion of treatment.&#xD;

The FIQR total score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a greater impact of the condition on the person'slife.</description>
