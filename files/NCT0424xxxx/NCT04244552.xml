  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATRC-101-A01 is a Phase 1b, open-label dose escalation trial of ATRC-101, an engineered fully&#xD;
      human immunoglobulin G, subclass 1 (IgG1) antibody derived from a naturally occurring human&#xD;
      antibody. The safety, tolerability, PK, and biological activity of ATRC-101 will be&#xD;
      characterized when administered every two weeks (Q2W) or every 3 weeks (Q3W) as a monotherapy&#xD;
      or in combination with other anticancer agents.&#xD;

      For the ATRC-101 monotherapy cohorts, enrollment is restricted to adults with breast cancer&#xD;
      (BC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), ovarian cancer, and acral&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pembrolizumab combination therapy cohort, enrollment is restricted to adults with&#xD;
      NSCLC, CRC (only MSI-H or dMMR), melanoma (with the exception of uveal melanoma),&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), or urothelial carcinoma (UC), that have been treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and have progressed or have achieved stable disease and who, in the judgment of&#xD;
      their treating physicians, could benefit from the addition of ATRC-101 to improve or maintain&#xD;
      their response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PLD combination therapy cohort, enrollment is restricted to adult females with&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer that is platinum resistant, defined as progression during or within 6&#xD;
      months of the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy or BC that is refractory to other&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;
