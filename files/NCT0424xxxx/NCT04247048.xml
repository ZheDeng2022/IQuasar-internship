  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the relationship between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and PCSK9 (Proprotein&#xD;
      Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9) in humans with a kinetic study of lipoproteins in&#xD;
      patients with dramatic increase of Lp(a) and controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are independently associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Recently an unexpected and significant 15 to&#xD;
      30 % reduction of Lp(a) was reported with PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type&#xD;
      9) inhibitors. The relation between Lp(a) and PCSK9 are unclear and debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinetic studies of lipoprotein are an important tool to decipher the complexity of&#xD;
      apolipoprotein metabolism in human. The comparison of apoprotein(a) and PCSK9 kinetic&#xD;
      parameters of patients with extreme lipid disorder link to PCSK9 and apo(a) will allow to&#xD;
      better understand the impact of PCSK9 on apo(a). From one previous in vitro study, the&#xD;
      hypothesize is that PCSK9 increases the production rate and the assembly of Lp(a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to explore the relationship between the plasma concentration of PCSK9 and&#xD;
      apo(a) production rate as well as the impact on the catabolic rate. Patients with extreme&#xD;
      Lp(a) levels and healthy controls will be explored by performing a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      deuterated leucine for 14 hours. LC/MS-MS will be used to analyze the samples and kinetic&#xD;
      data of apo(a) and PCSK9 will be generated from a compartmental model. Tracer enrichment&#xD;
      analysis could be complicated for proteins with low plasma concentrations as PCSK9. This&#xD;
      issue will be solved with SPE and/or immune affinity concentration techniques.&#xD;
      Non-parametrical test and multivariate analysis will be use to describe the relationship&#xD;
      between these two variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide new knowledge on Lp(a) and PCSK9 metabolism and their interactions in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
