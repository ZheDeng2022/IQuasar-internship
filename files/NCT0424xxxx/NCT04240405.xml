  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Episodic Specificity Induction (ESI) is a short training that improves the production of&#xD;
      episodic details during autobiographical recall in young and elderly people without cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. But it remains to be determined 1) whether the mechanisms targeted by the ESI&#xD;
      affect memory or executive functioning and 2) whether amnestic type (aMCI) or dysexecutive&#xD;
      type (dMCI) mild cognitive impairment patients would benefit differently from this training,&#xD;
      which has never been tested. By comparing the effect of the ESI on these patients, this would&#xD;
      open up new perspectives for their symptomatic care.&#xD;

    <description>The participant sees 5 images evoking various events (e.g., a birthday, a restaurant) and describes for each one a related memory for 3 minutes. Each verbal production is recorded with a dictaphone, transcribed and then segmented into internal (episodic) or external (non-episodic) details according the coding procedure of Levine et al. (2002). The average number of internal details by autobiographical recall task is then calculated from these data.</description>

        This study looks at a population of adults between the ages of 55 and 85 and 3 types of&#xD;
        sample of subjects extracted from this population :&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 24 elderly people without cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 24 amnestic type mild cognitive impairment patients (aMCI)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has provided informed consent obtained in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is affiliated to a social security system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  speaks fluent French.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  is between 55 and 85 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the participants of the control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score equal to or greater than 26;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has neuropsychological assessment performance (RL/RI 16, D080, TMT, VOSP, Rey's&#xD;
             figure) in the norm according to his socio-professional category and age, i.e. less&#xD;
             than two deviating scores of -1 standard deviation or less than the 10th percentile&#xD;
             per function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients in the TCLa group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has at least two scores below the 10th percentile or below -1 standard deviation from&#xD;
             the norm on neuropsychological assessment tests that assess memory, based on its&#xD;
             socio-professional category and age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has less than two scores below the 10th percentile or less than -1 standard deviation&#xD;
             from the norm in neuropsychological assessment tests that assess other functions. This&#xD;
             is in accordance with the diagnostic criteria of Petersen (2004) and Jak and Bondi&#xD;
             (2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients in the TCLd group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has focal executive dysfunction expressed by at least two scores less than the 10th&#xD;
             percentile or less than -1 standard deviation from the norm in neuropsychological&#xD;
             assessment tests that assess executive functions (TMT, Stroop, verbal fluences, free&#xD;
             recall in memory), according to his socio-professional category and age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  has less than two scores below the 10th percentile or less than -1 standard deviation&#xD;
             from the norm on neuropsychological assessment tests that assess other functions&#xD;
             (except for free memory reminders and language fluences). This is in accordance with&#xD;
             the diagnostic criteria of Petersen (2004) and Jak and Bondi (2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
