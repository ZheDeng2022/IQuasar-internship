  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the outpatient rehabilitation clinic, therapists provide therapeutic interventions to&#xD;
      treat patients with various tendinopathies, including lateral and medial epicondylosis.&#xD;
      Current conservative treatment includes immobilization for forced rest of the inflamed&#xD;
      tendons and muscles, as well as mobilizations to focus stimulation of synovial fluid, provide&#xD;
      movement to nourish cartilage, promote periarticular extensibility, and provide sensory and&#xD;
      proprioceptive input. Musculoskeletal disorders can accompany both local and referred pain&#xD;
      patterns that need to be assessed and treated. When an acute trauma or repetitive&#xD;
      micro-trauma occurs, that may result in decreased range of motion and increased pain causing&#xD;
      the onset of weakness and function of the affected extremity. An alternative approach is&#xD;
      through the provision of Piezowave Myofascial Acoustic Compression Therapy (MyACT), which&#xD;
      provides mechanical stimuli delivery to improve circulation and provide relief of pain. The&#xD;
      focused sound waves produced by the Piezowave MyACT device are classified by a pressure&#xD;
      surge, which is followed by a drop in pressure and a brief negative pressure phase low&#xD;
      energy/low pressure application. It is this transformation of mechanical stimuli into&#xD;
      biochemical signals, or mechanotransduction, which yields the treatment of myofascial and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain. There is currently limited research to support the benefit in regards&#xD;
      to increased function and decreased pain when the Piezowave MyACT is used for the treatment&#xD;
      of lateral and medial epicondylosis. Of the limited research available, treatment with&#xD;
      non-invasive shock wave therapy, complications are low and effect is achieved in most cases&#xD;
      within three to five sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If Piezowave Myofascial Acoustic Compression Therapy (MyACT)) is applied as treatment for&#xD;
      symptoms of lateral and medical elbow tendinopathies, then the patient will experience&#xD;
      increased function demonstrated by Quick DASH (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand)&#xD;
      score and decreased pain demonstrated by subjective reporting on the numeric pain rating&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;

    <description>The Quick (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) score will assess participant report of function based on daily activities by creating an upper extremity functional score. There are 11 questions that ask the participant to rate their difficulty or limitations and pain in order to complete specific tasks. Each questions will ask the participant to select one of the five measures from no difficulty, not limited at all or none to unable, extreme and I can't sleep, with the latter of the measures indicating decreased upper extremity function. A maximum total score of 55 and minimum of 11.</description>
