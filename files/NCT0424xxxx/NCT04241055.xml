  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine whether a values affirmation intervention improves&#xD;
      teacher-student relationships, classroom performance, and well-being of first-year teachers.&#xD;

    <measure>Student-teacher relationships</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Teachers will complete a survey that includes a 4-item scale to assess the quality of their relationships with students (scale: 1=not at all true for me; 5=extremely true for me)&#xD;
I have a good relationship with my students.&#xD;
My students have a positive opinion of me.&#xD;
I feel comfortable interacting with my students.&#xD;
My students respect me.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Teacher well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Teachers will complete a survey that assesses their well-being. Average scores for the individual scales (below) will be computed. Scales will then be averaged to create a composite score. Due to space constraints, the full text of the scales is available on the project's OSF page at https://osf.io/ju5gh/.&#xD;
Burnout (7 items; scale: 1=not at all true for/of me, 5=very much true for/of me; reverse-scored for composite)&#xD;
Self-integrity (3 items; scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)&#xD;
Belonging (3 items; scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)&#xD;
Belonging uncertainty (2 items; scale: 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree) [reverse-scored for composite]&#xD;
Perceived stress (4 items; scale: 1=never, 5=very often) [reverse-scored for composite]</description>

    <measure>Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) - &quot;Instructional Support&quot; dimension</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To assess quality of teachers' instruction, we will use the &quot;instructional support&quot; dimension of the CLASS (https://curry.virginia.edu/classroom-assessment-scoring-system). Coding will be conducted by staff from the Relay Graduate School of Education or their designees.</description>

        teachers, particularly White first-year teachers at majority minority schools. Participants&#xD;
        who are not White first-year teachers will be permitted in the study, but will not be&#xD;
        included in confirmatory analyses.&#xD;
