  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While conventional cigarette use continues to decline among youth and young adults,&#xD;
      e-cigarette (EC) use is on the rise. The use of ECs during young adulthood, particularly 18&#xD;
      years of age, is especially alarming because it is not only a critical period in development&#xD;
      but also a time when tobacco use is established. Additionally, the tobacco industry targets&#xD;
      individuals of this age with the hope that they will one day progress to using combustible&#xD;
      cigarettes. Advertising may be one of the reasons leading young people to use ECs, and the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now has the authority to regulate EC advertisement&#xD;
      features. The goal of the study is to determine which EC ad features most strongly influence&#xD;
      young adults' attitudes, susceptibility, and intentions to use ECs. Fifteen ads from the most&#xD;
      popular EC brands that employ a brand, product descriptions, and modeling features were&#xD;
      selected. Young adults who are susceptible to EC use will come into the lab and view these&#xD;
      ads. During exposure, they will be assessed for real-time visual attention using&#xD;
      eye-tracking, orienting responses using heart rate, and arousal using skin conductance as&#xD;
      well as pre- and post-ad self-report measures of attitudes, susceptibility, and behavioral&#xD;
      intentions. These factors will help determine the most high impact features, which will be&#xD;
      associated with the greatest visual attention, orienting responses, and arousal levels and&#xD;
      changes in attitudes. Findings from this study will provide public health officials important&#xD;
      and urgently needed information as to what advertising features are contributing to the sharp&#xD;
      rise in the use of ECs among young adults.&#xD;
