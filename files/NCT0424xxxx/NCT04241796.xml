  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATHFINDER is a prospective, multi-center study in which approximately 6,200 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled. An investigational multi-cancer early detection test, developed by GRAIL,&#xD;
      will be ordered by and results returned to a study investigator. In cases with a &quot;signal&#xD;
      detected&quot; test result (with a predicted or indeterminate tissue of origin (TOO)), the&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up will not be dictated by the protocol, but will instead be coordinated by&#xD;
      the ordering and treating medical team at the enrolling sites based on the participant's&#xD;
      clinical condition, recommendations by each institution's clinical practices, and in&#xD;
      consultation with the study investigator and interdisciplinary care team, as necessary.&#xD;
      Additionally, proposed clinical care pathways, developed based on a review of guidelines from&#xD;
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American College of Radiology (ACR) and&#xD;
      other professional organizations, should be referenced by the medical team to determine the&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up. The number and types of diagnostic procedures required to achieve&#xD;
      diagnostic resolution will be assessed. Performance of multi-cancer early detection test will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Additionally, participant-reported outcomes will be collected at several time&#xD;
      points to assess participants' perceptions about the multi-cancer early detection test.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for approximately 12 months from the time of enrollment. Cancer&#xD;
      status will also be assessed at the 12 month time point.&#xD;
