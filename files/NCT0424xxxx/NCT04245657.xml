    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer type in women globally. In conjunction with the new&#xD;
      developments, breast cancer survival has increased therefore the management of long-term&#xD;
      complications has gained importance. Breast cancer survivors can face the loss of muscle&#xD;
      strength, increased fatigue and diminished physical function associated with&#xD;
      treatment-related long term effects and psychological affection and thereby reduced quality&#xD;
      of life. Upper extremity lymphedema or breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is one of the&#xD;
      most prominent long term complications which affects breast cancer survivors in many ways&#xD;
      after breast cancer surgery. It has been reported that breast cancer survivors with BCRL have&#xD;
      the lower muscle strength and more activity limitations when compared to the ones free of&#xD;
      BCRL. In BCRL, affected extremity has been found to 36% more weaker when compared to the&#xD;
      unaffected side. Fatigue is one of the most prominent symptoms when considering&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms in cancer survivors. It has been stated that increased fatigue is&#xD;
      correlated with increased activity limitation and deterioration in physical function. The&#xD;
      hand-grip test which is frequently used in the assessment of decreased muscle function has&#xD;
      been stated as a reliable and repeatable test in breast cancer survivors. In addition, this&#xD;
      test is frequently applicable to assess mortality, physical and functional capacity, symptoms&#xD;
      after surgery and to designate an exercise program. There are studies that investigate upper&#xD;
      extremity function associated with hang-grip strength in breast cancer survivors. Yet, there&#xD;
      is a lack of the objective result or conclusion of the BCRL effect on upper extremity&#xD;
      function which is assessed with hang-grip strength when compared without BCRL. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study is planned to investigate of cumulative effects of factors such as lymphedema&#xD;
      severity, age, fatigue, body mass index, muscle strength, physical activity level, pain&#xD;
      level, exercise benefits/barriers scale score on hand-grip strength related upper extremity&#xD;

      Investigation of the Factors of Hand-Grip Strength-related Upper Extremity Functionality in&#xD;
      Breast Cancer Survivors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer type in women globally. In the United States, there&#xD;
      are almost 3 million breast cancer cases and this number gradually increasing in recent&#xD;
      years. In conjunction with the new developments, breast cancer survival has increased&#xD;
      therefore the management of long-term complications has gained importance. Breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors can face the loss of muscle strength, increased fatigue and diminished physical&#xD;
      function associated with treatment-related long term effects and psychological affection and&#xD;
      thereby reduced quality of life. In addition to the reduced quality of life, breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors experience reduced and altered upper extremity function. The Data not only reported&#xD;
      by breast cancer survivors but also derived by objective assessment tools state that the high&#xD;
      prevalence of disrupted upper extremity function. Studies reported that the deterioration of&#xD;
      shoulder function and reduced strength and flexibility in the range of between 16% to 43%,&#xD;
      however, these parameters followed a stabile pattern within a year while some parameters&#xD;
      which are assessed relatively in short periods were found in higher prevalence. In addition&#xD;
      to these, reduced mobility of head and neck, perceived fatigue, reduced upper extremity&#xD;
      strength are factors that induce functional limitations in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper extremity lymphedema or breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is one of the most&#xD;
      prominent long term complications which affects breast cancer survivors in many ways after&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery. Lymphedema is characterized by the inability of the function of the&#xD;
      lymphatic system which can result in the accumulation of protein-rich lymphatic fluid in&#xD;
      interstitial spaces in addition to skin changes in related body regions and extremities.&#xD;
      Untreated lymphedema causes chronic inflammation, cellulitis, pain, fatigue, cosmetic&#xD;
      deformity, restriction in mobility and related problems and therefore ineffective usage of&#xD;
      the extremity concerning diminished functionality has occurred. It is known that the&#xD;
      esthetical concern and emotional stress manifested by lymphedema cause deterioration in&#xD;
      physical function. The heaviness feeling, fibrosis and skin infections caused by lymphedema&#xD;
      not only can increase psychological stress but also induce musculoskeletal complications in&#xD;
      the long term. It has been reported that breast cancer survivors with BCRL have the lower&#xD;
      muscle strength and more activity limitations when compared to the ones free of BCRL. In&#xD;
      BCRL, affected extremity has been found to 36% more weaker when compared to the unaffected&#xD;
      side. Through augmented severity and stage of lymphedema, reduced physical functions are&#xD;
      taken place in the clinical condition. Patients without BCRL can increase their cumulative&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problems by avoiding physical activity and exercise due to misguidance and&#xD;
      fear of lymphedema while the ones with BCRL have to fear the increased severity of lymphedema&#xD;
      by doing so. Lymphedema can bring with problems such as reduced physical activity and weight&#xD;
      gain thereby constitution of the basis of functional limitations is settled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased fat mass and body mass index are reported in the range of 50% to %96 in breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Optimal upper extremity function is important for maintaining an&#xD;
      independent daily life and day routines and to perform works that need physical strength in&#xD;
      terms of the general quality of life. However, affecting factors and incidence of their&#xD;
      impact on upper extremity function in the aspect of physical, functional and psychological&#xD;
      are still have been the research issue. The literature reports that the frequently reduced&#xD;
      muscle strength due to cancer-related symptoms along with the altered motor control in&#xD;
      shoulder and neck musculature. Fatigue is one of the most prominent symptoms when considering&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms in cancer survivors. It has been stated that increased fatigue is&#xD;
      correlated with increased activity limitation and deterioration in physical function. The&#xD;
      hand-grip test which is frequently used in the assessment of decreased muscle function has&#xD;
      been stated as a reliable and repeatable test in breast cancer survivors. Besides, this test&#xD;
      is frequently applicable to assess mortality, physical and functional capacity, symptoms&#xD;
      after surgery and to designate an exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies investigate upper extremity function associated with handgrip strength in breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Yet, there is a lack of the objective result or conclusion of the BCRL&#xD;
      effect on upper extremity function which is assessed with hang-grip strength when compared&#xD;
      without BCRL. Therefore, this study is planned to investigate of cumulative effects of&#xD;
      factors such as lymphedema severity, age, fatigue, body mass index, muscle strength, physical&#xD;
      activity level, pain level, exercise benefits/barriers scale score on hand-grip strength&#xD;
      related upper extremity functionality in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to investigate of cumulative effects of factors such as lymphedema&#xD;
      severity, age, fatigue, body mass index, muscle strength, physical activity level, pain&#xD;
      level, exercise benefits/barriers scale score on hand-grip strength related upper extremity&#xD;
      functionality in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which of the aforementioned parameters has the most prominent effect on hand-grip strength&#xD;
      related upper extremity functionality in breast cancer survivors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having reached to a targeted number of breast cancer survivors compatible with the incl/excl&#xD;
      criteria of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the pilot test result, elimination of parameters that are not significant in the&#xD;
      statistical model will be excluded and power analysis will be re-performed. If the current&#xD;
      number of the targeted population has been achieved (by achieving at least 80% power, 95%&#xD;
      CI), then the study will be finished to save time and resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center: Single-center study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time range: December 2019- October 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      109 women aged between 25 and 65 years who had unilateral breast cancer surgery will be&#xD;
      included in this study (Sample size was determined according to the 0.15 effect size, 80%&#xD;
      power, and 95% confidence interval). Within the context of this study, an evaluation form&#xD;
      that assesses demographic information (Both patient and clinical demographics such as Name,&#xD;
      age, contact information and/or body mass index, time spent after surgery, surgery type, etc)&#xD;
      will be requested to fill. Within this form, having lymphedema (yes/no), drug use (especially&#xD;
      tamoxifen, yes/no), pain assessment (via visual analog scale), adjuvant therapies&#xD;
      (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, yes/no, number of sessions, etc) and shoulder range of motion&#xD;
      assessment via goniometer will be evaluated and recorded to the assessment form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Dielectric Constant Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-tissue fluid proportion will be evaluated via Moisture Meter D (Delfin Technologies,&#xD;
      Kuopio, Finland) on both upper extremity (right and left) in predefined reference points on&#xD;
      volar side (6 cm distal and 8 cm proximal points from cubital crease, 10 cm inferior side&#xD;
      point from axilla and dorsal point of web space in the hand) by using four different probes&#xD;
      which can assess 0.5 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.5 mm and 5.0 mm depth. Values taken by 2.5 mm depth probe&#xD;
      will be used to calculate the ratio (affected side TDC value/Unaffected side TDC value) to&#xD;
      stage lymphedema severity along with the International Society of Lymphology staging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength Participants' muscle strength of shoulder flexion, abduction, and elbow&#xD;
      flexion will be assessed via Handheld digital dynamometer (Lafayette Manual Muscle Tester,&#xD;
      Model 01165, LaFayette Instruments, NY, USA). Both upper extremities will be assessed three&#xD;
      times and the average value will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-Grip Strength Handgrip strength will be assessed with LaFayette Professional Hand&#xD;
      Dynamometer, Model 5030L1, LaFayette Instruments, NY, USA). The standard position which can&#xD;
      be achieved by 90-degree elbow flexion, shoulder abducted, and hand mid-prone positioned;&#xD;
      90-degree shoulder abduction and 90-degree shoulder abduction positions will be used to&#xD;
      assess hang-grip strength. Three measurements will be requested and the maximum value of them&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Threshold Measurement The sensitive pain threshold and normal pain threshold will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a digital algometer (Wagner FDIX, Greenwich, USA) on reference points as&#xD;
      follows: C5-C6 zygapophyseal joints' lateral points, upper trapezius (proximal, middle and&#xD;
      distal lateral points, length measured by a tape from C7 Processus spinosus to acromion and&#xD;
      this length will be divided equally into three parts for proximal, middle and distal lateral&#xD;
      point), deltoid muscle (deltoid tuberosity), dorsum of the webspace. Measurements will te&#xD;
      took both for right and left upper extremity. Units will be recorded as kgf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scales and Forms There will be scales and form which are required to fill out by&#xD;
      participants. The following list of scales will be filled with participants themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This scale was intended to be filled to assess participants' physical activity levels within&#xD;
      the last seven days. Then, MET calculations will be done via a basic Excel Spreadsheet which&#xD;
      is pre-defined MET values formulated inside. Scale data then obtained according to the&#xD;
      participants' answers and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue Impact Scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This scale has 9 items that can be answered as &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; through &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;&#xD;
      by numbered as 1 and 7, respectively. Then total points will be calculated and divided into 9&#xD;
      to achieve the Fatigue Impact Scale score. The higher points will be indicated more perceived&#xD;
      fatigue, while lower points indicate less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Scale (DASH):&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASH has 30 items related to upper extremity function. Participants will be requested to&#xD;
      grade some expressions related to the function within a 5-point Likert scale as follows: &quot;No&#xD;
      difficulty: 1, Mild Difficulty:2, Moderate Difficulty: 3, Severe Difficulty: 4 and Unable to&#xD;
      perform: 5). The symptom score of the DASH will be calculated as dividing filled items total&#xD;
      score to filled items' number and minus one from this data then multiplying with 25. The&#xD;
      higher points indicate a deteriorated shoulder and hand function while lower points indicate&#xD;
      a better upper extremity function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Benefits/ Barriers Scale Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale has 43 items each can be&#xD;
      graded within a four-point Likert type scale. Barrier items are reverse coded. 43 items are&#xD;
      all related to exercise and exercise beliefs in both in the aspect of health and general.&#xD;
      Strongly disagree, disagree, agree, strongly agree will be scored as 1,2,3,4 or vice versa&#xD;
      whether the item should de reversely coded, respectively. Total scores ranged between 29 and&#xD;
      172. The barrier scale score is ranged between 14 and 56. The benefits scale is also ranged&#xD;
      between 29 and 116. The higher the score of Barriers scale, the greater the perception of&#xD;
      barriers to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck Depression Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck Depression Scale has 21 items each can be scored within 0 to 3. All items are related to&#xD;
      the depressive mood of a participant. The higher the score of the Beck Depression Scale, the&#xD;
      higher the depression level.&#xD;
