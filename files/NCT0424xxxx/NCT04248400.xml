  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal cognitive decline and&#xD;
      dementia. Individuals with MCI are having an impairment in cognitive function compared with&#xD;
      normal age-matched counterparts, while their cognitive function is still sufficient for their&#xD;
      daily function. The prevalent rate of MCI is ranging from 10% to 20%. Patients with MCI are&#xD;
      more susceptible to dementia with annual conversion rate between 5% and 20%. It is well-known&#xD;
      that dementia not only lead to devastating consequences to the patients and their&#xD;
      care-givers, but also immense healthcare and socioeconomic burdens. The growing prevalence of&#xD;
      MCI in our rapidly aging population warrants immediate action to identify effective&#xD;
      interventions to prevent progression of the cognitive impairment and its conversion to&#xD;
      dementia. Currently, there is no pharmaceutical treatment proven to be effective in&#xD;
      alleviating the cognitive decline in MCI patients. Nonetheless, previous researches have&#xD;
      demonstrated that mind activity, physical exercise and social engagement are all have&#xD;
      positive effects in alleviating the cognitive decline in MCI patients. Tai Chi is a&#xD;
      traditional form of Chinese mind-body exercise that consists of both physical exercise and&#xD;
      meditation component. Practicing Tai Chi can also facilitate social engagement as people&#xD;
      usually practice in group. Tai Chi is expected to be more acceptable to the older adults for&#xD;
      incorporating it with their daily life to preserve cognitive function, compared with&#xD;
      conventional physical activity modalities (e.g., running/jogging and gym-based resistance&#xD;
      training). Preliminary evidences suggest the potential of Tai Chi for alleviating cognitive&#xD;
      decline in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial is needed to conclude on the therapeutic use of Tai Chi before&#xD;
      it can be large-scale implemented at community level. This study seeks to extend previous&#xD;
      findings of the beneficial effects of Tai Chi on cognitive function in older adults with MCI&#xD;
      and examine the impact of Tai Chi training in protecting older adults with MCI from&#xD;
      developing dementia. This study also attempt to delineate the behind mechanism of Tai Chi on&#xD;
      alleviating cognitive decline by including measurements in neuroimaging and blood markers.&#xD;

    <description>Executive function will be trial making test. The participants will be asked to connect a number of dots according to particular sequence. The time needed for the participant to connect all dots will be recorded. The shorter time the participant needed to connect all dots correctly indicate the better executive function of the participant</description>

    <measure>Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Attention will be assessed by stroop test. During the test, participants need to read out the colour of dots or words. The time needed to correctly named all colour of dots/words will be recorded. The faster the participant finished the test indicate the better attention of the participant</description>

    <measure>Verbal fluency</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal fluency test assesses the language domain of cognitive function. Participants need to name animals/ vegetable/ fruits as much as positive in 1 minutes. The more the participant named, the better of their language ability</description>

    <measure>Digit span</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Working Memory will be assessed by digit span. Digit Span Forward requires the participants to repeat numbers in the same order as read by the assessors, and Digit Span Backward requires the participants to repeat the numbers in the reverse order of that presented by the assessors.</description>
