      The primary goal of this tissue collection protocol is to establish a framework for the&#xD;
      acquisition and banking of biospecimen collected from men undergoing brachytherapy. Biopsies&#xD;
      of the prostate is an invasive procedure; however, in this tissue collection protocol,&#xD;
      biopsies are acquired intraoperatively while patients are prepped for brachytherapy seed&#xD;
      placement, thus minimizing the inconvenience of the biopsy procedure for patients. The&#xD;
      utility of these biopsies will provide a valuable resource for molecular assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with metastatic prostate cancer who succumb to the disease are initially&#xD;
      diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, where treatment has the potential to be curative.&#xD;
      For men initially diagnosed with high risk or locally advanced prostate cancer, nearly 50%&#xD;
      develop recurrence after primary therapy and can eventually progress to life-threatening&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Combined androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with ionizing radiation (IR)&#xD;
      is the current mainstay of therapy for such men with high-risk prostate cancer. While it is&#xD;
      likely that undetected, microscopic disseminated disease leads to the inability to cure in&#xD;
      some men, there is also emerging evidence that escalating local therapy may still have&#xD;
      benefit. It has been reported that metastasis-free survival and overall survival were&#xD;
      significantly improved in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer treated with external&#xD;
      beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with brachytherapy boost compared to men treated with EBRT alone, or&#xD;
      with radical prostatectomy. The observation that enhanced IR-based local therapy could&#xD;
      improve outcomes supports the notion that it is not microscopic systemic disease alone that&#xD;
      leads to treatment failures of high-risk prostate cancer, but that more aggressive local&#xD;
      management could still play a significant role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key question in the management of high risk prostate cancer is how can the investigators&#xD;
      predict whether a patient with local or metastatic prostate cancer will have complete&#xD;
      response with current IR-based therapy paradigms, or if patients would benefit from more&#xD;
      aggressive dosing regimens despite a potential for increased adverse effects. A major&#xD;
      limitation to developing effective strategies for predicting treatment response to&#xD;
      conventional vs. more aggressive dosing regiments has been a paucity of tissues from patients&#xD;
      undergoing radiation therapy, including at baseline and during follow up, as well as a lack&#xD;
      of the molecular, cell biological, and biochemical states of the cancer and&#xD;
      microenvironmental cells in such tissues. The availability of such tissues and data can&#xD;
      accelerate the discovery process of identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      for patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the tissue microenvironment at base line and&#xD;
      following radiation therapy may inform improved strategies in radiation dosing, as well as&#xD;
      complementary neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments to achieve complete response in&#xD;
      organ-confined disease in the future. Such an understanding of the tissue and biological&#xD;
      response of prostate cancer to radiotherapy may also provide insights to enhance IR-based&#xD;
      therapy of metastatic and oligometastatic disease, for both palliative and perhaps&#xD;
      life-prolonging intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this tissue collection protocol is to establish a framework for the&#xD;
      acquisition and banking of biospecimen collected from men undergoing brachytherapy. Biopsy of&#xD;
      the prostate is an invasive procedure; however, in this tissue collection protocol, biopsies&#xD;
      are acquired intraoperatively while patients are prepped for brachytherapy seed placement,&#xD;
      thus minimizing the discomfort as well as the inconvenience of the biopsy procedure for&#xD;
      patients. A subset of these patients will choose to have a 2 year confirmatory biopsy to&#xD;
      detect the absence or persistence of disease. Biopsy cores collected 2 years post-IR therapy&#xD;
      will also be included in the investigators' correlative studies. These biopsies will provide&#xD;
      a valuable resource for molecular and pathological assessments. To extract the maximal amount&#xD;
      of information from these biopsy specimens, the investigators will utilize comprehensive&#xD;
      genomic, pathological, and biochemical analyses including DNA-seq, RNA-seq, methylome&#xD;
      analysis, single cell sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC)/immunofluorescence (IF). The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect and maintain a database of the clinicopathological parameters&#xD;
      and follow up information for these specimens. The biobank will thus represent a bank of&#xD;
      tissues as well as the correlative measurements on those tissues.&#xD;
