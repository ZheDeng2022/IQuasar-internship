    <textblock>
      This study evaluate Frailty syndrome (FS) as a common syndrome in patients with cirrhosis and&#xD;
      it is an independent predictor of hospitalizations, falls and mortality. Identifying,&#xD;
      treating and preventing FS can improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients&#xD;
      and reduce health costs.&#xD;

      Substudy I. The phase angle (PA) determined by electrical bioimpedance is an index of FS with&#xD;
      prognostic value in outpatients with cirrhosis, but its usefulness in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      has not been studied. Objective: To analyze the prognostic value of PA in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: 100 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis will&#xD;
      be consecutively included and PA will be determined by bioimpedance at admission. The&#xD;
      correlation between PA and liver function and frailty markers, and the evolution during&#xD;
      hospitalization, as well as the incidence of falls, hospitalizations and mortality during&#xD;
      follow-up will be analyzed. Substudy II. Given the multidimensional nature of the FS, we&#xD;
      propose a multifactorial non-pharmacological intervention based on evidence from previous&#xD;
      studies that could be implemented in daily clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate if a&#xD;
      multifactorial intervention can improve the FS and decrease the related events&#xD;
      (hospitalizations, falls and mortality) in patients with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: 150&#xD;
      outpatients with cirrhosis will be included and evaluated using the Liver Frailty Index.&#xD;
      Frail and pre-frail patients will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive&#xD;
      a multifactorial intervention, consisting of exercise at home, branched-chain amino acids and&#xD;
      multispecies probiotic for one year, and one control group. The evolution of the Liver&#xD;
      Frailty Index and other parameters (muscle and cognitive function, bioimpedance, risk of&#xD;
      falls, quality of life) and biomarkers (miostatin, immune response, microbiota) of FS, and&#xD;
      the incidence of hospitalizations, falls and mortality in both groups will be prospectively&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Physical exercise at home: At the beginning of the study, group sessions will be conducted with 5 patients of 1-hour duration, where they will be taught the individualized program according to their physical condition and they will be given the necessary material (pedaling, dumbbells and elastic bands) and paper support on the program, also using the Vivifrail method through infographics. The group session will be repeated every 3 months to check the compliance of the program by reviewing daily activity, evaluate possible problems and review the exercises. The program will consist of aerobic and anaerobic exercise by pedaling (cardiovascular resistance) and resistance exercises with dumbbells and elastic bands (muscular strength), flexibility training by stretching, and coordination and balance exercises. Patients will perform 3 sessions per week of 20-30 min. increasing progressively according to tolerance up to 45-60 min. each.</description>
