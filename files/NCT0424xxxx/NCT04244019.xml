  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis (BrM) develops in approximately 40% of cancer patients. Stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (SRS) is a form of radiotherapy that delivers high-dose per fraction to&#xD;
      individual lesions that is commonly used to treat BrM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radionecrosis (RN) is an adverse event that occurs in approximately 10 - 25% of patients 6 -&#xD;
      24 months after treatment with SRS. Tumour progression may also occur due to local failure of&#xD;
      treatment. Radionecrosis and tumour progression share very similar clinical features&#xD;
      including vomiting, nausea, and focal neurologic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radionecrosis and tumour progression also share overlapping imaging characteristics. Due to&#xD;
      their similarities, physicians need to perform a surgical resection to diagnose the&#xD;
      complication. By using a hybrid FLT-PET/MRI scan, the investigators propose that this&#xD;
      combination scan will provide robust data with which to differentiate between radionecrosis&#xD;
      and tumour progression without the need for surgery. The investigators plan to conduct a&#xD;
      single center feasibility study to investigate the potential in differentiating between SRS&#xD;
      and tumour progression in patients who have previously undergone SRS for BrM who are&#xD;
      suspected to have either RN or tumour progression using hybrid FLT-PET/MRI imaging.&#xD;

        Patients presenting after being treated with SRS with a new intracranial lesion with&#xD;
        clinical and radiographic findings suspicious for either radionecrosis or tumour&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously treated with SRS for BrM&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. New intracranial lesion with clinical and radiographic findings suspicious for either&#xD;
             RN or tumour progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Planned surgical resection of the lesion in question. The determination that the&#xD;
             lesion is appropriate for and requires surgical resection will be made by the&#xD;
             multi-disciplinary brain metastasis team. The surgery date does not need to be&#xD;
             established and the patient does not need to have consented in order to be eligible&#xD;
             for this study, however the imaging procedure will need to occur prior to the date of&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A negative serum pregnancy test within the two-week interval immediately prior to&#xD;
             PET-MRI imaging for women of child-bearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to provide written informed concern to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment volume&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active malignancy other than sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inability to remain supine for at least 60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Failure to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Contraindication for MRI as per current institutional guidelines&#xD;
