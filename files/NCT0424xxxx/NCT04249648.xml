  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) have transformed prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, diabetic nephropathy and chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease. However, in everyday clinical practice patients often receive suboptimal&#xD;
      doses of RAASi. The development of hyperkalaemia is one of the reasons for dose reduction or&#xD;
      complete withdrawal of RAASi and this in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Yet it remains unknown precisely how often hyperkalaemia leads to changes to RAASi&#xD;
      doses, if it is the sole reason, or whether this occurs in combination with other clinical&#xD;
      situations such as worsened renal function and hypotension. It is also unclear what&#xD;
      influences the decision-making process of healthcare professionals in managing patients with&#xD;
      hyperkalaemia who take RAASi and if this is influenced by specialty, experience or&#xD;
      indications for RAASi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve our understanding of the problem we are taking forward a research study&#xD;
      (made up of 3 complimentary studies). These data are needed to help achieve our ultimate goal&#xD;
      of improving the care of patients with prognostic indication for RAASi.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the incidence of hyperkalaemia following RAASi therapy initiation and&#xD;
           uptitration in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF including those with a new&#xD;
           diagnosis of post myocardial infarction (MI) left ventricular systolic dysfunction?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does it impact on RAASi prescription?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How does hyperkalaemia impact on RAASi therapy according to the clinical indication for&#xD;
           the drug(s) in an adult population of patients who are hospitalised or attending the&#xD;
           emergency department (and not receiving dialysis) with hyperkalaemia and receiving&#xD;
           RAASi?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At what level of hyperkalaemia do healthcare professionals consider making changes to&#xD;
           RAASi and does it vary according to the clinical indication for the drug(s)?&#xD;
