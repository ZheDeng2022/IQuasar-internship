  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this usability study is to pilot test the recruitment procedures, data&#xD;
      acquisition methods, and text message program integration required to support the planning of&#xD;
      a future clinical trial. Approximately 15 smokers who are patients of the Boston University&#xD;
      Goldman School of Dental Medicine (BUGSDM) patient treatment center and have an upcoming&#xD;
      dental prophylaxis or scaling and root planing (henceforth referred to as 'teeth cleaning')&#xD;
      appointment will be recruited. During the dental cleaning, participants will watch a brief&#xD;
      educational video that provides guidance and advice on smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the dental appointment, participants will complete a survey about their&#xD;
      experience watching the video and their attitudes towards smoking cessation. Participants&#xD;
      will also receive other smoking cessation resources with instructions on how to access the&#xD;
      services. Participants will then use the one-month text message program developed by the&#xD;
      investigators to motivate and facilitate contact with the smoking cessation resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the one-month text message program, participants will complete a survey about&#xD;
      their experience during the text message program, their smoking habits, and attitudes towards&#xD;
      smoking cessation. The duration of the study will be approximately six-weeks.&#xD;

          <title>Smoking Cessation Intervention</title>
          <description>At a dental cleaning visit, participants will watch a brief educational video that provides guidance and advice on smoking cessation. Participants will then interact with a text program for a month to motivate them to use smoking cessation resources. Participants will also be required to make contact with the resources in order to demonstrate feasibility of study flow.&#xD;
Educational video: One of two different 10 minute educational videos on smoking cessation will be viewed by participants during a dental cleaning visit. The video that is watched will depend on participants' level of motivation to quit and project needs&#xD;
Text-message program: A one-month text message program to motivate and facilitate contact with smoking cessation resources.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Of the 16 enrolled subjects, n=13 completed required pre-dental visit activities &amp; were scheduled to attend the clinic. Of the 13, n=4 completed the study (n=6 could not attend clinic due to Covid-19, state-mandated closure; n=2 canceled their dental appointment due to Covid-19 concerns; n=1 indicated inability to wear VR headset at the clinic). Thus, due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, this usability study was terminated early leading to small numbers of subjects completing the study.</limitations_and_caveats>
