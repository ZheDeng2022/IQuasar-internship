  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to shortage of local studies of the adherence of physicians to the guidelines for albumin&#xD;
      use among patients with liver cirrhosis so this study aims to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physicians' knowledge on the evidence-based indications for HA use supported by the&#xD;
           international guidelines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether HA is used in clinical conditions not supported by solid scientific evidence;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To formulate the evidence-based indications for HA use supported by the international&#xD;
           guidelines and to evaluate effect of distributing these evidence-based indications on&#xD;
           physicians' knowledge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In the last part of the previous century the increasing knowledge about the&#xD;
           cardiovascular abnormalities that occur in advanced cirrhosis led researchers to design&#xD;
           prospective randomized clinical trials assessing the effect of exogenous human albumin&#xD;
           (HA) based on its well-established capacity to act as plasma-expander.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Due to the positive results reported by those studies, international guidelines have&#xD;
           included the administration of HA among the recommendations for the prevention of&#xD;
           post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) or renal failure induced by spontaneous&#xD;
           bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatorenal syndrome&#xD;
           (HRS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indeed, all these complications are characterized by a substantial reduction of&#xD;
           effective volemia. However, even in these settings, questions regarding HA dosage and&#xD;
           whether or not all patients should be treated remain unanswered .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has now become evident that circulatory dysfunction and organ damage in patients with&#xD;
           decompensated cirrhosis are related to a chronic state of systemic inflammation and&#xD;
           oxidative stress, which can abruptly exacerbate in patients developing acute-on-chronic&#xD;
           liver failure (ACLF), a syndrome characterized by extra-hepatic organ failure and poor&#xD;
           short-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Besides colloid-osmotic power, HA is provided with many biological properties unrelated&#xD;
           to the regulation of fluid compartmentalization. Among these, some would assume&#xD;
           particular importance in relation to the inflammatory state of decompensated cirrhosis,&#xD;
           such as antioxidant and scavenging activities, binding and transport of many endogenous&#xD;
           and exogenous substances, and regulation of endothelial function and&#xD;
           inflammatory/immunological response .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore, due to both its oncotic and non-oncotic properties, HA may exert beneficial&#xD;
           effects at different steps of the cascade of the pathogenetic events that link&#xD;
           circulatory dysfunction to systemic inflammation, providing a novel pathophysiological&#xD;
           perspective for the use of HA. In this regard, two nationwide surveys on the use of HA&#xD;
           in patients with cirrhosis conducted in the United States and France aiming to assess&#xD;
           the adherence to the current AASLD and EASL guidelines respectively, have shown that HA&#xD;
           is also prescribed besides the evidence-based indications. Indeed, HA is not rarely&#xD;
           employed in non-SBP bacterial infections, severe hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia.&#xD;
