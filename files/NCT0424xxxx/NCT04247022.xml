  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted with a product for use in the intimate region in up to 75&#xD;
      research participants who will use the investigational product for 28 ± 2 days. Will be&#xD;
      evaluated and followed up throughout the study by a gynecologist to verify the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the product and possible adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the non-interference of a topical use product on the intimate area,&#xD;
      helping to preserve the natural defenses. In addition, the epithelial hydration and pH of the&#xD;
      intimate area will be evaluated.&#xD;

      74 female participants, 18 to 59 years of age, healthy with complaints of vaginal dryness.&#xD;
      The subjects will be submitted to gynecological evaluation in which pH measurements,&#xD;
      hydration measurements and bacterioscopic collection will be performed. Then they will be&#xD;
      guided to answer the questionnaires of Perceived Efficacy and Quality of Sexual Life. Next,&#xD;
      participants will receive the product for home use, under real conditions of use, for 28 ± 2&#xD;
      days. After 28 ± 2 days of use, subjects will return to the institute, and undergo further&#xD;
      evaluations with the gynecologist. New pH measurements, hydration measurements (chronometry),&#xD;
      bacterioscopic collection will be performed and the participants will answer the Perceived&#xD;
      Efficacy and Quality of Sexual Life questionnaires.&#xD;
