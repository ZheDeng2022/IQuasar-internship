  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TLL018 is developed for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis. The purposes of this study are (1) determining if and at what doses&#xD;
      TLL018 is safe and can be tolerated when administered to humans, (2) assessing what TLL018&#xD;
      does to the body and how the body responds to TLL018 when given as single and multiple doses,&#xD;
      and (3) assessing potential food effect on TLL018.&#xD;
