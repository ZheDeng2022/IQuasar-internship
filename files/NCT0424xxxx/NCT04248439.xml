  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell-based gene therapy for patients with Fanconi anemia, subtype A (FA-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cells from mobilized peripheral blood of patients with FA-A will be&#xD;
      transduced ex vivo (outside the body) with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene. After&#xD;
      transduction, the corrected stem cells will be infused intravenously back to the patient with&#xD;
      the goal of preventing bone marrow failure.&#xD;

      This is a pediatric open-label Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      hematopoietic gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a&#xD;
      lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene in subjects with FA-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enriched CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells will be transduced ex vivo with the therapeutic&#xD;
      lentiviral vector and infused via intravenous infusion following transduction without any&#xD;
      prior conditioning.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Fanconi anemia as diagnosed by chromosomal fragility assay of cultured lymphocytes in&#xD;
             the presence of DEB or a similar DNA-crosslinking agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients of the complementation group FA-A&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Minimum age: 1 year and a minimum weight of 8 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least 30 CD34+ cells/μL are determined in one bone marrow (BM) aspiration within 3&#xD;
             months prior to CD34+ cell collection OR (see subsequent criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If the number of CD34+ cells/ μL in BM is in the range of 10-29, peripheral blood (PB)&#xD;
             parameters should meet two of the three following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: ≥11g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutrophils: ≥900 cells/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: ≥60,000 cells/μL&#xD;
