    <textblock>
      Current studies on the mechanism of subacromial impingement and other shoulder pathology&#xD;
      reveal that multiple factors are responsible for impingement. These include serratus anterior&#xD;
      dysfunction, rotator cuff insufficiency, posterior capsular tightness, acromioclavicular&#xD;
      joint, thoracic spine stiffness and extensibility of the pectoralis minor and subclavius&#xD;
      muscles. Manual intervention should therefore address these issues in conjunction with the&#xD;
      other therapies. Novel interventions have been designed pilot tested for each of these&#xD;
      factors to produce a healing environment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of each individual factor and combination of all on the range of motion of shoulder&#xD;
      joint in healthy subjects and subjects with a restricted range of motion of shoulder joint&#xD;
      respectively. The subject will be allocated randomly into four groups with respect to&#xD;
      objective 1 and each of the groups will be evaluated as a quasi-experiment design&#xD;
      (pretest-posttest) for healthy each of 30 subjects. Beneficial intervention among the four&#xD;
      trials and other previously reported beneficial in improving the shoulder joint range will be&#xD;
      combined in and termed as pragmatic intervention protocols. Pragmatic interventions on&#xD;
      subjects with the restricted range in shoulder pathology will be tested through a similar&#xD;
      design. The effects of these interventions on the Quality of life measured through the Urdu&#xD;
      version of Shoulder pain and disability in subjects with shoulder pathology will also be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder disorders are the 3rd commonest among musculoskeletal conditions. Its prevalence is&#xD;
      estimated 7-26% at one point of time and 67% of the individuals experience shoulder pain once&#xD;
      in their life. Subacromial impingements (SAIS) are the frequent diagnosis accounting for&#xD;
      45-65% of all shoulder disorders. It is defined as &quot;a condition in which the tendons of the&#xD;
      rotator cuff muscles, long head of the biceps or the subacromial bursa are entrapped between&#xD;
      the humeral head inferiorly and anterior acromion superiorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple researchers have studied interventions which affect the shoulder range of motions.&#xD;
      Thoracic spine manipulation improves the shoulder range of motion. Similarly, Stretching the&#xD;
      pectorallis minor muscles improve shoulder kinematics. Manual intervention for subscapularis,&#xD;
      infra spinatus, and serratus anterior are non-existent to investigators' knowledge.&#xD;
      Modification to stretch the posterior capsule in a pragmatic manner is described and&#xD;
      recommended but trials are nonexistent. Acromioclavicular joint being the part of the&#xD;
      scapolo-glenohumeral complex has a role to play in the kinematics of the shoulder but trials&#xD;
      on its mobilization with respect to shoulder range of motion are not been studies. These gaps&#xD;
      in research in relation to understanding of the mechanism of shoulder pathology and&#xD;
      subsequent intervention are also identified but trials and interventions are non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The understanding of the complex relations of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors&#xD;
      necessitates the development of manual therapy interventions to address the factors which are&#xD;
      adversely affect range of motion of shoulder joint. The purpose of this research is to&#xD;
      develop and propose manual therapy interventions for shoulder joint which can effectively&#xD;
      address the limitations in shoulder joint ranges of motion in both healthy subjects and&#xD;
      subjects with shoulder pathology having decrease range of motion through a series of&#xD;
      primitive trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMES AND OBJECTIVES The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the short term effects&#xD;
      of Pragmatic manual interventions on range of motion of the shoulder joint in healthy&#xD;
      individual and individuals with shoulder pathology who have restricted ranges of motion .The&#xD;
      aims of this study are therefore to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effects of pragmatic interventions in healthy asymptomatic subjects with&#xD;
           respect to the changes in shoulder joint restricted range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effects of interventions in symptomatic shoulder individual with&#xD;
           restriction in their shoulder range of motion and short term change in the shoulder&#xD;
           related quality of life and pain MATERIAL AND METHOD A single group quasi-experimental&#xD;
           (pretest-posttest) design will be used for all the trials in this study. It will be&#xD;
           conducted at Helping Hand Institute of Rehabilitation Sciences, Mansehra. The study will&#xD;
           be composed of 4 trials in the first phase on healthy subject with respect to each of&#xD;
           the proposed pragmatic (novice) intervention consistent with the first objective and&#xD;
           exploratory in nature. Subjects will be randomly allocated to the initial four groups.&#xD;
           The initial 4 trials on healthy subjects are chosen since the effects of each of the&#xD;
           proposed pragmatic interventions is not been studied but advocated. Healthy subjects&#xD;
           with restriction in shoulder ROM are deemed appropriate since other confounding factors&#xD;
           such as pain is absent and objectives could be achieved. In Phase 2, trial on patient&#xD;
           with shoulder pathology will be conducted after evaluating the effects on range of&#xD;
           motion in healthy individual. Each trial will recruit 30 subjects. subjects in trial 5&#xD;
           with shoulder pathology will be assessed through Urdu version of shoulder pain and&#xD;
           disability index at baseline, after one week and 5 weeks of pragmatic interventions. A&#xD;
           sample size of 30 for each trial ( a total of 150 subject) is deemed appropriate after a&#xD;
           pilot trial on 5 healthy subject which produced a meaningful difference of 15 degree&#xD;
           change in abduction, and 3 cm difference in reaching up behind the back and using&#xD;
           standard deviation estimates from previous studies. Finally, The urdu translated and&#xD;
           validated version of SPADI will used to measure shoulder related pain and Disability.&#xD;
           Ethical approval will be sought from REC Isra university and Ethical committee of HHIRS.&#xD;
           Subjects consent will be taken in writing (annex 2) and full study information will be&#xD;
           given (annex 3). Each of Phase 1 and phase 2 of this study will be completed in 6 months&#xD;
           (a total of 1 year) from August 2019 to August 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE For healthy subject of the initial 4 trials, subjects willing&#xD;
      to participate will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each&#xD;
      participant for trial 5 with shoulder pathologies will be assessed thoroughly and screened&#xD;
      against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic information, information related to&#xD;
      history of the presenting complaint, past medical and surgical history, hobbies, occupation,&#xD;
      drug history and social history will be collected from all the eligible subjects in trial 5.&#xD;
      Additional information in relation to date of onset, behavior of symptoms, aggravating,&#xD;
      easing factors, previous treatment including injection and other surgical interventions,&#xD;
      relevant investigation will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed objective examination process will be followed for participants in trial 5.&#xD;
      Examination process will include inspection of the shoulders, cervical spine and thoracic&#xD;
      spine from the front, each side and back. Any abnormality seen will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspection will be followed by ruling out any pathology of the neck by asking the patient to&#xD;
      perform active neck rotation to each side, side flexion, extension and flexion and any pain,&#xD;
      discomfort and paraesthesia will be noted. These quick movements are assumed sufficient to&#xD;
      rule out any pathology of the neck. Neck movements will be followed by the active elevation&#xD;
      (flexion and abduction) of the shoulder joint and any pain, restriction in range and&#xD;
      willingness to movement will be noted. Active reaching behind the back will be performed and&#xD;
      any limitation in comparison with the asymptomatic side noted. Limitation will be measures&#xD;
      from the respective posterior superior iliac spine though measuring tape. Active elation of&#xD;
      the arm is followed by the passive movements of abduction, flexion, and medial rotation. Any&#xD;
      limitation of range, end feel and pain will be noted during each of the passive movement.&#xD;
      Active resisted movement of abduction, medial rotation, later rotation of shoulder and&#xD;
      flexion and extension of elbow are followed and strength/pain will be noted. The systematic&#xD;
      procedure of assessment followed from Cyriax and has been found highly reliable(39) and&#xD;
      assessment procedure including similar procedures Special test such as Neer's sign, Hawkin&#xD;
      kennedy test, scarf test, speed test, O'brien's test will be administered to determine SAIS.&#xD;
