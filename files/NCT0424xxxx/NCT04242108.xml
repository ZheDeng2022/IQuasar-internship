  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary angle closure diseases (PACD) are commonly seen in Asia. In clinical practice,&#xD;
      gonioscopy is the gold standard for angle width classification in PACD patietns. However,&#xD;
      gonioscopy is a contact examination and needs a long learning curve. Anterior segment optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a non-contact test which can obtain three dimensional images&#xD;
      of the anterior segment within seconds. Therefore, the investigators designed the study to&#xD;
      verify if AS-OCT based deep learning algorithm is able to detect the PACD subjects diagnosed&#xD;
      by gonioscopy.&#xD;

        The training and primary validation datasets were collected from the databases of&#xD;
        electronic medical and research records at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from September 1,&#xD;
        2016, to September 1, 2019. The external test dataset was obtained from the Singapore Eye&#xD;
        Research Institute (SERI), Singapore during June 2008 to November 2019, and the&#xD;
        Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH, Bangkok, Thailand)&#xD;
        from October, 2019 to April, 2020.&#xD;

        The inclusion criteria in the study were as follows: (1) All participants must be â‰¥ 18&#xD;
        years old; (2) Study subjects had a previous diagnosis of the ACA status (narrow or open,&#xD;
        PAS or non-PAS) based on gonioscopy, SS-OCT scans and medical history records. Exclusion&#xD;
        criteria of the data include: (1) poor compliance in receiving gonioscopy examination; (2)&#xD;
        unclear AS-OCT scans due to blinking or out of focus; (3) recent use of miotics within a&#xD;
        month; 4) secondary angle closure sue to subluxation or dislocation, uveitis, neovascular&#xD;
        glaucoma, et al.; 5) history of ocular surgery or laser iridotomy; 6) patients who&#xD;
        previously had an episode of primary angle closure (which was obtained on history by asking&#xD;
        the patients).&#xD;
