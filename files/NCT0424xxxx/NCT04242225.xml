  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The method of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) introduced in 2002 by Alain&#xD;
      Cribier et al. has offered new prospects for patients with severe aortic stenosis and&#xD;
      multiple comorbidities, who are at high operative risk(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PARTNER series of randomized controlled trials has firmly established the role of TAVI&#xD;
      with the balloon-expandable Edwards Sapien valve in patients with severe symptomatic aortic&#xD;
      stenosis (AS) at prohibitive risk of surgery (PARTNER IA), high risk for surgery (PARTNER&#xD;
      IB), and intermediate risk for surgery (PARTNER 2).(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also PARTNER 3 and Evolut Low Risk trial strongly suggest that TAVI is not only a suitable&#xD;
      alternative and may be superior to surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR) in low-risk&#xD;
      patients.(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accurate determination of the size of the implant is dependent on pre-procedural imaging.&#xD;
      Annular measurements are important in the TAVI as inaccurate estimation can lead to&#xD;
      complications e.g paravalvular leakage .(3) Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE),&#xD;
      transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been extensively studied with respect to pre-procedural&#xD;
      aortic annular sizing.(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, even with some of the evidence returning a discrepancy in annular measurements&#xD;
      between techniques, the literature to date does not clarify whether TOE undersizes&#xD;
      inappropriately or appropriately with respect to MDCT.(3) In a recent study, 29.5% of&#xD;
      patients would have been deemed ineligible for TAVI because of overestimation of annular&#xD;
      measurements by MDCT, a figure reduced to 1.3% with the use of TOE (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent small retrospective study, TOE, MDCT and MRI all performed comparatively well&#xD;
      with device sizing. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) dilatation before TAVI is considered a mandatory&#xD;
      procedural step in the early years of TAVR. BAV is used to confirm annular sizing and to&#xD;
      enhance trans-catheter heart valve (THV) deliverability.(6) However till now there is no&#xD;
      comparison of annular measurement by 2D transesophgeal echocardiography with balloon sizing.&#xD;

&#xD;
           Determinations of 2D TEE aortic annular and LVOT diameters were performed in the&#xD;
           3-chamber long-axis view at approximately the 120◦ angle during early systole . The&#xD;
           aortic annular diameter was measured from the junction of the aortic leaflet with the&#xD;
           septal endocardium to the junction of the leaflet with the mitral valve posteriorly,&#xD;
           using the inner edge to inner edge. The LVOT diameter was obtained 5 mm into the LVOT&#xD;
           from the level of the annulus.(10) Calculation of a cover index: defined as a 100 x&#xD;
           (prosthesis diameter - transoesophageal echocardiography annulus diameter)/prosthesis&#xD;

           catheterization laboratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Access route evaluation: assess peripheral vasculature for size, tortuosity,&#xD;
                calcification -Iliofemoral angiography: A 5F metric (graded) pigtail is used for&#xD;
                calibration and accurate determination of vessel calibre and minimal lumen&#xD;
                diameter. The pigtail is placed at the lumber 4/5 level, which approximates a&#xD;
                position just proximal to the common iliac bifurcation with injection of 15-20mls&#xD;
                contrast at 20mls/sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
                -Iliofemoral diameter: determined by Sheath-to-iliofemoral artery ratio (SIFAR) was&#xD;
                defined as sheath outer diameter divided by access-side vasculature diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
                -Iliofemoral calcification: Calcification can be evaluated on fluoroscopy and&#xD;
                graded as: none, mild (spotty), moderate (coalescing), severe (bulky, protruding,&#xD;
                horse-shoe, circumferential ). Iliofemoral tortuosity : determined by tortuosity&#xD;
                score which is defined as follows: 0 = no tortuosity; 1 = mild tortuosity (30° to&#xD;
                60°); 2 = moderate tortuosity (60° to 90°); and 3 = marked tortuosity (&gt;90°).(13)&#xD;
&#xD;
                -Subclavian or axillary angiography if femoral axis is unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Diagnostic coronary angiography: for assessment of presence and severity of&#xD;
                coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Aortogram: is done to asses for angle between LVOT and ascending aorta , distance&#xD;
                of coronary vessels from annulus and presence of aortic regurge.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  5F graded pigtail is placed into the non-coronary cusp (NCC) and an aortogram&#xD;
                     performed (20mls contrast at 20mls/sec). Fluoroscopic projection of RAO 30◦&#xD;
                     and LAO 30◦.&#xD;

&#xD;
             5. Hemodynamic assessment: assess invasive transaortic gradiant with simultaneous&#xD;
                pressure transduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pigtail will be crossed into the LV cavity, simultaneous measurement of&#xD;
                     pressures from the LV and femoral artery can be obtained. Use of a 5F pigtail&#xD;
                     enables simultaneous pressures to be transduced from the 6F femoral artery&#xD;
                     sheath without the need for a second arterial sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Left ventriculogram: assess EF by eyeballing (mild 40-50%,moderate 30-40% and&#xD;
                severe &lt;30%) and presence of MR according to seller criteria described later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Left ventriculography is done using 25ml contrast at rate 10ml/second in both RAO&#xD;
                30◦ and LAO 60◦&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Right heart catheterization: assess pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, Pulmonary&#xD;
                capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           TAVI procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The detailed steps of procedure are reported by Nijhoff F,etal. TAVI is performed&#xD;
           through transfemoral or transapical approach, based on the feasibility of the&#xD;
           iliofemoral anatomy and suitable access sites. All procedures are performed in a fully&#xD;
           equipped hybrid cardiac catheterization laboratory. Surgical cutdown is used to close&#xD;
           the vascular access site at the femoral arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluoroscopy is used to guide the deployment of the valves and prosthesis positioning.&#xD;
           Both predilatation of the native valve and prosthetic valve implantation are performed&#xD;
           during rapid right ventricular pacing (160 to 200 beats/min). Prosthesis position,&#xD;
           function, and coronary ostia patency are assessed with fluoroscopy and aortography .&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Balloon sizing: An appropriately sized valvuloplasty balloon is choiced .The initial&#xD;
           volume of inflation is set to obtain a balloon size of 1 mm less than the TEE&#xD;
           measurement. The balloon is positioned across the aortic valve through femoral sheath&#xD;
           and inflated with the same volume during rapid ventricular pacing, using a 30 cc&#xD;
           inflation syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At full inflation, an aortography is performed. The following parameters are recorded:&#xD;
           (I) presence of a waist on the balloon at the level of the annulus, (II) intra-balloon&#xD;
           pressure, (III) patency of the coronary artery ostia and their relations with the&#xD;
           displaced aortic valve cusps, (IV) presence and entity of aortic regurgitation on&#xD;
           aortography at full balloon inflation (&quot;para-balloon leak&quot;). In the absence of a waist&#xD;
           on the balloon and/or in case of major para-balloon leak, the procedure is repeated with&#xD;
           a larger diameter balloon (larger balloon or same balloon inflated with a larger volume&#xD;
           of contrast media).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assesment of inhospital outcomes after TAVI procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1- paravalvular leakage : Assessment of paravalvular leakage&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Angiographic evaluation of paravalvular leakage :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ten minutes after the deployment of the prosthetic valve, angiography of the aortic root&#xD;
           is performed to assess the severity of aortic regurgitation according to Sellers&#xD;
           criteria (14):&#xD;
&#xD;
           (0) no regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. only trace of contrast could be seen in the left ventricle, and it is cleared in&#xD;
                each systole.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. contrast filling the entire LV in diastole with less density compared with&#xD;
                opacification of the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. contrast filling the entire LV in diastole equal in density to the contrast&#xD;
                opacification of the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. contrast filling of the entire LV in diastole on the first beat with greater&#xD;
                density compared with the contrast opacification of the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two observers independently score the images. In case of discrepancy the images will be&#xD;
           re-evaluated and consensus will be reached by a third observer. .&#xD;
&#xD;
           2-Transthoracic Echocardiographic study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be evaluated after TAVI by pre-discharge transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography. The extent of PVL is assessed according to the main VARC criteria&#xD;
           (15):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semiquantitative parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta-pulsed wave : mild (Absent or&#xD;
                brief) ,moderate ( early diastolic Intermediate), severe (Prominent holodiastolic)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Circumferential extent of prosthetic valve paravalvular regurgitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (0) no regurgitation; (1) mild PVL is defined as&lt;10 % circumferential extent; (2)&#xD;
           moderate PVL was defined as [&gt;10 % but&lt;30 % of PVL and (3) severe PVL is defined as &gt;30&#xD;
           % according to the updated VARC guideline , that is the circumferential extent of PVL in&#xD;
           a parasternal short-axis view (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantitative parameters:&#xD;
