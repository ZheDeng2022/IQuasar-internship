  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, stratified, phase IIb clinical trial of ATRA&#xD;
      administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with laPDAC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomised to receive gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine +&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel + ATRA. Treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles. ATRA will be&#xD;
      administered for 6 cycles whereas gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel will be administered until&#xD;
      disease progression. Treatment may be discontinued earlier due to unacceptable toxicities or&#xD;
      death or because the patient requests to be withdrawn from study treatment. If treatment with&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is stopped prior to the patient completing 6 cycles of treatment&#xD;
      with ATRA (if allocated), the patient may continue on treatment with ATRA alone until the 6&#xD;
      cycles are completed, at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Received no prior systemic therapy for pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate haematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory&#xD;
             results obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l (without granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
                  factor support within 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;
                  first study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Haemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl (transfusion permitted to establish target haemoglobin&#xD;
                  levels prior to the first study treatment)&#xD;

                  levels ≤ 3 x ULN may be enrolled). Patients must be able to undergo biliary&#xD;
                  stenting if required before or, if required, during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. AST or ALT &lt;2.5 x ULN&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Female patients of child-bearing potential are eligible, provided they have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment,&#xD;
             preferably as close to the first dose as possible. All patients with reproductive&#xD;
             potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout&#xD;
             the treatment period and for 1 month after discontinuation of ATRA and / or&#xD;
             gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (whichever is the latest) and for 6 months after&#xD;
             discontinuation for male patients. Acceptable methods of contraception include IUD,&#xD;
             oral contraceptive, sub-dermal implant and double barrier (condom with a contraceptive&#xD;
             sponge or contraceptive pessary). Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (&quot;mini-pill&quot;)&#xD;
             are an inadequate method of contraception during treatment with ATRA. If patients are&#xD;
             taking this pill they should be instructed to stop and another form of contraceptive&#xD;
             should be prescribed instead.&#xD;
