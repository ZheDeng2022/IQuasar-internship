    <textblock>
      The purpose of the WWChild study is to determine the feasibility of assessing the potential&#xD;
      impact of parents attendance at WW on their child's weight status and weight related&#xD;
      behaviours. The feasibility study will randomly allocate 60 parent participants to either the&#xD;
      WW programme (formally Weight Watchers) or to a control arm. Data will be collected from both&#xD;
      parent and child at baseline and at three months to explore changes in weight status and&#xD;
      weight related behaviours.&#xD;

      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if it is possible to recruit parents who have a BMI ≥25 with children whose&#xD;
           BMI is over the 85th percentile and assess the recruitment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the acceptability and feasibility of collecting height and weight data from&#xD;
           both the parent and child during two assessment visits (baseline and follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore trends and variance in outcomes between treatment allocation to support the&#xD;
           utility of a future definitive trial and to develop a sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the acceptability and sensitivity of secondary outcome measures to evaluate&#xD;
           the potential impact of parental attendance at WW on weight related behaviours of the&#xD;
           family and child (eg. eating habits and physical activity levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To test the assumptions in the logic model through which parental participation is&#xD;
           assumed to impact on child outcomes (Programme Theory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WWChild is a randomised feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation, aiming to&#xD;
      recruit 60 participants. Participants will be recruited through advertising using relevant&#xD;
      channels that will target parents of children of primary school age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants will be registered and allocated to either 3 month programme with&#xD;
      WW or to a waiting list control arm. Participants initially randomised to the control arm&#xD;
      will receive free access to 3 month programme with WW after follow up data has been&#xD;
      collected. Children will not attend the WW sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of participants will take place at multiple time-points. The initial screen will be&#xD;
      conducted online by people who are interested in the study (self-referred). Those potentially&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria will be asked to contact researchers at the Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Research Unit by telephone or email, who will provide more information about the study and&#xD;
      re-assess eligibility. If potentially eligible and interested, they will be invited to a&#xD;
      baseline assessment visit, where eligibility will be confirmed, consent will be obtained,&#xD;
      participants will be registered and baseline data will be collected. Participants will also&#xD;
      be randomised at the end of this visit.&#xD;
