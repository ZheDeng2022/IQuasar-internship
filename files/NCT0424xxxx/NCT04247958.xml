  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of SureForm™ Staplers (60&#xD;
      and 45) for transection and/or creation of anastomosis during robotic-assisted colorectal&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center observational study to evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      SureForm™ Staplers during robotic-assisted resections of either ascending or transverse or&#xD;
      descending or sigmoid colon or rectum. Subjects with either a suspected or confirmed benign&#xD;
      or malignant disease of the colon and rectum who are scheduled to undergo a robotic-assisted&#xD;
      resection of the colon or rectum will be asked to provide informed consent for their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at one institution with two surgeons performing the colorectal&#xD;
      procedures. The surgeons will be using either the da Vinci Xi or X Surgical System which ever&#xD;
      they use as per their standard of care for the colorectal procedure. Stapling will be&#xD;
      performed with SureForm™ Staplers and any of the reloads as per the surgeon's standard of&#xD;
      care for the transection and/or creation of anastomosis during robotic-assisted colorectal&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
