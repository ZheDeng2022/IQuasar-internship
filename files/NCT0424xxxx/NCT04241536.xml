    <textblock>
      The global aim of this project is to expand the knowledge on the multifactorial pathogenesis&#xD;
      of AMD. In addition to age, the multifactorial pathogenesis of AMD includes environmental and&#xD;
      genetic risk factors. However, how these interact to promote progression remains largely&#xD;
      unknown. AMD is a progressive retinal disease characterized by mostly asymptomatic early&#xD;
      phases and progression to potentially blinding late forms (choroidal neovascularization or&#xD;
      geographic atrophy). Individuals vary in their rate of progression, with some remaining&#xD;
      stable for years. The reasons behind this variability, as well as the triggers and mechanisms&#xD;
      of AMD progression, are not well understood. Currently, the standard of care for assessment&#xD;
      of the risk of progression is solely based on fundus appearance, and is limited in its&#xD;
      prediction ability. Our previous work showed that metabolomics enables the identification of&#xD;
      specific plasma metabolomic profiles in AMD, which vary with the severity stages. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the plasma and urinary metabolomic profile of subjects who&#xD;
      progress over a five-year period (progressors) is distinct from those who remain at the same&#xD;
      AMD severity stage (non-progressors). In this proposal, the investigators will follow our&#xD;
      existing cohort over five years, comparing the metabolomic profiles of progressors to&#xD;
      non-progressors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of adult blindness in developed&#xD;
      countries and the third cause of global blindness. It is an eye-ageing disease with&#xD;
      tremendous impact in daily quality of life. Clinically, AMD is a progressive disease, which&#xD;
      evolves from early to late stages - geographic atrophy (GA) or choroidal neovascularization&#xD;
      (CNV). GA has currently no treatment and CNV requires several costly intravitreal injections.&#xD;
      Patients with late stages of AMD represent a huge economic burden to society, with enormous&#xD;
      medical and non-medical costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting progression is therefore of utmost importance. It is established that AMD&#xD;
      progression has a multifactorial nature, combining phenotypic and several environmental and&#xD;
      genetic risk factors. Attempts have been made to include the different risk-factors in&#xD;
      theoretical predicting models, however they are not practical on the clinical setting and&#xD;
      fail to explain biological interactions. Thus, in the current clinical practice, risk&#xD;
      prediction is still being assessed on a phenotypic basis, not considering AMD multifactorial&#xD;
      nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new approach that may allow the integration of all AMD interacting factors is metabolomics,&#xD;
      the simultaneous multiparametric measurement of metabolic changes in living organisms as a&#xD;
      response to perturbation (disease, diet, environment, others). The value of metabolomics in&#xD;
      medical research has become clear through several studies on cancer, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      and Alzheimer disease (AD), the latter sharing common pathways with AMD, as well as by&#xD;
      increasing investments in this area. The metabolome reflects the occurring biochemical&#xD;
      processes, therefore forming a fingerprint of the organism's health status, at a given time,&#xD;
      which can be measured through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and/or mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (MS). The research team's previous work showed that metabolomics can be a&#xD;
      powerful tool to study AMD as well, enabling the identification of specific plasma&#xD;
      metabolomic profiles in AMD, which vary with the severity stages, and are primarily lipid&#xD;
      metabolites linked to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid pathways, as well as purines The&#xD;
      current study will further elucidate the role of metabolomics in the understanding of AMD,&#xD;
      and will also identify potential biologically robust biomarkers that can address the problem&#xD;
      of predicting progression. The investigators hypothesize that the plasma and urinary&#xD;
      metabolomic profile of subjects who progress over a five-year period (progressors) is&#xD;
      distinct from those who remain at the same AMD severity stage (non-progressors). Based on our&#xD;
      preliminary data, The investigators hypothesize that a panel of metabolites will distinguish&#xD;
      these two groups (progressors vs non-progressors), and that this will mostly consist of&#xD;
      lipids and amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these purposes, subjects who participated in our group's previous prospective&#xD;
      study on AMD metabolomics will be recruited. Eligible subjects will be all that participated&#xD;
      in the the IN654 study (between January 2015 and July 2016). These will be recalled and&#xD;
      progression will be phenotypically assessed, thus defining the AMD-progressors and&#xD;
      non-progressors groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic signatures of AMD progression and disease will lay the path for the future&#xD;
      definition of progression metabolic biomarkers, which can represent a rapid, reliable and&#xD;
      potentially affordable methodology for progression prediction. Overall, this approach should&#xD;
      offer an opportunity to identify new valuable supplemental tools for routine clinical&#xD;
      evaluation. This will allow medical interventions based on preventive strategies to reduce&#xD;
      progression to blindness stages, which will, ultimately, also reduce societal costs of AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data The researh team pioneered the application of metabolomics to the study of&#xD;
      AMD across all stages, and, in 2015, the AIBILI team recruited and collected baseline data on&#xD;
      a total of 295 subjects (242 AMD patients and 53 controls). This study cohort will be derived&#xD;
      from that study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have published extensively on the hypothesis that metabolomic profiles&#xD;
      differ across AMD stages. The latest paper, which includes the entire study population,&#xD;
      meta-analyses to combine data from different cohorts was used. This paper provides additional&#xD;
      evidence that patients with AMD present an altered plasma metabolomic profile as compared to&#xD;
      controls, and that these profiles vary with disease severity. Results revealed that 28&#xD;
      metabolites differed significantly between AMD patients versus controls (false discovery rate&#xD;
      (FDR) q-value: 4.1 x 10-2 - 1.8 x 10-5), and 67 across disease stages (FDR q-value: 4.5 x&#xD;
      10-2 - 1.7 x 10-4). Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of glycerophospholipid,&#xD;
      purine, taurine and hypotaurine, and nitrogen metabolism (p-value &lt; 0.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the performance of models considering metabolite information, receiving operating&#xD;
      curve (ROC) assessments were made. Both a model considering metabolite changes across disease&#xD;
      stages (AUC = 0.815; 95% CI:0.771-0.860) and a model comparing patients with AMD versus&#xD;
      controls (AUC = 0.789; 95% CI: 0.738-0.840) outperformed (p-value = 3.74 x 10-6 and p-value =&#xD;
      2.07 x 10-4, respectively) a more classical model considering demographic covariates alone&#xD;
      (AUC = 0.725; 95% CI: 0.671-0.779) This is evidence that metabolomics can be a useful tool&#xD;
      for longitudinal study of AMD progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General research design Five-years after the first AMD metabolomic study, all participants&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be invited to come to AIBILI to perform the study procedures, which&#xD;
      include color fundus photographs (CFP), SD-OCT and swept source OCT (SS-OCT). Additionally,&#xD;
      they will also be invited to answer a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)19 and a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their regular physical activity. Systemic comorbidities and current&#xD;
      medication will be registered. Blood and urine samples will be collected for metabolomic&#xD;
      profiling. Functional testing with microperimetry and dark adaptation will be offered as an&#xD;
      additional optional study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the obtained CFP will be graded. According to the procedures for IN654 study&#xD;
      classification, all CFP will be standardized using software developed by our group. Two&#xD;
      independent graders, masked to any other data, will assess AMD staging of all eyes, according&#xD;
      to the AREDS classification.21 Each eye of patients will be assessed separately, and if&#xD;
      different, the most advanced eye will be considered as the classification for that subject.&#xD;
      Previously performed IN654 study classification will be compared. Progressors will be defined&#xD;
      as patients who: (i) had originally been classified as early AMD, and at five years have&#xD;
      intermediate or late AMD; (ii) had originally been classified as intermediate AMD and have at&#xD;
      five years late AMD. Non-progressors will be defined as those who remain within the same AMD&#xD;
      stage at the five-year visit.&#xD;
