    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study for health care product safety assessment. The research will be&#xD;
      conducted with 92 subjects, aged 18 to 59 years. The product will be applied on the right&#xD;
      and/or left back of the research participants for 3 consecutive weeks. After 10 days, will&#xD;
      have another application of the same product, which will be removed in 48 hours. Medical&#xD;
      evaluation will be available throughout the study to assess possible adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to observe the effects of the application of the product on the&#xD;
      skin and prove the absence of irritability and/or allergy.&#xD;

      92 subjects, aged 18 to 59 years, phototypes I to IV (according to Fitzpatrick&#xD;
      classification). The patch test will be used to verify the absence of primary and cumulative&#xD;
      dermal irritation reactions and sensitization allergic reactions by the investigational&#xD;
      products. The products will be applied as they are over semi-occlusive dressings.&#xD;
