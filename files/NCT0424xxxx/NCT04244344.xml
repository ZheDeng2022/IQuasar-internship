  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fall is an event which results in a person coming to rest unwittingly on the floor or&#xD;
      ground or other lower level. Those who have fall history have significantly more&#xD;
      hospitalizations and clinical visits as well as emergency department visits than those who do&#xD;
      not. Loss of confidence in walking, fear of falling, social isolation and depression can also&#xD;
      occur in those patients. Fall is a predictor for decreased functional status and risk factor&#xD;
      for the whole institution Approximately 30% to 40% of people aged 65 years and older who&#xD;
      lived in the community fall each year. Multiple studies related to falls have shown a close&#xD;
      relation between sex and age. As a result, Elderlies who are prone to falling consume more&#xD;
      health care resources than non-fallers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATIFY proved to be more accurate and more frequently utilized. STRATIFY was originally&#xD;
      derived in mixed acute/rehabilitation geriatric wards of UK urban teaching hospital using a&#xD;
      'case control' design and multi-variate regression to identify predictors of falls in&#xD;
      hospital inpatients. This resulted in a simple five-point score (each item scoring 1 or 0),&#xD;
      with predictive &quot;cut-offs&quot; as 2 or 3 used in the original validation studies which followed.&#xD;
      STRATIFY was not designed or validated for continuous modelling of risk but for use in&#xD;
      categorical prediction 'high' versus 'low risk'. Sensitivity and specificity were both found&#xD;
      to be in excess of 80% in the two UK cohort of the original paper, leading to wide spread&#xD;
      adoption of the tool in clinical practice. It is now ten years since the publication of the&#xD;
      original STRATIFY paper and a number of prospective studies in several cohort of patients&#xD;
      have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Propose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effectiveness of the fall preventing intervention after targeted group is&#xD;
           screened by the tool &quot;STRATIFY&quot; in triage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To look at the discrepancy of fall perception of patient/caregiver and the assessment&#xD;
           result using &quot;STRATIFY&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the fall rate after applying the screening tool &quot;STRATIFY&quot; and with&#xD;
           intervention given in their AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is hypothesized that the effectiveness score collected from patient and/or caregivers&#xD;
           via questionnaires within data collection period shows positive result and these&#xD;
           measures are worth to execute in A&amp;E.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is hypothesized that there may not be a big discrepancy of fall perception of&#xD;
           caregivers with the result of assessment tool and there is a discrepancy of fall&#xD;
           perception of fall perception of patients as they may over-estimate their ability&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It is hypothesized that the fall rate of intervention group will be lower than that of&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of fall incident which is properly documented and reported to AIRS after using fall&#xD;
      screening tool &quot;STRATIFY&quot; and intervention given will be the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of fall incident of usual practice in a designated period will be the control group.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective two-center observational study Data collection Frequency: Cross-sectional&#xD;
      Sampling Design: convenience sampling Sampling Tool: Assessment forms &amp; Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment started from 1/2020 to 3/2020. Geriatric Attendance were extracted from&#xD;
      the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in the period of 1/2019 to 3/2019 and&#xD;
      1/2020 to 3/2020 Numbers of fall cases were extracted from AIRS system. Setting: KWH A&amp;E and&#xD;
      PWH A&amp;E (different cluster)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and sample size For a 95% confidence interval with width=0.3, the expected sample&#xD;
      size is at least 267 subjects needed to be recruited based on the rule of thumb that SD =&#xD;
      range/4. In this study, approximately 300 subjects will be recruited (~150 from Kwong Wah&#xD;
      Hospital and ~150 from Prince of Wales Hospital) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse investigators will be assigned to different duty by Duty in-charge in each shift. First&#xD;
      of all, the research nurse will screen the case with inclusion and exclusion criteria. After&#xD;
      that, investigators will approach to the target group, 10mins will be given to the target&#xD;
      group to consider whether to participate in the study or not. Once the target group decided&#xD;
      to participate in the research, fall risk of targeted patients will be screened by using&#xD;
      &quot;STRATIFY&quot; fall risk assessment tool at triage by investigators. Patient will be screened&#xD;
      into 2 groups, either at risk (score≥2) or not at risk (score&lt;2). Nursing intervention&#xD;
      includes fall signage, fall bracelet, instruction card will be provided to high risk group&#xD;
      (score≥2). Questionnaires will be distributed to the target groups to collect their opinions&#xD;
      towards the screening tool and the intervention upon they were discharged or admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content Validity The content validity of patient/caregiver effectiveness score questionnaire&#xD;
      and instruction card will be established by a panel of eight including one geriatric nursing&#xD;
      consultant, one emergency nursing consultant, two emergency medicine specialists and four&#xD;
      advanced practice nurses from two A&amp;Es. They will review the questionnaire and all&#xD;
      suggestions will be incorporated into the final version of the questionnaire. Ten lay persons&#xD;
      will be invited to complete the questionnaire to examine the readability to general public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Withdrawal of subjects Nurse investigator will be assigned to different duty by&#xD;
      Duty in-charge in each shift. First of all, the research nurse will screen the case with&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. After that, investigators will approach to the target&#xD;
      group, 20mins will be given to the target group to consider whether to participate in the&#xD;
      study or not. Once the target group decided to participate in the research, fall risk of&#xD;
      targeted patients will be screened by using STRATIFY at triage by investigators. Patient will&#xD;
      be screened into 2 groups, either at risk (score≥2) or not at risk (score&lt;2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing interventions Fall signage, fall bracelet, instruction card will be provided to high&#xD;
      risk group. Patients of high risk group will be positioned close to the nurse's station. For&#xD;
      high risk patients, nurse should ensure that the bed is at the lowest height, the brakes are&#xD;
      locked and the patient's belongings are within reach. Questionnaires will be distributed to&#xD;
      the target groups to collect their opinions towards the screening tool and the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient aged 65years old or above Caregiver aged 18years old or above and has cared patient&#xD;

      read and listen Cantonese/English Triage category 1&amp;2 cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness score of the fall preventing intervention collected from patient and/or&#xD;
      caregivers via questionnaires within data collection period (Questionnaire Q2 &amp; Q4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discrepancy of fall perception of patient/caregiver to STRATIFY screening tool&#xD;
      (Questionnaire Q1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of fall cases in A&amp;E of PWH and KWH which are properly documented and reported to&#xD;

      Method of Data Analysis The effectiveness score collected from patient and/or caregivers via&#xD;
      questionnaires within data collection period (Questionnaire Q1-3) will be presented using&#xD;
      descriptive method. The confidence intervals, correlation will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discrepancy of fall perception of patient/caregiver to STRATIFY screening tool&#xD;
      (Questionnaire Q4) is analyzed by constructing CI which estimates the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      who do not know they are high risk but they actually are.&#xD;
