  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Ontario, rheumatology services are in short supply. Many people with inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis (IA) are traveling long distances for care and face geographical/ financial&#xD;
      challenges in so doing. Travel burden may be decreased and satisfaction with care improved by&#xD;
      integrating existing health care resources. A few rheumatologists in Ontario have adopted a&#xD;
      video conferencing (VC) model for follow-up of stable IA patients using the Ontario&#xD;
      Telemedicine Network (OTN) with Extended Role Practitioners (ERPs) doing on-site assessments.&#xD;
      Anecdotal evidence suggests this model benefits both patient and rheumatologist. We will&#xD;
      determine how people with stable well-controlled IA, living more than 100 km round-trip from&#xD;
      the rheumatology clinic, perceive quality of life before, during and after VC with ERP&#xD;
      follow-up visits compared to usual care. Disease activity, functional status, medication&#xD;
      adherence, patient satisfaction, and barriers to care will also be measured.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: To determine, using a mixed-methods design, the impact of a rheumatology&#xD;
      appointment via video conferencing combined with on-site pre-assessment by an Advance&#xD;
      Clinician Practioner in Arthritis Care (ACPAC)-trained ERP compared to usual in-clinic care&#xD;
      during a one-year period of follow-up for a cohort of persons with stable, well-controlled&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis residing in areas of low rheumatology supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions: For people with stable IA residing in areas of low rheumatology supply,&#xD;
      is it feasible to provide follow-up to people with stable, well-controlled IA using&#xD;
      videoconferencing and an assessment by an extended role practitioner? Does VC with ERP&#xD;
      pre-assessment change quality of life and barriers to care perceived by people with stable,&#xD;
      well-controlled IA?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Mixed-methods design. Randomized controlled trial with 2 groups: VC with ERP&#xD;
      (VC-ERP) and usual care (UC). Pre- and Post-trial Interviews. Study procedures will be as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-trial Interview - 15 minute telephone interview that will be audio taped. Will take&#xD;
           place no more than one month before baseline study visit. Participant will be asked&#xD;
           about experience traveling to rheumatologist and barriers to receiving care closer to&#xD;
           home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline visit - This visit will be a regularly scheduled appointment with the&#xD;
           participant's rheumatologist. The participant will complete a package of four&#xD;
           questionnaires and the rheumatologist will assess disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization - after completion of the baseline visit, participants will be randomized&#xD;
           either to VC-ERP or UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up Visits - There will be three follow-up visits 6, 12, and 13 months after the&#xD;
           baseline study visit. Participants assigned to UC will be seen by their rheumatologist&#xD;
           at the clinic as usual for all visits. At each visit, the participant wil complete a&#xD;
           package of four questionnaires and the rheumatologist will assess disease activity.&#xD;
           Participants assigned to VC-ERP will have their first two follow-up visits at an OTN&#xD;
           site. There they will complete a package of four questionnaires, meet with the ERP for&#xD;
           an assessment of disease activity, then connect with their rheumatologist by video&#xD;
           conference. The final visit will take place in the rheumatologist's office, where the&#xD;
           patient will complete a package of four questionnaires and the rheumatologist will&#xD;
           assess disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-trial interview - 15 minute telephone interview that will be audio taped. Will take&#xD;
           place no more than one month after final follow-up visit. Participants assigned to UC,&#xD;
           will be asked the same questions as first interview. Participants assigned to VC-ERP,&#xD;
           will be asked questions about their experience with the therapist and OTN during the&#xD;
           study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: From perspective of people with stable, well-controlled IA, we will understand&#xD;
      the barriers they perceive when travelling for rheumatology care far from their communities&#xD;
      and whether this new model of care might help to mitigate some of that burden. This model&#xD;
      already exists in Ontario and it's important to understand its value to people with stable IA&#xD;
      and determine whether it is good use of an extended role practitioner's time.&#xD;
