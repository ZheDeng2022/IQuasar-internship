  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure (AKI) is defined by a deterioration of kidney function over a short&#xD;
      period. This definition was clarified recently in order to allow homogenization and optimal&#xD;
      comparison of patients in clinical studies by the classifications RIFLE in 2004, AKIN in 2007&#xD;
      and KDIGO in 2013. These classifications decline several stages of ARI through the increase&#xD;
      in the plasma creatinine level and the decrease in urine flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though AKI is a frequent pathology in all hospitalized patients, there are only few&#xD;
      studies that are interested in this entity in conventional hospital services except intensive&#xD;
      care or intensive care. Indeed, the recent meta-analysis including the 154 studies focusing&#xD;
      on the ARI defined by the KDIGO criteria, only 7 have recruited patients in conventional&#xD;
      nephrology services. However, patients admitted for an ARI which requires treatment in a&#xD;
      medical service probably have epidemiological characteristics and a different prognosis than&#xD;
      those requiring treatment in intensive care. In addition, the parameters of the RIFLE, AKIN&#xD;
      or KDIGO scores are more difficult to establish in conventional hospital services than in&#xD;
      intensive care, especially for hourly monitoring of urine flow, not allowing an optimal&#xD;
      classification of the episode of IRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study set out to develop a prognostic score for intra-hospital mortality in ARI based on&#xD;
      a first historical cohort. The investigators then validated this score on a second&#xD;
      prospective cohort obtained over an independent inclusion period and at a distance from the&#xD;
      first.&#xD;

        We included all patients over 18 years of age admitted for ARI, defined by an increase in&#xD;
        serum creatinine of more than 50% of baseline serum creatinine in patients without chronic&#xD;
        kidney disease or increased serum creatinine at 100 umol / L compared to baseline serum&#xD;
        creatinine if the patient had a serum creatinine clearance less than 60 mL / min / 1.73m2&#xD;
        calculated by the MDRD (Modification of the Diet in Renal Disease) formula, hospitalized in&#xD;
        the Nephrology department of the Besançon University Hospital Center. Our exclusion&#xD;
        criteria were kidney transplantation and patients from the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In our analysis, we constituted two cohorts: the first from January 1, 2001 to December 31,&#xD;
        2004 for the development of the prognostic score, then a second extending from January 1&#xD;
        2010 to December 31, 2013 for the validation of the score.&#xD;
