      Segments 2A and 2B of this trial evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, fecal&#xD;
      concentrations, and fecal microbiome effects of ACX-362E [ibezapolstat] in patients with C.&#xD;
      difficile infection (CDI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, multicenter, open-label single-arm segment (2A) followed by a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, active-controlled segment (2B) is designed to evaluate ACX-362E in the treatment&#xD;
      of CDI. Segment 2A of this trial was an open-label study of up to 20 patients at 6 study&#xD;
      centers and was terminated early at 10 patients based on the protocol-specified Trial&#xD;
      Oversight Committee's assessment of the compelling efficacy and safety data. Patients were&#xD;
      treated with 450 mg of oral ibezapolstat bid for 10 days. In segment 2A all (10 of 10)&#xD;
      patients were cured of CDI at end of treatment and all (10 of 10) were sustained clinical&#xD;
      cures 30 days after EOT. Ibezapolstat was well tolerated with no reported SAEs. The trial&#xD;
      will advance to Segment 2B which is a double-blind comparison of ibezapolstat to the standard&#xD;
      of care, oral vancomycin, in approximately 64 subjects (1-1 randomization) at up to&#xD;
      approximately 20 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for cure, safety, and tolerability. All subjects in both segments&#xD;
      will have stool samples tested for microbiome profiles. Pharmacokinetic (PK) testing for&#xD;
      systemic exposure will be performed on blood samples. Stool samples will be tested for study&#xD;
      drug concentration.&#xD;
