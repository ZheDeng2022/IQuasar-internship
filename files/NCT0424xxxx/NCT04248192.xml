    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site phase 1 study of the safety, immunologic and virologic responses of ex&#xD;
      vivo expanded donor-derived (DD) HIV-1 multi-antigen specific T-cell (HST) with non-escaped&#xD;
      epitope targeting (NEET) therapy as a therapeutic strategy in HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      following Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (alloBMT).&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of donor-derived allogeneic&#xD;
      expanded HIV-specific T-cell therapy (DD HST-NEETs) in HIV-infected alloBMT recipients on&#xD;
      ART. Eligible donors will undergo a blood draw of up to 300mL to allow production of&#xD;
      allogeneic DD HST-NEETs. Participants who meet specified inclusion criteria including&#xD;
      neutrophil recovery post-transplant and for whom donor products have passed release testing&#xD;
      will receive DD HST-NEETs at a dose of 2x107/m2 within 30 days of screening visit.&#xD;
