  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Research Hypothesis for the present pilot study in a special care setting is that in a&#xD;
      population suffering of mild and recent sleep disorders the pre-sleep arousal measured by the&#xD;
      Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS) after 30 days of oral administration with a nutraceutical&#xD;
      composed of hawthorn, lavender and hop (Sonidor®) shall significantly improve in comparison&#xD;
      with the baseline condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sonidor® was developed as a nutraceutical composed of hawthorn, lavender and hop inducing&#xD;
      sleep and relaxation in subjects with mild sleep disturbances. In addition, the Sonidor®&#xD;
      innovative three-layer-tablet formulation should allow the active components to be released&#xD;
      with different speeds into the gastrointestinal tract exerting a synergistic action to induce&#xD;
      sleep-promoting effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to have a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of Sonidor® in subjects&#xD;
      affected by persistent mild sleep disorders (difficulty in initiating sleep for at least 1&#xD;
      month and reduced quality of sleeping) to whom in special care setting have been suggested&#xD;
      sleep hygiene guidelines and administered the tested nutraceutical for one month.&#xD;
