  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, 2-part, global, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study&#xD;
      of oral tazemetostat in subjects with either advanced solid tumors, or hematological&#xD;
      malignancies and normal hepatic function or moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts for subjects with advanced malignancies and either&#xD;
      normal liver function, or advanced malignancies and moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.&#xD;
      Subjects in Part 1 of the study will receive a single oral, 800 mg dose of tazemetostat on&#xD;
      Day 1 and Day 15. In addition, the subjects will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose)&#xD;
      tablets to be taken twice daily from Day 5 to Day 14. Blood samples for PK analysis will be&#xD;
      obtained on Day 1 through Day 4 and again on Day 15 through Day 18. Part 1 ends on Day 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects continuing treatment in Part 2 will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose) tablets&#xD;
      to be taken twice daily in repeated 28-day cycles beginning on Day 19 until&#xD;
      Investigator-assessed clinical progression per standard practice, or unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      or until another discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects must have an end of study visit&#xD;
      after 30 days of the last dose of tazemetostat for safety assessment. Supplementary study&#xD;
      conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the&#xD;
      accompanying procedure manuals (i.e., laboratory, pharmacy, ECG manuals). Such manuals will&#xD;
      provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does&#xD;
      not impact subject safety.&#xD;
