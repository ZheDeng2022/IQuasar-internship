  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a consistent approach to prevent falls with injury in&#xD;
      nursing home (NH) residents. A centralized Injury Liaison Service (ILS) will be developed and&#xD;
      tested in four nursing home facilities (two in the Durham, North Carolina area and two in the&#xD;
      Boston, Massachusetts area). The ILS will combine successful elements of a Fracture Liaison&#xD;
      Service (FLS) and video telehealth staff education (ECHO) models with the goal of decreasing&#xD;
      injurious falls in nursing home residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ILS Program has four main components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Automated identification of NH residents at high risk for falls with injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recommendations by the ILS nurse to manage medications, including deprescribing&#xD;
           medications associated with falls and a prescription for osteoporosis medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Video telehealth sessions to educate staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Shared decision making with residents and/or families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this study is that the ILS model will reduce injurious falls by&#xD;
      changing care delivery in two areas: deprescribing psychoactive and cardiometabolic drugs to&#xD;
      reduce falls, and increasing osteoporosis treatment to prevent injury in the setting of a&#xD;
      fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with nursing home staff to gain a better&#xD;
      understanding of effective and non-effective injury prevention strategies. Information from&#xD;
      these interviews will be incorporated into the study design. Outcome measures will focus on&#xD;
      acceptability, demand, practicality, and feasibility of the program, as well as safety.&#xD;
