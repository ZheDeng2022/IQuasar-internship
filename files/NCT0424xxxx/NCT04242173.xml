      The purpose of this research study is to determine how people with weakened immune systems&#xD;
      and unresectable (cannot be removed by surgery) locally recurrent and/or metastatic cutaneous&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) respond to study treatment with Cemiplimab. Cemiplimab is&#xD;
      approved for sale in United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). Patients who are deemed as not evaluable according to RECIST 1.1 or inevaluable by the composite efficacy criteria will be considered as not reaching ORR.</description>

             myeloproliferative neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 lesion that is measurable by study criteria by RECIST 1.1. Externally&#xD;
             visible cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer (SCC) target lesion(s) greater than &gt;10 mm,&#xD;
             bi-dimensional measurements of the external lesion(s) with a color photograph may be&#xD;
             used as target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values as defined per protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  CSCC not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy such as unresectable tumors&#xD;

             deliver radiation safely determined by radiation oncologists, or radiation related&#xD;
             toxicities unacceptable by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: In lieu of individual consults performed during screening, it will suffice to&#xD;
        document the contraindication of surgery and radiation therapy via a clinic note from the&#xD;
        investigator indicating that an individualized benefit:risk assessment was performed by a&#xD;
        multidisciplinary team (consisting of, at minimum, a radiation oncologist AND EITHER a&#xD;
        medical oncologist with expertise in cutaneous malignancies OR a dermato-oncologist, OR a&#xD;
        head and neck surgeon) within 60 days prior to enrollment in the proposed study, and the&#xD;
        radiation therapy was deemed to be contraindicated. This is not required for patients with&#xD;
        distant metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior known allergy to Cemiplimab-rwlc&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known active infection requiring therapy, including acute infection with hepatitis B&#xD;
             virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, it is not required to test only to&#xD;
             determine the eligibility for the trail. As an exception, known HIV infection is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, or&#xD;
             low-risk early stage prostate adenocarcinoma (T1-T2a N0 M0 and Gleason score ≤6 and&#xD;
             PSA ≤10 ng/mL) for which the management plan is active surveillance, or prostate&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma with biochemical-only recurrence with documented PSA doubling time of &gt;&#xD;
             12 months for which the management plan is active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             make the patient ineligible for participation.&#xD;
