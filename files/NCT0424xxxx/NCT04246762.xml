  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olokizumab (OKZ) has been shown to reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on the activity of&#xD;
      Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to assess the effect of OKZ on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the&#xD;
      CYP450 probe substrates, caffeine (CYP1A2), S-warfarin (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), and&#xD;
      midazolam (CYP3A4) in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, 3-period, single-sequence, crossover study in subjects with RA&#xD;
      with increased C-reactive protein (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 eligible subjects will be enrolled at approximately 3 study centers to have&#xD;
      at least 12 evaluable subjects completing the study. However, if necessary, additional&#xD;
      subjects may be dosed to obtain the 12 evaluable subjects required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 35-day Screening Period, followed by a 29-day study duration: eligible&#xD;
      patients will be administered a cocktail of 4 substrates alone during 7-day PK-sampling&#xD;
      (Period 1); a single subcutaneous dose of 128 mg OKZ will be administered (Period 2)&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks prior to the second administration of the cocktail in 7-day PK-sampling&#xD;
      (Period 3). After completion of the Period 3 patients will be followed-up for 19 weeks (133&#xD;
      days) for safety evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall duration of the study will be approximately 200 days (6 and a half months).&#xD;

             Day 1 without significant Adverse events (AEs). Stable doses of MTX should be 10 mg to&#xD;
             25 mg weekly with folic acid (at least 5 mg weekly or equivalent). No significant side&#xD;
