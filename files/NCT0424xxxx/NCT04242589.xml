  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since patients with spinal metastases are living longer, durable palliation with long-term&#xD;
      tumor control are becoming increasingly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBRT results in durable local control of bone metastasis. However, about 25 % of patients&#xD;
      with spinal metastases only achieved complete pain relief following EBRT for a median&#xD;
      duration of less than 4 months. This could be partly due to spinal instability. In addition,&#xD;
      almost half of the patients who receive EBRT will subsequently develop VCFs . Hence, RT does&#xD;
      not stabilize the spine secondary to VCFs and is not effective in preventing imminent VCFs.&#xD;
      Vertebroplasty has rapidly reduced pain and improved function in patients with VCFs. However,&#xD;
      vertebroplasty does not provide local tumor control similar to EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is theorized that combining vertebroplasty with EBRT will stabilize the spine, relieve the&#xD;
      pain, prevent imminent VCFs and minimize or avoid the need for opioids. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that combining a spine stabilization procedure such as vertebroplasty with RT will be the&#xD;
      most effective management for patients with spinal metastases than RT alone for patients with&#xD;
      spinal metastases. Combined vertebroplasty and radiotherapy is not a standard treatment&#xD;
      option at present. This study is designed to quantify the advantage of adding vertebroplasty&#xD;
      to radiotherapy for patients with spinal metastases. If the study is proven to be&#xD;
      significant, it could become the standard of care for patients with spinal metastases.&#xD;
