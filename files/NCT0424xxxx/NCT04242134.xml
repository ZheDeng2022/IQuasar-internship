  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether drug-coated balloon (DCB) compared to&#xD;
      conventional balloon angioplasty for side branch after provisional stenting will lead to&#xD;
      lower rates of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) at 12 months. The&#xD;
      individual components of MACE include cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target&#xD;
      lesion revascularization (TLR). True bifurcation lesions were defined according to Medina&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled, single blind, superiority trial&#xD;
      that will include 25 international sites. The investigators aim to enroll 784 subjects with&#xD;
      true coronary bifurcation lesions in native coronary arterial segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with true coronary bifurcation lesions suitable for angioplasty will undergo 1:1&#xD;
      randomization either to PS (provisional stenting)-DCB or PS-NCB (noncompliant balloon) group&#xD;
      using a randomization schedule blocked by site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      per protocol and will further undergo angiography after successful stenting of the main&#xD;
      vessel with ostium side branch visually estimated stenosis ≥70%. Data and images will be&#xD;
      collected during the index procedure, during re-intervention in the case of clinically driven&#xD;
      revascularization, and at the predefined 12-month clinical follow-up visit. All subjects will&#xD;
      also undergo angiographic follow-up at 13 months.&#xD;

The initiation of the trial is defined as the time of randomization. After study subjects' enrollment and randomization, the study intervention will take place immediately. The follow-up visits for the primary endpoint are scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months after the index procedure. Angiographic follow-up is scheduled at 13 months.</intervention_model_description>
