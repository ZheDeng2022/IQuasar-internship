  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility and acceptability of a numberless behavioral digital scale&#xD;
      (BDS) intervention combined with motivational interviewing (MI) to affect lifestyle changes&#xD;
      to promote weight loss in adolescents who are obese. Half of the participants will receive&#xD;
      this intervention, while the other half will use a digital scale along with the standard&#xD;
      adolescent weight loss program.&#xD;

      The proposed pilot project seeks to enhance motivation for lifestyle change in adolescents&#xD;
      who are obese. It will test a novel intervention that combines modified MI-based counseling&#xD;
      and BDS. We will test the feasibility of the intervention over a 12-week period, with 24-week&#xD;
      follow-up compared to use of standard digital scale. All participants will undergo the&#xD;
      standard adolescent weight loss program, which includes monthly clinic visits with dietary&#xD;
      and physical activity counseling. The MI intervention will include modified MI, brief weekly&#xD;
      telephone reinforcement, and use of a BDS. The BDS with its mobile app offers daily feedback&#xD;
      through colors, daily missions to promote healthy habits, and weekly healthy tips from&#xD;
      nutritionists. In addition to the primary outcome of feasibility (daily weighing)&#xD;
      investigators will also explore the intervention's effect on motivation, psychological&#xD;
      outcomes and various aspects of feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
