  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: General movements (GMs) are endogenously generated movements of the entire body&#xD;
      observable from the 9th week postmenstrual age to at least 20 weeks postterm age. The&#xD;
      assessment of GMs, the GMA, is a method to differentiate between spontaneous normal vs.&#xD;
      abnormal motor patterns based on visual Gestalt perception, and has proven to be a reliable&#xD;
      tool to evaluate the integrity of the nervous system in early infancy. Trained GMA observers&#xD;
      achieve an excellent inter-observer agreement, but this accuracy is known to decline when GMA&#xD;
      is applied infrequently. Although specific changes in the quality of GMs are highly&#xD;
      predictive for atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories, one pattern of GMs, the&#xD;
      poor-repertoire, is still of low predictive power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Tracking GMA observers' intrinsic and unconsciously applied analytic strategies&#xD;
      may unravel hitherto unknown characteristics of GMs and Gestalt perception in clinical&#xD;
      reasoning. We specifically aim to: detect parameters during the writhing movements period&#xD;
      which differentiate normalising and deteriorating developmental trajectories (Aim 1);&#xD;
      evaluate different strategies/modalities of expert guidance for clinical reasoning and&#xD;
      develop novel didactical approaches for remote GMA training (remote visual and verbal&#xD;
      guidance; Aim 2); create a database to provide expert-guided tutorials for remote clinical&#xD;
      training, observer re-calibration, and self-evaluation for certified observers (Aim 3).&#xD;

      Approach / methods: Based on our expertise in GMA and eye tracking, and a successful proof of&#xD;
      principle (pilot experiment), we will conduct a series of experiments: GMA experts' eye&#xD;
      movement patterns during clinical reasoning will be assessed to better understand the&#xD;
      diagnostic category of poor-repertoire GMs (Experiment 1); benefits and potential&#xD;
      difficulties of different modes of &quot;seeing through the eyes of an expert&quot;-approaches for&#xD;
      GMA-training will be explored (Experiment 2); we shall evaluate enhancement of clinical&#xD;
      reasoning as a result of intensive remote GMA training (Experiment 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of originality / innovation: &quot;Tracking general movements&quot; will (1) contribute to better&#xD;
      understand poor-repertoire GMs adding to the clinical necessity to closely follow infants in&#xD;
      need for continuous or close-meshed clinical surveillance; (2) define the benefits of&#xD;
      different modes/modalities of expert guidance for GMA, which will form the basis for&#xD;
      innovative remote clinical GMA training; and (3) create a globally accessible database for&#xD;
      remote clinical GMA refreshment-training and re-calibration.&#xD;

        For the proposed experiments, observers will be divided into three groups. One group will&#xD;
        consist of (a) naïve observers, that is, individuals who are not familiar with GMs, have&#xD;
        not received any GMA training and are not medically educated. The two other groups will&#xD;
        consist of (b) GMA-trained and certified observers: (b1) novice observers who have&#xD;
        practiced GMA sporadically (def.: &lt;= 2 GMA/week for &lt;= 2 years) and have only little&#xD;
        experience; and (b2) GMA experts, i.e. GMA tutors and individuals who have applied GMA&#xD;
        regularly (def.: &gt; 2 GMA/week for &gt; 2 years).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Observers have to provide written informed consent to the study protocol, data analysis and&#xD;
        data storage guidelines, as well as the publication of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Observers have to complete the experimental data acquisition. Apart from their lack of GMA&#xD;
        training, naïve observers have to be of the same gender, of comparable age and educational&#xD;

&#xD;
        Novice observers and GMA experts have to be certified for GMA. Observers must have normal&#xD;

        in the eye tracking experiments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Observers did not adhere to the study protocol, data analysis, data storage guidelines, or&#xD;
        the publication of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Observers did not complete the experimental data acquisition. Observers have uncorrected&#xD;
        visual impairments or visual impairments corrected with glasses/hard contact lenses.&#xD;
