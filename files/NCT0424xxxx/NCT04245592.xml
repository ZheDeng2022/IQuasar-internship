  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have recently reported a prothrombotic state in patients with fibromyalgia that may&#xD;
      increase the risk of thrombosis-related cardiovascular disease in these patients. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown the cardioprotective, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory properties of&#xD;
      olive oil. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of consumption of two&#xD;
      types of olive oils with different antioxidant content on thrombosis-related parameters,&#xD;
      nitric oxide, inflammation, lipid profile and cortisol as well as on health-related&#xD;
      parameters in women with fibromyalgia.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present study is to investigate the effects of two olive oils with different&#xD;
      antioxidant content on cardiovascular risk factors (blood-coagulation parameters, platelet&#xD;
      indices, red blood cell count, inflammatory markers, lipid profile, nitric oxide and&#xD;
      cortisol) in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The investigators will determine&#xD;
      thrombosis-related parameters (fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity,&#xD;
      cephaline time, platelet count, platelet distribution width [PDW], mean platelet volume&#xD;
      [MPV], plateletcrit, red blood cell [RBC] count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], and&#xD;
      platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR]), inflammatory markers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-10,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), nitric oxide levels, lipid&#xD;
      profile, and cortisol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carry out in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      of the World Medical Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group will contact a Spanish association of patients with fibromyalgia, AFIXA&#xD;
      (Association of Fibromyalgia of Jaén, Spain) to find patients to participate in the study.&#xD;
      The researchers will convene patients in the laboratory of the Faculty of Health Sciences of&#xD;
      the University of Jaén (Spain) to obtain several data of interest (age, BMI, other chronic&#xD;
      diseases, pregnancy, lactation and medication). Based on these data, the investigators will&#xD;
      select the fibromyalgia group. In a second visit to the laboratory, all patients will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent form, the blood samples will be taken and the they will complete several&#xD;
      questionnaires (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Visual Analogic Scale, Short Form 12&#xD;
      Health Survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women with fibromyalgia will be previously diagnosed with fibromyalgia by a professional&#xD;
      rheumatologist and met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for fibromyalgia.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be the presence of any other chronic disease (diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, cancer or ischemic heart disease),&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, pregnancy, lactation or grade II obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2). None of the&#xD;
      participants will being treated with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, estrogens, analgesics&#xD;
      or anti-inflammatory drugs, and will be only included if they had stopped using them at least&#xD;
      2 months before the start of our study. None will consume alcohol regularly, and all will be&#xD;
      non-smokers. All the participants will be sedentary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized, controlled, double-blind nutritional trial will carry out. The&#xD;
      trial will consist of the consumption of 50 ml/day of one of the two organic olive oils with&#xD;
      different antioxidant content, EVOO or ROO, over 3 weeks. A short-term nutritional trial,&#xD;
      such as the present one, may offer certain advantages with respect to a long-term trial, as&#xD;
      it allows patients to adhere to a stricter and more controlled diet in relation to the intake&#xD;
      of other antioxidants. In this way, the possible interference of other antioxidants can be&#xD;
      limited, as can interference from possible changes in the lifestyles of the patients, which&#xD;
      could also alter the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups: EVOO and ROO. Before&#xD;
      beginning the 3-week dietary trial, participants will conduct a 2-week washout period during&#xD;
      which they consumed ROO (50 ml daily for 2 weeks) because they are part of a population that&#xD;
      consumes olive oil regularly. Biochemical markers and clinical parameters in each participant&#xD;
      will be determine before and after the 3-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organic olive oils will obtained from Olifarma S.L. (Granada, Spain). The olive oils will be&#xD;
      similarly packaged, and participants will be blinded as to the type of olive oil they will&#xD;
      consume. Participants will consume the treatment olive oil raw but will use ROO for cooking&#xD;
      in order to maintain their ingestion of antioxidants unchanged. The investigators will supply&#xD;
      ROO for cooking in sufficient quantity for the whole family. The researchers will estimate&#xD;
      the participants' intake by means of a 24-hr recall that they will complete for 3 days (2&#xD;
      working days and a day off) at the beginning of the trial. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      average of the values obtained over the 3 days to calculate participants' energy intake&#xD;
      (kcals/day) and intake of macronutrients (carbohydrates [g/day], lipids [g/day], and protein&#xD;
      [g/day]) and micronutrients, especially those that may have an antioxidant effect, including&#xD;
      vitamin C, vitamin A, copper, zinc, and selenium. Based on this analysis, the investigators&#xD;
      will provide all participants with dietary recommendations, focusing on the aspects that each&#xD;
      should improve. Data of the weight of the participants at the beginning and end of the trial&#xD;
      will record. The investigators will request that participants return all the treatment olive&#xD;
      oil containers (the consumed and unconsumed containers) at the end of the trial for control&#xD;
      of the olive oil consumption (i.e., a count of the empty and full containers each participant&#xD;
      will return).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection and preparation of blood samples: After overnight fasting, venous blood will&#xD;
      be taken in the early morning from the antecubital vein into several tubes with anticoagulant&#xD;
      and anticoagulant-free tubes. The blood of the anticoagulant-free tubes will be allowed to&#xD;
      clot for 30 min at room temperature. The anticoagulant and anticoagulant-free tubes will then&#xD;
      be centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C to obtain plasma and serum samples, respectively.&#xD;
      The blood will be always drawn at the same time of day to avoid circadian variations.&#xD;
      Thrombosis-related parameters (fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity,&#xD;
      cephaline time, platelet count, platelet distribution width [PDW], mean platelet volume&#xD;
      [MPV], plateletcrit, red blood cell [RBC] count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], and&#xD;
      platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR]) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined&#xD;
      in plasma samples. Inflammatory markers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-10, C-reactive protein&#xD;
      [CRP]), nitric oxide levels, lipid profile, and cortisol levels were measured in serum&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Characteristics of Participants: The investigators will obtain demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data from participants´ interview and questionnaires. The same specialist will carry&#xD;
      out all the measurements and tests throughout the study. The questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      immediately after the blood was drawn. The researchers will evaluate functional capacity in&#xD;
      daily living activities in patients with fibromyalgia using the Spanish version of the&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The FIQ score, which is the instrument most often&#xD;
      used by researchers to estimate fibromyalgia severity, ranges from 0 to 100. Self-reported&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain will be assessed in fibromyalgia patients by a Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      (VAS; 10 cm). For both of these instruments, higher scores reflect worse symptomatology. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the physical (Physical Component Summary, PCS-12) and mental&#xD;
      (Mental Component Summary, MCS-12) health status of patients and controls using the Spanish&#xD;
      version of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Scores range from 0 to 100, with&#xD;
      lower values reflecting worse health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of biochemical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric oxide (NO) Measurement: NO production was indirectly quantified by measuring&#xD;
      nitrate/nitrite and S-nitrose compounds (NOx) using an ozone chemiluminescence-based method.&#xD;
      The thawed serum aliquots were deproteinized with NaOH 0.8 N and ZnSO4 16% solutions. The&#xD;
      total amount of NOx will be determined as previously described (Rus et al., 2011) using the&#xD;
      purge system of Sievers Instruments, model NOA 280i (GE Analytical Instruments, Colorado&#xD;
      (CO), USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Inflammatory Markers: The IL-6 level will be determined by a&#xD;
      chemiluminescent immunoassay using the Access Immunoassay Systems (Beckman Coulter). Levels&#xD;
      of IL-10 will be measured by a chemiluminescent immunoenzymatic assay using an MLX™&#xD;
      luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). CRP will be measured using an AU 5800&#xD;
      analyzer (Beckman Coulter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol Measurement: Cortisol level will be determined in serum samples by a fluorescence&#xD;
      polarization immunoassay using an AxSYM analyser (Abbott Laboratories, Illinois (IL), USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Lipid Profile: Serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B) will&#xD;
      be measured by a spectrophotometric procedure using an OLYMPUS AU 5400 analyzer (Beckman&#xD;
      Coulter). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels will be estimated indirectly with&#xD;
      the Friedewald equation. The level of homocysteine will be determined by a fluorescence&#xD;
      polarization immunoassay using an AxSYM analyzer (Abbott Laboratories). The researchers will&#xD;
      determine lipid peroxidation by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS),&#xD;
      which are a good indicator of lipid peroxidation, a major marker of oxidative stress. TBARS&#xD;
      will be determined spectrophotometrically in plasma samples following the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations (TBARS Assay Kit, OXItek, Catalog. 0801192).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of thrombosis-related parameters: Blood-coagulation parameters (fibrinogen&#xD;
      levels, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity and cephaline time) will be determine in&#xD;
      plasma samples using the BCS XP analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The&#xD;
      researchers will measure determinants of platelet function (platelet count, platelet&#xD;
      distribution width [PDW], and mean platelet volume [MPV]), and red blood cell (RBC),&#xD;
      neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in plasma samples by flow cytometry using the ADVIA 2120&#xD;
      analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment: The sample size has been estimated using the Ene 3.0 software&#xD;
      (GlaxoSmithKline). Sample size has been estimated based on the levels of malondialdehyde&#xD;
      (Gassió et al., 2008). With an unilateral hypothesis, assuming a probability of type I error&#xD;
      of 5%, a β risk of 0.10, with a standard deviation of the effect of 1.4, 10 patients are&#xD;
      considered necessary per branch of the study, that is, a total of 20 patients. If 10% of&#xD;
      patient losses are assumed, a minimal sample size of 24 patients, 12 for each branch of the&#xD;
      study will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis of the data will be performed using the&#xD;
      statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics 24 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Levenne test will be performed to test normality and&#xD;
      homoscedasticity, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the effect of each olive oil between pre- and post measures, the data that&#xD;
      followed a normal distribution and the principle of homoscedasticity of variances were tested&#xD;
      by a two-way ANOVA. The statistical significance will be established by applying an unpaired&#xD;
      Student's t-test to compare differences between means. Data that did not follow a normal&#xD;
      distribution or the principle of homoscedasticity will be tested using the Scheirer-Ray-Hare&#xD;
      test, the non-parametric equivalent for two-way ANOVA. The statistical significance will be&#xD;
      established by applying the Mann-Whitney U-test to compare differences between means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the effect of the type of olive oil, all values will be converted into delta&#xD;
      scores (i.e., post-pre values) and thereafter will be tested by unpaired Student's t test or&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney U-test based on normality and homoscedasticity of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect size will be calculated using the Cohen´s d for parametric tests and the eta&#xD;
      squared (η²) for nonparametric tests. Values of Cohen´s d of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to&#xD;
      the classical Cohen bands of interpretation of the effect size as small, medium and large,&#xD;
      respectively. Values of η² of 0.02, 0.13 and 0.26 correspond to small, medium and large&#xD;
      effect size, respectively. The investigators set the level of statistical significance at p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
