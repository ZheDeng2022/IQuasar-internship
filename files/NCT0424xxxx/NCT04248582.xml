  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In published studies, complete response (CR) to chemoradiation occurs in only&#xD;
      25-30% of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy&#xD;
      (LNSC) is postulated to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response. In a preliminary study, the&#xD;
      investigators documented CR rate of 56% with a single session of LNSC administered prior to&#xD;
      chemoradiation. Before proceeding with larger trials to corroborate these findings, the&#xD;
      maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of neoadjuvant LNSC must be determined. The aims of this study&#xD;
      are: (1) To determine safety and MTD of LNSC during neoadjuvant chemoradiation in locally&#xD;
      advanced esophageal cancer. (2) To assess whether LNSC results in immunogenic cell death. (3)&#xD;
      To assess changes in tumor micro-environment with LNSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Eligible adult patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer will receive LNSC at&#xD;
      the following dose frequencies: Patient 1, 2, and 3: 2 sessions of LNSC prior to&#xD;
      chemoradiation (chemoXRT); Patients 4, 5, and 6: 2 sessions LNSC prior to chemoXRT, then 1&#xD;
      session during week 4 of chemoXRT; Patients 7, 8, and 9: 2 sessions LNSC prior to chemoXRT,&#xD;
      then 1 session during week 2 and 1 session during week 4 of chemoXRT. If no dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) occurs, the investigators will enroll an additional 3 patients to confirm MTD.&#xD;
      The investigators will contact patients at 48-hours and 1-week post-procedure to evaluate for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) and DLTs, and assess for improvements in dysphagia and quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL) using the Mellow-Pinkas and EORTC QLQ-OES18 instruments respectively. The investigators&#xD;
      will obtain peripheral blood for ELISA and biopsies from the tumor to assess&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and T cell subtypes before the 1st session of LNSC,&#xD;
      before the 2nd session of LNSC, and after chemoradiation is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: (1) Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) does not occur when patients received 2&#xD;
      session of LNSC prior to chemoXRT, and 2 sessions during chemoXRT (2) LNSC results in&#xD;
      immunogenic cell death, as assessed by increased levels of HMGB1 in serum, and calreticulin&#xD;
      in biopsy specimens (CRT) (3) LNSC is associated with increased T cell infiltration and&#xD;
      activation (increased TILs, CD8+, CD3+ T cells, and granzyme B), and decrease in regulatory T&#xD;
      cells (CD45R0, FOXP3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LNSC will be administered as follows: up to three cycles of 20 to 40 seconds each directed at&#xD;
      the bulkiest aspect of the tumor. During each cycle, a surface area of approximately 2 to 3&#xD;
      cm2 is targeted. Up to three sites are treated during each session. Tissue thawing is&#xD;
      verified between cycles by waiting at least 60 seconds before re-treatment, and by observing&#xD;
      a return to baseline color of the tissue and complete disappearance of ice crystals after&#xD;
      reperfusion. After the procedure is completed, patients will be monitored in the recovery&#xD;
      unit for at least 30 minutes. Patients will be discharged after monitoring if they meet the&#xD;
      endoscopy unit's standard discharge criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy dose frequency intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two LNSC sessions (patient 1, 2, and 3): 2 sessions of LNSC administered at 2-week&#xD;
           intervals, followed by concurrent chemoradiation for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three LNSC sessions (patients 4, 5, and 6): 2 sessions of LNSC administered at 2-week&#xD;
           intervals, followed by concurrent chemoradiation for 5 weeks. During week 4 of&#xD;
           chemoradiation, they will receive a session of LNSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Four LNSC sessions (patients 7, 8, and 9): 2 sessions of LNSC administered at 2-week&#xD;
           intervals, followed by concurrent chemoradiation for 5 weeks. During week 2 and week 4&#xD;
           of chemoradiation, they will receive LNSC (i.e. - 2 sessions during chemoradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No DLTs: If no patient develops a DLT, then the investigators will enroll an&#xD;
                additional 3 patients to receive 4 LNSC sessions as described earlier, in order to&#xD;
                confirm safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 DLT: If 1 of 3 patients develops a DLT, then the investigators will enroll 3&#xD;
                additional patients to receive LNSC at that dose. If any of the additionally&#xD;
                enrolled patients develop a DLT, the investigators will enroll 3 patients at the&#xD;
                previous dose, to confirm safety of the lower dose frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 DLTs: At a given dose frequency interval, if 2 of 3 patients develop a DLT, then&#xD;
                the investigators will enroll 3 patients at the previous dose, to confirm safety of&#xD;
                the lower dose frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Adverse Events (AEs) and Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) We will define adverse&#xD;
      AEs based on the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) lexicon (Appendix 2).&#xD;
      The relationship of the AE to LNSC will be classified using the following 4 categories:&#xD;
      definitely related, likely related, unlikely related, and definitely not related. DLT will be&#xD;
      defined as any severe or fatal adverse event that is definitely or likely related to the&#xD;
      cryotherapy procedure (i.e. - unplanned admission &gt; 10 nights, intensive care unit admission&#xD;
      &gt; 1 night, surgery for an adverse event, permanent disability due to an adverse event, or&#xD;
      death). A member of the study team will contact patients and review their medical records 48&#xD;
      hours after the procedure, and 1 week after the procedure to assess for mild, moderate, and&#xD;
      severe adverse events (AEs). In addition to recording any AEs, the study coordinator will&#xD;
      contact a physician investigator if any AEs are reported in order to direct appropriate&#xD;
      clinical management. An independent data safety monitoring (DSM) committee will review AEs&#xD;
      every 3 months for the duration of the study to determine whether the AE was definitely or&#xD;
      likely related to the LNSC procedure. Additionally, if a serious adverse event (SAE) is&#xD;
      reported, then the DSM will meet within one week to determine if the SAE represents a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue morphology, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain peripheral blood and 6 mucosal biopsies (2 mm X 2 mm) immediately prior to the first&#xD;
      and second session of cryotherapy, and at the end of chemoradiation. The investigators will&#xD;
      obtain half the biopsies from the center, and half the biopsies from the periphery of the&#xD;
      tumor. If the patient proceeds directly to surgery following chemoradiation without&#xD;
      endoscopy, then the investigators will obtain archival tissue from the explant specimen. The&#xD;
      investigators will place 2 biopsies in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for TILs analysis (1 center&#xD;
      and 1 periphery), 2 biopsies in 4% PFA for IHC analysis (1 center and 1 periphery), and 2&#xD;
      biopsies for exploratory analyses/backup. To assess for evidence of immunogenic cell death,&#xD;
      the investigators will perform IHC on biopsy specimens for CRT, and ELISA on peripheral blood&#xD;
      for HMBG1. A pathologist blinded to patient demographics, and treatment allocation will grade&#xD;
      overall inflammation using standard criteria and as sparse, moderate, or pronounced TILs. To&#xD;
      assess the immune infiltrate, the investigators will construct tissue microarray (TMA) blocks&#xD;
      and analyze in an automated immunostainer for antibodies against the following antigens: CD3,&#xD;
      CD8, CD45R0/FoxP3, and Pan-CK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Data Collection Baseline variables: Baseline variables will include age, gender,&#xD;
      ethnicity, tumor histology and TNM stage, location and length of tumor, presence or absence&#xD;
      of critical organ invasion (i.e. - aorta, trachea, heart, and vertebral body), ECOG&#xD;
      performance status, baseline Mellow-Pinkas dysphagia score, and a validated measure of&#xD;
      quality of life in esophageal cancer, the EORTC QLQ-OES18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pathologic/clinical complete response: At the completion of neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiation, results of the re-staging PET-CT and surgical explant will be abstracted to&#xD;
      document presence or absence of a pathologic complete response. As is standard protocol at&#xD;
      our institutions, patients who do not undergo surgery will undergo upper endoscopy with&#xD;
      biopsies along with PET-CT to assess for the presence or absence of a clinical complete&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of palliation efficacy: A member of the study team will contact each patient at&#xD;
      1-week after each LNSC procedure to update the Mellow-Pinkas dysphagia score and EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-OES18. The investigators will also document if there was any need for an esophageal&#xD;
      stent, enteral feeding tube, or parenteral nutrition support during chemoradiation.&#xD;
