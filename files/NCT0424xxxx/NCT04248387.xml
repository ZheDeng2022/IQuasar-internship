  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the fact that neoadjuvant therapy for malignant melanoma is in the exploratory&#xD;
      stage, and the current data on neoadjuvant immunology are mainly from European and American&#xD;
      populations, it is necessary to carry out clinical trials in the status of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      immunotherapy for patients with melanoma in China. Toripalimab has been extensively studied&#xD;
      in the field of malignant melanoma, and its effectiveness and safety have been proven.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators initiated a single-arm exploratory study to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Toripalimab in neoadjuvant treatment of patients with BRAF V600&#xD;
      wild-type malignant melanoma.&#xD;
