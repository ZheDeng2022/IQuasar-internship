  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the impact of musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints on the&#xD;
      quality of life and general health of MSK Patients attending MSK triage clinics. The&#xD;
      investigators will also record the proposed management options for patients' complaints. This&#xD;
      will be achieved by asking patients to complete questionnaires (MSK HQ) at musculoskeletal&#xD;
      triage clinic appointment, by undertaking a clinical assessment, by recording the proposed&#xD;
      management plan and assessing if patients have follow up appointments for the same complaint&#xD;
      in the following year. The investigators will also measure patient satisfaction using VSQ 9&#xD;
      Questionnaire. After a year the investigators will repeat the MSK HQ to assess the longterm&#xD;
      impact of MSK Triage appointment on the MSK complaint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present there is no data available to describe the impact of musculoskeletal (MSK) disease&#xD;
      on the Quality of life and General Health for patients attending Rheumatology MSK triage&#xD;
      clinics in SUH and OHLM or in similar service around Ireland. A new questionnaire (MSK HQ)&#xD;
      has been developed which has been validated in use with this population. This will be&#xD;
      completed by the patient on the day of the appointment and again a year later. Their number&#xD;
      of visits to secondary care in the year after their visit will also be captured and analysed.&#xD;
      This information will inform the health service of the outcomes of these patients and the&#xD;
      impact of their MSK disease on the health service. It will also help with resource allocation&#xD;
      and planning for future services, which will ensure the best service for these patients in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside this, Patient satisfaction and feedback is vital to ensuring service quality and&#xD;
      quality improvement. The VSQ 9 will be used to measure Patient Satisfaction in this study to&#xD;
      evaluate if patients are satisfied with the service they have received on the day. The&#xD;
      repeated MSK HQ will help identify if their triage clinic appointment was beneficial to their&#xD;
      Quality of life.&#xD;
