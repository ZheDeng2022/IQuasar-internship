  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a free-living, 6-week fish oil (FO) or placebo (PLA) supplementation&#xD;
      intervention alongside participants' habitual resistance exercise training (RET) regimens.&#xD;
      Twenty young, healthy resistance-trained subjects who do not currently supplement with FO&#xD;
      will be recruited to participate. An eligible participant will be between ages 18 and 35 and&#xD;
      will have a minimum of two years of RET experience. Participants will be randomized into a FO&#xD;
      group and a PLA group. The FO group will supplement with 4g/day of FO (4g fish oil&#xD;
      concentrate: 2g EPA+ 1g DHA) and the PLA group will consume 4g/day of coconut oil (saturated&#xD;
      fatty acids), as administered via gel capsules, in conjunction with their current RET&#xD;
      program. Prior to intervention all participants will complete baseline biometric, strength,&#xD;
      and neuromuscular testing. Participants will also have blood drawn to test for omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acid status, and complete and return a 3-day diet record and a physical activity recall. In&#xD;
      order to monitor adherence to supplementation, FO and PLA bottles will also be returned&#xD;
      weekly and pills will be counted. 3-day diet records will be obtained to ensure calorie and&#xD;
      protein intakes remain consistent throughout the intervention period. Weekly physical&#xD;
      activity records will also help to ensure consistency of participant training and to make&#xD;
      sure all participants are following their training regimes in a progressive fashion.&#xD;
      Following 6 weeks of FO or PLA supplementation, subjects will repeat all initial biometric,&#xD;
      strength and neuromuscular testing, as well as a second, post-intervention blood draw.&#xD;

      Potential participants will report to the Human Performance Lab (HPL) in James Hall to&#xD;
      complete the screening process. They will complete the informed consent form process with a&#xD;
      member of the research team before providing any protected health information (PHI). The&#xD;
      screening process has two components: questionnaires and physical measures. Potential&#xD;
      participants will complete the following questionnaires: Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire and a Medical History Questionnaire. Participants will complete the following&#xD;
      physical measures: height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      assessed and followed by calculations of body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR).&#xD;
      The final measure will be a determination of fasting total cholesterol and blood glucose&#xD;
      measured via capillary blood from a finger prick using an automated analyzer. The purpose of&#xD;
      the screening process is to determine if a participant is healthy and can safely participate&#xD;
      in exercise testing, and to determine their eligibility to participate in the study based on&#xD;
      the criteria listed elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the eligibility criteria and are willing to participate will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to FO or PLA via block randomization methods.&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will return to the HPL in the morning to complete a battery of&#xD;
      biometric tests (described below) and will be given two logs to complete to collect baseline&#xD;
      data: the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Questionnaire and a 3-day diet log. The purpose of&#xD;
      the physical activity log is to determine their average level of physical activity and&#xD;
      training program. The purpose of the 3-day diet log is to record their normal dietary intake&#xD;
      and to provide practice for completing these logs as they will be completed on a weekly basis&#xD;
      during the supplement intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the following physical measures recorded: height, weight, waist and&#xD;
      hip circumference, body composition, and blood pressure. Participants will then have their&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate (RMR) measured by indirect calorimetry. In preparation for this test&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete an overnight fast of at least 9 hours, abstain from&#xD;
      caffeine for 12 hours and abstain from exercise and alcohol for 24 hours. Participants will&#xD;
      be brought to a quiet room and asked to lie in a supine position for 30 minutes of rest. They&#xD;
      will then be fitted with a breathing mask connected to the metabolic cart and their breath&#xD;
      will be analyzed for 15 minutes while they continue to lie in a supine position. Their total&#xD;
      energy expenditure will be calculated using their RMR and a physical activity factor based on&#xD;
      their level of physical activity obtained from the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Subject's total daily calorie requirements will then be verified using their&#xD;
      3-day diet record and the Mifflin-St. Jeor prediction equation. In order to ensure that&#xD;
      participants are consuming enough calories in order to maintain their body weight during the&#xD;
      6-week supplementation period, the research team will use the average of participant's total&#xD;
      calorimetric data (based on RMR), 3-day diet log, and the Mifflin-St. Jeor estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent pre-participation instructions before testing to ensure they arrive&#xD;
      at the HPL with proper exercise attire and having abstained from caffeine for 12 hours and&#xD;
      exercise and alcohol for 24 hours. They will report to the HPL to complete a 1RM test, a type&#xD;
      of muscular strength assessment. This test will be performed for the back squat in a Smith&#xD;
      machine with hand release breaks. Water will be provided and consumed ad libitum. Bench press&#xD;
      and Squat will be completed with proper lifting technique as described by the National&#xD;
      Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' lower body neuromuscular function, assessed via maximal voluntary contraction&#xD;
      (MVC) and rate of force development (RFD), will be completed through the use of force&#xD;
      transducers applied to the legs. Participants will be seated in a custom-made wooden box with&#xD;
      a single axis transducer attached to one of its surfaces (SM-500, Interface Inc., Scottsdale,&#xD;
      Arizona, USA). When subjects sit on the box, their knee and hip joints will be at&#xD;
      approximately 70° and 90° of flexion from full extension, respectively. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to cross their arms across their chest during the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary compliance will be monitored weekly during the free-living supplementation period&#xD;
      using 3-day diet records and returned supplement pill bottles. 3-day diet records will be&#xD;
      recorded by the participants and returned to the research team for analysis using&#xD;
      professional nutrition analysis software (Food Processor, Oregon). Dietary analysis results&#xD;
      will be discussed with the participant in order to help them adhere to dietary&#xD;
      recommendations. Body weight measures will be recorded once per week to ensure a stable&#xD;
      weight during the dietary intervention period. The participants will return supplement&#xD;
      bottles weekly, and the research team will count and record any remaining capsules. Finally,&#xD;
      physical activity logs will be collected every week to ensure diet and calorie&#xD;
      recommendations are meeting the demands of RET.&#xD;
