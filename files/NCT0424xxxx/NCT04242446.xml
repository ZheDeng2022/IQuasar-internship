    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving clinical response as measured by Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response 50 (HiSCR50) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HiSCR50 is defined as at least a 50% reduction from Baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count, with no increase from Baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants achieving clinical response as measured by Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response 75 (HiSCR75) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HiSCR75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction from Baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count, with no increase from Baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with Flare by Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change from Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a skin disease specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect participants' health related quality of life (QOL). The DLQI total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating lower skin health related QOL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change from Baseline in Skin Pain score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 16</time_frame>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 71)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with serious treatment-emergent adverse events during the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 71)</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:&#xD;
Results in death&#xD;
Is life-threatening&#xD;
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
Results in persistent disability/incapacity&#xD;
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
Important medical events</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal from the study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Safety Follow-Up (up to Week 71)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the IMP. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IMP. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study are reported.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
