  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised study to develop personalised treatment approaches in participants&#xD;
      with Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) of the oropharynx and base of skull by&#xD;
      integrating the use of MR-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy (MRgRT) and functional image-guided&#xD;
      radiotherapy (FIgRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is made up of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility planning study consisting of a total of 13 patients. This will include&#xD;
           patients with either Human papilomavirus-associated (HPV-associated) oropharyngeal&#xD;
           cancer (OPC), Human papilomavirus-negative (HPV-negative) OPC or Base of Skull HNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single centre prospective interventional phase I/II study (main study) made up of 3&#xD;
           independent arms (on the condition of success of the feasibility stage).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cohort 1: HPV-associated OPC consisting of 25 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Cohort 2: HPV-negative OPC consisting of a minimum of 10 patients and a maximum of&#xD;
                53 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Cohort 3: Base of Skull HNC consisting of 25 participants&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at improving radiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancers by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repeating the radiotherapy planning scan at weeks 2 and 4 of treatment so that&#xD;
           investigators can adapt the radiotherapy to changes to the shape of the cancer and the&#xD;
           patient's body. These changes can affect the accuracy and the radiotherapy doses&#xD;
           delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using a MR (magnetic resonance) scans to view and target the cancer with more precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identifying HPV negative oropharyngeal cancer who are non-responders and increasing the&#xD;
           radiotherapy dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 groups of patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cancers of the oropharynx (middle of the throat) that test positive for HPV (human&#xD;
           papilloma virus). If HPV is present, the cancer responds better to treatment and there&#xD;
           is a higher chance of cure. In this group, the investigators aim is to reduce&#xD;
           radiotherapy associated long-term side effects by sparing healthy tissue from high&#xD;
           doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the oropharyngeal cancers test negative for HPV, they are less likely to respond well&#xD;
           to treatment. The investigator's department has shown that investigators can predict&#xD;
           which patients will respond to treatment using a special type of MR scan. Investigators&#xD;
           will increase the dose of radiotherapy to HPV negative patients who are predicted to be&#xD;
           non-responders with the aim of improving the chance of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cancers that located at the base of the skull are not seen very well on CT scan. By&#xD;
           using MR imaging, investigators can visualize the surrounding normal organs and the&#xD;
           cancer better, target the cancer with more precision and adapt to changes to the healthy&#xD;
           organs and tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also test if they can predict response to treatment by checking blood for&#xD;
      fragments of the cancer and using a special MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Royal Marsden in Sutton only and will be followed up for 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
