      â€¢ Patients receiving physical therapy (PT) at the University of Illinois at Chicago Faculty&#xD;
      Practice (UICFP) meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two groups: control group (CG) receiving standard care and an experimental group (EG)&#xD;
      receiving standard care in addition to being provided a strength education video (SEV). The&#xD;
      SEV is a short video designed to provide instructions clarifying how to do strength-based&#xD;
      exercises by monitoring a fatigue response with a set of any exercise. The EG will watch the&#xD;
      video with headphones in the waiting room of the UICFP on an iPad. The EG will also be&#xD;
      provided a handout with a link and QR code to the video on YouTube.com. Functional changes&#xD;
      with PT will be tracked for both groups using a Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)&#xD;
      questionnaire at initial evaluation, follow up at session 3 or 4, and at any date of&#xD;
      anticipated discharge. Basic demographic data (age, sex), dates of data collection, and any&#xD;
      discharge dates will be tracked as well. If questions arise regarding the content of the SEV&#xD;
      then the treating physical therapist will be permitted to answer and apply the content at&#xD;
      their discretion. All therapists will have pre-approved the content of the video to ensure&#xD;
      there are no contradictions to their usual methods of care. Data will be gathered for up to 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Human subjects for the study will be recruited and participate in the study at the&#xD;
           University of Illinois at Chicago Faculty Practice (UICFP) located at 1640 West&#xD;
           Roosevelt Road, 3rd floor, Chicago IL. All of the treating physical therapists with the&#xD;
           exception of Daniel Robinson will be participating as treating physical therapists in&#xD;
           this study and will therefore be aware of the proceedings involved. The treating&#xD;
           physical therapists: Aaron Keil, Brian Baranyi, Justin Payette, Deborah Davey, Benjamin&#xD;
           Land, Richelle Caya, Amanda Montbriand, Adam Wielechowski will be screening and&#xD;
           obtaining informed consent from study participants. Additionally, Jessica Pop will be&#xD;
           assisting in data collection and organization of data for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving physical therapy (PT) at the UICFP will be screened for eligibility&#xD;
           according to inclusion and exclusion criteria by treating physical therapists including&#xD;
           obtaining consent to participate in the study at date of initial physical therapy&#xD;
           evaluation or before the patient leaves from the second follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Checking for inclusion and exclusion criteria will be referenced by the treating&#xD;
                therapist from the &quot;Patient Checklist Data Form&quot; (PCDF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a patient does not meet any of the inclusion criteria or meets one of the&#xD;
                exclusion criteria they will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a patient is being added in the above manner on a date past initial evaluation&#xD;
                the physical therapist must record previous data needed that is available from&#xD;
                patient records (date of evaluation, Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)&#xD;
                average score). The PSFS will be provided to all possible candidates in the clinic&#xD;
                as part of the standard intake paperwork. Therefore, the PSFS should still be&#xD;
                available for data after obtaining consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Upon passing exclusion and inclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
                patients will be randomized into either the control or experimental group. Only&#xD;
                after these setup steps will the PCDF be filled out and, if appropriate, provide&#xD;
                the Strength Education Video (SEV) for viewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
                o Once included into the study subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
                groups: control group (CG) or experimental group (EG).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CG will receive standard PT care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EG will receive standard care in addition to being provided a SEV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The SEV must be watched by the patient at the UICFP prior to leaving from the 3rd PT&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EG will watch the video in the waiting room or other quiet available rooms on the&#xD;
           3rd floor within the UICFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The video will be watched from an iPad/tablet/laptop/desktop computer device as&#xD;
           available in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EG will also be provided a handout with a link and QR code to the video on&#xD;
           YouTube.com and disclaimer from the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disclaimer quoted from consent form: &quot;Please follow the link bellow to the video&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Treating physical therapist will record the date of SEV viewing on the PCDF. - The&#xD;
                PCDF will be used to record patient information by the treating physical therapist&#xD;
                and have a study subject identification (ID) number added by either Daniel Robinson&#xD;
                or Jessica Pop when performing data entry described later in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject information contained in the PCDF includes:&#xD;

                from PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCDF sheets will be kept with physical therapists when being used to gather data or in&#xD;
           the UICFP in a locked cabinet/drawer in the folder of the specific physical therapist&#xD;
           separate from standard treatment notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the PCDF will be entered without patient names into a Private Data Excel Sheet&#xD;
           (PDES). This spreadsheet will be kept in a Box Health Data Folder (BHDF) only available&#xD;
           to the study investigators (Daniel Robinson, Jessica Pop, and Brian Baranyi) using a&#xD;
           secure password containing at least: one uppercase letter, one lower case letter, one&#xD;
           number, one symbol, and at least 8 characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Functional changes with PT will be tracked for both groups using a Patient Specific&#xD;
           Functional Scale (PSFS) questionnaire at initial evaluation, follow up at session 3 or 4&#xD;
           (evaluation not counting as a session), and at any date of anticipated discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PSFS being utilized has been altered slightly from its original form for the purpose&#xD;
           of clarifying to patients that 10 is a high functional performance skill. This is being&#xD;
           done due to subjective reports from clinicians that patients commonly misread the&#xD;
           questionnaire selecting 10 as a score of low function based on pain being the common&#xD;
           question they receive. The changes made do not involve adding any new words or content&#xD;
           changes that would be expected to alter nature of answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If questions arise regarding the content of the SEV then the treating physical&#xD;
                therapist will be permitted to answer and apply the content at their discretion.&#xD;
                All therapists will have pre-approved the content of the video to ensure there are&#xD;
                no contradictions to their usual methods of care. Data will be gathered for up to 3&#xD;
                months.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is a clinical outcome tool that was designed and validated for the purpose of tracking changes in function for patients with a wide variety of clinical conditions. This is measuring up to three patient identified important activities which are each scored on a 0 to 10 scale. On this scale 0 indicates &quot;unable to perform activity&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;able to perform activity&quot;</description>
