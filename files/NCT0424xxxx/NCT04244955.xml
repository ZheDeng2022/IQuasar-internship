  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cancer diagnostic announcement and cancer care are both physical and psychological&#xD;
      highlights. The main objective is to analyze significant psychological difficulties in&#xD;
      children aged 6 to 16 treated for cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder in young children are often underdiagnosed because&#xD;
      the criteria of DSM-IV and ICD-10 are not suitable for these children. These symptoms are&#xD;
      nightmares, sleep problems, compulsive and joyless gambling, regression, hyper attention,&#xD;
      anxiety over new separation, and new fears. It is also known that the disorders are readily&#xD;
      more marked at the start of treatment and then subside throughout the first year. Some may&#xD;
      appear afterwards after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the prevalence of mental disorders linked to&#xD;
      diagnosis and care during treatment and their link with the practice of care. This study will&#xD;
      focus on disorders during treatment. We will study the psychic impact of the announcement of&#xD;
      diagnosis and care, whether they belong to the traumatic dimension or not. For this, we will&#xD;
      use the validated French version of the Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTS-RI)&#xD;
      scale. It is the most widely used scale in clinical research of trauma and reactive mental&#xD;
      disorders in children 6 to 16 years of age. We will also assess the most disturbing elements&#xD;
      for the child and the main clinical manifestations found in order to improve the detection of&#xD;
      mental disorders and the care support for these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will allow us to assess the prevalence of mental disorders in connection with&#xD;
      the care practiced within the Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (IHOPe) and,&#xD;
      subsequently, to establish a another intervention research protocol to improve our practices&#xD;
      and the care of these patients.&#xD;

    <description>The interviews, carried out by the child psychiatrist, will be semi-directive and short (15 to 30 minutes) one-on-one with the child or adolescent so that the presence of the parents does not influence the responses. The CPTS-RI index, which has 20 questions, will be filled, as well as other questions to understand what is problematic for the child.</description>
