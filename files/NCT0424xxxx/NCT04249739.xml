    <description>Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Keytruda ™ (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</description>

             test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
