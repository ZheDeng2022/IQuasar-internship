  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of full cuspal coverage restoration for the management root treated teeth was&#xD;
      advocated by many clinical studies and supported by systematic reviews. However, most of the&#xD;
      studies did not take into account the amount of tooth structure remaining before providing&#xD;
      cuspal coverage. The strength and fracture resistance of the tooth has been shown to be&#xD;
      positively correlated with the amount of tooth structure remaining. A more conservative&#xD;
      treatment option could be selected for a root treated tooth with good amount of remaining&#xD;
      tooth structure such as direct restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the survival and success of root&#xD;
      treated teeth with occlusal cavities and at least three intact axial walls, when restored&#xD;
      through the use of indirect full cuspal coverage restorations vs direct composite resin&#xD;
      restorations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The management of posterior endodontically treated teeth (ETT) is still to this day&#xD;
      considered a controversial topic.The use of full cuspal coverage restoration for the&#xD;
      management ETT was advocated by many clinical studies and supported by systematic reviews.&#xD;
      However, most of the studies did not take into account the amount of tooth structure&#xD;
      remaining before providing cuspal coverage. An ETT tooth with an MOD cavity will be at a&#xD;
      higher risk of fracture than an ETT tooth with just an occlusal cavity. Managing both with&#xD;
      cuspal coverage could be considered an overtreatment and an unnecessary removal of tooth&#xD;
      structure. The strength and fracture resistance of the tooth has been shown to be positively&#xD;
      correlated with the amount of tooth structure remaining. A more conservative treatment option&#xD;
      could be selected for an ETT with good amount of remaining tooth structure such as direct&#xD;
      restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the survival and success of ETT with&#xD;
      occlusal cavities and at least three intact axial walls, when restored through the use of&#xD;
      indirect full cuspal coverage restorations vs direct composite resin restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Managed with direct intracoronal composite resin restoration. Group 2: Managed with&#xD;
      a direct composite resin restoration, followed by an indirect full coverage restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recalled at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol for each group Group 1: Patient receiving a composite resin restoration.&#xD;
      Following rubber dam isolation, the temporary restoration will be removed. The enamel will be&#xD;
      selectively etched with 37% phosphoric acid and rinsed and dried thoroughly till a white&#xD;
      frost appearance appeared. An adhesive system (ScotchBond Multi-Purpose - 3M ESPE) will then&#xD;
      be applied to the dentine according to the manufacturer instructions and then will be cured&#xD;
      for 30 seconds. The direct restoration will be made using a microhybrid resin composite&#xD;
      (Filtek Z350, 3M ESPE), which will be applied in increments and each increment cured for 40&#xD;
      seconds. Glycerin will be applied to the final restoration and cured for 5 seconds to prevent&#xD;
      the development of the oxygen inhibition layer. The restoration will then be finished with&#xD;
      ultra-fine diamond finishing burs, and polished with Sof-Lex discs (3M ESPE) and 0.1&#xD;
      micrometer particle size diamond paste. Occlusion will be checked to conform to the patient's&#xD;
      current occlusion status and make sure no interferences were introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients receiving a composite resin restoration and followed with an indirect full&#xD;
      coverage restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same steps used as for group 1 would be followed to build the composite resin core. This&#xD;
      will be followed with a preparation for the indirect full cuspal restoration. Three&#xD;
      additional silicone putty indices will be made; one will be made for the production of a&#xD;
      provisional crown, and the other two will be cut and used as reduction indices (one will be&#xD;
      cut mesio-distally and the other one will be cut facially-lingually/palatally). The&#xD;
      preparation will be carried out with diamond burs. The guidelines to be followed will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supra or equigingival margins if aesthetic was of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chamfer finish-line&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 mm occlusal reduction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.5 mm axial reduction all around Following the application of two double retraction&#xD;
           cord sizes 00 and 0 (Ultradent), the impression will be made with additional silicone&#xD;
           (Zermack) and the cast poured in Die stone. The crown will be fabricated in the&#xD;
           laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temporary crown made from self-cure bisacrylic (Protemp, 3M ESPE) would be cemented using&#xD;
      Eugenol free temporary crown and bridge cement (TempBond). All crowns will be cemented after&#xD;
      1 week using Resin modified glass ionomer cement (RelyX luting plus, 3M ESPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up appointments and data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual inspection conducted with loops at magnification 4.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of the continuity of the margins of the restoration with the tooth structure&#xD;
           by use of an explorer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal probing performed with a periodontal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color photos (1:1 mirror shots) of the restorations were taken with standard film&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periapical and bitewing radiographic examination was performed by use of a paralleling&#xD;
           technique at 65 kV and 8 mA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients reported outcome measures (PROM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of success or failure will be performed by 2 examiners other than the operator.&#xD;
