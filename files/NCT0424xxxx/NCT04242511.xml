      This study compares blood levels of tuberculosis medications between diabetic patients and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients. There is some research that suggests these medications are at lower&#xD;
      levels in diabetic patients with tuberculosis, and this could adversely affect the outcome of&#xD;
      their infection. Diabetic patients are at higher risk of dying or having a severe episode of&#xD;
      tuberculosis therefore it is important that their care is optimised as far as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the research question all participants in the study will have an extra blood sample&#xD;
      drawn at the same time as their routine blood tests which are used to monitor their&#xD;
      tuberculosis treatment. Some participants will have additional blood samples taken at&#xD;
      different times to give a more accurate picture of the medication levels in their&#xD;
      bloodstream. The study will be conducted in the tuberculosis clinics at London North West&#xD;
      University Healthcare NHS Trust and will include adult patients with and without diabetes who&#xD;
      have recently been diagnosed with tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some other information about their routine medications, weight and height, and severity of&#xD;
      diabetes will also be collected, to see if these affect the medication levels in the&#xD;
      bloodstream as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a case-controlled study measuring tuberculosis medication levels in diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients on treatment for tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our tuberculosis clinic checks the levels of glycosalated haemoglobin (HbA1c), a marker of&#xD;
      diabetes, in all patients with a new diagnosis of tuberculosis before they start treatment.&#xD;
      All patients who are either known to have diabetes or have a raised HbA1c level will be&#xD;
      identified at their clinic appointment. Patients who have a raised HbA1c and are not known to&#xD;
      have diabetes will have a repeat blood test to confirm the result as part of normal clinical&#xD;
      practice. If their level is still raised or they are known to have diabetes they will be&#xD;
      asked if they wish to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be provided with a patient information leaflet and given the opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions, and discuss with friends and family if preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they agree to participate their tuberculosis care will continue as usual. Part of the&#xD;
      standard care for our TB patients is to have blood tests at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks&#xD;
      after starting treatment, to check for toxicity from the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be asked to take their TB medications as usual on the morning of their scheduled&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the time at which they took their doses they will be asked to either take a&#xD;
      time-stamped video of themselves taking their morning tablets, or to text or call the study&#xD;
      co-ordinator when they take their tablets. They will then be asked to come in for the blood&#xD;
      test 2 hours later. Prior to the blood test their consent will be confirmed and they will be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to ask questions or withdraw from the study. Along with the routine&#xD;
      blood tests (to check full blood count, liver and kidney functions) a further sample will be&#xD;
      taken to check levels of the TB medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also have their weight checked, and be asked if their other medications (eg for&#xD;
      diabetes) have changed since their first clinic appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are known to have abdominal tuberculosis, or are suspected to have other problems&#xD;
      with absorbing food and medications, they will be asked to stay for a second blood test&#xD;
      between 0 and 8 hours after they took their medication. This will help identify the peak&#xD;
      medication level more accurately if absorption from the gut is delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small number of the diabetic patients may also be asked to inform the study co-ordinator&#xD;
      when they take their anti-diabetic medications so that the study blood sample can also be&#xD;
      used to measure the levels of their anti-diabetic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples for the routine tests will be processed by the hospital pathology lab as&#xD;
      usual. Study blood samples will be spun to separate the serum which contains the medications.&#xD;
      The serum will then be frozen at -20C, prior to being processed in batches using High&#xD;
      Performance Liquid Chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant agrees the same procedure will be carried out at their 4 and 8 week&#xD;
      routine blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will be recruited from TB clinic in a similar way to cases. Patients who have an&#xD;
      HbA1c level &lt;48 mmol/mol and no history of diabetes will be reviewed to see if they meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. This will include assessing whether they are in the same weight&#xD;
      category (5kg bands e.g. 50-54kg, 55-59kg, 60-64kg etc) as recruited diabetic patients. If&#xD;
      they consent to participate then they will be asked to follow the same study protocol as the&#xD;
      diabetic cases, as detailed above.&#xD;

        This study will be conducted in the tuberculosis clinics at London North West University&#xD;
        Healthcare NHS Trust. The study participants will be recruited from patients with a&#xD;
        diagnosis of tuberculosis, with and without diabetes. Diabetes is a common comorbidity in&#xD;
        tuberculosis patients in this area, with a prevalence of around 15 to 20%.&#xD;
