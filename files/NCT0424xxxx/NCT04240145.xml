  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease&#xD;
      world wide . Severe forms of NAFLD such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigating risk factors associated with hepatic steatosis is required to perform effective&#xD;
      screening .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic steatosis develops for a variety reasons but obesity is the most common associated&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is considered a gateway disease and NAFLD is considered to be one of the phenotypes&#xD;
      of metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by obesity with visceral fat accumulation,&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with severe obesity have a disproportionately high risk of comorbidities&#xD;
      including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of fat appears more important than the total fat mass in obesity .A&#xD;
      predominantly upper body fat distribution increases the risks for the metabolic complications&#xD;
      of obesity including hepatic steatosis especially when it is associated with increased intra&#xD;
      abdominal fat .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most &quot;metabolically obese&quot; normal weight subjects have some increase in adipose tissue mass&#xD;
      and insulin resistance probably due to an increase in visceral fat. Thus, subjects with a&#xD;
      relatively low BMI can have gross increases in abdominal visceral fat, and others with a high&#xD;
      BMI may have very little intra abdominal/visceral fat .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggested visceral adiposity to be a clinical predictor of hepatic steatosis&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the severity of fatty liver has been linked to the VAT area as evaluated by CT.&#xD;
