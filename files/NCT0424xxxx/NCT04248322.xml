  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study through the use of semi-structured interviews or focus groups will explore the&#xD;
      lived experience with a Connected Catheter and usual customary care (UCC) of catheter users&#xD;
      with Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction and their caretakers to generate user-defined&#xD;
      themes regarding bladder function and catheter-related barriers and the daily impacts on&#xD;
      one's life.&#xD;

      Identify NLUTD user-defined themes regarding bladder function and catheter-related barriers&#xD;
      and the daily impacts on one's life Specific Aim: Using iterative, semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      or focus groups to explore the lived experience with CC and usual customary care (UCC) of&#xD;
      catheter users with NLUTD and their caretakers to generate user-defined themes regarding&#xD;

        We will recruit a homogenous group of those with NLUTD, then stratify on usual bladder&#xD;
        management and etiology (SB, MS, SCI, stroke, PD). These characteristics will create a 2&#xD;
        (bladder management) x ~5 (etiology) = 10 cell matrix for recruiting for participant&#xD;
        interviews. We plan to interview two individuals per cell (n=20) for participant&#xD;
        interviews. Caregiver (n=20) interviews will be done for those who care for individuals&#xD;
        with similar bladder managements and etiologies.&#xD;
