  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INVOcell intravaginal culture system is a prescription device intended for preparing,&#xD;
      holding, and transferring human gametes or embryos during intravaginal in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      or intravaginal culture procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original (FG-002) INVOcell culture system was FDA cleared through De Novo application&#xD;
      (DEN150008). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the INVO Bioscience modified INVOcell&#xD;
      system, comprised of the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture Device and Retention Device, in terms&#xD;
      of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Effectiveness of achieving fertilization, implantation, embryo development, clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy, and live birth after 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 The comfort and retention of the INVOcell device and retention system intravaginally.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Pivotal, single arm, multicenter, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      comfort and retention of the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture Device and Retention Device over&#xD;
      5-days vaginal incubation. The effectiveness of the INVOcell device will be tested on a&#xD;
      select population of infertile couples at several in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers. The&#xD;
      providers at each center will conduct the processes of ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval and&#xD;
      embryo transfer per the standard protocols for their centers. The planned sample size is 180&#xD;
      participants across 3 sites (60 participants per site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, comfort and retention of the INVOcell&#xD;
      with the retention device, and demonstrate superiority following 5-day vaginal incubation as&#xD;
      compared to current 3-day vaginal incubation indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the following will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The INVO Procedure using the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture Device can effectively&#xD;
           maintain 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation with the transfer of blastocyst(s) at&#xD;
           the end of the 5-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Retention Device retains the INVOcell in the vaginal cavity and is well tolerated&#xD;
           during the 5-days of continuous vaginal incubation.&#xD;
