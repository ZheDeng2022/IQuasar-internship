  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until 2013 the reported incidence of chronic kidney disease varied widely between countries,&#xD;
      reporting the highest prevalence Taiwan, the region of Jalisco in Mexico and United States,&#xD;
      with 458, 421 and 363 individuals per million inhabitants respectively. Mexico has around&#xD;
      52,000 patients in replacement therapies, of which 80% of patients are treated in the&#xD;
      Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each stage of renal disease the principal cause of mortality is cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      The risk of cardiovascular mortality is greater than the general population. Arterial&#xD;
      calcification, a marker of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular mortality predictor is common&#xD;
      in chronic kidney disease. The presence of arterial calcification leads to an increase in&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and to a decrease in coronary perfusion resulting in cardiac hypertrophy&#xD;
      and myocardial ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia and old age cannot fully explain the high prevalence of atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      arterial calcification in chronic kidney disease. Another specific factors related to chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease, like hyperphosphatemia, high calcium concentration in dialysis solutions, use&#xD;
      of high doses of vitamin D for the management of hyperparathyroidism has been shown to&#xD;
      positively influence development of arterial calcification. Invitro studies show that in&#xD;
      presence of hyperphosphatemia smooth muscle cells are transformed into osteoblast-like cells&#xD;
      that can express proteins that regulate mineralization. Two of this proteins, the matrix Gla&#xD;
      protein (MGP) and osteocalcin (OC) are regulators of tissue mineralization in arterial walls&#xD;
      and bones respectively. Vitamin K is required as cofactor in the gamma-carboxylation process&#xD;
      of several extracellular matrix proteins, converting inactive carboxylated proteins to&#xD;
      carboxylated active proteins. Prothrombin and coagulation factors 7,9 y 10 require vitamin K2&#xD;
      for its carboxylation process, while osteocalcin and the matrix Gal protein require vitamin&#xD;
      K1. Matrix Gla protein is a calcification inhibitor that plays an important role in the&#xD;
      prevention of arterial calcification. For carboxylation and correct function of the MGP is&#xD;
      necessary an enzymatic cofactor, vitamin K; this is corroborated in the fact that the&#xD;
      antagonism of vitamin K with warfarin antagonizes the carboxylation of MGP and produces rapid&#xD;
      arterial calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no studies evaluating vitamin K in the prevention of vascular&#xD;
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease, therefore, the role of vitamin K in&#xD;
      the patient with kidney disease needs to be clarified with randomized controlled studies, in&#xD;
      which the target will be this population of patients at high risk. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of phytomenadione on coronary artery calcification of patients on&#xD;
      hemodialysis compared to placebo, our research hypothesis is that phytomenadione slows the&#xD;
      progression and favors the regression of coronary arterial calcification in patients on&#xD;
      hemodialysis compared to placebo, evaluating the coronary calcium score by coronary&#xD;
      tomography. As secondary objectives was determine changes in the baseline coronary calcium&#xD;
      score and at 12 months of use of phytomenadione and presence of cardiovascular events like&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina and death of cardiac cause. The intervention&#xD;
      group received phytomenadione 10 mg (1 vial in the venous line of the extracorporeal&#xD;
      hemodialysis circuit) post hemodialysis 3 times a week for 12 months and the control group 1&#xD;
      vial of placebo solution (solution for injection in the venous line of the extracorporeal&#xD;
      hemodialysis circuit) post hemodialysis 3 times a week for 12 months. The follow-up of the&#xD;
      patients was for 12 months, at the end of the follow-up, a coronary control tomography was&#xD;
      performed by the Radiology Department to assess the final calcium score. Relative risk&#xD;
      measurement (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number to be treated (NTT) were&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our hospital (Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad No. 1 Bajío), there are about 130&#xD;
      patients on hemodialysis and estimation of cardiovascular risk is done through basic studies&#xD;
      as the lipid profile, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram and its management is determined&#xD;
      by classical interventions like diabetes control, hypertension and statins use, which have&#xD;
      not shown an increase in patient survival, and it is clear that more dramatic interventions&#xD;
      to normalize phosphate, such as intensive dialysis and even renal transplantation, cannot&#xD;
      reverse vascular calcification. This may be because the reversion process needs to be&#xD;
      activated at the cellular level, interventions such as the use of vitamin K as a strong&#xD;
      tissue calcification inhibitor can be an active tool for the reversal of vascular&#xD;
      calcification in chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By demonstrating a reversal of coronary calcification with the use of vitamin K, the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular events can be reduced, thus decreasing the progression of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis and the risk of acute myocardial infarction. The use of vitamin K&#xD;
      may represent an economic intervention that could be implemented in the other hospital&#xD;
      centers as a primary part of management in patients with chronic kidney disease in&#xD;
      hemodialysis. Based on this we ask the following research question: ¿What is the effect of&#xD;
      phytomenadione on the calcification of coronary arteries in patients on hemodialysis compared&#xD;
      to placebo?. Our research hypothesis was that phytomenadione slows the progression and favors&#xD;
      the regression of coronary arterial calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized clinical trial was designed with double blinding compared to placebo, the type&#xD;
      of sampling was simple random probabilistic and the universe of study patients on&#xD;
      hemodialysis of the Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad No. 1 Bajío, with diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease of any etiology that meet the tomographic criterion of a coronary calcium&#xD;
      score of 10 Agatston units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease in hemodialysis Patients who have 6 months or more on&#xD;
      hemodialysis Patients over 18 years Patients that meet the tomographic criterion of a&#xD;
      coronary calcium score of 10 Agatston units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female right-holders of the IMSS&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in previous or current treatment with phytomenadione Coronary stent patients&#xD;
      Patients with arrhythmias and requiring oral anticoagulation with warfarin or acenocoumarin&#xD;
      Pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who undergo renal transplantation during the follow-up period Patients who change&#xD;
      the modality to peritoneal dialysis during the follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elimination criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who wish to leave the study Patients allergic to vitamin K The start date of the&#xD;
      study was after approval by the Electronic Registration System of the Health Research&#xD;
      Coordination (SIRELCIS by its acronym in spanish) until the entire universe is completed and&#xD;
      12 months follow-up of the intervention. This work was approved by the local research and&#xD;
      ethics committee, approved with the registration number R-2017-501-16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on the article by Block et al (2005) where the annual&#xD;
      proportion of coronary artery calcification in patients on hemodialysis was evaluated with&#xD;
      placebo use, which was 88%. Assuming that with the use of vitamin K the proportion of&#xD;
      patients presenting with progression of coronary artery calcification will be 70%, plus an&#xD;
      alpha error of 0.05, a test power of 80% and a single tail, a size of 27 patients per group&#xD;
      was obtained, considering a loss of 10% the sample was increased to 30 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology was as follows: within the population of hemodialysis patients, patients who&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria were sought, once the participation in the study was accepted and&#xD;
      an informed consent was signed, a coronary tomography was performed and, after completing the&#xD;
      sample size, the patients were randomized using a random number letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary tomography was performed and interpreted by UMAE No. 1 Radiology staff, who had no&#xD;
      knowledge about the study groups or their intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the study group was administered 10 mg of phytomenadione (1 vial in the venous line of the&#xD;
      extracorporeal hemodialysis circuit) post hemodialysis 3 times a week, and to the group&#xD;
      control a placebo solution post hemodialysis 3 times a week; both vitamin K and placebo were&#xD;
      provided by the hospital pharmacy. After each application, both the drug and the placebo were&#xD;
      monitored for adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up of the patients was for 12 months, at the end of the follow-up, a coronary&#xD;
      control tomography was performed by the Radiology Department to assess the final calcium&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory studies were processed in the hospital's laboratory and are part of the&#xD;
      follow-up studies of patients with chronic kidney disease, they were requested upon admission&#xD;
      of the patients in the study and at the end of the 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are presented with descriptive statistics with mean and standard deviation or&#xD;
      median with confidence intervals according to the type of variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative variables were analyzed using Chi square or exact Fisher test. Quantitative&#xD;
      variables using student's T or Mann Withney's W in case of not having normal distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare coronary artery calcification between the vitamin K and placebo groups, they were&#xD;
      compared using T from independent samples or U Mann Withney, and to compare the change&#xD;
      between baseline and final coronary calcification in both the intervention group and the&#xD;
      control group, the coronary calcium score delta was calculated, and a paired student's T or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test was performed. p values menor 0.05 were considered as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, relative risk measurement (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number to be&#xD;
      treated (NTT) were performed.&#xD;
