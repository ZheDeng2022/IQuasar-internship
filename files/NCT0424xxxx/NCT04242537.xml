  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apneic oxygenation is a process of delivering continuous oxygen during direct laryngoscopy.&#xD;
      Nasal cannulas are used for the purpose of oxygenation; for delivering either low flow or&#xD;
      high flow oxygen but haven't been tested in terms of a superior study design on improving&#xD;
      patient outcomes. In this study the investigators propose to assess the effect of giving low&#xD;
      flow oxygen with head side elevation versus high flow oxygen with head side elevation against&#xD;
      the usual practice of care in which no oxygen is provided during direct laryngoscopy on&#xD;
      participant's oxygenation level. This will be a three arm study instituting block&#xD;
      randomization technique. There will be no blinding due to the nature of intervention. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes are lowest non-invasive oxygen saturation measurement during direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and two minutes after the placement of the tube and first pass success rate. The&#xD;
      intervention is unique as the investigators have introduced head side elevation up to 30&#xD;
      degrees for improving glottis visualization and low or high flow oxygen delivery on grounds&#xD;
      to improve oxygenation for patient safety undergoing endotracheal intubation. The technique&#xD;
      if proved successful can be employed as a method of airway management in the emergency room.&#xD;
      The results of the study will open new horizons for the development of guidelines to utilize&#xD;
      it as a routine measure, during airway management in the emergency room.&#xD;

      Intervention (High Flow and Low Flow):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants after fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      respective arm (High Flow, Low Flow or Standard). For procedure, depending upon the arm, the&#xD;
      head side of the patient bed will be elevated up to 30 degrees in order to better visualize&#xD;
      the glottis. The participants in the high flow oxygen delivery through nasal cannula&#xD;
      preoxygenation will be set for 4 min at 6 L/min through humidified and heated pure oxygen&#xD;
      (fraction of inspired oxygen 100%, 37C). Similarly, participant in the low flow oxygen&#xD;
      delivery through nasal cannula preoxygenation will be set for 4 min at 3 L/min through&#xD;
      humidified and heated pure oxygen (faction of inspired oxygen 100%, 37C). Throughout the&#xD;
      procedure the high flow nasal cannula or low flow nasal cannula will be maintained trying to&#xD;
      achieve a continuous oxygen during direct laryngoscopy for RSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the standard arm the head end of the bed will not be raised to 30 degrees instead the&#xD;
      whole bed is raised up to the operator belly button in order to ease glottis visualization.&#xD;
      In the standard group the preoxygenation is for 4 min or till achievement of peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation greater than 95% with a face mask that will be connected to the oxygen port&#xD;
      at 10 L/min. During the direct laryngoscopy there will be no insufflation of oxygen through&#xD;
      nasal cannula or face mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff involved in collecting data, will be independent from primary research team in&#xD;
      order to minimize observer bias. The oxygen saturations will be recorded using pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (through a standard infrared oximetry tape) exclusively used for research purpose and will&#xD;
      record time using stop watch (Casio Digital Stop Watch) during and after the procedure. The&#xD;
      operator will report research staff about all subjective assessments of difficult intubation&#xD;
      and airway complications during procedure on the data collection tool. The operator while&#xD;
      performing the direct laryngoscopy, if experience difficulty as per Corkman Lehman grade,&#xD;
      will inform research staff for protocol deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation attempts (number of time laryngoscope blade placed in the mouth) will be counted&#xD;
      for each patient. In those patients where first pass is failed and subsequent attempt is made&#xD;
      without assisted ventilation, the apnea time will be noted as mentioned above. To confirm the&#xD;
      accuracy of data collected, the investigators will conduct a concurrent assessment of the&#xD;
      outcomes for a convenience sample of 10% of enrolled participants.&#xD;
