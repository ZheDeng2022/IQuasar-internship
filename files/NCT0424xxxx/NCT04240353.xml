  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious but treatable chronic health&#xD;
      condition. Optimised management improves symptoms, complications, quality of life and&#xD;
      survival. Disease exacerbations, which have adverse outcomes and often trigger hospital&#xD;
      admissions, underpin the rising costs of managing COPD (projected increase in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK) to Â£2.3bn by 2030). The costs and care-quality gap of COPD exacerbations,&#xD;
      coupled with the global rising prevalence present a major healthcare challenge. This study&#xD;
      proposal, which has been developed in partnership with patients, clinicians, enterprise and&#xD;
      government representation is to conduct an implementation and effectiveness observational&#xD;
      cohort study to establish a continuous and preventative digital health service model for&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation proposals comprise: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishing a digital resource for high-risk COPD patients which contains symptom&#xD;
           diaries (structured patient reported outcome questionnaires), integrates physiology&#xD;
           monitoring (FitBit and home NIV therapy data), enables asynchronous communication with&#xD;
           clinical team, supports COPD self-management and tracks interaction with the service&#xD;
           (for endpoint analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishing a cloud-based clinical COPD dashboard which will integrate background&#xD;
           electronic health record data, core COPD clinical dataset, patient-reported outcomes,&#xD;
           physiology and therapy data and patient messaging to provide clinical decision support&#xD;
           and practice-efficiencies, enhancing delivery of guideline-based COPD care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use the acquired dataset to explore feasibility and accuracy of machine-learned&#xD;
           predictive modelling risk scores, via cloud-based infrastructure, which will be for&#xD;
           future prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary endpoint for the effectiveness evaluation is number of patients screened and&#xD;
      recruited who successfully utilise and engage with this RECEIVER clinical service. The&#xD;
      implementation components of the project will be iterated during the study, based on patient&#xD;
      and clinical user experience and engagement. Secondary endpoints include a number of&#xD;
      specified clinical outcomes, clinical service outcomes, machine-learning supported&#xD;
      exploratory analyses, patient-centred outcomes and healthcare cost analyses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened from emergency attendance or admission at South and North Sector&#xD;
      (Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, and Glasgow Royal Infirmary) and from referrals to the&#xD;
      COPD clinical team at these sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be approached and offered enrolment to the study.&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent timings will be individualised to be most efficient and least&#xD;
      burdensome for patients. For some patients it will be appropriate to do this immediately to&#xD;
      avoid burden of repeated attendances; for some patients, delay and consideration may be&#xD;
      appropriate; for some patients the enrolment and engagement may be a staged process (consent&#xD;
      at time of hospital attendance, study commence at follow up home or clinic visit etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited will receive support information and assistance with login setups for the&#xD;
      digital service components. Literature with frequently asked questions (FAQs), and team&#xD;
      contacts for service support are available for throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled will be asked, and prompted with text notifications, to complete daily&#xD;
      short structured COPD symptom questionnaire. There are a small number of additional questions&#xD;
      on a weekly basis, with quality of life questions completed once every 28 days. Patients&#xD;
      recruited will have a &quot;Fitbit&quot; wristband wearable to monitor physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure will additionally be on home non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV) treatment - this is part of their routine clinical care rather than a study&#xD;
      intervention. However, the study patient resource and messaging system will be used to gather&#xD;
      information and support this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients, who are recruited during hospital admission or attendance and will be&#xD;
      attending outpatient clinic follow up, will undergo exploratory physiology measurements -&#xD;
      parasternal electromyography (EMG) (similar to electrocardiography (ECG) recording, takes ~20&#xD;
      minutes with breathing manoeuvres), oscillometry (a breathing test involving 10 resting&#xD;
      non-effortful breaths blown into the medical device), home pollution monitoring (a pack which&#xD;
      rests in patients bedroom +/- tube placed outside house) for 7 days - alongside routine&#xD;
      clinical care at baseline and 3 monthly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have linked access from the patient resource to curated information about COPD&#xD;
      diagnosis, and all aspects of management. Specific prompts about management - e.g. timing to&#xD;
      make appointment for annual flu vaccination - will be provided through platform-text&#xD;
      notifications. Self-management content of the resource will potentially be further developed&#xD;
      over iterations within the study; any change in content of patient materials would be advised&#xD;
      as a protocol amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be able to message the clinical team using the patient portal. This supplements&#xD;
      existing availability of answer phone contact details provided as part of routine clinical&#xD;
      care. Automatic messages will notify patients that this is not for emergency contact, and&#xD;
      that replies should be expected within Mon-Fri working hours, by next working day. This&#xD;
      messaging system will be used to support self management, home oxygen and home NIV treatment&#xD;
      initiation and monitoring, and practical aspects such as appointment scheduling and equipment&#xD;
      consumable replenishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical team will be able to access the data from the patients symptom diaries, wearable&#xD;
      and NIV physiology directly - asynchronously, rather than delayed acquisition of this data at&#xD;
      a clinical contact. This data visualisation will support routine clinical care, and better&#xD;
      inform unscheduled advice contacts from patients (e.g. help determine significance of&#xD;
      apparent worsening symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be subject to machine-learning analysis, which will evaluate secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, as per protocol.&#xD;
