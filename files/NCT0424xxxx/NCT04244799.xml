  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of school-based behavioral &quot;nudges&quot; installed in toilets and&#xD;
      handwashing facilities on handwashing behavior among students in the Philippines. Nudges&#xD;
      include: visible signage crafted to trigger behavioral motivators for handwashing; colorful&#xD;
      pathway overlaid with footprints leading from the toilet to the handwashing station; sticker&#xD;
      of a pair of eyes placed above the handwashing station; soap dish with an arrow beside it on&#xD;
      the sink or counter to remind children to wash their hands with soap. The study's main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that behavioral nudges will increase the percentage of students who wash their&#xD;
      hands with water and soap after toilet use by 7 percentage points or more among schools where&#xD;
      nudges were installed compared to control schools without nudges. The study is taking place&#xD;
      in public primary schools in Zamboanga Del Norte, Philippines between October 2019 and May&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of the behavioral nudge intervention will be evaluated using a cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT). The investigators will randomly select 132 Department of Education&#xD;
      (DepEd) schools across Zamboanga Del Norte province to comprise the study sample. 66 schools&#xD;
      will be assigned to the treatment group, and 66 schools to the control group. Treatment&#xD;
      schools will receive the behavioral nudge intervention, while control group will not. Both&#xD;
      treatment and control schools will receive DepEd's national WASH in Schools (WinS) policy.&#xD;
      WinS promotes &quot;correct hygiene and sanitation practices among school children and a clean&#xD;
      environment in and around schools&quot; and includes initiatives related to infrastructure,&#xD;
      knowledge, and behavior change, but does not include other programs with an explicit focus on&#xD;
      handwashing promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four months after installing nudges, enumerators will conduct structured observations in&#xD;
      study schools, observing whether pupils wash their hands with soap, wash without soap, or do&#xD;
      not wash, after they have used classroom toilets. This will be used to estimate the causal&#xD;
      impact of the nudges intervention on rates of independent handwashing with water and soap&#xD;
      after toilet use.&#xD;
