  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will address a critical knowledge gap: there are no evidence-based&#xD;
      smartphone apps for reducing young adult drinking. The purpose of the study is to test&#xD;
      alcohol-related smartphone applications designed to provide assistance during actual drinking&#xD;
      situations to help young adults reduce their drinking. It is the researchers hypothesis that&#xD;
      participants will self-administer less alcohol when using the experimental app with feedback.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An app giving in-the-moment feedback could increase perceived impairment, and reduce drinking&#xD;
      and consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cued go/no-go (CGNG) task is an ideal choice for in-the-moment impairment feedback. Its&#xD;
      instructions are simple; practice effects are minimal; and is sensitive to alcohol. The CGNG&#xD;
      tests ability to respond fast to &quot;go&quot; targets (activation) while withholding response to&#xD;
      &quot;no-go&quot; targets (inhibition). Activation/inhibition tension is externally valid. Dual process&#xD;
      models posit risk behaviors stem from overactive appetitive drives that are compelling and&#xD;
      hard to inhibit. Poor CGNG performance post-alcohol has been related to poor simulated&#xD;
      driving, enhancing external validity. Moderate dosing to .05-.06% blood alcohol content (BAC)&#xD;
      reliably increases inhibition errors, but slowing reaction time (RT) to &quot;go&quot; cues requires&#xD;
      higher doses. RT to go cues often recovers later in a drinking episode (acute tolerance) but&#xD;
      ability to inhibit does not. Thus at this BAC, ability to respond remains but inhibition is&#xD;
      impaired, which relates to risk behaviors like DUI as young adults underrate impairment.&#xD;

After initial use of their randomized app, they will then be dosed to .06% blood alcohol content (BAC) in groups of 3 in a naturalistic lab, followed by app use, then 1-hr when they can self-administer alcohol up to .12%.
