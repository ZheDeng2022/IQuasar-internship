  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Chilean National Health Survey 2009-2010, 60% of woman in reproductive age&#xD;
      are overweight or obese with detrimental consequences on women as well as offspring´s health&#xD;
      at long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New efforts are required to clarify how increased maternal body fat and obesity previous and&#xD;
      during pregnancy impinge an increased cardiometabolic and obesity risk in the progeny.&#xD;
      Nowadays it is clear that obesity in adults constitute a chronic state of sub-clinical&#xD;
      inflammation characterized by an increased infiltration of monocytes in the adipose tissue as&#xD;
      well as an imbalance between increased pro- (M1) and decreased anti- (M2) inflammatory&#xD;
      macrophage polarization. Increased inflammatory markers have been found in obese children as&#xD;
      young as 3 years of age, but if these markers are present at birth is completely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, unveiling the mechanisms implicated in the capability of monocytes to&#xD;
      differentiate into pro-inflammatory macrophages at birth would contribute to establish early&#xD;
      markers of the potential risk to develop cardio-metabolic diseases. In this context,&#xD;
      modulation of M1-M2 polarization seems to be crucial for the development of altered immune&#xD;
      response, and this process would be tightly regulated by epigenetic mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) play a role as precursors&#xD;
      of cellular membrane components and modifiers, and as precursors of a plethora of signaling&#xD;
      molecules that participates in cardiovascular, metabolic and immune functions. Additionally,&#xD;
      DHA regulates gene expression in monocytes and macrophages altering the M1/M2 polarization.&#xD;
      The supplementation with DHA in a high risk population of pregestational obese mothers, with&#xD;
      known low n-3 intake, would have an important impact on newborn and infant % body fat. An&#xD;
      improvement in the n-6/n-3 LCPUFA ratio during pregnancy in humans could represent a primary&#xD;
      prevention strategy to revert fetal and neonatal high body fat and a healthy immune system&#xD;
      maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this proposal is that neonates born from obese mothers supplemented with&#xD;
      DHA during pregnancy show a reduction in specific markers of high-risk of obesity. These&#xD;
      markers would be evidenced as a lower percent of body fat at birth and at 4 months of age, as&#xD;
      well as the reversion of functional and epigenetic changes in neonatal monocytes at birth,&#xD;
      compared to neonates from obese mothers with low DHA intake.&#xD;

      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In neonates born from pregnant women with normal BMI (&gt; 18.5 and &lt;24,9) at the first prenatal&#xD;
      visit (&lt;14 weeks of gestation) (Reference Group) and with pre-gestational obesity (BMI &gt;30&#xD;
      Kg/m2) with low (customary) DHA intake (200 mg/day) (MO Group) and pre-gestational obese&#xD;
      women supplemented with a high dose of DHA (800 mg/day)(MO+DHA Group) we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze whether maternal DHA supplementation modifies the body composition in neonates&#xD;
           and children at 4 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether maternal supplementation with DHA during pregnancy modifies the&#xD;
           balance of circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and metabolic markers in the&#xD;
           mother during pregnancy, the fetus, the placenta and the child at 4 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the response of macrophages to inflammatory mediators associates with&#xD;
           altered epigenetic markers in pro- and anti-inflammatory obesity-related-genes in fetal&#xD;
           monocytes from obese mothers and if DHA maternal supplementation reverts this phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether maternal obesity translates into changes in the genome-wide DNA&#xD;
           methylation profile in fetal monocytes at birth and the impact of maternal DHA&#xD;
           supplementation on this epigenetic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY. The EpiFat study, is a nested cohort in the Maternal obesity control ThrouGh&#xD;
      Healthy nuTrition, MIGHT study (PI: Dr. Garmendia NCT02574767). MIGHT study randomized 1000&#xD;
      patients that began their prenatal care before 14 weeks of gestation to one of four parallel&#xD;
      study arms: 2 groups received 200 mg/day DHA (based on Schizochytrium oil, 100% DHA, DSM) and&#xD;
      2 groups 800 mg/day DHA, each group had a group with and one without home-based diet and&#xD;
      physical activity interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and follow up: At admission to the pre-delivery unit, midwives of the Dr. Sótero&#xD;
      del Río Hospital invite all the pregnant women who fulfill eligibility criteria to&#xD;
      participate in this study and carries out informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment in the EpiFat study, at delivery moment, midwife collect cord blood samples&#xD;
      and the placenta tissue. Between 24 to 48 hrs. after delivery, patients are visited by the&#xD;
      research midwife to perform anthropometry to the newborn and collect sociodemographic data&#xD;
      and clinical information about women health and delivery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 4 months the infants have a visit, in the Research Center in Eating Environment and&#xD;
      Prevention of Associated to Nutrition Chronic Diseases (CIAPEC for his Spanish acronym) from&#xD;
      the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA for his Spanish acronym), to evaluate&#xD;
      anthropometry and body composition. In this visit, infant blood samples (5 ml.) and infant&#xD;
      health status information are collected. Furthermore, maternal anthropometry is performed,&#xD;
      and infant feeding and food frequency surveys are applied to the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate sample size for body fat percentage (primary outcome) were considered a mean&#xD;
      difference of 2.5%, and 3.0 SD that were described by Catalano. Considering a power of 80%&#xD;
      and p-value of 0.05, the sample size estimation was 45 subjects per group. The calculation&#xD;
      was made using the software Statistics/Data Analysis STATA version 14.0 (Texas, USA).&#xD;
      Considering a 20% of loss to follow up the sample size was adjusted to 54 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary outcome &quot;the epigenetic-driven inflammatory response of neonatal&#xD;
      macrophages in vitro&quot; there is no evidence published. However, previous studies from our&#xD;
      group have shown that: For % of methylation in the IL-1β promoter, a sample size of 15&#xD;
      newborns per group from normal weight and obese mother was enough to find a statistical&#xD;
      difference between the groups, and for IL-10 in macrophages derived from neonatal monocytes&#xD;
      10 subjects per group was needed. Therefore, for these outcomes it was considered a sample&#xD;
      size of 15 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEWBORN AND MATERNAL VARIABLES OF THE STUDY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables included in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables of newborn/infants: % of body fat &amp; epigenetic-driven inflammatory response in&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Other maternal variables: parity, smoking habit, education (years), type of delivery,&#xD;
           placental weight (g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EX VIVO &amp; IN VITRO STUDIES UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD. Umbilical cord blood are collected after&#xD;
      delivery and before placental expulsion in Terumo blood collecting bags (40-100 ml) and&#xD;
      stored at 4°C until processing (within 1-5 hours after delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHA LEVELS IN MATERNAL AND FETAL BLOOD: These will be measured in MIGHT Study by gass&#xD;
      chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONOCYTE ISOLATION, CELL CULTURE AND MACROPHAGE DIFFERENTIATION. Peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMC) are separated shortly after birth by Ficoll density gradient using&#xD;
      Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, US) centrifugation and incubated in RPMI 1640&#xD;
      medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, US) and seeded at density of 8 to 10 × 106 cells/mL in 100&#xD;
      mm culture dishes at 5% CO2 for 2 h at 37°C. Monocyte identity is assessed by flow cytometry.&#xD;
      Monocytes are cultured for 7 days to assess macrophage differentiation. Macrophage&#xD;
      polarization is induced by exposing for 24 hours to 100 ng/mL of LPS (SigmaAldrich, Missouri,&#xD;
      US) and 20 ng/mL of INFγ (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, US) for M1 or, alternatively, to 20 ng/mL&#xD;
      of IL-4 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, US) for M2 in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% FBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells are seeded on plastic culture dishes and maintained in a controlled atmosphere&#xD;
      incubator, at 37°C with different experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUANTIFICATION OF PRO- AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, INSULIN, LEPTIN &amp; ADIPONECTIN IN&#xD;
      MATERNAL, NEONATAL AND INFANT PLASMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These pro and anti-inflammatory mediators, leptin and insulin are quantified using a&#xD;
      multiplexed (Bio-Plex platform) immunometric assay (MILLIPLEX xMAP High Sensitivity Human&#xD;
      Cytokine Panel, and human metabolic panel, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Quantification of&#xD;
      total adiponectin in umbilical cord plasma is done with High Molecular Weight &amp; Total&#xD;
      Adiponectin (ALPCO) ELISA kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREPARATION OF PLACENTAL HOMOGENATES. Placentas are collected at delivery and weighed after&#xD;
      trimming of the cord and membranes, immediately placed on ice after delivery and dissected.&#xD;
      The chorionic plate, amniotic sac, and decidua removed. Approximately 50 g of villous tissue&#xD;
      is cut into small pieces and rinsed with ice-cold physiological saline. Tissue will be placed&#xD;
      in ice-cold buffer D [250 mM sucrose, 0.7 μM pepstatin A, 1.6 μM antipain, 80 μM aprotinin, 1&#xD;
      mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4)] at 4°C and homogenized on ice using a polytron. The&#xD;
      homogenate is snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis or further&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUANTITATIVE PCR FOR IN VITRO EXPRESSION OF CYTOKINES. RNA is isolated from monocytes using a&#xD;
      commercial kit (GenElute, Sigma), according to manufacturer instructions. RT is perform be&#xD;
      with the ImProm-II Reverse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcription System (Promega). PCR is carried out using oligonucleotide primers for human&#xD;
      TNFα, IL-6, Il-1β, MCP-1 and IL-10. The levels of mRNAs for GADPH, ATP5F1 and RPLP2 are used&#xD;
      as internal references. Primers are validated for use: checking amplification, primer&#xD;
      concentrations, efficiency primers-HK and stability of HK in experimental conditions.&#xD;
      Relative expression of target genes is calculated using the 2-delta delta ct method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLOW CYTOMETRY FOR MONOCYTES CHARATERIZATION. The expression of different surface markers is&#xD;
      evaluated using flow cytometry, which is performed either in whole blood for identification&#xD;
      of monocyte subtypes or in vitro differentiated macrophages for identification of the&#xD;
      immunophenotype. Among circulating monocytes (CD86+ cells) classic and non-classic subtypes&#xD;
      are assessed according to their surface expression of CD14 and CD16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunophenotype of macrophages (i.e. M1 and M2) are assessed according to the expression of&#xD;
      specific markers (e.g. CCR2, CXCL13, CX3CR, CD62L, KLF4, TNFα, NO production). Samples are&#xD;
      stained in the laboratory and sent to a Flow Cytometry Facility at Universidad de Chile&#xD;
      (CyAnTM ADP analyzer (Beckman Coulter®), within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLOBAL DNA METHYLOME. The DNA Methylome analysis are done in collaboration with Dr. Graham&#xD;
      Burdge and Dr. Karen Lillycrop from Southampton using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip&#xD;
      kit from Illumina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS. DNA methylation status of the promoter regions (approximately 400&#xD;
      bp from the transcription start site) of the genes coding for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1,&#xD;
      IL-10, PPARγ and PCG1α will be determined using bisulfite modification coupled to DNA&#xD;
      sequencing. Briefly, total DNA extracts from cells will be treated with sodium bisulphite to&#xD;
      convert non-methylated cytosine to uracil, and promoter regions will be amplified by PCR&#xD;
      using specific according to the strategy used and published by our group. Briefly, one of the&#xD;
      PCR primers will be designed including a 5'-biotin tag, which will allow purification the&#xD;
      amplicon directly from the PCR mix. Then biotin-containing amplified DNA strand will be&#xD;
      transferred to a PyroMark Q96 MD pyrosequencer (Qiagen) for sequencing. Site-specific CpG&#xD;
      methylations will be determined as percentage, comparing the signal intensity of&#xD;
      non-bisulfite-sensitive CpG (conserved C, methylated CpG) and bisulfite-sensitive CpG&#xD;
      (converted C→T, unmethylated CpG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. For descriptive statistics will be applied mean ± SD or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range for quantitative variables, and percentage with n for categories.&#xD;
      Distributions will be verified with a Shapiro Wilk test. Differences in fat mass and&#xD;
      circulating markers will be determined by ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis according to data&#xD;
      distribution. Spearman (parametric) or Pearson (no parametric) correlation will be applied to&#xD;
      determine the association between dependent and independent (maternal and neonatal)&#xD;
      variables. Independent variables will be fitted to logistic and lineal regression models to&#xD;
      evaluate interactions as well as to identify confounding factors. For in vitro studies,&#xD;
      comparisons between two or more groups will be performed by means of Student's unpaired&#xD;
      t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. If the ANOVA demonstrates a&#xD;
      significant interaction between variables, post hoc analyses were performed by Dunns when&#xD;
      comparing selected groups and multiple-comparison Bonferroni correction test. Data for in&#xD;
      vitro responses to cytokines will be fitted to dose-response curves from which maximal&#xD;
      response and drug potency (pD2 = -Log EC50) will be obtained. Comparison of curves and&#xD;
      maximal responses under different conditions will be analysed by ANOVA. All the analyses will&#xD;
      be carried out with the statistical software Graphpad Prism, STATA or SPSS considering a&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 as cut-off for statistical significance.&#xD;
