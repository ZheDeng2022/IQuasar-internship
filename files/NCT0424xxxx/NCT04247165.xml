  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a dreadful disease due to its often advanced&#xD;
      stage at diagnosis and poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. A locally unresectable tumor&#xD;
      (locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC)) is present in 30% of the cases and is defined as&#xD;
      a surgically unresectable tumor encasing the adjacent arteries [celiac axis, superior&#xD;
      mesenteric artery (SMA)]. In these patients, chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for&#xD;
      decades, optionally combined with radiotherapy. The results of small randomized trials&#xD;
      comparing chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy of patients with LAPC are divergent.&#xD;
      Considering the emerging role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), the combination of&#xD;
      checkpoint blocking antibodies with agents that target the inhibitory effects of the TME&#xD;
      could lead to better responses in tumor historically resistant to checkpoint blocking&#xD;
      antibody approaches. Furthermore, the addition of standard-of-care chemotherapy could further&#xD;
      potentiate the anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy approaches by reducing the tumor burden,&#xD;
      exposing antigens, and directly affecting the immunosuppressive TME compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the safety and synergy of the proposed combinatorial approach, participants with&#xD;
      locally advanced PC will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab administered in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel followed by immune-chemoradiation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive nivolumab and ipilimumab. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg will be given on Day 1 (± 3&#xD;
      days) of each 28-day treatment cycle. Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg will be given only on day 1 in cycle&#xD;
      1. Nivolumab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 (± 5) minutes and then, after a&#xD;
      30 minutes rest period, ipilimumab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 (± 5)&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-medication for chemotherapy (based on standard-of-care and local institutional standards)&#xD;
      and chemotherapy will then be administered after a further 30 minutes rest period. The&#xD;
      recommended dose of nab-paclitaxel is 100 mg/m2 administered as an IV infusion over 30 to 40&#xD;
      minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 will be adminestered&#xD;
      over 30 to 40 minutes immediately after nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of cycle 3, patients also undergo concurrent MRI-guided adaptive SBRT (8 Gy&#xD;
      x 3 fractions) delivered by ViewRay MR-Linear Accelerator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses (16 weeks) in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once 4 cycles of study treatment have been completed, subjects without disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity may continue as per Investigator's Choice to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuation of treatment with nivolumab, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or surgery.&#xD;
           Nivolumab can be continued until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
           withdrawal of consent, or up to 12 cycles in total. Patients will receive chemotherapy&#xD;
           until PD, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent, according to investigator's&#xD;
           judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If tumor response allows for surgical intervention, the subject will be eligible for&#xD;
           that treatment as deemed appropriate by the investigators. Surgical intervention may not&#xD;
           occur prior to completing the planned 4 cycles of nivolumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine&#xD;
           and SBRT regardless the patient demonstrates a major response to therapy. Patients after&#xD;
           PC resection will receive treatment until recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal&#xD;
           of consent, clear clinical deterioration, or for a maximum of 6 cycles, according to&#xD;
           investigator's judgment Patients who discontinue without PD (stable disease (SD),&#xD;
           partial response (PR), or complete response (CR)) will have both the safety follow-up&#xD;
           period and survival follow-up period to occur simultaneously during the 2-year follow-up&#xD;
           period. The duration of this follow-up is up to 2 years following the last dose of study&#xD;
           treatment, although a longer follow-up period could be considered in selected cases if&#xD;
           an efficacy signal is apparent. Patients will receive follow-up CT/MRI scans every 2&#xD;
           months (±14 days) until documented progression of disease, withdrawal of consent from&#xD;
           active participation in the study, lost to follow-up, or for at least 2 years after&#xD;
           start of treatment, whichever is earliest. Tumor evaluations will be assessed by the&#xD;
           investigators and response to be determined according to response evaluation criteria in&#xD;
           solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines. Tumor assessment scans, for participants who have&#xD;
           ongoing clinical benefit beyond the 2-year period from start of treatment, may continue&#xD;
           to be collected as part of standard-of-care treatment. Subsequent therapies will also be&#xD;
           recorded in this survival follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason will have a safety follow-up visit&#xD;
      about 30, 60 and 100 days after treatment discontinuation and will be followed for OS and&#xD;
      post-study anticancer therapies approximately every 90 days by phone or review of medical&#xD;
      records until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize the risks of adding or nivolumab + ipilimumab followed by nivolumab and&#xD;
      chemo-radiation, safety will be monitored by a Bayesian stopping rule for the rate of&#xD;
      treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation greater than 30% (summarized baseline&#xD;
      toxicity rate). For example, if 3 patients out of the first 6 or 4 out of the first 7&#xD;
      evaluable patients experience treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation, accrual to&#xD;
      the trial will be temporarily suspended and the principle investigator and study team will&#xD;
      review the toxicity data and recommend either modification or termination of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent&#xD;
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be&#xD;
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not&#xD;
                  part of normal subject care&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
                  schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma&#xD;
             prior to entering this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy regimens received for PC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;

          -  Life expectancy greater than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants will be required to undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment biopsies&#xD;
             at acceptable clinical risk as judged by the investigator. An archival pre-treatment&#xD;
             sample is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
                  Syndrome must have a total bilirubin ≤ 50 mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as&#xD;
             indicated in Appendix 3. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is&#xD;
             insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been&#xD;
             done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per&#xD;
             year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be&#xD;
             determined in consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for&#xD;
             birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours,&#xD;
             contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an&#xD;
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year (Appendix 3). The investigator shall review&#xD;
             contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men&#xD;
             that are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when&#xD;
             the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception&#xD;
             should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the&#xD;
             investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to&#xD;
             25 days. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31&#xD;
             weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after&#xD;
             the last dose of investigational drug. Women who are not of childbearing potential&#xD;
             (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not&#xD;
             require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC approved written informed consent form in&#xD;
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation&#xD;
             or checkpoint pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with&#xD;
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune&#xD;
