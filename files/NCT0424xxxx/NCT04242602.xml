    <textblock>
      Various methods have been studied to evaluate autoregulation. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      universally accepted technique to assess integrity of the cerebral autoregulation&#xD;
      neurovascular system. In the last decade, significant progress has been achieved in&#xD;
      developing methods to assess cerebral autoregulation by quantifying cross-correlation between&#xD;
      spontaneous oscillations in CBF or oxygenation and similar oscillations in arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will analyze the relationship between spontaneous&#xD;
      fluctuations in mean arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity or cerebral&#xD;
      regional oxygenation to investigate two novel methods for measuring cerebral autoregulation,&#xD;
      Transfer Function Analysis and Wavelet Coherence after acute pediatric brain injury.&#xD;

      A. Background and Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute neurologic injury (ANI) is an important and common cause of mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      pediatrics such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), stoke and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy&#xD;
      (HIE). Advances have been made in the intensive care management of children with ANI&#xD;
      improving mortality rates but survivors are often left with long-term neurologic and&#xD;
      neuropsychological disabilities. It is estimated that as many as 50-60% of children who&#xD;
      sustain a severe TBI will suffer from some long-term neurologic sequela such as cognitive,&#xD;
      behavioral, psychiatric and psychological defects despite modern advanced care. Survivors of&#xD;
      ANI may also sustain a reduction in their quality of life and ability to participate in daily&#xD;
      activities and their long-term care can results in a considerable socioeconomic burden. The&#xD;
      brain is a highly metabolic organ representing 2% of the total body weight but consuming 20%&#xD;
      of the oxygen. The dependence of the brain on a high rate of aerobic cellular metabolism&#xD;
      necessitates a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. However, this large energy&#xD;
      requirement also means that brain cells are particularly vulnerable to injury when nutrients&#xD;
      are deprived even for very short periods. The delivery of cerebral energy nutrients is a&#xD;
      highly controlled process maintained through an intricately balanced cerebrovascular system,&#xD;
      which regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF) at a constant rate to meet tissue demand. In the&#xD;
      simplest model CBF is proportional to the pressure differential across the cerebrovascular&#xD;
      system and is inversely proportional to the cerebral vascular resistance (CVR). The driving&#xD;
      pressure differential or cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) represents the vascular pressure&#xD;
      difference across the brain tissue, expressed as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In normal physiologic states CBF is largely independent of CPP over a wide range of pressure&#xD;
      by altering CVR, a process known as cerebral autoregulation (CA). Cerebral autoregulation is&#xD;
      controlled by the complex interplay of neurogenic, metabolic and myogenic mechanisms. During&#xD;
      CA arterioles in the brain dilate (decreasing resistance) or constrict (increasing&#xD;
      resistance) maintaining an adequate CBF to meet tissue metabolic demands (Figure 1). After&#xD;
      ANI the endogenous autoregulatory mechanisms may be impaired predisposing vulnerable tissue&#xD;
      to ischemia or vasogenic edema. In the normal state CA maintains a constant CBF over a wide&#xD;
      rage of perfusion pressures but with loss of CA CBF becomes linear with perfusion pressure&#xD;
      such that any reduction in CPP or MAP will cause a corresponding fall in blood flow. After&#xD;
      severe TBI, cardiac arrest or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, children may suffer from a&#xD;
      combination of cerebral and systemic pathophysiologic alterations such as hypotension, shock,&#xD;
      cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, acute blood loss anemia and respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Therefore, the biologic system of CA is a clinically important mechanism that&#xD;
      functions to protect against cerebral hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion during the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic changes that occur commonly in neurocritical illness where patients may have&#xD;
      rapid changes in blood pressure, intracranial pressure or systemic oxygen delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral blood flow is not directly measured at the bedside in clinical practice hence either&#xD;
      CPP (if ICP is measured) or MAP is used to target an age-based goal in clinical practice.&#xD;
      However, there are several limitations with this approach, 1) the optimal MAP/CPP threshold&#xD;
      is unknown in children across age groups, 2) the optimal MAP/CPP value is very likely to not&#xD;
      only be reflected by age-based target but be highly dependent on individual patient and&#xD;
      injury-type factors and 3) due to this uncertainty there exists wide clinical variability is&#xD;
      what value medical providers choose to target MAP/CPP after ANI. Moreover, since&#xD;
      autoregulation is a continuous spectrum dependent on the adaptive response of CVR to regulate&#xD;
      flow, disturbances may change over time and may also differ in the same patient with varying&#xD;
      degrees of physiological derangement. Since CBF is not measured in clinical practice the&#xD;
      actual ability of the patient to maintain an adequate CBF at a given MAP/CPP is assumed but&#xD;
      not known. Relying on perfusion pressure alone fails to account for alterations in CA that&#xD;
      occur after brain injury hindering the clinician's ability to determine if CBF is adequate to&#xD;
      meet metabolic needs at a given MAP/CPP&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are emerging studies supporting the theory that impaired CA is an important factor in&#xD;
      ANI. In adults impairments in CA are associated with a worse outcome and have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to occur after a wide-spectrum of neurologic injuries, including TBI, HIE,&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar reports of poor outcomes after pediatric TBI and neonatal and pediatric HIE with have&#xD;
      been found impaired in patients with impaired CA. However, significant knowledge gaps still&#xD;
      exist in our current understanding of how to measure CA, which patients are at risk for&#xD;
      impaired CA, if alterations in CA are associated with worse long-term functional outcomes and&#xD;
      importantly how can the investigators use data from the patient's CA status to optimize our&#xD;
      ICU management to improve outcomes. Current management options for children after severe TBI&#xD;
      and intracranial hemorrhage may include the use of an invasive ICP monitor and arterial line&#xD;
      to measure arterial blood pressure (ABP) and CPP continuously but these devices by themselves&#xD;
      do not provide information about the status of the cerebrovascular system. Our study aims to&#xD;
      utilizing two novel non-invasive methods of assessing dynamic autoregulation to describe the&#xD;
      incidence and temporal profile of CA disturbances during the acute phase after ANI in&#xD;
      children incorporating clinical data provided by the patient's current existing monitoring&#xD;
      devices. The investigators also aim to examine the association between impaired CA and short&#xD;
      and long-term functional neurologic outcome. This research proposal attempts to address some&#xD;
      of our knowledge gaps in determination of CA disturbances and optimal MAP/CPP targets for&#xD;
      children after ANI. The investigators hope this study will increase our understanding of CA&#xD;
      impairments that occur after ANI and data gained from this study will lead to clinically&#xD;
      useful tools incorporating CA assessment at the bedside to improve care for pediatric&#xD;
      neurocritical care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Assessing Dynamic Cerebral Autoregulation Various methods have been previously&#xD;
      studied to evaluate CA and currently there is no universally accepted method to assess the&#xD;
      integrity of the cerebral autoregulation neurovascular system. Measurements of CA have been&#xD;
      described in terms of a static or dynamic process. Static CA relates to the net change in CBF&#xD;
      following the manipulation of ABP under steady state conditions typically with drugs that&#xD;
      either increase or decrease blood pressure. In this method if CBF remained constant with&#xD;
      changes in ABP, autoregulation is deemed to be intact. Dynamic CA describes the fast&#xD;
      mechanisms that permit restoration of blood flow after rapid changes in ABP, which typically&#xD;
      occur over longer periods of time. Traditional methods to study of CA use techniques such as&#xD;
      vasopressor administration, squat maneuver, carotid compression and deflation of thigh cuffs&#xD;
      to induce large fluctuation in blood pressure to measure the CBF response. However, these&#xD;
      maneuvers rely on patient cooperation and may be unsuitable in cases of neurocritical&#xD;
      illness. In the last decade, advances have been made in developing new methods to assess the&#xD;
      dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) response by quantifying cross-correlation between&#xD;
      spontaneous oscillations in MAP and CPP and the corresponding oscillations in CBF or&#xD;
      oxygenation as opposed to experimental induced changes. While spontaneous oscillations in ABP&#xD;
      and CBFv have been known to occur for many years, the function of these oscillations remain&#xD;
      unknown. They are believed to originate as autonomic responses generated in the brainstem and&#xD;
      peripheral baroreceptors. The cerebral arterioles response to changes in ABP may not be rapid&#xD;
      enough to counteract high frequency changes hence fluctuations at these frequencies are&#xD;
      passed along unmodified to cerebral circulation. In contrast, slower frequency oscillations&#xD;
      (0.02 Hz to 0.2 Hz can be counteracted by cerebral arterioles to maintain constant flow. It&#xD;
      is at these low frequency or slow waves periods that CA is believed to function as system to&#xD;
      changes in ABP. Transfer function analysis and wavelet coherence analysis are mathematical&#xD;
      models allowing simultaneous analysis of CA input and outputs over a wide range of&#xD;
      physiologically relevant CA oscillatory frequencies. Measurements are interpreted based on&#xD;
      the concept that dCA will work to minimize the effect of spontaneous oscillations in MAP on&#xD;
      CBFv. Without a functional CA response each spontaneous oscillation in MAP would be&#xD;
      associated with a similar oscillation in CBFv in terms of magnitude, duration and frequency.&#xD;
      The investigators will combine two non-invasive techniques to investigate the temporal dCA&#xD;
      relationship after ANI using spontaneous fluctuations of the patient's MAP or CPP as the&#xD;
      input and CBFv or brain regional oxygenation as the output. Importantly, the two methods the&#xD;
      investigators will be investigating utilize spontaneous fluctuations of a patient's&#xD;
      physiologic waveforms. This eliminates the requirement for an experimental manipulation of&#xD;
      blood pressure, which may introduce some risk to the patient. In the first method a 30-minute&#xD;
      transcranial doppler (TCD) sonographic examination will be performed to analyze the transfer&#xD;
      function analysis (TFA) of spontaneous oscillations of MAP/CPP and CBFv on days 1-10 after&#xD;
      injury. In the second method, the investigators will examine dCA changes that occur&#xD;
      continuously over the first 7-10 days of injury using a non-stationary model of wavelet&#xD;
      coherence analysis between MAP/CPP and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. In both models the&#xD;
      investigators will be using MAP/CPP values measured from an indwelling arterial line placed&#xD;
      as part of standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) Transfer function analysis is a mathematical model to&#xD;
      describe the spontaneous fluctuations in MAP and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) which&#xD;
      can analyze both static and dynamic components of CA. In the time-domain mean values of ABP&#xD;
      and CBFv are obtained for each cardiac cycle and the spectral analysis algorithm Fast Fourier&#xD;
      Transform is used to obtain spectral estimates in the frequency domain used to calculate&#xD;
      coherence, gain and phase to describe the efficiency and latency of the CA frequency response&#xD;
      across very low (VLF: 0.02-0.07 Hz), low (LF: 0.07-0.20 Hz), and high (HF: 0.20-0.50 Hz)&#xD;
      frequency ranges. The analysis is based on the assumption that autoregulation functions in a&#xD;
      &quot;stationary&quot; linear system with MAP considered the input and CBFv as the output. The analysis&#xD;
      will be performed during a period of patient stability where no acute interventions will be&#xD;
      made. Data acquisition settings and subsequent analysis for TFA will be in accordance with&#xD;
      the white paper from the international cerebral autoregulation research network. A control&#xD;
      group of patients will be enrolled as part of this study with arterial lines but without&#xD;
      neurologic injury and have CBFv and TFA performed to serve as the comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wavelet Coherence Analysis (WCA) Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive light&#xD;
      emitting electrode method to measure regional tissue oxygenation. Probes sensitive to light&#xD;
      absorption by oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) can be placed&#xD;
      directly on the skin of the forehead to measure cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) or&#xD;
      the differential hemoglobin concentration (HbD = HbO2 - Hb). The SctO2 has been used as a&#xD;
      non-invasive method to measure changes in regional cerebral perfusion or blood flow to assess&#xD;
      CA. Spontaneous oscillations in CBF can therefore be estimated by changes in SctO2 values&#xD;
      over time and analyzed against changes in MAP. Previous studies have used a linear&#xD;
      correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between SctO2 and MAP in adult and&#xD;
      pediatric studies to assess dCA after cardiac surgery, subarachnoid hemorrhage and TBI. These&#xD;
      prior analytical methods are based on the assumption of obtaining measurements in a&#xD;
      stationary system, in other words the neurovascular and systemic hemodynamics do not change&#xD;
      over time. In reality the investigators know that blood pressure and cerebral factors such as&#xD;
      ICP and blood pressure are non-stationary, changing frequently, particularly in the early&#xD;
      hours and days after critical illness. Wavelet coherence analysis assumes a non-stationary&#xD;
      system and may be able to better characterize dCA disturbances in a continuous moving system&#xD;
      during the real-time physiological changes that occur at the extremes of system stress not&#xD;
      testable by previous methods. Wavelet coherence analysis can also be used to quantify the&#xD;
      dynamic relationship between MAP and SctO2 across much longer time frames compared to TCD&#xD;
      based analysis. Similar to TFA, wavelet coherence uses phase, gain and coherence to determine&#xD;
      a relationship between the two waveforms values MAP/CPP and SctO2. Using NIRS-based SctO2 to&#xD;
      measure changes in CBF has the advantages of being a stable sensor not subject to movement&#xD;
      disturbances, a non-invasive routine monitor in the critical care unit and a method that&#xD;
      requires no specialized training and is suitable for long-term continuous monitoring. A&#xD;
      control group of patients will be enrolled as part of this study without neurologic injury&#xD;
      but with arterial lines and NIRS monitoring to serve as the comparison group by having&#xD;
      wavelet coherence analysis performed of MAP and SctO2 for 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Utilize transfer function analysis to analyze the cerebral autoregulation gain and&#xD;
      phase values across very low (VLF: 0.02-0.07 Hz), low (LF: 0.07-0.20 Hz), and high (HF:&#xD;
      0.20-0.50 Hz) frequency ranges of MAP/CPP and CBFv after acute brain injury on post-injury&#xD;
      days 1-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Utilize wavelet coherence analysis to analyze the coherence values of continuously&#xD;
      measured MAP/CPP and regional cerebral oxygenation saturation across time and period domains&#xD;
      during post-injury days 1-10 days in brain injured patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the functional outcome of between patients who demonstrate disturbed cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation using hospital discharge, 3 and 6 months post-injury neurologic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.1 Concise Project Summary In this study, the investigators will use two non-invasive&#xD;
      methods to investigate temporal changes in dynamic CA by performing cross-correlation&#xD;
      analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in MAP/CPP with cerebral blood flow velocity and&#xD;
      cerebral regional oxygenation domains to examine CA disturbances after acute pediatric acute&#xD;
      neurologic injury. In the first method, the investigators will uses transfer function&#xD;
      analysis of MAP/CPP and TCD-based CBFv waveforms to measure CA components gain and phase on&#xD;
      post injury days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. This model assumes a stationary system as is performed&#xD;
      for 30 minutes during a period of patient stability. In the second method, the investigators&#xD;
      will utilize wavelet coherence analysis of MAP/CPP and NIRS-based tissue oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (StO2) and to measure the continuous and dynamic CA changes occurring over a wide range of&#xD;
      patient physiologic variables during the first 7-10 days after injury. This model allows for&#xD;
      measurement of CA assuming a non-stationary system which more accurately reflects the actual&#xD;
      pathophysiological and biologic disturbances that occurs in patients during the first days&#xD;
      after neurocritical injury. For comparison with normal CA values, the investigators will use&#xD;
      a control group of patients without any neurologic injury who are already intubated and&#xD;
      sedated per standard of care. The study and control group will have arterial lines placed as&#xD;
      part of their standard care to measure MAP for study analysis. The primary analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted using two mathematical models of spontaneous oscillations in physiologic waveforms&#xD;
      using continuous MAP/CPP as the CA input, and CBFv (TFA) or cerebral regional oxygenation&#xD;
      (wavelet coherence) as the CA output. The investigators will also measure the impact that CA&#xD;
      has on functional outcomes by measuring pediatric neurologic functional and disability scales&#xD;
      at hospital discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months. Advancing our knowledge of the temporal changes&#xD;
      that occur in CA during the initial critical phases of brain injury will lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of how the brain regulates flow after injury preventing secondary ischemia and&#xD;
      help to develop patient-specific physiologic targets for MAP or CPP to optimize CBF&#xD;
      accounting for the heterogeneity and individual differences in patients improving neurologic&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.2 Description of Infrastructure All study patients will be enrolled at Children's Medical&#xD;
      Center Dallas. Data collection will be through both paper case report forms, review of the&#xD;
      electronic medical record and direct subject data download from the bedside Phillips&#xD;
      Intellivue monitor. Dr. Miles (PI) is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at UTSW Medical&#xD;
      Center and has been an attending in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) since 2005. Dr.&#xD;
      Miles will provide direct supervision for the research study and has experience in both TCD&#xD;
      techniques and conducting clinical trials in the PICU. Dr. Miles currently has the following&#xD;
      research equipment obtained for this study, 1) specialized portable workstation with personal&#xD;
      computer, display and DWL transcranial doppler device for measurement of CBF velocities and&#xD;
      simultaneous download of MAP and CBFv with Medicollector software, 2) additional PC and&#xD;
      smaller workstation for continuous NIRS data for continuous Phillips monitor data capture&#xD;
      with Medicollector software and 3) two specially designed sets of pediatric headpieces with&#xD;
      portable TCD probes for measurement of 30 minute continuous TCD waveform. Wavelet coherence&#xD;
      analysis of CA will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Fenghua Tian Ph.D, a faculty&#xD;
      member in the Department of Bioengineering at University of Texas at Arlington. Dr. Tian's&#xD;
      research expertise includes the use of NIRS and noninvasive methods to measure CA and several&#xD;
      publications using wavelet coherence investigating CA in neonates after HIE and children&#xD;
      receiving extracorporeal support. Dr. Tian will also provide statistical analytical support.&#xD;
      Transfer function analysis of CA will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Sushmita&#xD;
      Purkayastha, Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Physiology and Health&#xD;
      Management at Southern Methodist University. Dr. Purkayastha laboratory examines the link&#xD;
      between clinical symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury and cerebral blood flow regulation.&#xD;
      She is currently using similar methods of TFA to study changes in CA after concussion in&#xD;
      college athletes and has published results in patients with stroke and white matter&#xD;
      abnormalities. Laurence Ryan Ph.D. will provide computer-engineering support and statistical&#xD;
      analysis creating a custom MatLab (Mathowrks, Natick, MA) software code for signal processing&#xD;
      of waveform CBFv and MAP data into TFA frequency plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.3 Study Measures The study measures for aim 1 will be mean estimates of transfer function&#xD;
      gain (cm/s/mmHg), phase (radians) and coherence for very low (VLF: 0.02-0.07 Hz), low (LF:&#xD;
      0.07-0.20 Hz), and high (HF: 0.20-0.50 Hz) frequency ranges calculated from MAP and CBFv&#xD;
      spontaneous oscillations. Study measures for aim 2 study measures include calculation of&#xD;
      squared cross-wavelet coherence (R2) ranging from 0-1 which represents the significance of&#xD;
      correlations in spontaneous oscillations in MAP and SctO2 values during the first 7-10 days&#xD;
      of injury. In this model an R2 value of 1 represent impaired autoregulation correlation where&#xD;
      changes in MAP are significantly correlated with changes in cerebral oxygenation. A&#xD;
      non-significant value would indicate spontaneous fluctuations in SctO2 are largely&#xD;
      unconnected to changes in MAP. A squared cross-wavelet coherence threshold value of &gt; 0.7&#xD;
      will be used for significance and will be plotted across patient monitoring time (X axis) and&#xD;
      frequency or period (Y axis). In this model much lower frequency oscillations are being&#xD;
      measured than for TFA for analysis ranging from 30 minutes to 256 minutes. The percentage of&#xD;
      total monitoring time with significant cross-wavelet MAP and SctO2 coherence will be measured&#xD;
      for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.4 Study Timeline Study activities will continue for a 3-year period or when a target&#xD;
      enrollment of 35 subjects has been reached. Based on historical numbers of annual admission&#xD;
      for severe TBI, stroke and HIE mechanisms in the PICU the investigators would anticipate&#xD;
      reaching the study target within the study time frame with an consent refusal/missed&#xD;
      eligibility rate of 20-40%. Given the non-invasive and observational nature of the study the&#xD;
      investigators hope the consent rate will be high for this study. Including children with&#xD;
      various types of acute neurologic injury should also contribute to reaching the target&#xD;
      enrollment within the study time frame. Neurologic follow-up will continue for 12 months&#xD;
      after hospital discharge from the last patient enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      D1. Transcranial Doppler Sonography Study team personnel will perform transcranial doppler&#xD;
      (TCD) sonography on post-injury days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 to insonate the right and left&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery mean, peak and diastolic flow velocities (cm/sec) via the temporal&#xD;
      bone window. TCD uses ultrasound waves to measure the speed of moving blood in intracranial&#xD;
      blood vessels. Since the blood flow velocity and vessel signal acquisition is very sensitive&#xD;
      to probe movement, for continuous monitoring purposes a fixed probe device pediatric&#xD;
      headpiece (LAM-Rack or Elastic Headband, DWL, Germany) will be used. This headpiece uses&#xD;
      either a fixed metal frame or soft silicone straps to secure the TCD probes to the surface of&#xD;
      the skull after the vessel signal is obtained. The headpiece has soft foam attachments and&#xD;
      should not cause discomfort. Head circumference will be measured and using the standard 10 mm&#xD;
      left and right of midline the middle cerebral artery/anterior cerebral artery (MCA/ACA)&#xD;
      bifurcation will be identified first by a hand held probe where optimal insonation position&#xD;
      will first be marked in the optimal position with a sharpie felt pen on the skin. This will&#xD;
      allow for quicker and more consistent placement with the fixed headpiece for subsequent&#xD;
      measurements. The investigators will use the mid MCA or most optimal signal for each patient&#xD;
      but the same depth of MCA vessel will be used for repeated measurements. This procedure&#xD;
      requires 20-30 minutes of continuous TCD measurements and the co-existing MAP waveform from&#xD;
      an indwelling invasive arterial line connected to Phillips Intellivue patient care monitor.&#xD;
      Readings will be collected during a period of patient stability where no acute medical&#xD;
      interventions or ventilator changes are being made. Arterial blood pressure readings will be&#xD;
      measured from an invasive arterial pressure transducer already placed for clinical monitoring&#xD;
      of blood pressure. TCD measurements will be performed on a dedicated TCD machine&#xD;
      (Doppler-BoxTM, Compumedics DWL, Germany) installed with QL imaging software and analogue TCD&#xD;
      signal output capabilities. A specially designed portable computer cart style workstation&#xD;
      consisting of the Doppler-Box, PC laptop and desktop computer, and 22-inch monitor is&#xD;
      dedicated for use in research studies can be easily moved into any room in the critical care&#xD;
      unit for bedside monitoring. While no adverse events have been reported in over 20 years&#xD;
      experience of using TCD in the application of neurosonography, study patients may experience&#xD;
      some stimulation with headpiece and probe placement. The investigators will attempt to&#xD;
      minimize this as much as possible, if the patients physiological condition does not tolerate&#xD;
      even mild movements with headpiece placement the investigators will stop the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D2. Near Infrared Spectroscopy Cerebral Regional Oximetry Data for wavelet coherence will be&#xD;
      collected continuously for the first 7-10 days of admission using the combined NIRS/MAP&#xD;
      monitoring devices. Analyzing the changes in SctO2 with fluctuation in MAP/CPP continuously&#xD;
      using wavelet coherence over first 7-10 days is important as this will uncover dynamic&#xD;
      changes in CA that occur during the actual pathophysiologic disturbances at the margins of&#xD;
      target values in neurocritical illness such as during periods of low MAP/CPP or elevated ICP&#xD;
      Intracranial pressure (ICP). Cerebral oximetry values will be collected at 1 Hz from a NIRS&#xD;
      monitor (Medtronic, INVOS 5100C Cerebral Oximetry, Minneapolis, MN). The NIRS self adhesive&#xD;
      single-use sensor will be placed on a clean and dry site on the right/left or bilateral&#xD;
      forehead above the eyebrow and inferior to hair line and away from any damaged tissue,&#xD;
      sagittal sinus or frontal extra axial hemorrhages underlying the sensor. The skin around the&#xD;
      sensor will be inspected twice daily and sensors will be kept away from strong light and&#xD;
      moisture. Sensors will be removed if the patient is having an MRI but not if they are having&#xD;
      a brain CT. If a patient will have NIRS as part of their standard of medical care the&#xD;
      investigators will consent for collection of the SctO2 values that are being used by the&#xD;
      clinical team for up to 10 days or as long as the monitor is in place. In patients where NIRS&#xD;
      monitoring is not a standard of care device the NIRS sensor and monitor will be provided by&#xD;
      the study team and the SctO2 value will be covered on the display during the study&#xD;
      procedures. The medical team will be blinded to any TCD and/or SctO2 values if it is&#xD;
      collected for the sole purposes of research. The screen is password protected and streaming&#xD;
      data will not be available for viewing by the staff or family without a password to unlock&#xD;
      the screen saver display.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D3. Neurologic Outcome Assessment Neurologic outcome will be at assessed at hospital&#xD;
      discharge, 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury. The 8-point Glasgow Outcome Scale&#xD;
      Extended-Pediatrics (GOSEP) will be used for neurologic functional outcome categories. A&#xD;
      GOSEP score of 1 = normal, 2 = mild disability, 3 = upper moderate disability, or 4 = lower&#xD;
      moderate disability is classified as a favorable outcome. A GOSEP score of 5 = upper severe&#xD;
      disability, 6 = lower severe disability, 7 = vegetative state, or 8 = death was classified is&#xD;
      an unfavorable outcome. The GOSEP will be conducted by a study member through a 10-minute&#xD;
      parent/legal guardian interview over the phone. Neuropsychological outcome will also be&#xD;
      measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test&#xD;
      (PEDI-CAT) a validated tool to measure domains of daily activities, mobility,&#xD;
      social/cognitive function and responsibility from birth through 18 years. The PEDI-CAT is a&#xD;
      computer based program which will be conducted over the phone with the interviewer reading&#xD;
      questions and entering deidentified responses into the web based program for analysis and&#xD;
      report.&#xD;

    <measure>Transfer Function Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 post injury</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer function has three components:&#xD;
I. Gain: This measures the magnitude of transmission of MAP oscillations to CBFv. Effectively, a functional dCA system dampens the strength of transmitted oscillations resulting in a lower gain value. A higher gain value is therefore suggestive of impaired autoregulation.&#xD;
II. Phase is a &quot;time delay&quot; in degrees measured between the two waveforms. Absence of autoregulation would result in both MAP and CBFV changing at the same time. This would be measured as a 0°phase shift. Hence, a non-zero phase shift indicates intact autoregulation and counter-regulation of CBFV in response to changes in MAP.&#xD;
III. Coherence:This provides a measure of association between the two waves at difference frequencies. Coherence varies between 0 and 1, similar to a correlation coefficient it expresses the fraction of MAP linearly associated with CBFv. Gain, phase, and coherence will be aggregated to get the transfer function analysis.</description>

    <description>The 8-point Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended-Pediatrics (GOSEP) will be used to assess change in neurologic function from baseline. The GOSEP is composed of 3 parts: eye opening, best motor response, and best verbal response. Eye opening is measure 1-4, the higher the category, the better outcome. Best motor response is measured as 1-6, the higher the score, the better outcome. Best verbal response is measured as 1-5, the higher the score, the better outcome. All 3 categories are summed together to equal a total GOSEP score. The higher the overall score, the better potential outcome.</description>
