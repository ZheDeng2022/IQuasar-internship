      We performed a retrospective observational-analytic study. Anatomical measurements were&#xD;
      performed on 118 participants during an ultrasound exam, and demographic data was collected&#xD;
      from their medical files. The data was stratified according to age, sex, patient's body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), and height.&#xD;

      Approval - Ethical Considerations The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (NHR-014417). Study Design In this retrospective observational-analytic study we analyzed the&#xD;
      anatomical relation between the cricoid cartilage, thyroid gland isthmus, and the superficial&#xD;
      second neck crease. We reviewed patient data from between November 2016 and August 2018. The&#xD;
      data was collected during ultrasound exams of 118 subjects who underwent assessment of the&#xD;
      thyroid gland. Patients who had any neck surgical procedure prior to the test, patients with&#xD;
      abnormalities in the anterior neck, and patients without clear second crease were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the examination, patients were lying supine with their head in mild extension, in the&#xD;
      same manner that is practiced during a thyroidectomy. The assessment and collection of data&#xD;
      was performed by the senior author (OR) who routinely performs both this preoperative&#xD;
      examination and thyroid surgeries in the medical center. The precise location of the cricoid&#xD;
      cartilage and the thyroid isthmus was determined using ultrasound. The main parameters were&#xD;
      the distances between the thyroid isthmus superior border and the second neck crease, and the&#xD;
      distance between the cricoid cartilage superior border and the second neck crease. These were&#xD;
      measured with a ruler with ultrasound imaging guidance (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several neck creases can be observed in normal adults. The first upper crease runs&#xD;
      horizontally roughly along the thyroid notch and hyoid bone. A second lower neck crease runs&#xD;
      parallel to it approximately at the height of the cricoid and this is the crease the&#xD;
      measurements in our study relate to. Occasionally there is a third prominent skin crease&#xD;
      around 2-3 finger breadths above the clavicle. Other less prominent horizontal neck creases&#xD;
      can be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables, such as age, sex, BMI, and height, were collected from medical records&#xD;
      and used for result stratification either as continuous variables or divided into sub-groups&#xD;
      according to accepted divisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The hypothesis was that the second neck crease is superficial to the&#xD;
      thyroid gland isthmus superior border (0 cm horizontal distance). A vertical distance of 0.5&#xD;
      cm and more was considered significant difference in the location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Distance between the thyroid isthmus or the cricoid cartilage and the&#xD;
      second neck crease were described by means, standard deviation, and range. Age, sex, BMI, and&#xD;
      height were analyzed as quantitative variables with the measures mentioned above. The&#xD;
      continuous variants were also grouped for a clearer presentation of the results. The BMI&#xD;
      variant was categorized into accepted ranges: underweight (below 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight&#xD;
      (18.5 to 25 kg/m2), overweight (25 to 30 kg/m2), and obese (over 30 kg/m2). BMI sub-groups&#xD;
      and sex variables were described by frequencies and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distances were compared among sub-groups using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, Independent&#xD;
      sample t-test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test. The choice between those tests was according to&#xD;
      the number of sub-groups, the group's sample size, and the distribution of the data in each&#xD;
      sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A correlation between age, BMI, height, and the distance was tested by Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      coefficient test or Spearman's correlation coefficient test. The choice between those tests&#xD;
      was according to the sample size and the score's distribution. If the variable was defined as&#xD;
      ordinal sub-groups, Spearman's correlation coefficient test was used.&#xD;
