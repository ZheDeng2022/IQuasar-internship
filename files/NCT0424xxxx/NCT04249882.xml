      This study design consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm,&#xD;
      parallel-group study of naltrexone (50 mg QD) and varenicline (1 mg BID). A total of 108 men&#xD;
      and women with current AUD (moderate or severe) and reporting intrinsic motivation to change&#xD;
      their drinking, will be randomly assigned to receive naltrexone (50 mg QD), varenicline (1 mg&#xD;
      BID) or matched placebo. Post-randomization, all participants will complete an alcohol&#xD;
      cue-reactivity paradigm prior to the initial dose of study medication. After a week-long&#xD;
      medication titration period, participants will be asked to complete a 7-day practice quit&#xD;
      attempt, during which they will have daily virtual visits (phone and online) where they will&#xD;
      report on their alcohol use. Additionally, a second cue-reactivity paradigm will be conducted&#xD;
      90 minutes following study drug administration on final day of the practice quit attempt (Day&#xD;
      14).&#xD;

      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the community through online and newspaper&#xD;
      advertisements. Campaigns in local buses and print publications (e.g., LA Weekly) will also&#xD;
      be implemented. Targeted recruitment will also take place through a lab database of previous&#xD;
      study participants who agreed to be contacted for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone Screen: Individuals who call the lab (in response to flyers and advertisements)&#xD;
      expressing interest in the study will receive detailed information about the study&#xD;
      procedures, and if they remain interested they will complete a telephone screen performed by&#xD;
      a trained research assistant for self-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who&#xD;
      appear eligible will be invited to the laboratory for an initial in-person screening session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Screening: Prior to conducting any research related procedures, research staff will&#xD;
      conduct the informed consent process, which details the procedures to take place during the&#xD;
      screening visit. Informed consent will be a three-part process. First, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to read and provide verbal consent for breathalyzer. If the breathalyzer is above&#xD;
      0.000, the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated. The participant&#xD;
      will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day. If the breathalyzer&#xD;
      test is negative, the written informed consent form will be reviewed and signed by the&#xD;
      participant and study staff outlining procedures for the initial screening visit. A second&#xD;
      written consent form will be reviewed and signed in the presence of the study physician at&#xD;
      the medical screening visit if the participant is found eligible to continue to that visit.&#xD;
      At the initial screening visit, subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample to test for&#xD;
      drugs of abuse and pregnancy (if female), and will complete a series of questionnaires and&#xD;
      interviews (described in detail below) to determine initial eligibility. This visit will take&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour. Following the initial in-person screening, the study coordinator will&#xD;
      meet with the PI to determine if the participant is eligible to continue to the medical&#xD;
      screening based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Screening: Those participants who appear to be eligible after the initial screening&#xD;
      visit, will then be scheduled for a second screening visit. This visit will be conducted by&#xD;
      the study physician and will start with a breathalyzer test. If the breathalyzer is above&#xD;
      0.000, the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated. The participant&#xD;
      will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day. If the breathalyzer&#xD;
      test is negative, the physician will conduct the second written (experimental) consent;&#xD;
      medical history interview and physical exam. In addition, a urine sample will be obtained for&#xD;
      repeat drug screen and pregnancy tests. The participant will then be accompanied by research&#xD;
      personnel to the CTRC for blood specimen collection including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel&#xD;
      and Complete Blood Count to evaluate overall health; and EKG to screen for medical conditions&#xD;
      that could make study participation medically unsafe. The study physician will review each&#xD;
      participant's medical history, vital signs, weight, review of systems, and laboratory tests,&#xD;
      including liver function tests (LFTs), drug screen, chemistry screen, and urine pregnancy&#xD;
      screen to determine if it is medically safe for the participant to take the study medication.&#xD;
      Any subject who is excluded from the study will be compensated for their time in the&#xD;
      screening session and will be offered referrals for alcohol treatment in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Medication Titration: Participants who are eligible after the physical exam&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three treatment conditions (VAR, NTX, or PLA). Urn randomization&#xD;
      will be used to balance the groups by gender, smoking status (as reported on question 1 of&#xD;
      the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence), and drinking status ('heavy' drinker defined as&#xD;
      28 or more drinks per week for males/14 or more drinks per week for females, or 'very heavy'&#xD;
      drinker, defined as 35 or more drinks per week for males/28 or more drinks per week for&#xD;
      females). The UCLA Research Pharmacy will manage the blind. The three treatment conditions&#xD;
      will not be different in appearance or method of administration. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo a week-long medication titration period prior to the onset of the practice quit&#xD;
      attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice-Quit Attempt: During the practice-quit attempt, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      abstain completely from drinking alcohol during a 7-day practice quit period. This period&#xD;
      will begin on Day 8 of study medication dosing. During this period, participants will&#xD;
      complete daily virtual visits to report on their drinking, mood and craving for alcohol&#xD;
      during the previous day in a daily diary assessment (DDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication: On Day 1, participants will report to the laboratory to complete the&#xD;
      alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm and receive their first medication dose under direct&#xD;
      observation of study staff. They will receive a 7-day supply of study medication in blister&#xD;
      packs with AM and PM dosing clearly distinguished for the titration procedure. After reaching&#xD;
      full medication dose at the end of one week, participants will come to the laboratory on Day&#xD;
      8 to begin the practice quit attempt and to take AM dose of study medication daily in the lab&#xD;
      under direct observation of study staff. Additionally, on the first day of the practice-quit&#xD;
      attempt (Day 8), participants will receive a second 7-day supply of study medication. All&#xD;
      study medication will be prepared by the UCLA Research Pharmacy and will be identically&#xD;
      matched in appearance (opaque capsules with 50 mg of riboflavin to aid in medication&#xD;
      compliance procedures) and the medication labels will not reveal the drug identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol Cue Reactivity Sessions (CR): Randomized participants will complete a cue-exposure&#xD;
      paradigm at two time points during the study, once on Day 1 prior to ingesting the first dose&#xD;
      of study medication, and again on Day 14, approximately 90 minutes after study drug&#xD;
      administration. Alcohol cue exposure will follow well-established experimental procedures.&#xD;
      Sessions will begin with a 3-minute relaxation period. Participants will then hold and smell&#xD;
      a glass of water for 3 minutes to control for the effects of simple exposure to any potable&#xD;
      liquid. Next, participants will hold and smell a glass of their preferred alcoholic beverage&#xD;
      for 3 minutes. Order is not counterbalanced because of carryover effects that are known to&#xD;
      occur. Participants (who are smokers) will be allowed a smoke break immediately prior to the&#xD;
      CR assessment. After every 3 minutes of exposure, participants will rate their urge to drink&#xD;
      on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) and their mood on the Profile of Mood States (POMS).&#xD;
      AUQ score (alcohol minus water) is the primary outcome for the CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Counseling Session: All participants will meet with a trained study counselor briefly&#xD;
      after the second cue exposure session on Day 14 to discuss their responses to the alcohol&#xD;
      cues and discuss local treatment options. The counselor will begin by introducing him/herself&#xD;
      and thanking the participant for his/her participation. He/she will continue by providing the&#xD;
      participant with feedback on their responses on various individual difference measures&#xD;
      (drinking patterns, severity of AUD diagnosis, family history, CIWA, depression, and other&#xD;
      drug use). The counselor will probe for participants' attitudes towards these responses and&#xD;
      diagnoses, and provide both informational and emotional support. Next, the counselor will go&#xD;
      over the participant's history of alcohol treatment, in order to identify potential barriers&#xD;
      to treatment access. He/she will discuss local treatment options with the participant,&#xD;
      including the participant's primary care provider, self-help groups, and the UCLA Psychology&#xD;
      Clinic. Lastly, the counselor will go over the &quot;Rethinking Drinking&quot; pamphlet with the&#xD;
      participant, pointing out specific treatment options discussed in the session, and will&#xD;
      address any questions or concerns.&#xD;
