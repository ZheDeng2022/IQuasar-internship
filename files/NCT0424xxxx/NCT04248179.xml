  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a novel ultrasound-guided nerve block indicated primarily&#xD;
      for breast cancer surgery that mimic a thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) - hitherto the&#xD;
      internationally accepted regional anesthesia golden standard for anesthesia of the hemithorax&#xD;
      - but hypothetically without the risks of adverse events associated with the TPVB (i.e.&#xD;
      pneumothorax, risk of bleeding in the thoracic paravertebral space, random and unmanageable&#xD;
      epidural spread etc.). The investigators have already tested the anatomical- and block&#xD;
      execution hypothesis in a randomized cadaveric study, and the investigators now have&#xD;
      anatomical proof of concept for the functionality of the block technique. The investigators&#xD;
      have also conducted a small clinical pilot study with very promising results. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled and double-blind study,&#xD;
      comparing the effect of the ultrasound-guided multiple-injection costotransverse block (MICB)&#xD;
      vs. placebo. The aim with this study is to investigate the efficacy of the MICB vs. placebo&#xD;
      in patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy and primary reconstructive surgery due to breast&#xD;
      cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. The hypothesis is, that the unilateral MICB will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the opioid consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours and&#xD;
      significantly reduce the Numerical Rating Scale pain score (0-10) and opioid related side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve women in Denmark are diagnosed with breast cancer every day. Breast cancer and ductal&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are the primary type of cancer/precursor to cancer in women, and one&#xD;
      of the main treatment modalities is surgical intervention. DCIS is a non-invasive&#xD;
      (pre-malignant) condition in the breast with proliferating cells with malignant&#xD;
      characteristics; confined in situ by the basal lamina in the breast. International DCIS is&#xD;
      considered as manifest breast cancer, but in Denmark DCIS is considered as a precursor to&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer and DCIS surgery includes many subtypes ranging from the minor lumpectomy to&#xD;
      major surgery; e.g. mastectomy and reconstructive surgery with or without axillary clearance.&#xD;
      All surgical subtypes at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, Zealand&#xD;
      University Hospital (ZUH) are performed under general anesthesia (GA) and implies a&#xD;
      multimodal pain regimen with preoperative oral medication (Paracetamol 1g, Celecoxib (NSAIDs)&#xD;
      400mg, Gabapentin 600mg, Dexamethasone 8mg and Dextromethorphan 30mg). Standard GA is total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and consists of Remifentanil, Propofol (and Rocuronium for&#xD;
      tracheal intubation if needed), and the anesthesiologists will administer IV Sufentanil (a&#xD;
      synthetic long-lasting opioid) 0.3-0.5 microg/kg 20-30 minutes prior to emergence for the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative pain treatment. The patients are given additional Sufentanil and/or&#xD;
      morphine intravenously in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending of surgical subtype, the surgeons will sometimes inject local anesthetic (LA)&#xD;
      during surgery. The anesthesiologists will infrequently (depending on the availability of&#xD;
      technical skills on the day of surgery) perform ultrasound-guided (USG) nerve blocks (Pecs 1&#xD;
      (and or) 2 and serratus anterior blocks) in the anterolateral thoracic wall prior to surgery,&#xD;
      but this is not an implemented standard treatment. It is sadly neither national nor European&#xD;
      standard to use USG nerve blocks for perioperative pain management for breast cancer and DCIS&#xD;
      surgery. Instead, the vast majority of surgical centers rely heavily on the use of various&#xD;
      long-lasting opioids, despite the adverse events associated with these drugs. Only relatively&#xD;
      few surgical centers in Europe have implemented TPVB or other USG nerve blocks in the&#xD;
      anterior thoracic wall as standard treatment for perioperative pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USG multiple-injection TPVB is considered the regional anesthesia golden standard for breast&#xD;
      cancer and DCIS surgery and reduces both acute and chronic pain as well as postoperative&#xD;
      opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine which surgical subtype would be the most relevant to investigate (define the&#xD;
      quantity of the research problem) the research group at ZUH have conducted a thorough&#xD;
      retrospective study (including 111 patients) regarding postoperative pain and 12- and 24-hrs&#xD;
      opioid consumption concerning patients undergoing breast cancer and DCIS surgery during&#xD;
      2016-2017 at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, ZUH. The electronic&#xD;
      anesthesia files, PACU files and ward files were meticulously reviewed. Six surgical&#xD;
      subgroups were reviewed and the UMPR surgery elicited high values on the numeric rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS) and a substantial need for perioperative opioids. The survey revealed an overall&#xD;
      accumulated morphine consumption in the first 24 postoperative hours of 86.1±60.1mg (mean ±&#xD;
      SD) of oral morphine equivalents (OME) and a NRS in the PACU of 4.5±2.4 (mean ± SD) in UMPR&#xD;
      patients - and this surgical subtype was selected as most relevant and feasible to&#xD;
      investigate. This dosage should be evaluated in relation to the standardized multimodal&#xD;
      regimen described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is definitely room for improvement in regards to the current treatment of this patient&#xD;
      group. For instance, sub-group analysis reveals that patients having only received our&#xD;
      current USG blocks (+preoperative oral medication and GA) have an accumulated morphine&#xD;
      consumption in the first 24 postoperative hours of 81±55.2mg (mean ± SD) of OME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication for UMPR surgery is either breast cancer or DCIS. UMPR surgery can be performed in&#xD;
      several stages (and with several techniques) involving multiple GA techniques. However, at&#xD;
      ZUH one-stage UMPR surgery is common and is described in the following (multiple stage&#xD;
      surgery is irrelevant for the study protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard operating procedure for one-stage UMPR surgery often involves two surgeons; i.e. one&#xD;
      breast surgeon performing the mastectomy and one plastic surgeon performing the subsequent&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mastectomy is skin conserving with incision inferolateral to the breast tissue. The&#xD;
      breast tissue is removed leaving a pocket. The area profound to the major pectoral muscle and&#xD;
      superficial to the minor pectoral muscle is opened and prepared for a prothesis. Very common&#xD;
      this prothesis is an expander-prothesis with a filling-chamber (for subsequent ambulant&#xD;
      re-fillings). An expander-prothesis is either permanent or temporary. If permanent the&#xD;
      filling-chamber is removed ambulant with LA, if temporary the prothesis is removed in toto&#xD;
      under GA and replaced with a permanent prothesis. Two surgical drains are installed; one in&#xD;
      the pocket between the major pectoral muscle and the skin and one between the major pectoral&#xD;
      muscle and the minor pectoral muscle (beside the prothesis). The drains exit the skin in the&#xD;
      lateral thoracic wall without an exact defined anatomical point but often it is in the front&#xD;
      axillary line below the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UMPR patient is evaluated by the operating surgeon around 14 days after surgery where the&#xD;
      pathology results are reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of the current anesthesiologic practice/treatment. The use of morphine (IV and&#xD;
      oral) can cause severe side effects, including nausea and vomiting, bowl paralysis, urine&#xD;
      retention, sleep disturbances and respiratory depression. These side effects can delay&#xD;
      mobilization after surgery, increase the risk of complications and worst of all be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to all the well-known adverse events associated with morphine and the synthetic&#xD;
      opioid derivate, these drugs have several masked adverse events (e.g. immunomodulation,&#xD;
      hormonal disturbing, delirium triggering, angiogenetic etc.). Despite numerous&#xD;
      (retrospective) studies regarding these issues, it is not yet possible to definitively link&#xD;
      morphine consumption to metastasis formation and subsequent cancer recurrence. However, the&#xD;
      surgical stress during the surgical procedures possibly generates an advantageous environment&#xD;
      for dissemination of tumor cells when these inevitably are released to the blood stream by&#xD;
      surgery. Studies advocate that TPVB reduces the perioperative opioid consumption - an&#xD;
      indication of reduced surgical stress and other studies indicate that TPVB might even&#xD;
      decrease the metastasis and progression of breast cancer. Large prospective studies regarding&#xD;
      breast cancer recurrence with TPVB (and thoracic epidurals) are still ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic postoperative pain Chronic postoperative pain (CPP) is a significant and very common&#xD;
      problem associated to breast cancer and DCIS surgery ranging between 20-65% in all patients.&#xD;
      Moderate to severe pain is reported to be between 10-20%. The underlying etiology is&#xD;
      multifactorial and not fully understood, but it is suggested that CPP is occurring from a&#xD;
      perioperative sensitization of the central nervous system. Numerous studies suggest that TPVB&#xD;
      might decrease CPP and it has been postulated that the effect is due to an efficient&#xD;
      treatment of acute pain leading to a decreased sensitization (both peripheral and central&#xD;
      sensory) and a lower incidence of CPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new prospective observational study finds that severity of acute pain is associated with&#xD;
      the development of persistent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new block. The breast is innervated by the lateral and medial pectoral nerves from the&#xD;
      brachial plexus and the T2-T6 thoracic spinal nerves. Hence, no regional technique will block&#xD;
      the entire hemithorax with a single injection. The relatively new USG nerve blocks in the&#xD;
      anterior thoracic wall like the &quot;pecs block&quot; and serratus anterior plane block, do not target&#xD;
      the same nerves as TPVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TPVB is executed in the posterior thoracic wall near the vertebral bodies with the needle&#xD;
      tip just adjacent to the pleura and thereby with an inherent risk of pneumothorax as well as&#xD;
      other serious adverse events. In expert hands and with ultrasound guidance the risk is&#xD;
      probably relatively low. However, many anesthesiologists are still reluctant to perform the&#xD;
      block due to the perceived risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) emerged and quickly gained a lot of attention&#xD;
      for various indications. The ESPB have only been used for breast cancer surgery in a few case&#xD;
      studies and in one RCT but presumably with some success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have modified the ESPB to a novel multiple-injection costotransverse block&#xD;
      (MICB). MICB is also a USG nerve block in the posterior thoracic wall. With MICB, the&#xD;
      investigators inject LA on the superficial side of the superior costotransverse ligament&#xD;
      (SCTL); which is the posterior border of the thoracic paravertebral space (TPVS). The LA will&#xD;
      spread from the injection point and into the TPVS via the costotransverse foramen and the&#xD;
      veins traversing the SCTL. Thereby the investigators mimic a TPVB, but - very important -&#xD;
      with the needle tip in a very comfortable distance to the pleura reducing the risk of adverse&#xD;
      events. The investigators have already proved this in a large cadaveric study with&#xD;
      multinational collaboration. In this study, the MICB effectively stained the ventral rami,&#xD;
      the communicating rami and the thoracic sympathetic trunk. Epidural spread was completely&#xD;
      absent with the MICB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have published two abstracts concerning this new block modality - and the&#xD;
      main article is published in Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot studies show that the MICB is considered a PNB with very little discomfort for the&#xD;
      patient (NRS 1-2) &quot;as painful as having a standard IV line in the hand&quot; - which aligns with a&#xD;
      previous study performed in our department regarding a deep nerve block for analgesia of the&#xD;
      abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the end-point for the MICB is the analgesic effect of a TPVB the investigators find it&#xD;
      relevant to describe the contraindications to TPVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, there are few contraindications to TPVB. However, infection at the site of needle&#xD;
      insertion, empyema, allergy to local anesthetic drugs, patient refusal and tumor occupying&#xD;
      the TPVS are the most common noted contraindications in the literature. Before the emergence&#xD;
      of ultrasound for nerve block execution coagulopathy, bleeding disorder or therapeutic&#xD;
      anticoagulation were considered as relative contraindications for TPVB. Today, with&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance there are no firm consensus on relative contraindications regarding&#xD;
      especially therapeutic anticoagulation when performing TPVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day the investigators perform deep truncal blocks at the department at ZUH and the&#xD;
      investigators have yet to see bleeding as a complication. The MICB is NOT a neuraxial block,&#xD;
      neither do the investigators consider it a deep block. The mere purpose of the MICB is to&#xD;
      further reduce the already low incidence of complications with TPVB. Recently, one accidental&#xD;
      pneumothorax (with TPVB) was reported in well over 2000 patients, but not a single bleeding&#xD;
      complication was reported and another study with 1427 TPVBs only six complications was&#xD;
      reported (no bleeding); all handled successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators generally consider the MICB (and other paravertebral blocks by proxy) as&#xD;
      safe procedures.&#xD;
