  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of chronic and end stage&#xD;
      kidney disease. Large-sized prospective randomized clinical trials indicate that intensified&#xD;
      glucose and blood pressure control, the latter especially by using agents that interfere with&#xD;
      the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), halts the onset and (particularly) the&#xD;
      progression of DKD, in both type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM) patients. However, despite the wide use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), a considerable amount of patients&#xD;
      develop DKD (20-40%), indicating an unmet need for renoprotective therapies as DKD largely&#xD;
      causes the increased mortality risk from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a relatively novel&#xD;
      glucose-lowering drug for the treatment of T2DM as they lower plasma glucose levels by&#xD;
      blocking renal glucose reabsorption. In addition, these agents exert pleiotropic actions&#xD;
      beyond glucose control. As such, SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease proximal sodium reabsorption,&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure, body weight and uric acid. In large trials and likely through these&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for&#xD;
      heart failure and reduce end stage kidney disease. At this point in time, the renoprotective&#xD;
      mechanisms involved with SGLT-2 inhibition still remain speculative, though a consistent&#xD;
      finding is that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce estimated eGFR after first dosing, which is&#xD;
      reversible after treatment cessation. This &quot;dip&quot; indicates a renal hemodynamic phenomenon&#xD;
      reminiscent of the RAS blockers and is thought to reflect a reduction in intraglomerular&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of this observation have only been partially investigated by us and others.&#xD;
      From studies in peolpe with T1DM it is hypothesized that SGLT-2 inhibition increases sodium&#xD;
      chloride delivery to the macula densa, which in turn augments the afferent arteriolar&#xD;
      resistances, known as tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), consequently reducing glomerular&#xD;
      (hyper)filtration and hydrostatic pressure. Recently a trial has been conducted in humans&#xD;
      with T2DM to investigate if this also holds true in these patients. Suprisingly, this study&#xD;
      showed that the renohemodynamic actions of SGLT-2 inhibition in T2DM are not due to afferent&#xD;
      vasoconstriction but rather efferent vasodilation [van Bommel/van Raalte Kidney International&#xD;
      2019 in press]. The investigators realized that the SGLT-2 associated dip in eGFR remains&#xD;
      insufficient understood. The increase in sodium excretion following SGLT-2 inhibition peaks&#xD;
      at day 2-3 after which it normalizes. It is unknown whether this drop in eGFR is related to&#xD;
      this peak in sodium excretion, as the drop remains after normalization of sodium excretion.&#xD;
      Therefore it might be possible that glucosuria, by inducing osmotic diuresis, is the main&#xD;
      driver of the reduction in intraglomerular pressure more than sodium, since SGLT-2 inhibitors&#xD;
      cause persisting glucosuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is known that SGLT-2 induced glucosuria and possibly sodium excretion is&#xD;
      dependent of renal function and HbA1c and consequently is diminished in people with CKD or&#xD;
      without T2DM. However, the renoprotective effects in T2DM are also observed in patients with&#xD;
      impaired kidney function and seem statistically independent of glucose levels. Until now it&#xD;
      has not been investigated whether or not the SGLT-2 induced eGFR alterations occur in people&#xD;
      with CKD with or without T2DM. It is clinically relevant to understand the renal hemodynamics&#xD;
      of SGLT-2 inhibitors in these populations since then it is possible to interpret the results&#xD;
      from the ongoing trials in people with CKD without T2DM, such as EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, potential mediators of renal arterole tone, such as adenosine, have been measured&#xD;
      to gain more insight into mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitor-induced changes in renal&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Adenosine is known to augment preglomerular arteriolar resistance. Adenosine&#xD;
      was significantly increased after SGLT-2 inhibition, as was also observed in patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. However, it can also induce postglomerular vasodilation via A2aR activation&#xD;
      in the presence of RAS blockade. One study in T1DM rats has shown that increased adenosine&#xD;
      generation by the macula densa in response to SGLT-2 inhibition suppresses hyperfiltration,&#xD;
      as the improvements in preglomerular arteriolar resistance were abolished after adenosine&#xD;
      antagonist administration. To date, this has not been investigated in T2DM humans. Therefore,&#xD;
      this trial will assess TGF responses with and without adenosine blockade by caffeine.&#xD;
