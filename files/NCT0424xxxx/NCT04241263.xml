  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies who require intensive care need to have their heart rate, oxygen levels and&#xD;
      temperature measured continuously using specially designed monitors. These monitors allow the&#xD;
      clinical team to constantly assess the baby and see if they are becoming unwell. However,&#xD;
      these monitors each have separate wires to connect them to the baby. Another important part&#xD;
      of care in these babies is being able to allow parents to hold their babies, getting them out&#xD;
      of their incubators to be cuddled. This is called Kangaroo care and has been shown to impact&#xD;
      on long term health for both babies and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have designed a system to free babies of the wires that tether them to the monitors. This&#xD;
      system has been tested in adults and we now want to test them on the babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two study parts with two different questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How good is the data? This will compare the new wireless system with the existing&#xD;
           system. Babies will have both standard wired monitors and the new wireless monitor on at&#xD;
           the same time so we can compare the data to see how good is the quality of the data&#xD;
           collected on the new system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What do parents and staff think about the wireless system during Kangaroo care? Babies&#xD;
           who no longer need monitoring (but who previously had been monitored with the wired&#xD;
           system), will have the wireless system attached and the parent will take their baby from&#xD;
           the cot for Kangaroo Care. After the baby has been placed back in the cot, we will&#xD;
           conduct interviews with the parent and the nurse to find out what they thought of the&#xD;
           new system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope this will help the investigators to understand about how good the data is we collect&#xD;
      and how we might be able to improve the system.&#xD;

      Summary of study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center study recruiting from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at&#xD;
      Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. There are 2 study parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the new system in comparison with standard&#xD;
           clinical monitoring systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Qualitative Assessment of parent and staff views of caring for babies with the new&#xD;
           system in comparison with conventional clinical monitoring systems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative study arm Study population Up to 24 participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Addenbrooke's Hospital NICU. The participants will be recruited from three groups, defined by&#xD;
      the BAPM Categories of Care The population size has been selected to include sufficient&#xD;
      babies to collect a reasonable amount of data to ascertain, with confidence, our defined&#xD;
      outcomes. Furthermore, the data should come from across the range of variables seen in babies&#xD;
      requiring intensive care while limiting exposure of the infants at most risk. The study will&#xD;
      be performed in a stepwise fashion, starting with those infants requiring lower dependency&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Babies being cared for on the NICU at Addenbrookes Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written, informed parental consent Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known to have an intolerance to silicone or silicone gel adhesives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has a pacemaker or other implanted electronic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned procedures Participants will have the newly developed wireless sensors for ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, and temperature attached adjacent to the current clinical, wired sensors. Once the&#xD;
      application sites have been identified and prepared, the sensors will be placed on the baby&#xD;
      by an appropriately trained individual. The wireless receiver will connect to a separate&#xD;
      patient monitor to log the comparative data. This study monitor will be covered and silenced&#xD;
      such that data will not be visible to the clinical team, and it will not be possible to&#xD;
      confuse the study monitor from the 'clinical' monitor. The sensors will be in place for a&#xD;
      period of up to 24 hours. After this period, the study sensors will be removed, and the site&#xD;
      inspected by a member of the research team and scored using the standard tissue viability&#xD;
      scoring system already in use on the unit. The sensors will be disposed of in keeping with&#xD;
      the unit and Trust policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study intervention, a questionnaire will be given to the nurse caring for the baby&#xD;
      to determine their views on the wireless system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected from both the study monitor and the 'clinical'&#xD;
      monitor. The data are formed of two types: parameter data and waveform data. Parameter data&#xD;
      has a two-second interval. The waveform data has a period of approximately 4ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Up to 10 participants will be recruited from the Addenbrooke's Hospital.&#xD;
      This is in line with other studies with similar cohorts and balances the need to obtain a&#xD;
      range of views and experiences, with the imposition on parents' time in such an environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAPM level transitional care babies who do not clinically require vital sign monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The baby has had vital sign monitoring at some point during their stay on the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written, informed parental consent Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known to have an intolerance to silicone or silicone gel adhesives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has a pacemaker or other implanted electronic medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned procedure Babies who are not indicated for vital sign monitoring will have the&#xD;
      wireless monitoring system attached. Once the application sites have been identified and&#xD;
      prepared, the sensors will be placed on the baby by an appropriately trained individual. The&#xD;
      wireless receiver will connect to the study monitor to log the vital sign data, and all&#xD;
      alarms will be silenced. The monitor will be covered and silenced such that it will not&#xD;
      impact on clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baby will be transferred from the cot/incubator to the parent for kangaroo care as per&#xD;
      standard NICU procedure. The parent and baby will remain in contact for as long as the parent&#xD;
      is comfortable, and the baby remains stable and in keeping with unit policy and procedures.&#xD;
      The baby will then be transferred back to the cot, and monitoring will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 30 minutes will then be conducted with, (i)&#xD;
      the nurse, and (ii) the parent(s). These interviews will focus on previous experiences with&#xD;
      vital sign monitoring systems, and their experience of using the new wireless system.&#xD;
