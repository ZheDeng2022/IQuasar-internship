  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to compare navigated kinematically aligned total knee&#xD;
      replacements (KA TKR) with navigated mechanically aligned TKR (MA TKR) in terms of function&#xD;
      and ROM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are therefore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the functional outcomes of KA TKR versus MA TKR performed using navigation&#xD;
           technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare ROM and alignment of knee in the two groups&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. .subject recruitment Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of some of&#xD;
           the orthopaedic surgeons working at Hull and East Yorkshire NHS trust hospitals over&#xD;
           18-24 months period. The patients coming to new clinic during this period will be&#xD;
           explained about the trial and explained about the two methods of TKR- kinematically&#xD;
           aligned and mechanically aligned. The participants involved in this study will NOT be&#xD;
           paid any remuneration. The procedure involved and the follow up details will be&#xD;
           explained to the patient and patient information leaflets handed over to them. The&#xD;
           consent will be obtained in the clinic, in the presence of a nurse and / or family&#xD;
           members of the patient. In case of non-English speaking patients, an interpreter will be&#xD;
           called to do the translation of the communication between doctor and the patient. The&#xD;
           interpreter in such scenarios will have to sign on the consent form in addition to the&#xD;
           patients. Patients will be given sufficient time to arrive at a decision. In case they&#xD;
           want to think over this study, they will be given one month, after which a telephonic&#xD;
           conversation will be conducted to reach a decision. Patients can sign the consent form&#xD;
           in the clinic or on the day of the surgery. On the day of surgery, reconfirmation of the&#xD;
           consent to participate in the trial will be undertaken. Patient will be free to come out&#xD;
           of trial at any stage of the trial if they wish to do so. Patients with special needs&#xD;
           (mentally ill, children, those suffering from dementia) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. .Source of patients Patients visiting orthopaedic elective clinic of 2-3 consultants&#xD;
           will be selected for this study. The study will be carried out at Hull Royal Infirmary&#xD;
           and Castle Hill Hospitals. Expected number of patients eligible for the trial is 130 (65&#xD;
           in each group of kinematically aligned knee and mechanically aligned knee). We expect&#xD;
           that at least 95% patients will agree to the trial. One surgeon will perform all&#xD;
           kinematically aligned TKR and other surgeons will perform all mechanically aligned TKR&#xD;
           which will ensure that there is no change of clinical practice for any surgeons in terms&#xD;
           of kinematic or mechanical alignment of the TKR .&#xD;
&#xD;
      5….Randomisation Patients will be randomised using research randomiser computer software&#xD;
      (randomisation.com).{16}.This program is a pseudo random number generator. The numbers are&#xD;
      generated by complex algorithm (seeded by computer clock) that gives the appearance of&#xD;
      randomness. This will help us randomly assign our study population into the two groups. It is&#xD;
      a single blinded study and patients will be blinded. Envelopes will be opened after clinic&#xD;
      appointment and patients will be booked for surgery based on which group they get randomised&#xD;
      to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6….withdrawal of subjects Patients may be withdrawn at any stage of the follow up/trial. If&#xD;
      any patient develops dementia, deep infection, fracture, failure of extensor mechanism or any&#xD;
      other injury which affects their mobility or ability to make decision will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study. Under such circumstances randomization codes may have to be broken. Also if the&#xD;
      patients want to sought second opinion or continue the treatment outside the trust, the codes&#xD;
      may have to be broken. The codes will be available with the inpatient secretaries and may be&#xD;
      obtained from them after taking due permission from the investigators. There won't be a need&#xD;
      to replace a subject in this matter. Only randomization might have to be adjusted&#xD;
      accordingly. The withdrawn subjects will be followed up in the clinics of respective&#xD;
      surgeons, till a suitable period when they can be discharged to the care of the GPs, unless&#xD;
      and until the subjects wishes not to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7…Study treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical alignment considers only the two-dimensional (2D) alignment of the limb and knee&#xD;
      in the coronal or frontal plane. Followers of mechanically aligned TKR strive to cut the&#xD;
      distal femur perpendicular to a line drawn from the centre of the femoral head to the centre&#xD;
      of the knee - the mechanical axis of the femur - and cut the proximal tibia perpendicular to&#xD;
      a line drawn from the centre of the knee to the centre of the ankle - the mechanical axis of&#xD;
      the tibia. Most surgeons using navigational rechnique for mechanically aligned TKR will aim&#xD;
      to perform proximal tibial and distal femoral bony resection at 90 degrees to the mechanical&#xD;
      axis of the femur and tibia..&#xD;
&#xD;
      In navigated kinematically-aligned TKA, the surgeon strives to position the femoral and&#xD;
      tibial components to resurface the knee and restore the natural joint lines in the arthritic&#xD;
      knee. The goal of kinematically aligned TKA is to restore the natural difference in symmetry&#xD;
      and varus/valgus laxity between 0° of extension and 90° of flexion of the normal knee.&#xD;
      Proximal tibial resection is performed to achieve equal thickness of medial and lateral bony&#xD;
      resection accounting for wear and thickness of the saw blade. This usually results in varus&#xD;
      tibial resection. To prevent excessive varus , a maximum upper limit of tibial resection is&#xD;
      set at 3-4 degrees. Posterior slope is measured on xrays. Using navigation data exactly same&#xD;
      amount of posterior slope is recreated accounting for 3 degrees of slope already present in&#xD;
      tibial poly liner with Columbus TKR system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recording femoral data on navigation system and gap measurements, femoral resection is&#xD;
      planned to achieve equal medial and lateral gaps in full extension but slightly wider gap on&#xD;
      lateral side in flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo patella resurfacing irrespective of condition of the patella to&#xD;
      remove potential bias if the patellar resurfacing is performed only in selective cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8…General information Name of treatment….Total knee replacement Device…. Columbus TKR&#xD;
      manufactured by Bbraun Licence information in the UK….. This implant is widely available in&#xD;
      UK and has gone through necessary approvals and is licensed for use in UK. This implant has&#xD;
      been used by both surgeons as part of their usual orthopaedic practice Intended benefits.&#xD;
      Pain and improved function Potential risks……infection, bleeding, scars, stiffness, persisting&#xD;
      pain/deformity, loosening , fractures, dislocations, DVT , myocardial infarctions, cement&#xD;
      reactions, stroke , death, damage to blood vessels and /or nerves, anaesthesia related&#xD;
      complications , damage to extensor mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9….use of treatment within the trial Mechanically aligned and kinematically aligned knee&#xD;
      replacement has been used in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis who have not benefitted&#xD;
      from non arthroplasty options. The efficacy has been validated in various studies. It is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure carried out in operation theatres under anaesthesia. . The radiation&#xD;
      involved in this study will be in form of X-rays which will be taken immediately preoperative&#xD;
      (full leg alignment view), post-operative (standard ap/lat view) and at 1 year follow up&#xD;
      (full leg alignment view). After the completion of trial the patients will be followed up in&#xD;
      the clinic of operative surgeon until a period where they can be discharged to the care of&#xD;
      respective GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10…subject and compliance of study treatment The compliance will be assessed by the visits at&#xD;
      follow up. If there is any missed follow up appointment, postal reminder will be sent. If the&#xD;
      patient does not attend follow up visit on the consecutive appointment, it will be considered&#xD;
      as lost to follow ups and discharged from the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPLIANCE WILL BE MONITORED WITH the help of Lorenzo software, to know if they were lost for&#xD;
      follow ups. At such times, we will record the reason for a missed follow up after they have&#xD;
      been missed for follow ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients lost to follow ups will be withdrawn from the study and will be followed as routine&#xD;
      follow ups in the clinic of operating surgeon, unless they wish to do so.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Why the data are being collected Initial baseline data and follow up quantitative and&#xD;
           qualitative data for analysis and comparison between the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the data are gathered using a standardised tool (e.g. McGill pain score), by&#xD;
           means of a procedure (in which case full details should be supplied). If a nonstandard&#xD;
           tool is to be used, detail on reliability and validity should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No tools will be used for data collection; goniometers (mechanical/digital/app based) will be&#xD;
      used to check ROM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What form the data will take Binary data will be selected. Hard copies of clinical&#xD;
           scores / ROM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe methods used to maximise completeness of data Patient will be contacted if they&#xD;
           are lost to follow up and in the database such patients will be red dotted 18….source&#xD;
           data&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a minimum, the following information will be recorded in patient's case notes for study&#xD;
      visits or telephone contacts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      19….protocol deviations /serious breaches All deviations from the protocol or GCP will be&#xD;
      recorded by investigators on Protocol Deviation Form for the trial available from R&amp;D. A&#xD;
      serious breach is likely to affect to a significant degree either the safety or physical or&#xD;
      mental integrity of a trial subject or the scientific value of the trial. Major deviations or&#xD;
      serious breaches will be reported by investigators to HEY R&amp;D by telephone (tel 461883) or in&#xD;
      person within 24 hours of the deviation or breach being identified. HEY R&amp;D will notify the&#xD;
      REC within 7 days of becoming aware of a serious breach. Investigators will take into account&#xD;
      all protocol deviations and any serious breaches in the final study analysis and publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20….study equipment All the equipment's and implants used in the study are a part of routine&#xD;
      knee replacement practice of both surgeons. The details of the implant. Confirmation that the&#xD;
      implant will be available during the course of the study. The arrangements made for&#xD;
      availability of the equipment, proper and timely maintenance and calibration of equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      21….end of trial The trial will end when the last patient participating in the trial will&#xD;
      complete 1 year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of discontinuation of trial, an interim analysis will take place with the help of&#xD;
      clinical director for orthopaedics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of study declaration form (using the NRES form) will be submitted to the REC and Trust&#xD;
      R&amp;D within 90 days from completion of the trial and within 15 days if the trial is&#xD;
      discontinued prematurely. A summary of the trial report/publication will be submitted to the&#xD;
      REC and Trust R&amp;D within 1 year of the end of trial 22….sample size calculation Waterson et&#xD;
      al (17) found that at 12 months the mean KOOS score was 77.7 (20.0 sd) in the KA TKR group.&#xD;
      This study is powered to demonstrate a 19 point difference in the KOOS score between groups&#xD;
      at 12 months which has been defined as the minimal clinical important (MCI) difference in&#xD;
      scores by the research team. Further literature review (20) confirms that the MCI for KOOS&#xD;
      after TKR actually ranges from 11 to 19 for various sub categories of KOOS. As our study&#xD;
      involves TKR as the main intervention it was agreed with the statistician to use the above&#xD;
      MCI figures which are more relevant to our study. Hence sample size was recalculated for&#xD;
      detecting a difference of 11 points for KOOS between 2 groups to ensure that study is&#xD;
      sufficiently powered. New sample size of 42 in each group is now agreed with statistician&#xD;
      assuming same standard deviation od 20 points in KOOS, using a one tailed analysis and an&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05 with a power of 0.80&#xD;
&#xD;
      23….statistical analysis This trial will be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines for&#xD;
      clinical trials (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials statement&#xD;
      (http://www.consort-statement.org/)). Analyses will be conducted following the principles of&#xD;
      intention-to-treat with patient's outcomes analysed according to their original, randomised&#xD;
      group irrespective of deviations based on non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be undertaken in Stata v14 or later (to be confirmed in the final report).&#xD;
      Significance tests will be two-sided at the 5% significance levels unless otherwise stated.&#xD;
      The statistician will remain blind to allocation until after the trial is complete and the&#xD;
      results have been finalised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients screened, eligible and randomised will be reported. The flow of&#xD;
      participants through the trial will be presented in a CONSORT diagram. Questionnaire response&#xD;
      rates will be summarised from each time point by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant baseline data will be summarised descriptively overall and by trial arm both&#xD;
      as randomised and as analysed in the primary analysis. No formal statistical comparisons will&#xD;
      be undertaken. Continuous measures will be reported as means and standard deviations while&#xD;
      the categorical data will be reported as counts and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will compare the KOOS at 12 months among the patients randomly allocated&#xD;
      to KA TKR and MA TKR. This result will be extracted from a covariance pattern model in which&#xD;
      KOOS at each time point (Baseline, 6 weeks , 6 months and 12 months) will be nested within&#xD;
      patients and the effect of treatment according to trial arm will be assessed. KOOS at&#xD;
      baseline, trial arm, each time point of follow-up, each time point of follow-up by trial arm&#xD;
      interaction, any stratification factors (fixed effects) and KOOS at each time point nested&#xD;
      within patient (random effects) will be included in the model. This will allow efficient use&#xD;
      of the data collected, and account for potential correlation of repeated measures and within&#xD;
      patient correlation.(18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different covariance structures for the repeated measurements, that are available as part of&#xD;
      Stata, will be explored and the most appropriate pattern will be used for the final model.&#xD;
      Diagnostics including Akaike's information criterion [19] will be compared for each model&#xD;
      (smaller values are preferred).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are included in the model if they have full data for the baseline covariates and&#xD;
      outcome data for at least one post-randomisation time point. A comparison of baseline data&#xD;
      for patients 'as analysed' in the primary analysis will allow assessment of whether attrition&#xD;
      has introduced selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This linear mixed model will also provide an estimate of the comparable effect of KA TKR and&#xD;
      MA TKR in terms of a change in KOOS at every time point for secondary investigations aimed at&#xD;
      determining any potential pattern of improvement. Treatment effect sizes will be reported&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals for each time point. The assumptions of the linear model will&#xD;
      be checked visually. The normality of the standardised residuals will be assessed via a&#xD;
      histogram and QQ-plot, and the homoscedasticity of the errors will be checked by plotting the&#xD;
      residuals against the fitted valvalues. If model assumptions are in doubt, transformations&#xD;
      will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome data will be summarised descriptively at each time point, overall and by&#xD;
      trial arm and will be analysed in exactly the same way as the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24…pharmacy There is no role of pharmacy in the trial. The implants have been in use all over&#xD;
      the UK and in the trust for more than 5 years and will be available for future use in the&#xD;
      trust during the trial 25….Quality control and quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      a…Peer review This trial has been Peer reviewed and discussed in clinical governance meeting&#xD;
      of orthopaedic department by Name Mr T Symes Position clinical director, Orthopaedic&#xD;
      department Address Hull Royal Infirmary, Anlaby Road, Hull, HU3 2JZ Contact details&#xD;
      tom.symes@hey.nhs.uk b….monitoring The study may be monitored in accordance with HEY R&amp;D&#xD;
      department standard operating procedures to ensure compliance with ICH GCP and the Research&#xD;
      governance Framework 2005. All trial related documents will be made available upon request&#xD;
      for monitoring by R&amp;D monitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      26….Ethical considerations The treatment modalities offered in the trial, are part and parcel&#xD;
      of the surgeons routine knee replacement practice. Hence there are not obvious ethical&#xD;
      considerations in this trial&#xD;
