  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction is a polygenic disease that may occur due to various environmental risk&#xD;
      factors. Mortality risk of the disease; sex, age, smoking, systolic blood pressure, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein levels. The paraoxonase-1 phenotype is expressed as&#xD;
      the paraoxonase/arylesterase ratio and is closely related to high-density lipoprotein, acting&#xD;
      as an endogenous defense mechanism against vascular oxidative stress, thus contributing to&#xD;
      the prevention of atherosclerosis. Serum concentration and activity depend on environmental&#xD;
      factors as well as genetic polymorphism. This decrease in enzyme concentration causes changes&#xD;
      in gene expression (1). Numerous data on Paraoxonase-1 levels have been found in studies,&#xD;
      especially with decreasing serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities with age, associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in humans. Many studies&#xD;
      have shown that serum Paraoxonase-1 activity is significantly reduced in people with&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease. The most&#xD;
      important risk factor for these and similar diseases is aging. Diversity of conditions such&#xD;
      as genetic predisposition, malnutrition, stress, and smoking, which increases vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction due to oxidative stress, classify individuals with acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      according to age groups and investigate whether there is a relationship between serum&#xD;
      Paraoxonase-1 activity and severity of coronary artery disease in young patients. The&#xD;
      paraoxonase-1 enzyme, which is known to decrease blood levels with age, is found to be&#xD;
      significantly lower in patients with myocardial infarction at a young age compared to the&#xD;
      healthy control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High-density lipoprotein (HDL), known as good cholesterol, is named because of its protective&#xD;
      effects on the cardiovascular system. in order to summarize the mechanism of the event,&#xD;
      cholesterol is transported from the liver to the cells and from the cells back to the liver&#xD;
      via blood. Cholesterol and other fats are carried in packets called lipoprotein to dissolve&#xD;
      in the blood. Those with these are two kinds of cholesterol, these low-density lipoproteins&#xD;
      and good cholesterol can help to lower the cholesterol as well. LDL cholesterol is the main&#xD;
      package that carries cholesterol in the blood. When the blood is high, it sticks to the&#xD;
      inside of the veins and forms plaques around here. With the addition of cholesterol, a blood&#xD;
      clot that formed in cracks that occur on these plaques grow the arteries and clogs them. If&#xD;
      the blockage occurs in the heart vessels, it can cause a heart attack and stroke. Cholesterol&#xD;
      in the blood is a part of a package called HDL-cholesterol is carried in. HDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      prevents the accumulation of cholesterol in the veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It collects the cholesterol circulating in the blood and brings it to the liver to get rid of&#xD;
      it from the body. Thus, it reduces the exposure of blood vessels to the harmful effects of&#xD;
      cholesterol. All these effects of HDL cholesterol in the paraoxonase enzyme owes. This may be&#xD;
      the reason why Dolat may even use another nomenclature instead of HDL in future years. A&#xD;
      paraoxonase-1 enzyme, which is known to decrease blood level with age, is found to be&#xD;
      significantly lower in patients with myocardial infarction at a young age compared with the&#xD;
      healthy control group in this study, and the measurement of this enzyme level can be used as&#xD;
      a screening test in people with risk factors.&#xD;
