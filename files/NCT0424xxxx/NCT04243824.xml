      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate Ga-68 MAA distribution on PET/MRI after&#xD;
      injection into the prostatic arteries in patients without prostate cancer who are being&#xD;
      treated with prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Study subjects will be 5 men scheduled to undergo the PAE procedure at UNC&#xD;
      Hospital for benign prostatic hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Study subjects will undergo PAE using the standard technique. Prior to&#xD;
      embolization of the prostatic artery with the bland embolic agent, Ga-68 MAA will be&#xD;
      injected. Standard departmental radiation protection procedures will be followed. After the&#xD;
      PAE procedure is complete, the patient will be transported to the UNC Biomedical Research&#xD;
      Imaging Center to undergo PET/MRI.&#xD;

      This study is an initial proof of concept evaluation to determine the feasibility of using&#xD;
      Y-90 radioembolization performed using the Sniper balloon occlusion microcatheter to treat&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer. This will be performed by evaluating Ga-68 MAA distribution on&#xD;
      PET/MRI after injection into the prostatic arteries in patients without prostate cancer who&#xD;
      are being treated with prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The&#xD;
      distribution of the radiotracer activity within the prostate and any activity in adjacent&#xD;
      organs will be determined for when the tracer is injected into the central prostatic&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;
