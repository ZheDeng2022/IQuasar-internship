      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bipolar fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency treatment via use of the Profound System to achieve lift in lax submental&#xD;
      (beneath the chin) and neck tissue&#xD;

      A multi-center, blinded, non-randomized, non-controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 eligible participants will be enrolled at up to three (3) sites. Participants will&#xD;
      receive one (1) treatment in the submental/neck area. Participants will complete follow-up&#xD;
      visits for clinical evaluation at Day 14, 1 Month, 3 Month, and 6 Months after the study&#xD;
      treatment. Standard photography will be obtained at Screening to the 6 Month follow-up, and&#xD;
      3D photography will be obtained at Screening, Month 3, and Month 6 visit.&#xD;
