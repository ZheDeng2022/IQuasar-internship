    <textblock>
      Non-adherence is a recognized problem with growth hormone treatment in children. In this&#xD;
      study, we aim to utilize web-based information derived from easypod growth hormone injection&#xD;
      devices and easypod connect devices in a nurse-led telephone clinic to improve adherence and&#xD;
      therefore optimize growth. Our primary aim is to test height SDS change over a 12 month&#xD;
      period. Our secondary aims are to test adherence, acceptance/satisfaction and qualitative&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant human growth hormone (GH) is used in the treatment of short stature due to growth&#xD;
      hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, Prader Willi syndrome, small for gestational age with&#xD;
      failure of catch up growth, chronic renal failure and SHOX deficiency. Growth hormone is&#xD;
      administered at home as daily injections and given over several years. Administration of&#xD;
      growth hormone involves considerable commitment from parents and families and incurs&#xD;
      significant cost to the NHS in the UK. Current treatment regimens using a range of GH&#xD;
      formulations are not based on drug efficacy, cost effectiveness or cost of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well recognised that adherence to treatment is directly correlated to height&#xD;
      performance in patients receiving GH. Several studies have indicated better height outcomes&#xD;
      through use of technology to enhance patient adherence. The standard model of care of GH&#xD;
      therapy involves patients returning to review appointments with clinicians for GH monitoring&#xD;
      and dose adjustment. This model requires travel to hospitals at regular intervals (3-4&#xD;
      monthly), causing disruption to regular routines, inconveniencing family commitments,&#xD;
      education and school. Importantly, this model does not encourage adherence or compliance with&#xD;
      GH and relies on individual patient and family initiative to ensure treatment delivery.&#xD;
      Alternative and more user-friendly models of care promoting greater adherence to GH are&#xD;
      required to improve efficiency of GH treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have proposed a novel model of GH treatment monitoring integrating web-based adherence&#xD;
      information in paediatric endocrine specialist nurse-led telephone clinics. A specialist&#xD;
      nurse-led telephone clinic for management of growth hormone already exists at the Royal&#xD;
      Manchester Children's Hospital (RMCH) and generates positive feedback from parents and&#xD;
      families whilst releasing capacity in face to face growth clinics. The WAIN-MC model&#xD;
      integrates and improves this specialist nurse-led clinic with web-based GH adherence&#xD;
      information as a clinical innovation. The proposed model enables remote monitoring without&#xD;
      travel to the hospital, review of growth performance in relation to adherence information and&#xD;
      improved engagement of parents/families, thereby increasing adherence, satisfaction and&#xD;
      height gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current models of GH treatment are not targeted towards increasing adherence and achieving&#xD;
      improved height gain. It is important to explore alternative models of care using GH that&#xD;
      improve adherence to treatment and result in improved height outcome whilst enhancing patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. The WAIN-MC model represents a clinical innovation which requires testing for&#xD;
      utility in a pilot study prior to wider application in the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WAIN-MC feasibility study provides an alternative treatment model that might improve&#xD;
      adherence of treatment, resulting in greater height outcome than with the current standard&#xD;
      model of hospital review. This study is based on a telephone clinic run by specialist nurses&#xD;
      who are able to access information about treatment adherence through easypod connect. This&#xD;
      model enables greater understanding of adherence patterns correlated to height gain without&#xD;
      requiring additional hospital reviews and the stress of frequent visits to the hospital. It&#xD;
      is likely to be better accepted by parents and families, thereby fostering greater adherence&#xD;
      and culminating in greater efficiency of treatment. WAIN-MC represents the application of&#xD;
      digital technology in the achievement of improved treatment outcomes in children receiving GH&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous findings and data from other studies It is well recognised that an important&#xD;
      component of treatment outcome with GH is adherence. However, non-adherence is common among&#xD;
      children and families receiving treatment with height outcomes being limited by and&#xD;
      correlated with the degree of non-adherence [1]. In spite of efforts made by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, long term adherence with GH treatment is suboptimal and widespread [2], with&#xD;
      one study reporting 30% good adherence [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several devices are available to inject or transject GH for treatment in children. Only one&#xD;
      device records the number of the injections and the efficiency of dose injection administered&#xD;
      - Saizen easypod™ manufactured by Merck Healthcare KGaA. Easypod can also dock into a 4G&#xD;
      connected device, easypod connect™ which uploads adherence as digital information specific to&#xD;
      the patient. A recent study showed good adherence using easypod connect with the magnitude of&#xD;
      2 year catch-up height gain correlated to high adherence levels [4]. In the multi-centred&#xD;
      longitudinal observational study (ECOS study) involving 1190 patients, median adherence with&#xD;
      GH treatment was high at 93.7% in the first year [5]. However, adherence decreased with&#xD;
      increasing treatment duration with adherence rates progressively declining to 87.2% at 3&#xD;
      years, 75.5% at 4 years and 70.2% at 5 years. Thus the use of easypod GH and easypod connect&#xD;
      is strongly associated with good adherence with GH treatment but is unable to prevent the&#xD;
      reduction of adherence rates over longer durations of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WAIN-MC clinical innovation integrates easypod connect with the structure of a specialist&#xD;
      nurse-led telephone clinic for additive treatment outcome benefits for each component. It is&#xD;
      expected that the synthesis model will not only reinforce adherence but also sustain this&#xD;
      through regular clinical contact. WAIN-MC is a novel development and therefore has not been&#xD;
      investigated for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are the likely benefits of WAIN-MC to participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improved height gain over 1 year of treatment; initial height gain is likely to&#xD;
           correlate with optimal final height gain at the end of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improved patient and family satisfaction with WAIN-MC, reinforcing further adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased clinic capacity for standard clinic reviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improved cost efficiency of treatment with favourable financial cost of height gain and&#xD;
           favourable total cost of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serve as a template for future studies in GH treatment and other forms of daily&#xD;
           injectable therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The WAIN-MC model is a feasible option in the treatment of children with GH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence will improve by 10% from the time of entry to the study to the time at the end&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Children on GH will gain 0.5 SD or more within one year of adopting WAIN-MC&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parents and families will find the application of WAIN-MC to their satisfaction and&#xD;
           therefore provide positive qualitative feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the utility of a nurse led clinic using easypod connect&#xD;
      web-based GH adherence information in a one year feasibility study. The study will&#xD;
      investigate if adherence with easypod GH improves by combining easypod connect with nurse led&#xD;
      telephone monitoring clinics. The study will also investigate potential improvement in height&#xD;
      gain over 12 months whilst adopting WAIN-MC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study designed to investigate whether the WAIN-MC model is practical&#xD;
      for use in this population. At present there are 70 patients enrolled on this model, which is&#xD;
      a reasonable sample size to assess variation in auxology outcomes. Taking alpha as 0.05, and&#xD;
      90% power, a sample size of 70 will detect an effect size of 0.41, allowing for 10% dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the semi-structured interviews not all parents will consent and financial and time&#xD;
      practicalities also constrain the sample size. All 70 patients will be invited to consent and&#xD;
      a random selection of 15 individuals will be selected from those consenting to take part in a&#xD;
      semi structured interview for feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no controls groups for this feasibility study. Each patient will serve as his/her&#xD;
      own control with comparison of adherence and auxology data between initial and final visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients All patients who receive easypod GH of age 1-14 years will be approached for&#xD;
           consent to participate in the study. Patients may have any valid cause for short&#xD;
           stature. These may include children with isolated growth hormone deficiency, multiple&#xD;
           pituitary hormone deficiencies, and non-growth hormone deficient conditions such as&#xD;
           small for gestational age with postnatal failure of height gain, chronic renal failure&#xD;
           and Turner syndrome. Patients will be recruited to the study irrespective of diagnosis&#xD;
           and will not be stratified by diagnosis at entry to the study. However, in analysis of&#xD;
           data, subgroup analysis may be performed on groups such as those with isolated growth&#xD;
           hormone deficiency, dependent on the frequency of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be identified at the start of the study. A one month period will be&#xD;
           considered before the study commences to contact families for potential recruitment.&#xD;
           Each patient will remain in the study for 12 months. The active study duration will be&#xD;
           18 months whereby all eligible patients will be recruited and followed up for a 12 month&#xD;
           period. This period will be followed by a buffer period to gather necessary data for&#xD;
           analysis. The timeline of the study is provided in the in Appendix 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures Health Research Authority/Ethical (IRAS 264053) and MFT approval will be&#xD;
           achieved for this study prior to any study procedures commencing. Information for&#xD;
           consent will be provided to the parents of patients eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
           at study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric endocrine specialist nurse led face to face appointments at outpatients in RMCH&#xD;
      will be set up on 3 days for explanation and patient recruitment. The appointments will be&#xD;
      led by specialist nurses Sister Julie Jones and Sister Helen Pimlott and overseen by Dr I&#xD;
      Banerjee, CI for the study. Dr Banerjee will undertake consent for this study from parents&#xD;
      and carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinic reviews with hospital visits will continue in parallel. Investigations, dose&#xD;
      changes and other treatment alterations will be continued as part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, the following information will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adherence information based on easypod connect data over the month previous to study&#xD;
           entry will be recorded in the clinical research form (CRF). A hard copy of a screen&#xD;
           capture image will be stored in the CRF for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Height will be measured by a Harpenden stadiometer at outpatients department in RMCH.&#xD;
           Weight will be measured at the time using weighing scales. Information on age, sex,&#xD;
           height and weight will be entered into the CRF. Puberty will not be assessed but&#xD;
           information on puberty will be obtained from the previous or closest clinic review&#xD;
           correspondence. Auxology (height, weight) will be converted to standard deviation scores&#xD;
           using both UK 1990 centiles and WHO reference standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The educational qualifications of one or both parents will be noted using the&#xD;
           International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 2011&#xD;
           [http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-operational-manual.pdf]. The&#xD;
           following categories will be used: 0 pre-primary education, 1 primary education, 2 lower&#xD;
           secondary education, 3 upper secondary education, 4 post-secondary non-tertiary&#xD;
           education, 5 short-cycle tertiary education, 6 Bachelor or equivalent, 7 Master or&#xD;
           equivalent, 8 Doctoral or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial visit, two nurse led telephone monitoring clinics will be set up at 4&#xD;
      and 8 months. Patients and families will be offered a choice of 3 days for each of the 4 and&#xD;
      8 month telephone clinic appointments. Each appointment will last for 20 minutes. The&#xD;
      telephone appointment will be structured in the following format:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascertain dose of easypod GH, cartridge size of easypod GH and check if supplies are&#xD;
           adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record special circumstances potentially influencing adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Parent/carer reported adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain recent height and weight data from GP surgery measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Record advice regarding method of administration, needle size and depth of injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Record parent perceptions of adherence and comparison with easypod connect information&#xD;
           over previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final face to face nurse led clinic review will be undertaken at outpatients in RMCH.&#xD;
      Patients and families will be offered a choice of 3 days for the final study visit. At the&#xD;
      final appointment, the following information will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Auxology data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence data over previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adverse events, if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The highest education status will be re-ascertained in as per the International Standard&#xD;
           Classification of Education (ISCED)] as stated at the initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomly chosen subset (n=15) will be invited to a semi structured interview to provide&#xD;
      feedback. The interview will be conducted by Dr Jacqueline Nicholson, clinical psychologist&#xD;
      at RMCH. The interview will last 30 minutes and will focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 5 point Likert scale of parent perception of satisfaction for WAIN-MC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 5 point Likert scale of parent perception of preference for WAIN-MC as a future&#xD;
           clinical model&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative comments of suitability of WAIN-MC to patient care and suggestions for&#xD;
           improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be explored to understand their form and completeness using appropriate&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (N [%], mean [standard deviation] or median [interquartile range]) and&#xD;
      graphics. No imputation will take place for missing data, but consideration may be made in&#xD;
      the analyses in the event of large numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in height SDS between entry and final visit will be assessed by paired t-tests&#xD;
      or non-parametric equivalent as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence data will be available on a daily basis, but for the main purposes of analysis will&#xD;
      be reported as a percentage for each month (1-12). Trends in non-adherence on a daily basis&#xD;
      will be explored graphically with consideration for recorded information, e.g. consecutive&#xD;
      non adherence due to technical fault or missing doses due to illness or being away on&#xD;
      holiday. Adherence data over a 12 month period will be collated into units of time, i.e.&#xD;
      weeks or months and presented descriptively, with the aid of longitudinal graphs. If&#xD;
      indicated longitudinal models will be used to describe any trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in adherence at entry to the study (month 1) and final visit (month 12) will&#xD;
      be tested by paired t-tests or non-parametric equivalent. The change will also be explored&#xD;
      using multivariable regression models to adjust for age, sex, diagnosis and ISCED group.&#xD;
      Univariate and multivariable linear regression model will be used to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of adherence on height SDS, adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis and ISCED group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis Results from the patent satisfaction and patient preference&#xD;
      questionnaires will be presented descriptively. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and&#xD;
      the six stages of Thematic Analysis will be used to analyse the interview data.&#xD;
