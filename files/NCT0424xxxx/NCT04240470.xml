      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether the endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without&#xD;
           using intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute&#xD;
           ischemic stroke patients demonstrates &quot;promise&quot; or a lack thereof (&quot;futility&quot;) in&#xD;
           deciding what would be the next phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the proportion of subjects with slight or no disability (a modified Rankin&#xD;
           score (mRS) of 0-2) at 3 months after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical&#xD;
           thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA and compare with historical controls who were&#xD;
           treated with IV rt-PA to identify (or lack of) futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the proportion of subjects with improvement in the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥8 points or achieving a score of 0-1 at 24 hours&#xD;
           after the onset of stroke among subjects with acute ischemic stroke after receiving&#xD;
           endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the proportion of subjects with angiographic recanalization on post procedure&#xD;
           angiogram according to modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) perfusion&#xD;
           flow categories among subjects with acute ischemic stroke after receiving endovascular&#xD;
           treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the proportion of subjects with treatment-related serious adverse events&#xD;
           (SAEs) within 72 hours and development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 27&#xD;
           ±3hrs post treatment among subjects with acute ischemic stroke after receiving&#xD;
           endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase II trial is proposed to address the question whether administration of intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute ischemic stroke patients who&#xD;
      are candidates for endovascular treatment provides any additional value. The phase II trial&#xD;
      will treat consecutive patients who are candidates for IV rt-PA and mechanical thrombectomy&#xD;
      with just mechanical thrombectomy alone. Such trial will generate the necessary data for a&#xD;
      definitive phase III trial. The trial is designed based on low rate of recanalization in&#xD;
      patients with major arterial occlusion with IV rt-PA alone and no difference in rate of&#xD;
      recanalization or distal embolization in patients who receive IV rt-PA and those who do not&#xD;
      prior to mechanical thrombectomy. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization are higher when IV rt-PA is administered prior to mechanical thrombectomy.&#xD;
      The trial will determine the proportion of patients with slight or no disability (a modified&#xD;
      Rankin score (mRS) of 0-2) at 3 months after receiving endovascular treatment (mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy) alone without using IV rt-PA and compare with historical controls who were&#xD;
      treated with IV rt-PA to determine futility.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Low molecular weight heparins (such as Dalteparin, Enoxaparin, Tinzaparin,&#xD;
                  Fondaparinux) as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis or in full dose within&#xD;
                  the last 24 hours from screening unless anti-activated factor X (anti-factor Xa)&#xD;
                  assay less than 200% of control value.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received heparin within 48 hours must have a normal partial&#xD;
                  thromboplastin time (PTT) to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have received heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor (Angiomax,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients on dabigatran etexilate mesylate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto),&#xD;
                  apixaban (Eliquis), and edoxaban (Savaysa) may be considered after 48 hours after&#xD;
                  last intake of medication in patients with normal renal function (CrCl &gt; 60&#xD;
                  mL/minute). If moderate renal impairment, CrCl of 30-59 mL/minute, last dose&#xD;
                  should be 72 hours before procedure and 96 hours in severe renal impaired&#xD;
                  patients (CrCl of 15-29 mL/minute). The time interval between the last dose&#xD;
                  administration and the neurointerventional procedure appears to be the most&#xD;
                  reliable criterion for assessing the risk of bleeding events. Patients in whom&#xD;
                  time of last dose ingestion is unknown or within last 48 hours, can be included&#xD;
                  under following circumstances: normal PTT for dabigatran, normal prothrombin time&#xD;
                  for rivaroxaban, or anti-activated factor X (anti-factor Xa) assay rivaroxaban&#xD;

                  value.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with an arterial puncture at a non-compressible site or a lumbar&#xD;
                  puncture in the previous 7 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with a pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that would&#xD;
                  confound the neurological or functional evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other serious, advanced, or terminal illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current participation in another research drug treatment protocol (patient cannot&#xD;
                  start another experimental agent until after 90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent is not or cannot be obtained. For example, obtunded patients are not&#xD;
        automatically excluded from the study. However, if the next of kin or legal guardian (i.e.,&#xD;
        the individual legally empowered in the state where the consent is obtained) cannot provide&#xD;
        consent, randomization and entry into the study could not proceed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  High density lesion consistent with hemorrhage of any degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant mass effect with midline shift.&#xD;

          -  Large (more than 1/3 of the middle cerebral artery) regions of clear hypodensity on&#xD;
             the baseline CT scan or ASPECTS of &lt; 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sulcal effacement and / or loss of grey-white differentiation alone are not&#xD;
             contraindications for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CT Angiographic Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angiographic evidence of carotid dissection or complete cervical carotid occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial tortuosity, calcification, pre-existing stent, and/or stenosis, which would&#xD;
             prevent the thrombectomy device from reaching the target vessel and/or preclude safe&#xD;
             recovery of the endovascular devices.&#xD;
