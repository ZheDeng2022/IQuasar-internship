  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is strongly associated with opioid consumption among Veterans, and&#xD;
      improved clinical management of LBP is likely to reduce reliance on opioid among Veterans. Up&#xD;
      to 60% of patients with an acute episode of nonspecific LBP experience either symptom&#xD;
      persistence or symptom relapse within one year. This is likely an indication of a failure in&#xD;
      addressing the underlying mechanisms of pain or initiation of a new etiology; both may stem&#xD;
      from a mismatch between patients and treatments. The overall goal of this research is to&#xD;
      develop, validate and implement measures that are relevant to known mechanisms of LBP, which&#xD;
      can then be used to holistically gauge the health status of patients' lower backs beyond&#xD;
      self-reporting of symptoms. More accurate measurements will help better match of patients&#xD;
      with existing treatments or development of more effective new treatments. The specific&#xD;
      objective of this study is to generate evidence in support of the feasibility of the&#xD;
      investigators' methods for 1) the evaluation of relative contribution of lower back tissues&#xD;
      to spinal loads, and 2) the investigation of the resultant spinal loads in Veterans with&#xD;
      non-specific LBP. The investigators have developed a powerful set of tools for the&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of spinal loads and lower back mechanical behavior (MB), that will&#xD;
      enable the investigators to examine the existence or development of abnormalities in spinal&#xD;
      loads and lower back MB in three groups of Veterans with different experiences with&#xD;
      non-specific LBP. These groups will include 1) Veterans with chronic, non-specific LBP and&#xD;
      high level of disability (n=18), 2) Veterans with chronic, non-specific LBP and low level of&#xD;
      disability (n=18), 3) asymptomatic Veterans without a recent history of non-specific LBP&#xD;
      (n=18; serving as control group). Successful completion of this feasibility project will pave&#xD;
      the way for future studies (merit grant applications) that will verify the role of&#xD;
      abnormalities in lower back MB and spinal loads in the clinical presentation of LBP. Such an&#xD;
      understanding has the potential to help the affected Veterans with disabling non-specific&#xD;
      LBP. Specifically, measures of lower back MB and spinal loads can be used not only to&#xD;
      identify Veterans with mechanical abnormalities in their lower back who are likely to&#xD;
      experience LBP in the future, but also to guide novel integrated physical and psychological&#xD;
      preventative treatments aimed at improved lower back mechanics. Ultimately, the goal and&#xD;
      resultant improvement in clinical outcomes of treatment for non-specific LBP is to diminish&#xD;
      reliance on opioids for the symptom management of particularly Veterans with chronic LBP.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this study is to generate evidence in support of the feasibility of&#xD;
      the investigators' developed methods for the evaluation of 1) relative contribution of lower&#xD;
      back tissues to spinal loads, and 2) the resultant spinal loads experienced during daily&#xD;
      activities in Veterans with non-specific LBP. Results of this feasibility study will enable&#xD;
      proper design of the investigators' future projects, wherein the investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the role of spinal loads experienced in daily life activities in clinical&#xD;
      presentation of LBP. The investigators have developed several innovative computational and&#xD;
      experimental methods for a comprehensive and personalized assessment of spinal loads.&#xD;
      Specifically, the relative mechanical contribution of active and passive lower back tissues&#xD;
      to spinal loads is assessed using advanced measures of bulk lower back mechanical behavior&#xD;
      (MB), whereas muscular responses to physical demands of daily activities and the resultant&#xD;
      spinal loads are evaluated using the investigators' finite element model of human spine. The&#xD;
      investigators have used the methods proposed in this application extensively for evaluation&#xD;
      of bulk lower back MB and spinal loads in asymptomatic individuals. This project will&#xD;
      demonstrate the sensitivity of the measures for capturing abnormalities in lower back MB and&#xD;
      spinal loads in patients with nonspecific LBP by completing the following two aims to achieve&#xD;
      the investigators' objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim-1: Feasibility of distinguishing potential differences in lower back MB between Veterans&#xD;
      with different LBP experiences. The investigators will characterize lower back MB in three&#xD;
      gender-balanced groups of Veterans between 20 and 70 years old. These will include Veterans&#xD;
      with 1) chronic LBP and a Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score of &gt;12 (n=18),&#xD;
      2) chronic LBP and RMDQ score of 12 (n=18), 3) no recent history of LBP and currently&#xD;
      asymptomatic (n=18), serving as control group). Participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      population served by the Lexington, KY, VA Medical Center. The investigators will determine&#xD;
      passive stiffness of the lower back and its relaxation along with its active intrinsic and&#xD;
      reflexive mechanical properties, using the sudden perturbation and stress-relaxations tests.&#xD;
      Given the reported differences in trunk neuromuscular behavior and lumbo-pelvic coordination,&#xD;
      the investigators expect to see differences in the measures between patient groups targeted&#xD;
      for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim-2: Feasibility of distinguishing potential differences in spinal loads between Veterans&#xD;
      with different LBP experiences. Trunk muscle forces and the resultant spinal loads will be&#xD;
      determined in the same participant groups when they perform common activities of daily living&#xD;
      like walking and manual material handling. Considering the causal role of spinal loads, and&#xD;
      given the persistence of symptom in patients with chronic LBP, along with the high risk of&#xD;
      LBP recurrence in patients with non-chronic LBP and those with a recent history of LBP, the&#xD;
      investigators expect differences in spinal loads between patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants deemed eligible will complete one data collection session during which they will&#xD;
      first be instrumented with sensors to enable measurement of kinematics and muscle activity,&#xD;
      similar to procedures the investigators used in earlier studies. Specifically, wireless&#xD;
      inertial measurement units (Xsens MTW, Xsens Technologies, Enschede, Netherlands) will be&#xD;
      used to measure rotations of the thorax and pelvis, and surface EMG electrodes will be used&#xD;
      to measure the activity of erector spinae, rectus abdominis, internal and external obliques.&#xD;
      Participants will then be asked to stand on a force plate and perform a forward bending and&#xD;
      backward return test. Participants will be instructed to bend from an upright standing&#xD;
      posture to their maximum comfortable forward bending posture and then return to the upright&#xD;
      posture at a self-selected pace. Participants will then be instructed to perform the&#xD;
      following activities of daily life at a self-selected pace: walking on level and sloped&#xD;
      surfaces, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions, and lowering and lifting a 10 lb load to&#xD;
      their knee height. These activities have been selected because they represent basic but&#xD;
      repetitive activities of daily life, and the investigators have successfully used them in&#xD;
      earlier investigation of spinal loads among asymptomatic non-Veterans, as well as persons&#xD;
      with unilateral lower limb amputation. Finally, sudden perturbation followed by&#xD;
      stress-relaxation tests will be conducted as in earlier studies and as explained below. Each&#xD;
      of the above tests will take less than 5 minutes, and the investigators will provide break&#xD;
      periods between each set of tests to minimize fatigue and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for future projects, the investigators will also administer the following&#xD;
      questionnaires that are relevant to LBP experience during the data collection session: 1)&#xD;
      comprehensive health status using the PROMIS-29 questionnaire (all participants), 2) survey&#xD;
      of habitual physical activity (all participants), 3) the short version of Copenhagen&#xD;
      Psychosocial questionnaire concerning work and non-work-related factors (all participants),&#xD;
      4) the minimum data set recommended by the NIH task force on research standards for chronic&#xD;
      LBP (only Veterans with LBP), 5) pain intensity using a numerical rating scale (only Veterans&#xD;
      with LBP), 6) LBP-related disability using the 24-item Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire&#xD;
      (only Veterans with LBP), 7) the fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (only Veterans with&#xD;
      LBP). Total time for the entire data collection session, including the instrumentation time,&#xD;
      is estimated to be less than 3 hours.&#xD;
