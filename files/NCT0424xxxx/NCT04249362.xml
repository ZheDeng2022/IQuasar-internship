      This is a Phase II open-label, single-arm, multicenter, international study to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical activity of durvalumab in patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC who are deemed&#xD;
      to be ineligible for chemotherapy per Investigator assessment. Patients will be enrolled into&#xD;
      2 cohorts according to radiotherapy pretreatment dose (Cohort A: standard radiation therapy&#xD;
      [60 gray (Gy) ± 10% or hypofractionated bioequivalent dose (BED)]; Cohort B: palliative&#xD;
      radiation therapy [40 to &lt; 54 Gy or hypofractionated BED]).&#xD;

      This is a Phase II open-label, single-arm, multicenter, international study to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical activity of durvalumab in patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC who have an&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 2 and who were treated with radiotherapy&#xD;
      but are ineligible for chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to&#xD;
      the dose of radiotherapy received prior to study entry (Cohort A: Standard Radiotherapy [60&#xD;
      Gy ± 10% or hypofractionated BED]; Cohort B: Palliative Radiotherapy [40 to &lt; 54 Gy or&#xD;
      hypofractionated BED]). Patients must not have progressed following radiation therapy, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy must be completed within 6 weeks (42 days) prior to first study drug&#xD;
      administration. The last dose of radiation therapy is defined as the day of the last&#xD;
      radiation treatment session. All patients will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion&#xD;
      every 4 weeks (q4w) for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13 doses/cycles)&#xD;
