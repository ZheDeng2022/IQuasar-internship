  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complementary and alternative therapies for weight loss treatment may be effective. There are&#xD;
      few studies showing promise of the use of hypnosis in weight-reduction programs; however,&#xD;
      there are lots of bias and more rigorous rials are needed to establish the relationship&#xD;
      between hypnosis and weight management. Furthermore, the effect of hypnosis may not be&#xD;
      directly related to weight loss but rather on behavioral change. On the basis of the trans&#xD;
      theoretical model of change, we hypothesized that audio taped hypnosis would facilitate&#xD;
      greater movement through the stages of change toward weight loss as compared to general&#xD;
      advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to assess the ability of audio taped hypnosis to&#xD;
      promote weight loss through its effect on the stages and the processes of change as defined&#xD;
      by the Trans theoretical Model of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: American University of Beirut Medical Center.&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS: Adults with overweight and obesity will be recruited if they had previous&#xD;
      attempt to lose weight, are planning to lose weight within the next 6 months or are not&#xD;
      satisfied with the results of their current weight loss plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS: This research will be triple blinded randomized placebo controlled trial. The&#xD;
      intervention group will be listening to a hypnotic audio-file on a USB and the control group&#xD;
      will be listening to a placebo audio-file on a USB . The hypnotic audio-file will consist of&#xD;
      a 20 minutes recording prepared by an experienced hypnotist and the control audio-file will&#xD;
      consist of a 20 minutes recording with direct messages targeting lifestyle modification.&#xD;
      Follow up visits will take place at 21 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months following the&#xD;
      intervention to assess for any change in participant's readiness to lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome will be the difference between the groups in&#xD;
      acquiring at least one stage change (upward) as defined by the S-weight from baseline to 3&#xD;
      weeks, 6 months and 12 months post intervention. The secondary outcomes include difference in&#xD;
      the mean score of any item of the processes of change between hypnosis audio-file and control&#xD;
      audio-file, weight in kg at 3 weeks, 6 and 12 months as compared to baseline weight, decrease&#xD;
      in waist circumference in cm as compared to baseline at 6 and 12 months between the hypnosis&#xD;
      and control groups, exploring factors that may affect any of the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes such as gender, age, educational status, baseline BMI, PHQ2.&#xD;
