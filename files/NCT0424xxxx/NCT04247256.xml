      This study evaluates the combination of SCO-101 to FOLFIRI for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients who have developed resistance to FOLFIRI treatment. The study is&#xD;
      divided in two parts, where the first part evaluates the safety and toxicity of increasing&#xD;
      doses of SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI at the same dose as the patient has previously&#xD;
      developed resistance to. The second part of the study evaluates the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination of FOLFIRI and SCO-101 at the dose level established in the first part.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, dose escalation, Phase 2 study of SCO-101 in combination&#xD;
      with FOLFIRI in up to 50 mCRC patients. All patients included have previously had effect from&#xD;
      treatment with FOLFIRI, but have now progressed (i.e. treatment failure due to acquired&#xD;
      resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFIRI is a key anti-cancer chemotherapeutic combination in the treatment of several solid&#xD;
      tumor cancers, e.g. colorectal cancer. Cancer resistance to FOLFIRI exposure is a well known&#xD;
      phenomenon and can often be attributed to upregulation of cellular efflux pumps, e.g.&#xD;
      ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)G2 and ABCB1, involved in the efflux of the chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      from the cancer cells and resulting in treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCO-101 is an inhibitor of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) efflux pumps and SRPK1 kinase which is&#xD;
      responsible for phosphorylation of splicing factors, a key element involved in tumour growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of SCO-101 with FOLFIRI is expected to inhibit the active efflux of&#xD;
      chemotherapy molecules from the cancer cell thereby re-sensitizing it to the chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, open label, dose escalation, Phase 2 study of SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI in up to 50 mCRC patients.&#xD;
Cohorts of FOLFIRI-resistant mCRC patients will be treated with SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI . Patients to be enrolled should previously have had either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (&gt;16 weeks) on FOLFIRI.&#xD;
The study is separated in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation part with a standard 3+3 design, designed to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of SCO-101 and FOLFIRI, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A maximum of 5 cohorts have been planned. Starting dose of SCO-101 is 150 mg (cohort 1) and maximum dose is 350 mg (cohort 5).&#xD;
Part 2 is the efficacy part, where patients are treated with the MTD dose identified in the first part and evaluated for efficacy and safety of the combination SCO-101 plus FOLFIRI.</intervention_model_description>
