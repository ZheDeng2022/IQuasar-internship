  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Circle of Security-Parenting is a parental support program that provides basic&#xD;
      knowledge about the emotional needs of children up to 6 years old and is illustrated&#xD;
      graphically based on a circle model. It is designed to be given in group and includes 8&#xD;
      sessions of 90 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COS-P is regularly offered as a parent support intervention within the Psychology units for&#xD;
      Maternal and Child health care in Södra Älvsborg and Fyrbodal with the aim of increasing the&#xD;
      quality of the parent-child relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Prior to a planned RCT study, clarify which inclusion criterias are used for the&#xD;
      COS-P intervention within the two psychology units, which parents accept and complete the&#xD;
      study and investigate change in self-assessed depression, anxiety and stress level in the&#xD;
      parent, the parent's reflective ability and symptoms in the child estimated by the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The parents who participate in the planned COS-P groups within the two units in&#xD;
      spring/autumn of 2020 will fill in surveys before group start, at the end of intervention and&#xD;
      6-months follow up. Change between baseline and posttest as well as between baseline and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychologists will fill in specially formulated questionnaires regarding their inclusion&#xD;
      criterias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result: This pilot study is expected to describe the group of parents receiving&#xD;
      COS-P and the inclusion criterias for the intervention used by the psychologists in the&#xD;
      Psychology units for Maternal and Child health care in Södra Älvsborg and Fyrbodal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P) is a manual-based, psychoeducational&#xD;
      parental support program that includes 8 group sessions of 90 minutes each. It provides basic&#xD;
      knowledge about the emotional needs of children up to 6 years old and how parents can meet&#xD;
      those needs to promote secure attachment in their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COS-P is a parental support groupintervention that is regularly given in the Psychology units&#xD;
      for Maternal and Child health care in Södra Älvsborg and Fyrbodal and has become an&#xD;
      appreciated intervention by both the participants and the psychologists who lead the groups.&#xD;
      The method is also increasingly used both in Sweden and internationally but the systematic&#xD;
      evaluation of COS-P is at the same time very limited. It is also unclear what the inclusion&#xD;
      criterias and outcome measures are for COS-P in the Psychology unit for Maternal and Child&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of this pilot study is to provide knowledge of the inclusion criterias&#xD;
      and outcome measures for COS-P within the Psychological units for Maternal and Child health&#xD;
      care in Södra Älvsborg and Fyrbodal before more research subjects and activities are included&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled study. The study also aims to examine change in the participating&#xD;
      parents between baseline and posttest as well as the 6-month follow-up regarding&#xD;
      self-assessed depression, anxiety and stress level, the parent's reflective ability and&#xD;
      symptoms in the child estimated by the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will describe whether there is a relationship between demographic&#xD;
      data and self-assessed depression, anxiety, stress level, the parent's reflective ability and&#xD;
      symptoms of the child estimated by the parent at baseline and posttest and at baseline and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The parents who are assessed suitable for COS-P and accept to participate in the&#xD;
      pilot study during spring/autumn 2020 will fill in surveys before group start, after&#xD;
      completion and at the 6-month follow-up. In total, 50 parents will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychologists will fill in specially formulated questionnaires regarding their inclusion&#xD;
      criterias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result: This pilot study is expected to describe the group of parents receiving&#xD;
      COS-P and the inclusion criterias for the intervention used by the psychologists in the&#xD;
      Psychology units for Maternal and Child health care in Södra Älvsborg and Fyrbodal.&#xD;
