  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this planned research is to more fully test the efficacy of a very brief,&#xD;
      inexpensive, single-session, and web-delivered personalized normative feedback (PNF)&#xD;
      intervention evaluated in a successful pilot R34 study to prevent alcohol misuse and&#xD;
      associated negative consequences, as well as increase behavioral health treatment seeking&#xD;
      behaviors among a difficult to reach and treatment resistant veteran population. The&#xD;
      investigators expand on successful pilot work by (1) building a large publicly available&#xD;
      database of young veteran drinking and treatment seeking norms, (2) focusing on reaching&#xD;
      veterans who have recently separated from the military and drink heavily but who have not&#xD;
      recently sought any behavioral health treatment, (3) evaluating how an enhanced intervention&#xD;
      offering PNF content specifically related to treatment seeking affects preparatory behaviors&#xD;
      and actual treatment initiation, and (4) testing hypothesized mediators and moderators of&#xD;
      intervention drinking and treatment initiation outcomes relevant for this population. In Aim&#xD;
      1, the investigators will add to a large database of drinking norms for the population by&#xD;
      collecting drinking and treatment seeking information from veterans underrepresented in the&#xD;
      pilot, such as female veterans (total sample N = 2,500). In Aim 2, investigators then use&#xD;
      these norms in a randomized controlled trial of the PNF intervention designed to reach heavy&#xD;
      drinking young veterans who are not currently receiving behavioral health care (N = 800) and&#xD;
      test if additional feedback about treatment seeking can help promote treatment initiation&#xD;
      among this treatment resistant group. Outcomes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months are compared for&#xD;
      participants receiving an enhanced PNF condition (N = 400) to an attention-only control&#xD;
      condition (N = 400). In Aim 3, the investigators test mediators of intervention efficacy on&#xD;
      drinking outcomes (i.e., changes in perceived norms, increases in treatment initiation) and&#xD;
      explore moderators of outcomes to determine if the brief intervention works better for&#xD;
      veteran participants based on age, gender, reasons for drinking (social versus coping),&#xD;
      perceived stigma, posttraumatic stress disorder disorder and depression symptoms, and&#xD;
      solitary drinking.&#xD;

    <description>Control participants will receive content similar in length but different in content from the PNF (i.e., non-drinking focused). These participants will receive information based on their actual and perceived behavior of playing video games, a strategy used in prior PNF work to balance attention to non-targeted behaviors.</description>

    <intervention_name>Personalized Normative Feedback</intervention_name>
    <description>The personalized normative feedback (PNF) focuses on behavioral norms, where participants see (1) how their perceptions compare to other same-gender veterans' actual drinking and (2) how their actual drinking compares to other same-gender veterans' actual drinking. The format of the intervention highlights typical days per week, drinks per occasion, and binge drinking as per traditional PNF interventions. PNF will also contain a video description of theories of normative influence (e.g., how individuals are affected by perceptions) and a description of the normative data sample. Participants also see enhanced PNF content that will focus on sharing with participants treatment information that the investigators obtained from a pilot sample.</description>
