  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are proposing a 6-week mindfulness and resilience training intervention&#xD;
      tailored for caregivers of children with autism. Investigators will assess increases the&#xD;
      caregiver's well-being and levels of psychological acceptance of their life situation as it&#xD;
      relates to their child with autism. The mindfulness training focuses on self-regulation of&#xD;
      emotional responses and acceptance of internal experiences. Self-report measures and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews will be administered at baseline and post-intervention. Investigators&#xD;
      will compare the active group to a control group of caregivers who are on the waitlist to&#xD;
      receive the intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will prospectively examine a sample comprised of parental caregivers (ages 20&#xD;
      to 60) of children with autism spectrum disorder (ages 3 to 12) to determine how responses to&#xD;
      the chronic stress of caregiving may contribute to psychological distress (e.g depression,&#xD;
      caregiving burden, self-reported sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into the active group vs. wait list control group.&#xD;
      Investigators will assess indices of psychological health at 2 time points over 6 weeks&#xD;
      (length of intervention) - a Baseline Assessment, and a Follow-up Assessment. Both baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up assessments include the same battery of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily/nightly diaries will also be completed by participants in the 7 days leading up to the&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to self-report measures, investigators will conduct a 20-25 minute qualitative&#xD;
      interview with caregivers both pre and post-intervention. The interview is optional and will&#xD;
      be conducted via telephone before beginning the six-week course and within two weeks of&#xD;
      finishing the course. The interview will be used to assess caregiver's acceptance of their&#xD;
      child's condition and better understand their personal perception of their own acceptance.&#xD;
      Interviews questions will be open-ended and may be modified based on the caregiver's&#xD;
      response. An example question includes, &quot;How hard has it been to accept your child has ASD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be waitlisted and enrolled in the next 6-week mindfulness course.&#xD;
      Investigators expect the next mindfulness course for the waitlist control group to be held&#xD;
      within 1-3 months of the initial active group course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active group only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active group will participate in a mindfulness resilience training intervention. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of weekly 2 hour classes held at UCSF Parnassus Campus over the course&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. The study PI, Dr. Elissa Epel, will lead the intervention classes teaching the&#xD;
      fundamentals of mindfulness training. The training focuses on acceptance and awareness of the&#xD;
      present moment.&#xD;
