  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite availability of several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in one-third of patients,&#xD;
      epilepsy remains uncontrolled with AEDs. There is a need to develop new approaches to improve&#xD;
      the existing medications to relieve patients' epilepsy, and OPC-214870 is being studied for&#xD;
      this purpose.&#xD;
