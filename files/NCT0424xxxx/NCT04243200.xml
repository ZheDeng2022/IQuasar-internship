  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness the &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; intervention on people&#xD;
      with diabetes experiencing hypoglycaemia (or &quot;hypo&quot;, meaning low blood sugar). The&#xD;
      intervention should help prevent recurrence of &quot;hypos&quot;, improve patients' future health,&#xD;
      reduce calls to ambulance services and thus reduce NHS pressures and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia affects increasing numbers of people with diabetes. It is a side effect of&#xD;
      treatment with insulin or certain tablets, where blood glucose (sugar) falls causing the&#xD;
      brain to malfunction. In mild cases this can lead to sweating, drowsiness and confusion; in&#xD;
      more severe cases, coma can occur needing medical assistance for recovery, and if prolonged&#xD;
      can be fatal. It results in 1% of calls to ambulance services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; intervention involves ambulance staff providing treatment to&#xD;
      patients experiencing hypos and advising them to access follow-up care by their GP/specialist&#xD;
      diabetes team. This is backed up by giving patients a &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; information&#xD;
      booklet which they can read when they recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universities of Lincoln and Leicester are working with East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS&#xD;
      Trust and patient groups on this study. The &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; intervention has now&#xD;
      been implemented by ambulance services in Leicester, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire,&#xD;
      Derbyshire and Lincolnshire from October 2018-May 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyse data from the ambulance services before, during and after the&#xD;
      introduction of the 'Hypos can strike twice' intervention to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on repeat ambulance calls and attendances for hypoglycaemia and the costs and&#xD;
      consequences of implementing it. The investigators will also interview/survey ambulance staff&#xD;
      who provided the intervention and patients who received it, to understand how and why it&#xD;
      works (or does not) and how, if it works, it could be scaled up over a larger geographical&#xD;
      area. The duration of this study is 1 year.&#xD;

      Research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effect on repeat ambulance calls and attendances for hypoglycaemia and what are&#xD;
      the costs and consequences of implementing the 'Hypo's can strike twice' intervention to&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and hypoglycaemia attended by East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS&#xD;
      Trust in the East Midlands region of the UK?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe hypoglycaemia (defined as cognitive impairment severe enough to require external&#xD;
      assistance for recovery) frequently requires an ambulance resulting in Emergency Department&#xD;
      attendance or hospital admission. Severe hypoglycaemia constitutes around 1% of 1.7 million&#xD;
      emergency ambulance calls in England and Scotland resulting in 100 thousand paramedic&#xD;
      attendances and estimated costs in England of Â£13.6 million annually. Hypoglycaemia is&#xD;
      associated with adverse consequences including higher mortality, morbidity and health service&#xD;
      costs due to hospital attendance/admission. It is also frightening for both patients and&#xD;
      relatives and impairs quality of life and productivity, leading to poor long term control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the effect of implementing the 'Hypo's can strike twice' intervention to&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and hypoglycaemia attended by East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS&#xD;
      Trust in the East Midlands region. &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; is a complex intervention&#xD;
      involving ambulance staff providing treatment and advice to people who have had a&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic attack to access follow-up care by the GP or specialist diabetes team as&#xD;
      detailed in national ambulance (JRCALC) clinical guidelines supported by the provision of a&#xD;
      &quot;Hypos can strike twice&quot; booklet which the patient can read when they are fully recovered&#xD;
      from the cognitive and other effects of the hypoglycaemic episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of implementing the 'Hypo's can strike twice' on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repeat ambulance calls and attendances for hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recorded referrals to an appropriate healthcare professional (e.g. GP, nurse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Completed care bundle for hypoglycaemia (proportion of patients with all of blood&#xD;
           glucose recorded before treatment, blood glucose recorded after treatment and treatment&#xD;
           given for hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Costs of implementation 'Hypo's can strike twice' intervention vs costs of health&#xD;
           service resource use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To conduct a process evaluation to explore how 'Hypo's can strike twice' exerts its&#xD;
           effects and can be scaled up if effective by understanding implementation, mechanisms of&#xD;
           impact, and contextual factors using interviews and surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomised stepped wedge design with mixed-methods process evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>For our analyses of repeat ambulance calls and costs we will use routine anonymised data from routine call-and-dispatch and clinical records data from EMAS for 12 months before the intervention was first introduced (September 2017) to at least 6 months after the final step of the introduction in April 2019, i.e. October 2019. This is likely to involve the analysis of an estimated 11916 cases so that we can implement a stepped wedge (non-randomised control)design .</description>
