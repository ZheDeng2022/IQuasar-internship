    <textblock>
      This is a prospective research study which will include patients who have progressed on&#xD;
      immunotherapy as their most recent line of therapy. This study aims to characterize whether&#xD;
      patients who fail to respond to immunotherapy versus patients who respond initially but after&#xD;
      a period of time progress demonstrate different genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic,&#xD;
      immunophenotyping profiles. Patients will have a one-time fresh tumor biopsy. Serial blood&#xD;
      samples (total amount of blood drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 mL or 3 mL/kg in an 8&#xD;
      week period), archival tissue (if available) and one stool sample will be collected.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histological or cytological diagnosis of solid malignancies, with at&#xD;
             least one tumor lesion amenable to core needle biopsy and consent to such a procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressed on immunotherapy (defined as anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies&#xD;
             given as monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy) as their most recent line of&#xD;
             therapy. Patients will be classified into two groups: 1) those who benefitted from&#xD;
             immunotherapy with either complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or prolonged&#xD;
             stable disease (SD) defined as &gt; 6 months with subsequent progression (i.e. acquired&#xD;
             resistance), 2) those whose disease is primary refractory to immunotherapy with&#xD;
             disease progression on first on-treatment imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be of good performance status, ECOG 0-1, for subsequent anticancer&#xD;
             therapy, with either standard treatment or within the context of a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have provided voluntary written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that could interfere with a patient's ability to provide informed&#xD;
             consent such as dementia or severe cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication to undergoing venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with patient&#xD;
             safety, or evaluation of the collected specimens and interpretation of study results.&#xD;
