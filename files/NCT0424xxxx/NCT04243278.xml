  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who develop preeclampsia (PE) in pregnancy are at a greater risk for adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular health outcomes. PE is associated with vascular remodeling and functional&#xD;
      changes in the postpartum, reflective of its systemic effects during gestation. Aberrant&#xD;
      microvascular endothelial function has been demonstrated in pharmacological studies of&#xD;
      formerly preeclamptic women. However, clinicians do not have any recourse for modulating&#xD;
      vascular functional adaptations nor mitigating the future risk for maternal disease in the&#xD;
      early postpartum. Low-dose aspirin (LD-ASA) is commonly prescribed to prevent PE and confers&#xD;
      a consistently positive effect on mitigating PE risk when given in early gestation to women&#xD;
      at risk. While the precise effect of LD-ASA on PE development is not fully understood,&#xD;
      existing evidence suggests it may confer an array of anti-thrombotic, vasodilatory,&#xD;
      pro-endothelial effects that mitigate the risk of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of LD-ASA administration over 6&#xD;
      months in the early postpartum in women with prior severe PE. Women will be identified,&#xD;
      enrolled, and randomized to either treatment or placebo groups. Treatment groups will receive&#xD;
      81 mg daily oral aspirin, while control groups will receive an equivalent placebo pill.&#xD;
      Vascular functional assessment at study outset will take place, combining laser speckle&#xD;
      contrast imaging and iontophoresis of dilute vasoactive drug solutions. Blood and urine will&#xD;
      be obtained for analysis of cardiometabolic and endothelial factors. Participants will take&#xD;
      their assigned study drug for 6 months, after which a retest appointment will take place to&#xD;
      assess vascular functional changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, single-centre trial&#xD;
      with two parallel groups. The primary outcome will be endothelium-dependent vasodilation as&#xD;
      measured by iontophoresis and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited following a preeclamptic delivery at Kingston Health Sciences&#xD;
      Center. Following confirmation of eligibility, they will be randomized to treatment or&#xD;
      control groups. Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio. In total, 44 participants will be recruited and randomized, with 22 being assigned to&#xD;
      each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to discharge from the hospital, investigators will assess both vascular functional and&#xD;
      biochemical variables in each participant. Using LSCI, a non-invasive imaging modality,&#xD;
      investigators will continuously measure microvascular blood flow in the volar forearm in&#xD;
      response to dilute drug solutions administered using iontophoresis. Iontophoresis refers to&#xD;
      the non-invasive administration of drugs under the influence of an applied current.&#xD;
      Iontophoresis of acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and sodium&#xD;
      nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasodilator, will occur, the response to which will&#xD;
      be recorded using LSCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study outset, investigators will record additional biophysical parameters such as&#xD;
      blood pressure, weight, and BMI. Blood will be drawn and serum analysis of lipid profile,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, s-Flt-1, platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor, and uric acid will occur. Urine will be collected for analysis of albumin: creatinine&#xD;
      ratio. Findings will then be integrated to calculate a lifetime cardiovascular risk score,&#xD;
      which is used to categorize individuals as low risk or high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who are assigned to the oral aspirin arm of the study will receive 81 mg&#xD;
      oral aspirin. Over-encapsulated 81mg aspirin tablets will be used. Study participants in this&#xD;
      arm will take 81mg aspirin daily for 6 months. A standard placebo pill, the same size, shape,&#xD;
      and color of the oral aspirin will also be used. The placebo will be administered to the&#xD;
      participants randomized to the placebo group in the same manner the oral aspirin would be&#xD;
      administered - they will take the pill daily for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a monthly basis, all participants will be contacted by study personnel to confirm that&#xD;
      they have been taking their medication, and that there are no adverse effects to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to either LD-ASA or placebo, both groups will receive our center's current&#xD;
      standard of care of cardiovascular assessment and lifestyle counseling at the Maternal Health&#xD;
      Clinic (MHC) at Kingston Health Sciences Center. MHC appointments take place at 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum. At the MHC appointment, vascular reactivity testing will occur again, followed by&#xD;
      biochemical analyses, to assess vascular functional recovery due to the drug.&#xD;
