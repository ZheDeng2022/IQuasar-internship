  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased level of physical activity (PA) are of benefit in the management of cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      (CF). This randomised control tial will assess whether three-months use of an online platform&#xD;
      can help increase PA levels in people with CF (compared to a control group continuing routine&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that predominantly affects the lungs through an&#xD;
      accumulation of thick mucus. As there is no cure for CF, it is a disease that is managed&#xD;
      through intensive medication, nutrition, physiotherapy, exercise and physical activity (PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased levels of PA are of benefit to people with CF, and therefore interventions that&#xD;
      promote PA are warranted, particularly in adolescence, whereby PA levels decrease. Telehealth&#xD;
      interventions are of particular interest in CF, whereby strict cross-infection guidelines&#xD;
      prevent patients meeting in person, and allowing patients to overcome geographical barriers&#xD;
      at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown engagement with an online platform (www.activonline.com.au),&#xD;
      specifically designed to monitor PA in CF, is feasible and acceptable to people with CF.&#xD;
      Therefore, a full randomised control trial is warranted to assess the efficacy of this&#xD;
      intervention in changing PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE JUNE 2021: Due to ongoing restrictions placed upon research by the global COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, modifications to the protocol are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consenting will now take place online, and testing procedures will be&#xD;
      completed by participants in their own homes. The nature, and length of, intervention remains&#xD;
      unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes to protocol approved by ethics board on May 4th 2021.&#xD;
