      To determine the efficacy of using MRI/US fusion imaging technology to direct focal ablation&#xD;
      of prostate tissue using nanoparticle-directed laser irradiation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-dose study of AuroLase Therapy in the focal&#xD;
      ablation of prostate tissue via nanoparticle directed irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population consists of men with low to intermediate risk localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer with MRI visible and confirmed focal areas of prostate cancer using MR US Fusion&#xD;
      Guided Biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is one arm/group to this study: Up to sixty (60) patients will receive a single&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of AuroShell particles 12 to 36 hours prior to MRI/US guided laser&#xD;
      irradiation using an FDA cleared laser and an interstitial optical fiber diffuser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and acute volume of ablation will be assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI 48 - 96 hours&#xD;
      after laser illumination to allow time for the appearance of coagulative necrosis and prior&#xD;
      to reconfiguration of tissue by lytic action. An appearance of a 'void' (e.g., lack of&#xD;
      contrast in ablation zone) on MRI would be more generally expected than lesion shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of focal ablation of prostate tissue will be assessed by MRI /Ultrasound guided&#xD;
      target biopsy 6 months after laser treatment and at 1 year via MRI /Ultrasound guided target&#xD;
      biopsy in combination with standard systematic biopsy. Per standard of care, patient follow&#xD;
      up will continue beyond the one year study visit but will be outside the scope of the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be consented for up to 5 years in order to track their disease status and&#xD;
      progression or recurrence if any.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documented histological or cytological evidence of tumor(s) of the&#xD;
             prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥ 45 years of age&#xD;
