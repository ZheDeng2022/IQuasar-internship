    <textblock>
      This is a trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of a 10^6&#xD;
      cfu dose of an oral live-attenuated S. sonnei vaccine candidate, WRSs2, in up to 120 healthy&#xD;
      males and non-pregnant females aged 18-49, inclusive. This is a two-phase study, an&#xD;
      outpatient WRSs2 vaccination phase and an inpatient S. sonnei 53G challenge phase. There are&#xD;
      three groups in each phase. Outpatient WRSs2 phase: Group 1 will receive two doses of WRSs2&#xD;
      vaccine; Group 2 will receive one dose of the placebo and one dose of WRSs2 vaccine; Group 3&#xD;
      will receive two doses of the placebo. All three groups in an inpatient S. sonnei 53G&#xD;
      challenge phase will receive one dose of S. sonnei 53G challenge. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      in up to 3 Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU) sites. The study duration is&#xD;
      approximately 24 months with subject participation duration approximately 8 months. The&#xD;
      Primary Objective of this study is to estimate vaccine efficacy of 1 and 2 doses of WRSs2 in&#xD;
      preventing shigellosis, following challenge with S. sonnei strain 53G.&#xD;

      Secondary Objectives are to:1) Evaluate the safety of 1 and 2 doses of WRSs2; 2) Evaluate&#xD;
      immune responses following vaccination (immunogenicity) with 1 and 2 doses of WRSs2 and after&#xD;
      challenge with S. sonnei strain 53G by serum anti-LPS and anti-Invaplex IgG and IgA by ELISA;&#xD;
      3) Determine fecal shedding of S. sonnei after WRSs2 vaccination and 53G challenge by&#xD;
      qualitative stool culture.&#xD;
