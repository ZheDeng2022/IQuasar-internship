  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the CHU Brugmann hospital, a multidisciplinary Renal Lithiasis and Mineral Metabolism&#xD;
      clinic has been inaugurated in 2017. During the first months of 2018, the activities of the&#xD;
      clinic have been focalized on the pre-analytical and analytical aspects of metabolic work-up.&#xD;
      15 patients are followed on average per week. The clinic is recognized as one of the 24 core&#xD;
      centers of the European Nephrolithiasis Network and it is the only clinic included in this&#xD;
      network in Belgium. The actual practice of the clinic has been published in a survey&#xD;
      regarding current practice patterns of stone centers across Europe. Following this&#xD;
      publication, the members of the board of the European Nephrolithiasis Network have put as&#xD;
      common effort to standardize the care of kidney stone formers and obtained endorsement to&#xD;
      perform a second survey in each core center. The aim of this initiative is to share&#xD;
      information from real patients in aggregate form. Each core center practice will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the second survey by an analysis of the robustness of clinical, biological, urological and&#xD;
      radiological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this project consists in the constitution of a clinical, biological,&#xD;
      urological and radiological database of followed patients. This database could be shared in&#xD;
      aggregate form by using a specialized coding system for the patients. The database will&#xD;
      enable the investigators to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  describe the epidemiological and clinico-biological characteristics of the CHU Brugmann&#xD;
           patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gather information about the kidney function outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analyze and classify identified prolithogenics factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characterize related metabolic disorders (diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
           arterial hypertension, chronic kidney diseases, osteoporosis...)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the patients that could participate in the international trials on kidney stone&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify the patients that will need a specialized genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the impact of the clinic activity and metabolic work-up on the rate of&#xD;
           recurrence of kidney stones in the patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained data will be compared with the global data from the European Nephrolithiasis&#xD;
      Network.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 10% of population suffer from kidney stone disease. Recent review reported that kidney&#xD;
      stones represent an underestimated risk factor for further kidney function deterioration,&#xD;
      arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. They are furthermore a significant&#xD;
      predictor of osteoporotic fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evidence needs to be very seriously considered in children and adolescent suffering from&#xD;
      this disorder. The epidemiological registry data show an alarming, continous increase in the&#xD;
      incidence of kidney stones in adults (both sexes) and intriguingly in children. During the&#xD;
      last 25 years the incidence of nephrolithiasis in children has increased by approximately 6%&#xD;
      to 10% annually and is now 50 per 100 000 adolescents. Stone incidence in children undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal imaging more than doubled between 2011 and 2016. Moreover, the changes in stone&#xD;
      compositions have been identified and remain relevant pathophysiological aspects in the&#xD;
      epidemiology of kidney stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute nephritic colic access reflects only the end-point of mineral metabolism abnormalities&#xD;
      - the kidney stone disease is considered as a chronic, systemic mineral metabolism disorder.&#xD;
      The process of kidney stones formation - lithogenesis- is a consequence of imbalance between&#xD;
      the promotors and inhibitors in the urine. The patients with kidney stone disease require a&#xD;
      complete metabolic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three main areas leading to stone formation are metabolism, diet and lifestyle. The main&#xD;
      causes of kidney stones are most frequently related to an increase in salt and sugar intake,&#xD;
      insufficient water intake and increased incidence of obesity. All this together leads to the&#xD;
      supersaturation of several biochemical components excreted physiologically in the urine,&#xD;
      resulting in fine in their crystallization, a first step in stone formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic work-up is recommended by the American Urology Association to identify and correct&#xD;
      the factors responsible for urinary stone formation such as hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria,&#xD;
      hypocitraturia or abnormalities of urinary pH. The metabolic work-up includes the collection&#xD;
      of urine during 24h. This is the most useful test, giving information about the patient's&#xD;
      average chemical risk of stone formation and it is the nearest available body fluid to the&#xD;
      actual formation and growth of the stone itself. Metabolism is dealt with through a&#xD;
      concurrent blood and spot urine test. Diet is handled through a variable method of diary&#xD;
      recorded by the patient on his free, home diet. Lifestyle is handled with through a standard&#xD;
      questionnaire given by the physician.&#xD;
