      Multicenter, open-label, phase II safety and efficacy study of all-oral combination of&#xD;
      narlaprevir/ritonavir and sofosbuvir in Treatment-naïve Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C&#xD;
      Genotype 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two patient cohorts are anticipated in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort A: 60 treatment-naive patients will be enrolled into&#xD;
           narlaprevir/ritonavir/sofosbuvir treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort B: (exploratory): 25 treatment-naive patients with low viral load (HCV&#xD;
           RNA&lt;1000000 IU/L) will be enrolled into narlaprevir/ritonavir/sofosbuvir treatment for 8&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment of 25 treatment-naïve patients with low viral load into 8 week cohort will&#xD;
      start after completion of enrollment of 60 treatment-naive patients into 12 week cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 3 time periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period with duration up to 2 weeks during which study eligibility will be&#xD;
           confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Active treatment period (for 12 or 8 weeks): patients in the Cohort A will receive study&#xD;
           therapy with narlaprevir/ritonavir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, in the Cohort B - during 8&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a patient has virologic breakthrough while receiving therapy, discontinuation of&#xD;
           antiviral treatment is advised with appropriate clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up period during which patients do not receive any study medication. The duration&#xD;
           of the follow-up period after the end of study treatment will be 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, each patient will participate in the study for approximately up to 38 weeks from the&#xD;
      time the patient signs the Informed Consent Form through the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is a screening failure, but is rescreened and subsequently enrolled, the reason&#xD;
      for the original screening failure must be documented in the source documents. A new subject&#xD;
      Identification number (ID) will be assigned to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period in this study is planned to be up to 6 months. The total period of the&#xD;
      study is anticipated to be approximately 1 year 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is considered to be completed the study upon the completion of the last protocol&#xD;
      specified visit. For those patients who do not complete the study, patient participation will&#xD;
      be considered terminated upon the completion of the last visit or contact (e.g., phone&#xD;
      contact with the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 85 patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited from&#xD;
      approximately 6 clinical sites in Russia&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Not pregnant or nursing;&#xD;

                  women &gt;50 years of age with cessation [for ≥ 12 months ] of previously occurring&#xD;

                       investigational drugs. Women of childbearing potential must not rely on&#xD;
                       hormone-containing contraceptives as a form of birth control during the&#xD;
                       study. Female subjects using a hormone-containing contraceptive prior to&#xD;
                       screening must stop their contraceptive regimen use from the date of&#xD;
                       screening until 6 months after their last dose of investigational drugs.&#xD;
