  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a fundamental gap between the discovery of proven-effective intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) sedation, mechanical ventilation, mobility, and symptom management strategies and&#xD;
      approaches that can equip ICU providers with the skills necessary to reliably adopt these&#xD;
      interventions in everyday practice. Until this gap is filled, the millions of patients with&#xD;
      heart, lung, and blood disorders admitted to ICUs annually will remain at risk for avoidable&#xD;
      physical, mental, and cognitive health impairments that may persist for months to years after&#xD;
      hospital discharge. In the proposed study, the investigative team will continue their&#xD;
      partnership with the Society of Critical Care Medicine's (SCCM's) ICU Liberation&#xD;
      Collaborative. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the overall&#xD;
      objective of the Determinants of Implementation Success Coordinating Ventilator, Early&#xD;
      Ambulation and Rehabilitation Efforts in the ICU (DISCOVER-ICU) study is to develop&#xD;
      multilevel implementation strategies to enhance sustainable adoption of the ABCDEF (Assess,&#xD;
      prevent, and manage pain and delirium, both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials,&#xD;
      choice of sedation, early mobility, family engagement) bundle in routine ICU practice. Using&#xD;
      a multiphase, sequential, mixed-methods design, this study has three specific aims: 1)&#xD;
      estimate the effects of patient-level characteristics on ABCDEF bundle adoption; 2) examine&#xD;
      unit-level variation in ABCDEF bundle adoption and associated provider- and&#xD;
      organization-level characteristics; and 3) determine which implementation strategies result&#xD;
      in the greatest adoption of the ABCDEF bundle. Existing deidentified data will be obtained&#xD;
      from &gt;15,000 patients, &gt;5,000 interprofessional ICU team members, and 68 hospitals&#xD;
      participating in the ICU Liberation Collaborative to achieve specific aims 1 and 2. For&#xD;
      specific aim 3, data collection will be extended using interprofessional ICU team surveys, a&#xD;
      modified Delphi process, and concept mapping to achieve greater understanding of&#xD;
      implementation strategies that prove most effective for ABCDEF bundle adoption. Results of&#xD;
      this work will directly lead to the development of implementation strategies that are&#xD;
      adaptable, responsive to community needs, and account for the cultural and organizational&#xD;
      factors necessary to increase ABCDEF bundle adoption. These implementation strategies will&#xD;
      then be tested in a future cluster randomized hybrid II implementation effectiveness trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart, lung, and blood disorders severe enough to require an intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) stay frequently experience profound physical, mental, and cognitive health&#xD;
      impairments that may persist for months to years after hospital discharge. These long-term&#xD;
      impairments are commonly acquired in the ICU and are often initiated or exacerbated by&#xD;
      sedation, mechanical ventilation, and symptom management decisions. Indeed, ICU-acquired&#xD;
      pain, anxiety, delirium, and weakness are associated with numerous adverse health outcomes&#xD;
      including prolonged mechanical ventilation, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,&#xD;
      functional decline, new institutionalization, and severe neurocognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Considering millions of adults face the challenges of ICU survivorship annually, it is&#xD;
      essential findings from high-quality research are reliably adopted and sustained in everyday&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As outlined in &quot;Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Pain, Agitation, and&#xD;
      Delirium (PAD) in Adult Patients in the ICU,&quot; a robust and growing body of evidence&#xD;
      demonstrates clinical outcomes are improved when integrated, interprofessional approaches to&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and symptom management are applied during the course of critical&#xD;
      illness. One such approach is the ABCDEF bundle, an evidence-based, multicomponent strategy&#xD;
      that incorporates many PAD guideline recommendations. While previously shown safe and&#xD;
      effective when applied in routine ICU practice, the investigators preliminary data&#xD;
      demonstrate that this bundle has yet to be widely adopted. Pain and delirium remain&#xD;
      underdiagnosed, and ICU clinicians often fail to maintain patients at a light level of&#xD;
      sedation, use a protocolized mechanical ventilation discontinuation approach, get patients&#xD;
      out of bed, or accept flexible bedside family presence. There is, therefore, a clear need for&#xD;
      studies that use validated implementation frameworks and outcomes to assess strategies for&#xD;
      improving ABCDEF bundle adoption and the removal of long-held and potentially harmful ICU&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, the investigators will continue their three-year partnership with the&#xD;
      Society of Critical Care Medicine's ICU Liberation Collaborative, a national quality&#xD;
      improvement (QI) network comprised of 68 ICUs. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for&#xD;
      Implementation Research, the overall objective of this T4 research is to develop multilevel&#xD;
      implementation strategies to enhance sustainable adoption of the ABCDEF bundle in routine ICU&#xD;
      practice. The investigators are particularly interested in discovering how various patient-,&#xD;
      provider-, and organization-level characteristics and implementation strategies effect ABCDEF&#xD;
      bundle adoption. Using a multiphase, sequential, mixed-methods design the &quot;Determinants of&#xD;
      Implementation Success Coordinating Ventilator, Early Ambulation and Rehabilitation Efforts&#xD;
      in the ICU (DISCOVER-ICU)&quot; study has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Estimate the effects of patient-level characteristics on ABCDEF bundle adoption.&#xD;
      Patient-level characteristics are defined as non-modifiable factors exhibited by critically&#xD;
      ill adults at ICU admission that may influence ABCDEF bundle adoption. Existing data on â‰¥&#xD;
      15,000 critically ill adults who spent at least one full day in a participating ICU&#xD;
      Liberation Collaborative unit will be used to estimate the effects of: (1) demographics, (2)&#xD;
      body mass index, (3) admitting diagnosis, (4) severity of illness, and (5) preadmission&#xD;
      residence/mobility status on ABCDEF bundle adoption. The hypothesis is that the ABCDEF bundle&#xD;
      will less likely be adopted into the care of particularly vulnerable populations (e.g., older&#xD;
      adults, obese, non-English speaking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine unit-level variation in ABCDEF bundle adoption and associated provider- and&#xD;
      organization-level characteristics. Existing data will be obtained from surveys of over 5,000&#xD;
      interprofessional ICU team members and 68 hospitals participating in the ICU Liberation&#xD;
      Collaborative. Provider-level characteristics are defined as ICU clinicians': (1) ABCDEF&#xD;
      bundle-related knowledge and attitudes, (2) self-efficacy, and (3) perceptions of work&#xD;
      environment (both overall health and degree of teamwork/collaboration). Organization-level&#xD;
      characteristics are defined as those related to: (1) administrative structure, (2) staffing&#xD;
      patterns, (3) ICU team composition, and (4) prior QI experience. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      ABCDEF bundle adoption will be greater in ICUs where providers value and are more familiar&#xD;
      with the principles of the bundle, display higher levels of self-efficacy, and report more&#xD;
      positive teamwork. Secondly, there will be better bundle adoption in organizations with&#xD;
      greater absorptive capacity for change, more resources, and who use interprofessional ICU&#xD;
      team models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine which implementation strategies result in the greatest adoption of the&#xD;
      ABCDEF bundle. Data collection will be extended by using interprofessional ICU team surveys,&#xD;
      a modified Delphi process, and concept mapping to achieve greater understanding of&#xD;
      implementation strategies that prove most effective for ABCDEF bundle adoption. The focus on&#xD;
      high- and low-ABCDEF bundle-performing units will allow the investigative team to select and&#xD;
      tailor potential ABCDEF bundle implementation strategies to meet specific local contextual&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With expertise in dissemination and implementation science, biostatistics, critical care, and&#xD;
      QI, the interdisciplinary team investigative is ideally prepared to lead this three-year&#xD;
      study. The results will directly lead to the development of implementation strategies that&#xD;
      are adaptable, responsive to community needs, and account for the cultural and organizational&#xD;
      factors necessary to increase ABCDEF bundle adoption. These implementation strategies will&#xD;
      then be tested in a future cluster randomized hybrid II implementation-effectiveness trial.&#xD;
