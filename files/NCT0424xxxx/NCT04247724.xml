      Fitness and health effects of 12 weeks of recreational team handball in untrained adult men&#xD;
      and women aged 20-30 years&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult men and women aged 20-30 years will be recruited to take part in a 12-week intervention&#xD;
      with recreational team handball. Half of the participants are men (n=32), who are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to a group playing recreational team handball (n=16) and an inactive control group&#xD;
      (n=16). The women (n=40) are also divided and assigned to a group with regular participation&#xD;
      in recreational team handball (n=20) and an inactive control group (n=20). The training&#xD;
      sessions will be offered 2-3 times weekly for 70 minutes per session by a supervised trainer.&#xD;
      The sessions involves an injury preventive warm-up and ball exercises for 15 minutes followed&#xD;
      by recreational handball on small pitches such as 4 vs 4. A comprehensive testing protocol is&#xD;
      conducted before and after the training period. The measurements includes body composition&#xD;
      and bone mineralization, blood pressure, resting heart rate, fasting blood sugar, insulin,&#xD;
      cholesterol and bone markers. In addition, a number of physical tests which involves fitness&#xD;
      level (VO2max), intermittent work, muscle strength and balance will further be conducted. The&#xD;
      testing takes place at the University of Copenhagen. The training sessions will also take&#xD;
      place at the University of Copenhagen or in a handball club near the University. The study&#xD;
      will be approved by the local ethical committee of Copenhagen.&#xD;
