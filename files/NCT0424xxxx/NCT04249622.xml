    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rifaximin works for the treatment of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      toxicities related to pertuzumab-based therapy in patients with stage I-III HER2 positive&#xD;
      breast cancer. Rifaximin may reduce the incidence and severity of pertuzumab induced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities without interrupting or delaying the chemotherapy schedule.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the reduction rate of grade &gt;= 2 abdominal toxicities, including abdominal&#xD;
      distension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomach pain, and typhlitis according to the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0)&#xD;
      with the use of rifaximin in stage II-III HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      pertuzumab induced gastrointestinal toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate dose reductions, dose delays and discontinuation of treatment with pertuzumab due&#xD;
      to gastrointestinal side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate and measure the change in the Bristol stool scale before and after rifaximin&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate and measure the change in the 4-point Likert scale patient questionnaire before&#xD;
      and after rifaximin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate changes in the fecal microbiome, hydrogen breath test, and permeability test&#xD;
      before and after rifaximin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate changes in the fecal microbiome, hydrogen breath test, and permeability test&#xD;
      before and after pertuzumab-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the difference in the fecal microbiome, hydrogen breath test, and permeability&#xD;
      test among patients with or without pertuzumab induced gastrointestinal toxicities (PIGT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (GRADE &gt;= 2 PIGT): Patients that experience PIGT after receiving first standard of care&#xD;
      cycle of pertuzumab-based chemotherapy receive rifaximin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and standard of care pertuzumab-based chemotherapy on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (GRADE =&lt; 1 PIGT): Patients that do not experience PIGT after receiving first standard&#xD;
      of care cycle of pertuzumab-based chemotherapy continue receiving standard of care&#xD;
      pertuzumab-based chemotherapy on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 5 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
