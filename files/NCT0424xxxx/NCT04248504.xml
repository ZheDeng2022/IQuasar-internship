      The DGA provides an end-to-end digital solution to the preconception carrier screening&#xD;
      process from participant registration to receipt of the test results and their&#xD;
      interpretations. These steps are provided using personalized animated videos.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment: The participant enrolls in the system prior to the visit and enters personal&#xD;
      information into the DGA system. This step is estimated to takes approximately ten minutes&#xD;
      and is expected to save valuable time should participants be required to come for a genetic&#xD;
      counseling session. The medical questionnaire will self-adjust to address the clinical&#xD;
      scenario related to each participant. This component will allow the attending physician to&#xD;
      receive virtually all required information about the participant prior to their meeting,&#xD;
      thereby improving communication with the participants, and potentially referring them to&#xD;
      relevant tests even prior to their meeting. In the face-to-face meeting of the participants&#xD;
      with the medical professional, most of the report summarizing treatment and family history,&#xD;
      which the medical professional would have usually spent precious time filling, will be&#xD;
      automatically ready, allowing for easy editing and finalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the participant is guided through an on-line introductory personalized video explaining&#xD;
      the genetic test and its implications tailored to the medical information that the&#xD;
      participant entered in the questionnaire. The participant's understanding of the information&#xD;
      presented in the personalized introductory video is tested by three questions. The&#xD;
      participant must accurately answer the three questions. If the participant makes two mistakes&#xD;
      the application opens the video in the relevant section and then asks the participant again.&#xD;
      Following a successful completion of this step the participant is invited to sign an&#xD;
      electronic Informed Consent to carry out the routine CarrierScan screening test (which is not&#xD;
      a part of this study). The participants will re-sign a hard copy Informed Consent upon&#xD;
      arrival to the Sheba Genetic Institute. A dedicated dashboard enables medical staff to&#xD;
      monitor the progression of a participant along the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1. Registration: During the initial phone call with potential participants, qualified&#xD;
      staff that are part of the study will explain the process and extend an invitation to&#xD;
      participated in the study. The DGA process will begin when the Sheba Medical Center (MC)&#xD;
      Genetics Institute will send potential participants a link following the initial phone call&#xD;
      between them. This link will enable the participant a secure connection to the DGA system.&#xD;
      During the initial registration to the system the participant will undergo authentication&#xD;
      using the standard two-factor authentication method based on phone number and the last four&#xD;
      digits of the ID number of the participant. At the end of this process a new user will be&#xD;
      created in the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2. Interactive medical questionnaire: The interactive medical questionnaire is defined&#xD;
      as the process of gathering personal information relevant to the specific clinical genetic&#xD;
      scenario (e.g. personal information, personal and family medical information). The&#xD;
      interactive medical questionnaire incorporated in the Enrollment app is based on Ministry of&#xD;
      Health (MOH) guidelines for carrier screening. The questionnaire is dynamic and is&#xD;
      interactively adapted based on live information supplied by the participant. In addition, the&#xD;
      questionnaire is taking advantage of &quot;natural language form&quot;, a user experience technique for&#xD;
      drafting the questions, for a higher compliance rate. The questionnaire was approved by the&#xD;
      Sheba MC PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that the essence of the DGA system is to enable to conduct genetically relevant&#xD;
      medical informatics processes in the context of digital sessions with secured and adaptive&#xD;
      systems. Such data collection, pedigree drawing, and risk calculation takes place during&#xD;
      face-to-face or over the phone meetings with medical staff using the currently practiced&#xD;
      genetics counseling paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3. Sample submission and signing a hard copy Informed Consent for the CarrierScan test:&#xD;
      At the Sheba MC Genetic Institute, before the submission of buccal/saliva/blood samples to&#xD;
      the test, participants will be asked to sign a hard copy Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The CarrierScan screening test in not part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4. Introductory personalized animated video: A personalized and dynamic animated video&#xD;
      is machine-generated following a well-characterized medically supervised algorithm to tailor&#xD;
      the video to each participant. The algorithm that generates the personalized introductory&#xD;
      video is approved by the Sheba medical staff. Participants will receive a short-animated&#xD;
      video summarizing the medical process they are going through. The content of these videos is&#xD;
      dynamic and in full alignment with the Sheba MC requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the dynamic video, the system will examine participants' understanding by a short&#xD;
      interactive quiz that summarizes the relevant topics presented in the video. If the user&#xD;
      answers wrong twice, he or she will be directed to the section in the video that provides the&#xD;
      information to answer correctly. It is important for the usability study to test the&#xD;
      responsiveness of the participant to sign the electronic Informed Consent following the&#xD;
      personalized introductory video. The investigators believe that this video will provide a&#xD;
      clear and, in most cases, more thorough explanation than the common face-to-face explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-Learning (general information on genetics and preconception): Provides education to the&#xD;
      participant on basic genetic principles and concepts by a series of short dynamic videos&#xD;
      making up an e-learning center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Board Dashboard for the Medical Staff:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A user-friendly dashboard will be accessible to relevant approved medical staff. It will&#xD;
      include all the information gathered from the participant during the completion of the&#xD;
      on-line registration and questionnaire process. Once the participant concludes the session of&#xD;
      Participant Enrollment (Pre-Test), all his/her data are presented on the medical staff&#xD;
      dashboard. A genetic counselor will be able to accept, reject, and/or revise the data. Next,&#xD;
      the genetic counselor will send the participant a signed summary letter (PDF) via the DGA&#xD;
      system, in a secured protocol (just as in the initial connection of the participant to the&#xD;
      Sheba MC application). This letter will present the information entered into the system by&#xD;
      the participant and invite him/her to perform the genetic test. Using the standard two-factor&#xD;
      authentication method based on phone number and the last four digits of the participants' ID&#xD;
      number, the participants will be able to view the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling rationale - the logics of the DGA system (the &quot;brain&quot;):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This module processes participant information gathered during the participant enrollment&#xD;
      process in combination with the results of the CarrierScan screening test. Residual risk is&#xD;
      calculated automatically, and the system is ready to preset the medical staff with its&#xD;
      suggestion on how to proceed. The Genetic Counseling Dashboard presents the supervising&#xD;
      clinician with all relevant information for their approval or for further comments and edits.&#xD;
      The results of the genetic tests are uploaded to the Sheba MC secured cloud. All processes&#xD;
      described in this section also take place in the secure Sheba MC cloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Only anonymization information of participants will be transferred to Igentify for&#xD;
      analysis, assessment and improvement of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DGA Algorithm: Next, the system utilizes its medically supervised genetic algorithm to decide&#xD;
      on the outcome of the genetic counseling (high or low risk). The algorithm takes advantage of&#xD;
      all relevant information in the system including the predictions of the residual risk. The&#xD;
      outcomes of the system are either a digital report generator (see next section) or in the&#xD;
      cases of couples that have been found to be at high risk, an invitation to a face-to-face&#xD;
      genetic counseling session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic Counseling Dashboard (to medical staff in Sheba MC): Presents all the information&#xD;
      gathered from the participant to the relevant medical staff, enabling decision-making&#xD;
      regarding participant outcomes. The dashboard will enable the medical staff to approve or&#xD;
      reject the suggestion of the DGA algorithm with regards to the participant's risk and the&#xD;
      subsequent process. The system will raise flags in cases that action is needed and will&#xD;
      support the subsequent face-to-face/telephone genetic counseling with reporting tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interface for genetic results: Enables the DGA to incorporate genetic results from various&#xD;
      genetic tests. In the current study, the DGA will work only with results of tests done at the&#xD;
      Sheba MC genetic lab for the expanded carrier screening (CarrierScan and Fragile-X tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling Summary Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the clinician approves the suggested decision of the DGA algorithm, this module is&#xD;
      responsible to generate two types of outputs. Low risk participants (namely couples that were&#xD;
      not found to be carriers of mutations in the same genes) are approved to receive an automated&#xD;
      digital report (personalized video), while high risk participants are urged to schedule a&#xD;
      face-to-face genetic counseling session. In high risk cases, the genetic counselor will have&#xD;
      the digital information provided by the participants and the genetic test results, to make&#xD;
      the counseling process more effective. The threshold of high/low risk assignment is&#xD;
      determined by the head of the Sheba Genetic Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Genetic Counseling Report Generator: This component generates an animated,&#xD;
      personalized dynamic video and a hard copy report (in PDF format) summarizing the genetic&#xD;
      counseling provided to the participant online. Using the standard two-factor authentication&#xD;
      method based on phone number and the last four digits of the participants' ID number, the&#xD;
      participants will be able to view the personalized video and download the reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This module is responsible to coherently convey all personal and mandatory messages&#xD;
      compatible with the guidelines of the Sheba Genetic Institute. The report is&#xD;
      machine-generated and approved by medical personnel before its disclosure to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having the DGA video available to the participants will allow them to review it repeatedly,&#xD;
      until full understanding of the topic is achieved, as self-assessed by the participant. Each&#xD;
      review will be recorded for medico-legal purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Support for In-Person Genetic Counseling: Face-to-face genetic counseling for high-risk&#xD;
      participants will be aided by the system. The system dashboards will present the genetic&#xD;
      counselor with a full report containing all gathered information to-date, which will be&#xD;
      augmented with digital tools, such as pedigree editor and short self-explanatory animated&#xD;
      videos aimed to facilitate an effective session.&#xD;

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators expect a significant reduction in the number of post-test face-to-face/telephone genetic counseling sessions. The current practice of expanded carrier screening provides a genetic counseling session to each couple who one of them is found to be a carrier of a genetic disease. Following the CarrierScan, expanded carrier screening test, ~60% of the couples are expected to be carriers of at least one disease. Using the DGA, the investigators expect that in the vast majority of cases (&gt;95%), when low risk is identified, the couple will be informed by the DGA without requiring a face-to-face/telephone session. The investigators expect that some of the low risk couples that received digital report will still request further counseling. The investigators estimate this fraction to be 10-20% of the low risk participants.</description>
