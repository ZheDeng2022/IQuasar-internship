      This study will be the first trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin&#xD;
      treatment in preventing readmissions/ER visits/urgent clinic visits, and death in patients&#xD;
      with and without T2D after admission for heart failure. Treatment with SGLT2-i has been shown&#xD;
      to reduce both heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with established&#xD;
      heart disease. However, the time of initiation of SGLT2-i therapy has not been evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with HF. In addition, the impact of treatment on HF symptoms quality of life,&#xD;
      resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus placebo will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The results of this study have great potential to impact and facilitate care and&#xD;
      to change current clinical guidelines in the management of patients with heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of both heart failure and type 2 diabetes (T2D) or prediabetes are reaching&#xD;
      epidemic proportions globally and in the United States. More than 40% of patients with&#xD;
      established heart failure (HF) have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin&#xD;
      treatment in preventing readmissions/ER visits/urgent clinic visits, and death in patients&#xD;
      with and without T2D after admission for heart failure. Treatment with SGLT2-i has been shown&#xD;
      to reduce both heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with established&#xD;
      heart disease. However, the time of initiation of SGLT2-i therapy has not been evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with HF. In addition, the impact of treatment on HF symptoms quality of life,&#xD;
      resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus placebo will be&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. In the KCCQ, an overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
