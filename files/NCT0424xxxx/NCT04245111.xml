      This will be a prospective observational trial to better understand the range and variation&#xD;
      associated with bone/soft tissue perfusion in fracture patients and examine the relationship&#xD;
      between perfusion, measured using quantitative Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence and&#xD;
      complications such as surgical site infection (SSI), persistent SSI, and fracture nonunion.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure is complication (either infection, recurrent infection or nonunion).&#xD;
      Eligible consenting patients will receive standard of care treatment for their fracture or&#xD;
      infection including irrigation and debridement of their operative site and/or fracture&#xD;
      fixation. After exposure, 0.1 mg/Kg ICG will be injected intravenously and video rate ICG&#xD;
      fluorescence images will be acquired 20 seconds before and 4 minutes after the injection,&#xD;
      each before and after debridement. A subset of 38 post-fracture complication patients will&#xD;
      undergo surgical treatment for their infection in Center of Innovation Surgery (CIS) and have&#xD;
      either an intraoperative Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) after&#xD;
      exposure but before the ICG injection or a preoperative DCE-MRI. Patients receiving surgery&#xD;
      in the CIS will be required to sign an additional CIS-specific consent document. The need for&#xD;
      repeat surgical procedure will be left up to the treating surgeon. If repeat procedure is&#xD;
      needed, pre- and post-debridement quantitative ICG fluorescence images will be obtained at&#xD;
      each procedure. Study participants will be followed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months from their index study surgery. Complication including index infection, recurrent&#xD;
      infection or delaying union/nonunion will be identified at the time of diagnosis and/or&#xD;
      during each participants assessment that occurs during routine outpatient clinic visit.&#xD;
      Detailed information on the infection including date of diagnosis, participant signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, culture test results, method of treatment(s), and date of resolution will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be administered FDA approved ICG through intravenous injection and imaged by a FDA approved surgical microscope (Pentero or Spy Elite) which is 0.5 meter away from the subject. Both ICG fluorescence and the two imaging systems have been used for routine clinical practice for many years. Figure (a) shows the Schematic sketch of the imaging systems. ICG fluorescence imaging utilizes intravenously injected ICG, which is a fluorescent dye that is FDA-approved for clinical use, illuminated with near-infrared light. The ICG dye is indirectly activated and the dynamic fluorescence due to bone perfusion can be captured by a video rate imaging system.</description>

        Patients 18 years of age or older who present with an open fracture will be considered for&#xD;
        the open fracture cohort (Cohort 1). Similarly fracture patients who present with an SSI&#xD;
        following fracture fixation or joint fusion will be screened for the fracture SSI cohort&#xD;
        (Cohort 2). Patients who present with a closed fracture will be considered for the closed&#xD;
        fracture cohort (Cohort 3).&#xD;
