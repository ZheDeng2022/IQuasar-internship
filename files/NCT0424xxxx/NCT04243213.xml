  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid mobilization of cardiac surgery patients within the first 48 postoperative hours in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit is common practice and decisive for the outcome, especially in this&#xD;
      group (over 65 years). If sitting on the edge of the bed was successful, a standing attempt&#xD;
      is usually made. Both can be accompanied by blood pressure dysregulations in the sense of&#xD;
      hypotensive phases as well as dizziness. Postural control is the ability of the body to&#xD;
      balance an upright body position under the influence of gravity.The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether training with the Galileo device by means of vibration on the soles of&#xD;
      the feet and / or by changing the position to 15 ° can improve the postural control and thus&#xD;
      the postoperative mobilization of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether vibrations on the sole of the foot accelerate&#xD;
      mobilization after cardiac surgery. Preliminary studies show that the mechanisms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular regulation in the event of changes in position, e.g. when getting up from the&#xD;
      lying position, can be positively influenced by vibration treatments on the soles of the&#xD;
      feet, if at the same time a small part of the body weight is shifted to the soles of the&#xD;
      feet. In the early phase after the operation, you may feel dizzy when you get up, which&#xD;
      creates uncertainty in the patient, which in turn delays further mobilization.The sole of the&#xD;
      foot vibrations and various measurements of the cardiovascular regulation are carried out in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is carried out by the clinical department for cardiac surgery together with the&#xD;
      chair of physiology at the Medical University of Graz. Thirty patients will participate in&#xD;
      this study. Through a random selection process, the patients are divided into three groups of&#xD;
      10 patients each and receive the following treatment in addition to standard clinical&#xD;
      physiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Intervention group I receives a unit of 10 minutes daily on the vibrating plate with an&#xD;
      upright posture of 15 ° postoperatively from the 2nd to the 7th day B: Intervention group II&#xD;
      is positioned postoperatively from day 2 to day 7 for 10 minutes at 15 degrees, but without&#xD;
      vibration C: The control group only receives standard physiotherapy and no further treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard physiotherapy consists of the patient trying to stand up together with the&#xD;
      physiotherapist from the intensive care bed or IMC bed. The participation in this clinical&#xD;
      trial will take approximately 60 minutes per appointment. This consists of 20-25 minutes for&#xD;
      attaching the electrodes, 15 minutes for the &quot;sit-to-stand test&quot; and 15-20 minutes for the&#xD;
      survey (filling out the questionnaires). At the beginning of the study or before the&#xD;
      operation (OP), questionnaires are used to determine whether you have an increased risk of&#xD;
      falling and whether you are frail. These questionnaires will be carried out by trained&#xD;
      employees together with you during the initial measurement, upon discharge and after about 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the cardiovascular regulation during changes in position, a sit-up test is carried&#xD;
      out. Values such as blood pressure and cardiac output (Task Force Monitor), muscle activity&#xD;
      on the calf over the skin and vascular reaction in the calf over the skin, and blood flow to&#xD;
      the brain are measured with a Ultrasound device included. All methods used are non-invasive&#xD;
      (that is, only adhesive electrodes are used on the skin and no needles or syringes, there is&#xD;
      no blood draw in this measurement) and not painful. The patient will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in such a sit-up test (from supine/lying position to standing upright) at a total of 5&#xD;
      measuring dates. In total the patient will be given two blood pressure cuffs, one on the&#xD;
      right upper arm, the second on the left middle finger. To measure the ECG and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular values, 8 electrodes are attached to your upper body. In addition there are 3&#xD;
      adhesive electrodes on the calves for measuring the muscles. No additional blood tests are&#xD;
      carried out as part of the tests. The results of your routine blood tests will be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements from the patients in group A-C are compared to determine whether training&#xD;
      with the vibration exercise leads to faster mobilization after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
