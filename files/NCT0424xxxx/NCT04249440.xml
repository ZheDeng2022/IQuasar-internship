  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative systemic treatment can make patients getting more opportunity for&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery, down-staging and new drugs developing. It is particularly common&#xD;
      in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-over expressing subtype for as high as&#xD;
      40%~60% pCR rate of such a population. Even though, in NSABP B18/27 trials, it had been&#xD;
      proved that PST could not improve either disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      comparing with postoperatively systemic treatment in total population. We designed a&#xD;
      real-world study to investigate the prognosis of anti-HER2 treatment combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy preoperatively versus postoperatively in HER2-positive early breast cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of HER2 positive early invasive breast cancer (cT1-3N0-1M0), from&#xD;
      January 2012 to December 2014 were identified and enrolled continuously. The conditions of&#xD;
      HER2-positive expression of primary breast cancer were defined as follows: HER2 3+ by&#xD;
      immunohistochemical (IHC) method or HER2 2+ by IHC with a further positive result by&#xD;
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). According to the real upfront treatment, all&#xD;
      eligible patients were classified as PST group and surgery group. All the patients accepted&#xD;
      standard one-year trastuzumab as anti-HER2 treatment combined with chemotherapy. In the PST&#xD;
      group, the effect was evaluated according to RECIST1.1 every two cycles, the patients with&#xD;
      clinical complete response (cCR) or partial response (PR) would receive the whole course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, those with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) would receive&#xD;
      surgery promptly. After surgery, all patients underwent irradiation and endocrine therapies&#xD;
      if necessary. The pCR was defined as the absence of infiltrating residual invasive disease in&#xD;
      the breast and axillary nodes. For those non-pCR patients after PST, intensive adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy was not routine treatment except patients with progressive disease.The primary&#xD;
      endpoint was DFS defined as the time from enrollment to local, regional, or distant&#xD;
      recurrences; the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer; or death without evidence of&#xD;
      breast cancer. Patients suffered disease progress becoming inoperable before surgery were&#xD;
      counted as local treatment failures. The second endpoint was OS defined as the time from&#xD;
      study entry to death from any cause. All the endpoints were compared between PST group and&#xD;
      upfront surgery group, also further analysis according to pathological response status&#xD;
      stratified in PST group.&#xD;
