                  in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant setting with disease progression or recurrence&#xD;
                  within 6 months of completion of platinum-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participants who previously only received platinum as a radiosensitizer are not&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must provide a tumor tissue sample, either from archival tissue or newly&#xD;
             obtained core or excisional biopsy. If the participant received local therapy (For&#xD;
             example: radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy) after the archival tissue was taken,&#xD;
             a new biopsy will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 to 1&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Participants with a history of HCV infection should have completed curative&#xD;
                  antiviral treatment and require HCV viral load below the limit of quantification&#xD;
&#xD;
