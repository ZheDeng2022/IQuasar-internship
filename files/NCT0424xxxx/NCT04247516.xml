  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a neurological, non-progressive, and permanent developmental disorder&#xD;
      that mainly affects movement and posture, with a prevalence of 3 to 4 children per 1000 live&#xD;
      births. CP's motor impairments are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation,&#xD;
      perception, cognition, communication, and behavior. These impairments echo in the activities&#xD;
      of daily life, as well as in the learning process. Importantly, children with CP are&#xD;
      especially prone to display working memory and EFs deficits, as well as difficulties in&#xD;
      self-regulation, which might help explain some of their social and learning problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These children have a high risk of showing learning disabilities, which may arise before the&#xD;
      schooling years. This risk is not exclusively determined by cognitive impairment, with&#xD;
      children with a normative cognitive level still presenting specific learning difficulties&#xD;
      (e.g., mathematics, reading).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to their clinical picture, children with disabilities, including CP, struggle with their&#xD;
      difficulties in school. Consequently, they are prone to develop a poor School Engagement (SE)&#xD;
      - multidimensional and multifaceted construct involving three interrelated dimensions:&#xD;
      students' behaviors, emotions, and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with disabilities, one of the factors that contributes to lower SE is their high&#xD;
      level of school absenteeism. These children miss, on average, 3 weeks of school in a school&#xD;
      year due to health issues, which may hinder their academic performance. The promotion of SE&#xD;
      in children with disabilities is, therefore, a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To promote SE, Gamification strategies can be used. Gamification is the use of game elements&#xD;
      (e.g., points, rewards, feedback) in non-game contexts. The potential of using Gamification&#xD;
      is high and constitutes a unique opportunity to engage participants in specific activities,&#xD;
      such as in intervention or learning contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, through game mechanics, Gamification can be used as a tool to promote SE. This is&#xD;
      because, it offers an attractive learning environment and converts difficult tasks into more&#xD;
      appealing ones, motivating individuals to perform. Moreover, it enhances the degree and depth&#xD;
      of participant engagement, rises behavior and lifestyle changes, promotes learning&#xD;
      opportunities, motivates students, and improves intervention appeal, especially for&#xD;
      youngsters. To conclude, this project aims to increase SE through Gamification in children&#xD;
      with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature has highlighted the need to focus interventions on SE and self-regulated learning&#xD;
      (SRL) on a specific domain. Because children with CP are at high risk of presenting learning&#xD;
      difficulties, especially in mathematics, this project will focus on mathematics performance.&#xD;
      Moreover, SE is multidimensional, including behaviors, emotions, and cognitions related to&#xD;
      school. Specifically, behavioral SE can be conceptualized in three levels: 1) school&#xD;
      attendance and fulfillment of school work, 2) participation in class, and 3) active&#xD;
      participation (e.g., doing extra school-work). Emotional SE refers to students' affective&#xD;
      reactions and sense of connectedness with school. Finally, cognitive SE is related to&#xD;
      personal investment in academic tasks, self-regulation, and value of the learning process.&#xD;
      Because SRL may be compromised in children with CP, mainly due to difficulties in planning&#xD;
      and setting goals, this project will promote SE in mathematics by developing SRL strategies&#xD;
      in these children. SRL processes are key for students to attain their self-set goals and&#xD;
      include competences of planning, execution, evaluation, and monitoring of the learning&#xD;
      process. SE and SRL will be promoted through Gamification strategies on the Canvas platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main purpose is to assess an intervention program with children with CP to increase&#xD;
      SE, and enhance SRL, through Gamification Strategies in mathematics. Specifics aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embed Gamification Strategies (e.g., rewards, collaboration, competition) in the Canvas&#xD;
           Platform using the tools already available (e.g., forum/chat);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and assess the efficacy and impact of the intervention in promoting SE, and SRL&#xD;
           competences, through an integrated assessment approach (functional, educational,&#xD;
           neurocognitive, and neuroimaging).&#xD;

      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 children with CP, age-range between 8 and 15 years (elementary and middle school - 3rd&#xD;
      grade to 9th grade), without cognitive impairments, will be selected. Agreements in partaking&#xD;
      in the study are already in place with CP rehabilitation centers on the north of Portugal.&#xD;
      Participants have already been evaluated through cognitive and neuropsychological tools.&#xD;
      Specifically, children should present a cognitive performance at least in Medium- Low level&#xD;
      (WISC-III) and should have eventual epilepsy episodes under control. Participants need to be&#xD;
      able to use a computer and have internet access, and are required to have a native level of&#xD;
      writing and reading skills in the Portuguese language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in the Portuguese associations of cerebral palsy. A collaboration&#xD;
      agreement was established with the Federation of Portuguese Cerebral Palsy Associations&#xD;
      (FPCPA), which includes 15 Cerebral Palsy Associations in Portugal. The Associations will&#xD;
      evaluate their children and identify those who fulfil the inclusion criteria. The first&#xD;
      contact with the parents/caregivers will be made by the associations and only after they&#xD;
      accept to participate will the research team contact them. When identified, children and&#xD;
      their parents will be debriefed, the consents delivered, explained, and signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FCPA (Federation Associations of Cerebral Palsy) will identified the needs to promote&#xD;
      self-regulation skills and school involvement of children with CP. Researchers will&#xD;
      established contact and held formal meetings with therapists to identify key difficulties and&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Two questions guided the meetings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. &quot;What are the main difficulties you have while intervening with children with CP?&quot; ii.&#xD;
      &quot;What do you think we could help with?&quot; For study 4 a randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      developed with three groups. After obtaining informed consent from parents/caregivers,&#xD;
      participants meeting criteria will be randomly assigned to one condition. The control group&#xD;
      (CG) will not have access to the online platform, i.e. no intervention. The intervention&#xD;
      group 1 (IG1) will receive on a weekly basis tasks and activities on the online platform to&#xD;
      promote SR and SE, as well as chapters of the narrative. The intervention group 2 (IG2) will&#xD;
      receive the same tasks and materials as IG1 but embedded with Gamification Strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - Selection of Gamification Strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reeves and Read (2009) identify the &quot;Ten Ingredients of Great Games&quot; as good examples of&#xD;
      elements of Gamification: i) self-representation with avatars, ii) three-dimensional&#xD;
      environments, iii) narrative context, iv) feedback, v) reputations, ranks and levels, vi)&#xD;
      marketplaces and economies, vii) competition under rules that are explicit and enforced,&#xD;
      viii) teams, ix) parallel communication systems that can be easily configured, x) time&#xD;
      pressure. Specifically, in the school context, a number of game elements have been identified&#xD;
      as promoters of SE, contributing to learning success of students: collaboration and&#xD;
      competition, feedback and reputations, ranks and levels, and reinforcement. Accordingly,&#xD;
      through Canvas® Platform tools, these elements will be applied to the IG2. The project will&#xD;
      be presented to FCPA, who will be involved in all stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be presented at the rehabilitation centers, to technicians and&#xD;
      parents/caregivers; and to children who accept to participate. The intervention will take&#xD;
      place at the rehabilitation centers, and the collaboration of all stakeholders is imperative.&#xD;
      Parents/caregivers will be asked to stimulate their child to engage with, and talk about, the&#xD;
      intervention, and to contact the research team whenever is necessary. Secondly,&#xD;
      parents/caregivers and children will fill-in the informed consents and the socio-demographic&#xD;
      questionnaires. Each child will have a login through e-mail into the platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will take place during the weekly occupational therapy (OT) sessions at the&#xD;
      rehabilitation centers to guarantee implementation of the research protocol (e.g., internet&#xD;
      access).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Program evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To capture the procedural dimension of the phenomenon and evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on the promotion of SE, SRL, and EF in children with CP, several elements will&#xD;
      be considered: aptitude (i.e. questionnaires), event (i.e. checklist, observations), and&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, as suggested by the literature of SRL processes (Núñez, Rosário, Vallejo &amp;&#xD;
      González-Pienda, 2013; Zimmerman, 2008). The hypothesis is that the intervention will promote&#xD;
      statistically significant improvements in the IG1 and IG2 in all measures - SE, SRL, EF&#xD;
      evaluation, compared to the CG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation protocol described refers to assessment that will be conducted with the&#xD;
      children participating in the study. Children were assessed on their intellectual ability&#xD;
      using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III) (Wechsler,&#xD;
      2003). Medical and therapists' records were reviewed to collect information about the&#xD;
      topographic motor type and quality of tonus, as well as the child's level on the Gross Motor&#xD;
      Function Classification System (GMFCS) (Andrada, 2012; Palisano et al., 2015). Other&#xD;
      variables were gathered: gender, date of birth, school grades from the last year, types of&#xD;
      therapies each child is attending, extracurricular activities, internet access at home,&#xD;
      computer access, story reading frequency, curricular adaptations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will be collected before the start of the intervention, at the end,&#xD;
      and 3 months after the intervention completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neuropsychological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. This investigation follows the Miyake model of EF. This model postulates that EF is&#xD;
                comprised of three latent variables with different roles (Inhibition, Shifting, and&#xD;
                Updating) that can be learned through the individual's performance (Miyake,&#xD;
                Emerson, &amp; Palisano et al., 2015). The CANTAB application was selected for the pre-&#xD;
                post assessment. From the set of the CANTAB, 6 tests were selected: i. Multitasking&#xD;
                Test (MTT) - To manage conflicting information provided by the direction of an&#xD;
                arrow and its location on the screen and to ignore task- irrelevant information&#xD;
                (Shifting).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS) - To assess both the spatial planning and the&#xD;
           working memory subdomains (Updating/Planning). Based upon the Tower of Hanoi test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Stop Signal Task (SST) - To measure response inhibition and impulse control&#xD;
           (Inhibition Control).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. Spatial Working Memory (SWM) - To provide a measure of strategy and of working&#xD;
           memory errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           v. Motor Screening Task (MOT) - To provide a general assessment of whether sensorimotor&#xD;
           deficits or lack of comprehension will limit the collection of valid data from the&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           vi. Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) - This task, measures the ability to identify six&#xD;
           basic emotions in facial expressions along a continuum of expression magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. A classic test of inhibitory control (Go-No-go task) will be used; another test will&#xD;
           be adapted using images from the e-book of the &quot;Incredible Adventures of the Anastácio,&#xD;
           the Explorer&quot;. 2. Self-Report Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Effort Measures 4. Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Self-Regulation Learning (Rosário et al., 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. SRL Strategies Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comprises nine self-regulated learning strategies presented in a Likert-like format of 5&#xD;
           points (1=never to 5=always)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Items assess the three phases of SRL model: PLEE (three items per each phase) i.&#xD;
           Planning (e.g., ''I make a plan before I begin writing. I think about what I want to say&#xD;
           and how I need to write it.'' - α=.80), ii. Execution (e.g., ''If I become distracted or&#xD;
           lose concentration while I am in class or studying, then I usually try to regain my&#xD;
           goals.'' - α=.85) iii. Evaluation (e.g., ''I compare the grades I receive with the goals&#xD;
           I set for that subject.''- α=.87)&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) Engagement&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. School Engagement Scale (Fredricks et al., 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The scale comprises 14 items presented in a Likert-like format of 5 points (1=never to&#xD;
           5=always).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Items cluster in the three SE dimensions (i.e., behavioral, emotional, and cognitive).&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Behavioral Engagement scale comprises 5 items (e.g., &quot;I follow the rules at school.&quot;)&#xD;
           (α=.77);&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Emotional Engagement scale comprises 6 items (e.g., &quot;I feel happy in school.)&#xD;
           (α=.86); iii. Cognitive Engagement scale comprises 8 items (e.g., I study at home even&#xD;
           when I don't have a test.) (α=.82).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Throughout the interventions, children will be asked to complete different tasks on&#xD;
                a voluntary basis (e.g., viewing videos, participation in the discussion forums).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The fulfillment of these tasks and of the session's goals will be on-task measures&#xD;
                of children's involvement with the intervention program&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Children, therapists, and parents/caregivers will be selected for a purposeful&#xD;
                sample upon completion of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Interviews will be semi-structured to further understand the effectiveness of the&#xD;
                intervention.&#xD;
