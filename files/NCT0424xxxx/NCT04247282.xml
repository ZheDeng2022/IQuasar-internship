  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people who get head and neck cancer will need surgery to treat their cancer. Research&#xD;
      suggests that immunotherapy drugs may help fight head and neck cancer if given before&#xD;
      surgery. In most cases, there is enough time between cancer diagnosis and surgery to test&#xD;
      immunotherapy drugs. In this study, researchers are testing the safety and anti-cancer&#xD;
      abilities of 3 drugs given before surgery for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if giving M7824 alone, or with the TriAd vaccine, or with TriAd vaccine plus N-803&#xD;
      can shrink previously untreated head and neck tumors before surgery or stop the tumors from&#xD;
      coming back after all treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older who have a head and neck cancer that has not been treated before, and&#xD;
      the tumor must be removed with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history and physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tumor, mucosa, and skin biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrocardiograms to monitor heart activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  endoscopies (a tube is inserted through the nose to see the upper airway)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get M7824 through an intravenous infusion. For this, a small plastic&#xD;
      tube is put into an arm vein. Some may also get the TriAd vaccine. It is injected under the&#xD;
      skin on the arms or legs. Some may also get N-803. It is injected under the skin on the&#xD;
      stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have clinic visits while they are getting treatment and after treatment&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment ends, participants will have their scheduled surgery. There will be two&#xD;
      follow up visits at the NIH after your surgery. They will be contacted by phone or email&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for 3 months. Then they will be contacted every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 50% of patients with advanced p16-negative head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma (HNSCC) will develop locoregional or distant relapse within two years of&#xD;
           completing definitive standard-of-care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two ongoing clinical trials investigating neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade before surgical&#xD;
           resection of HNSCC suggest that immunotherapy can both cytoreduce existing disease&#xD;
           before surgery and reduce the risk of locoregional or distant disease relapse after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preliminary data from these studies suggest neoadjuvant treatments can be administered&#xD;
           without delaying planned surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experiments conducted by the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB)&#xD;
           demonstrated synergistic activity with tumor-targeted adenoviral vaccine plus M7824 plus&#xD;
           N-803 in humanized mice bearing human carcinomas and in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand&#xD;
           1(PD-L1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
           (TGF-beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adenoviral vaccines targeting known shared tumor antigens can generate antigen-specific&#xD;
           T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N-803 is an IL-15/IL-15R alpha super agonist complex that can enhance both NK cell and T&#xD;
           cell anti-tumor activity via expansion and activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity observed with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 agents alone provides rationale for testing&#xD;
           of M7824 alone and in combination with other immune oncologic agents that have been&#xD;
           shown to work in concert with M7824 in preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of pre- and post-treatment tissues from HNSCC patients presents a unique&#xD;
           opportunity to interrogate the effects the above treatment(s) on tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dose escalation of N-803 in combination with a flat dose of M7824 was conducted at the&#xD;
           National Cancer Institute. Thirteen patients have been treated with the combination. No&#xD;
           DLTs were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) or clinical-to-pathological&#xD;
      downstaging in patients with previously untreated intermediate/high risk, non-HPV associated,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T1-T4, N0-N3, M0 stage II, III or IV) who&#xD;
      receive any of the three proposed treatments: M7824 alone, M7824 plus TriAd vaccine, or M7824&#xD;
      plus TriAd vaccine plus N803 prior to definite surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, previously untreated&#xD;
           intermediate/high risk, p16-negative (if oropharyngeal), squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
           head and neck (T1-T4, N0-N3, M0 stage II, III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men or Women; Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol is a sequential window of opportunity trial of Anti-PD-L1/TGF-beta trap&#xD;
           (M7824) alone and in combination with TriAd Vaccine and N-803 for non-HPV associated&#xD;
           resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be referred to the NIH for this immunotherapy treatment from surrounding&#xD;
           academic medical centers and private physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon referral to the NIH, patients will be rapidly screened, and enrolled on the&#xD;
           protocol, if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This trial will enroll patients in three arms sequentially to permit safety evaluation&#xD;
           before adding the next agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first arm of 12 patients, M7824 (1200 mg) will be administered intravenously on&#xD;
           day 1 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no safety concerns, accrual will proceed to the 2nd arm, and 12 patients will enroll&#xD;
           with M7824 (1200mg; intravenous) treatment on day 1 and 15 and TriAd vaccine (5 x 10&#xD;
           (11) VP; subcutaneous) treatment on day 1 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no safety concerns, accrual will proceed to the 3rd arm, and 12 patients will enroll&#xD;
           with M7824 ((1200mg; intravenous) treatment on day 1 and 15 plus TriAd vaccine (5 x&#xD;
           10(11) VP; subcutaneous injection) and N-803 (15mcg/kg, subcutaneously) treatment on day&#xD;
           1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After obtaining pre-treatment biopsies, imaging and blood collection, patients will&#xD;
           receive the neoadjuvant immunotherapy at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will then be sent back to their referring providers for their definitive&#xD;
           standard of care surgery and adjuvant therapy as indicated based upon pathologic&#xD;
           analysis of the surgical specimen. NCI investigators will have no role in directing the&#xD;
           ensuing standard of care surgeries performed at outside institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For consistency in pathologic analysis of resection specimens, tissue blocks and/or&#xD;
           slides will be obtained from outside institutions and be reviewed by the NCI Laboratory&#xD;
           of Pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that up to 20 patients may enroll in one year. Thus, with 3 arms of 12&#xD;
           patients apiece, up to 36 evaluable patients may enroll. Accrual is expected to be&#xD;
           completed within 2 years.&#xD;

                  therapy &lt; 1 month are excluded. HIV-positive patients will also be excluded if&#xD;
                  the PI determines that there is a clinically significant drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic administration (defined as daily or every other day for continued use &gt;14&#xD;
                  days) of systemic corticosteroids or other immune suppressive drugs, within 14&#xD;
                  days before treatment on study. Physiologic daily dosing of steroids is allowed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M7824 is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with M7824 breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;

             treatment are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent full&#xD;
             participation in this trial (including the long-term follow-up), or would interfere&#xD;
             with the evaluation of the trial endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior live vaccine, investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or&#xD;
             any prior radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past&#xD;

             arrhythmia, requiring medication, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170/ DBP&gt;105) or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations within 12 months that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment. A biopsy&#xD;
             will not preclude a patient from starting study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis B (HBV) are excluded due to potential risk for&#xD;
             viral reactivation and resulting liver injury in persons with latent HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated or active brain metastases are not eligible because we are&#xD;
             enrolling non-metastatic head and neck cancer patients in this trial. Standard of care&#xD;
             treatment is different for head and neck cancer patients with and without metastatic&#xD;
