    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the Dynamic Spectral Imaging (DSI) Colposcope (DySIS) in it's ability to&#xD;
      diagnose cervical dysplasia. Half of participants with be examined by the DySIS colposcope,&#xD;
      there the other half will be examined by standard colposcopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colposcopy has been shown to be a subjective exam, and is dependant on the colposcopists.&#xD;
      Sensitivity for colposcopy has been shown to be as low as 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve this, different adjunctive technologies have been introduced to add a more&#xD;
      objective approach to the colposcopy exam. One of these devices is the DySIS colposcope,&#xD;
      which measures the aceto-white reaction that may occur on the cervix uteri after the&#xD;
      application of acetic-acid. The device provides the examiner with a colour-coded map&#xD;
      indicating areas of interest. Studies have shown promising results indicating that using this&#xD;
      device together with the colposcopists own interpretation of the cervix uteri can potentially&#xD;
      lead to an increase in the performance of the colposcopy exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark all women referred for colposcopy have 4 biopsies taken, according to the Danish&#xD;
      national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study these 4 biopsies are as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The area the colposcopists views as the worst before the DSI-map is seen.&#xD;
           Colposcopy-Directed Biopsy (CDB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The area indicated as the worst by the DSI-map (DSI-directed biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. additional biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. additional biopsy All biopsies are placed in separate containers and analysed separately&#xD;
           by specialized pathologists.&#xD;
