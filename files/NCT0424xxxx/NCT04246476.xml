  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults, and particularly those with Parkinson disease (PD), may experience walking&#xD;
      difficulties that negatively impact their daily function and quality of life. This project&#xD;
      will examine the impact of music and mentally singing on walking performance, with a goal of&#xD;
      understanding what types of rhythmic cues are most helpful. Our pilot work suggests that&#xD;
      imagined, mental singing (i.e., singing in your head) while while walking helps people walk&#xD;
      faster with greater stability, whereas walking to music also helps people walk faster but&#xD;
      with reduced stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, the investigators will compare walking while mentally singing to walking while&#xD;
      listening to music, using personalized cues tailored to each person's walking performance.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize stride time variability will be less in the mental singing&#xD;
      condition compared to listening to music; and that mental singing and listening to music will&#xD;
      improve gait speed similarly as compared to the uncued condition. The investigators will also&#xD;
      test whether finger tapping, a rhythmic task similar to walking in many ways, responds&#xD;
      similarly while mentally singing and listening to music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2, the investigator will investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the enhancements&#xD;
      in movement performance seen with mental signing or listening to music. The investigators&#xD;
      will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain activity during finger tapping&#xD;
      with and without various cues to understand which areas of the brain are more or less&#xD;
      responsive to the cues. The investigators hypothesize individuals with PD will exhibit lesser&#xD;
      activation of putamen and greater activation of cortical motor areas and cerebellum compared&#xD;
      to controls in all tapping conditions; and internal, mental singing during tapping will&#xD;
      elicit greater activation of the putamen and lesser activation of cortical motor areas in&#xD;
      both groups compared to uncued tapping and tapping while listening to music.&#xD;

      During this observational study, all participants will attend two visits 4-10 days apart. At&#xD;
      the first visit, all participants (participants with PD and age-matched controls) will wear&#xD;
      wearable sensors during the following tasks: walking with no cues; walking while listening to&#xD;
      music; and walking while mentally singing. The wearable sensors will measure gait parameters&#xD;
      including gait speed and stride time variability. All participants will also conduct the&#xD;
      following tasks while finger tapping on a keyboard: tapping with no cues; tapping while&#xD;
      listening to music; and tapping while mentally singing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second visit, all participants (participants with PD and age-matched controls) will&#xD;
      perform the following tasks during imaging: uncued tapping; listening to music (no tapping);&#xD;
      mentally singing (no tapping); listening to music and tapping; and mentally singing and&#xD;
      tapping.&#xD;
