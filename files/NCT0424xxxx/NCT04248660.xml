      Uterine artery doppler measurements will be made at 11-14 weeks and 20-22 weeks of gestation,&#xD;
      and the classification of these measurements according to type of delivery; and to&#xD;
      investigate the change in the effect of delivery type on uterine artery flows on obstetric&#xD;

      The first and second trimester perinatal examination results performed by the same operator&#xD;
      from pregnant women who have applied to the clinic since the first trimester are removed from&#xD;
      the ViewPoint 6.0 server and database and their uterine artery doppler values (uterine artery&#xD;
      PI and RI values, presence of uterine artery notch), placental location, gestational week of&#xD;
      measurement, blood pressures, PAPP-A and hCG MoM values, obstetric results (type of birth,&#xD;
      week, weight, ante-postpartum complications), data to be generated from other hospital&#xD;
      records will be saved to the base&#xD;
