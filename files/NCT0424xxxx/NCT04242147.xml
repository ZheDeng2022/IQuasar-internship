  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-in-Human, open-label, sequential dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of&#xD;
      KD033 in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The main purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to test KD033 at different dose levels to see if it is safe and well tolerated when&#xD;
      given once every 2 weeks. Additional purposes of the study are to find out whether the study&#xD;
      drug has anti-cancer effects and how the study drug is processed by the body.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the dose escalation phase of the study, cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects with metastatic or&#xD;
      locally advanced solid tumors will receive KD033 at escalating dose levels. Upon completion&#xD;
      of the dose escalation part of the study, at least 15 subjects will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      expansion cohort to further confirm the recommended phase 2 dose.&#xD;
