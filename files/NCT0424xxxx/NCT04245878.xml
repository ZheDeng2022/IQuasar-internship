  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orotracheal extubation in resuscitation is a situation in which there is an elevated risk of&#xD;
      inhalation. In resuscitation, enteral nutrition that is administered in a continuous flow is&#xD;
      likely to accumulate in the stomach. Gastric motility in resuscitation patients may be&#xD;
      impaired for many reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iatrogenic: Catecholamines, sedatives and opioids slow down the digestive system and&#xD;
           decrease the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shock, polytrauma, sepsis, pain or discomfort, or mechanical ventilation again create an&#xD;
           alteration in gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition is commonly discontinued to manage extubation, but it is not systematic.&#xD;
      Discontinuation leads to a decrease in caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric ultrasound is a minimally invasive, reliable and promising means of monitoring that&#xD;
      allows the stomach to be visualized directly. Studies on healthy subjects and in anaesthesia&#xD;
      have made it possible to validate ultrasound in the context of the study of gastric content&#xD;
      using both quantitative (including measurement of the antral area) and qualitative criteria.&#xD;
      Measurement of the antral area was also studied in resuscitation. Antral area and gastric&#xD;
      volume are closely related, with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.6 to 0.91.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying patients at risk of inhalation by ultrasound could allow individualized enteral&#xD;
      nutrition management prior to extubation in the resuscitation unit, and thus optimize&#xD;
      nutritional management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to identify factors associated with greated antral area in&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The hypothesis is that continued enteral&#xD;
      nutrition before extubation is associated with increased gastric volume as measured by&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
