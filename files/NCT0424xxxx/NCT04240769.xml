  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to utilize physical activity monitoring to determine the trajectory&#xD;
      of normal recovery as it relates to a patient's ability to get up and get moving. From this&#xD;
      work, we hope to be able to define the range in patients' physical activity following knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery, and thus, give clinicians a tool and the methodology to identify&#xD;
      patients whose recovery is not progressing as quickly as expected. Data from physical&#xD;
      activity monitors will allow the research team to identify how active patients are, how&#xD;
      vigorous that activity is, and how well that activity correlates with standard and commonly&#xD;
      used patient questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study of the physical activity levels of adults who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee and are undergoing knee replacement&#xD;
      surgery at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Data regarding patient activity and&#xD;
      functional recovery will be collected using two methods. First, data will be collected&#xD;
      through the extraction of three-axis accelerometer data, collected via a wrist-worn (and&#xD;
      hip-worn for a subset of patients) physical activity monitor. This data will be collected in&#xD;
      three intervals: pre-operatively, immediately postoperatively, and at 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. Secondly, data will be collected by standard clinical assessment and patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures. These assessments will again take place pre-operatively, at 6&#xD;
      weeks postoperatively, and at 6 months postoperatively. Additional data will be collected&#xD;
      through a simple activity diary, which asks the participants to log their monitor wear-time&#xD;
      along with the times that they took bicycle rides or extended walks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of patient involvement is up to a total of 8 to 8.5 weeks over the&#xD;
      course of up to 7 months. There are no clinical visits within this protocol beyond what is&#xD;
      already within normal patient care. Patients will be asked to post their monitor back to the&#xD;
      research centre for data collection and data processing twice during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the trajectory of recovery in terms of physical activity&#xD;
      in the post-operative knee replacement population, and subsequently to define the expected&#xD;
      path of early recovery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Physical activity will be evaluated for 7 days at approximately 2 weeks before surgery, for 6 continuous weeks immediately postoperatively and (for a subset of participants) for 7 continuous days at 6 months postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will physical activity, as extracted from analysis of raw accelerometer data from the activity monitor. Several variables will be extracted from the raw data, including average acceleration vector (Euclidean norm minus one), bouts of physical activity and percentage of active and sedentary time.</description>

    <measure>Change in EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative (baseline), 6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient reported outcome measure to assess patient benefit. As summary index score from 0 to 1 is given, where 0 is the health state equivalent to dead, 1 is a full healthy outcome, and negative indicates a health state worse than dead. The score is derived from five sections (Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/Depression) scored 1 to 5, with higher corresponding to better outcomes. A second visual analogue score for perceived health is reported from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better perceived overall health.</description>
