  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant advances in molecular nuclear medicine imaging in prostate cancer have been&#xD;
      achieved in recent years. In particular, the introduction of prostate-specific membrane&#xD;
      antigen (PSMA) -based tracers has significantly influenced diagnostic imaging of prostate. If&#xD;
      cancer recurs after surgical removal of the prostate, targeted PSMA PET (positron emission&#xD;
      tomography) can detect metastases even at very low PSA (prostate-specific Antigen) values.&#xD;
      This increasingly allows individualized specific therapy of patients with prostate cancer&#xD;
      recurrence. PSMA PET has now been included in national and international guidelines for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially in patients in good general condition, with potentially longer life expectancy and&#xD;
      early localized PSA recurrence, advances in molecular imaging are increasingly turning local&#xD;
      therapy concepts into focus. Here both, radiotherapeutic (salvage radiotherapy of the&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage) and surgical interventions (salvage lymph node dissection = removal of&#xD;
      the pelvic lymph nodes) are offered on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These regional therapies mainly aim to achieve a delay of further progression of the prostate&#xD;
      cancer disease, and thus delay the initiation of palliative, sustained drug therapy. Previous&#xD;
      standard or common practice at salvage lymph node dissection is the removal on both sides of&#xD;
      the pelvic lymph nodes even if only one-sided suspicious lymph nodes are detected on imaging.&#xD;
      Although the complications of salvage lymph node dissection are usually minor and manageable,&#xD;
      they can still lead to impaired lymphatic drainage, leg edema, lymphocele formation or other&#xD;
      surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether a unilateral pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection on the side of conspicuous PSMA PET is sufficient and a dissection on the&#xD;
      contralateral side can be dispensed without negatively impacting oncological outcomes and&#xD;
      thereby sparing the patient the potential additional complications of a bilateral pelvic&#xD;
      lymph node dissection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized study, patients with early biochemical recurrence after&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy and with PSMA-PET positive unilateral pelvic metastatic lesions are&#xD;
      assessed as to whether unilateral and bilateral salvage lymph node dissection are&#xD;
      oncologically equivalent. For this, the following endpoints will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete biochemical response (cBR: PSA &lt;0.2ng /ml) after salvage lymph node dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biochemical freedom from recurrence without further prostate-cancer-specific therapy&#xD;
           (time from salvage lymph node dissection to first PSA value&gt; 0.2ng / ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prostate cancer-specific therapy-free time (time from salvage lymph node dissection to&#xD;
           initiation of prostate cancer specific therapy) In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
           the preoperative PSMA PET, which led to the indication of salvage lymph node dissection,&#xD;
           is to be investigated in the context of the study and the standardized one- or two-sided&#xD;
           template lymph node dissection. Furthermore, it should be investigated whether there is&#xD;
           a reduction of surgery-associated side effects in patients undergoing unilateral salvage&#xD;
           lymph node dissection. In addition, quality of life and psychological stress of patients&#xD;
           is systematically recorded by means of validated questionnaires. Since salvage lymph&#xD;
           node dissection may also be carried out with the help of currently experimental&#xD;
           preoperative labeling with PSMA ligands for easier intraoperative localization (PSMA&#xD;
           radioguided surgery), a comparison of conventional salvage surgery and the PSMA&#xD;
           radioguided surgery is also planned. However, if applied to patients, PSMA radioguided&#xD;
           surgery is performed outside of the study protocol and is explicitly not part of the&#xD;
           study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case there is no complete biochemical response (cBR, PSA &lt;0.2ng / ml) or, after reaching&#xD;
      cBR, a further increase in PSA above 0.2ng / ml threshold is observed after salvage lymph&#xD;
      node dissection, an attempt should be made to localize recurrence disease using PSMA PET.&#xD;
      This should provide indirect information as to whether re-irradiation following salvage lymph&#xD;
      node dissection could be a useful approach and should be investigated in future studies.&#xD;
      However, PSMA PET is recommended in the study, but is optional and therefore to be performed&#xD;
      outside of the study protocol.&#xD;
