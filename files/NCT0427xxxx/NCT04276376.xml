        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed progressive metastatic or&#xD;
             recurrent solid tumor (as defined below for each tumor type). Diagnosis must be stated&#xD;
             in a pathology report and confirmed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Representative archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in&#xD;
        paraffin blocks (preferred) or 20 freshly cut and unstained slides, with an associated&#xD;
        pathology report, for ancillary studies and central testing, is mandatory for all cohorts.&#xD;
        In all cases, recovery of the most recent tumor block or biopsy is encouraged and tumor&#xD;
        tissue has to date back from less than 3 years ago. If tumor tissue is more than 3 years&#xD;
        old, a fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory for cohorts 1, 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        o Specificities for Cohorts 1A-D:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with DNA repair gene mutation already identified by local testing,&#xD;
             mutational testing must have been done less than one year prior to inclusion in the&#xD;
             trial (i.e. signing of informed consent). Tumor block should correspond to the one&#xD;
             that has been used for the original testing. If more recent blocks are available,&#xD;
             these should be provided for ancillary studies, and the presence of the mutation of&#xD;
             interest should be confirmed on these.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If no archival tissue is available or if tumor tissue is more than 3 years old,&#xD;
             feasibility of a fresh tumor biopsy at baseline (C0D1 pre-dose) should be ensured and&#xD;
             mutation confirmed on that tissue for cohorts 1A, 1B and 1D. Only tissue from core&#xD;
             needle, punch or excisional biopsy sample collection will be accepted. Other methods&#xD;
             such as fine-needle aspiration, brushing, bone tissue or lavage samples are not&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone biopsies are allowed for mCRPC (cohort 1C), if sufficient tumor cellularity can&#xD;
             be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Specificity for cohort 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If no archival tumor biopsy is available, a new fresh biopsy should be done prior to&#xD;
             treatment start (C0D1 pre-dose) whenever feasible; otherwise, any archival tumor&#xD;
             tissue will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Core or excisional biopsy from soft tissue or a bone biopsy is required from a site&#xD;
             not previously irradiated (samples from tumors progressing in a prior site of&#xD;
             radiation are allowed; other exceptions may be considered after Sponsor consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Measurable disease, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the non-prostate cohorts: At least one lesion, not previously irradiated,&#xD;
             measurable according to RECIST v1.1 as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph&#xD;
             nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) and suitable for repeated assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For prostate cohorts: At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, measurable&#xD;
             according to RECIST v1.1 and / or bone scan measurable disease (Cf inclusion criteria&#xD;
             4) and / or measurable disease according to Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3&#xD;
             (PCWG3) 7. Agreement of the patient to sign the genetic analysis consent form for&#xD;
             access to plasma samples for ctDNA analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with no&#xD;
             deterioration from registration date.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Estimated life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks. 10. Adequate hematologic and&#xD;
             organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 3 days&#xD;
             prior to the first study treatment (Cycle 0 Day 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/μL (without granulocyte&#xD;
                  colony-stimulating factor support within 2 weeks before cycle 0 day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100.000/μL (without transfusion within 2 weeks before Cycle 0&#xD;
                  Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL (patients may be transfused or receive erythropoietic&#xD;
                  treatment to meet this criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN (subjects with documented/suspected Gilbert's disease&#xD;
                  or liver metastases may be enrolled with bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper&#xD;
                  normal limit (ULN) or ≤ 5 × ULN in case of liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Albumin ≥ 28g/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 40mL/min (according to&#xD;
                  Cockroft and Gault formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
                  (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN. This applies only to patients who do not receive therapeutic&#xD;
                  anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (such as&#xD;
                  low-molecular weight heparin or warfarin) should be on stable dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy&#xD;
                  test within 7 days prior to the administration of the first study treatment 12.&#xD;
                  Sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly&#xD;
                  effective method of contraception &lt;&lt; supplemented by a barrier method &gt;&gt;, or to&#xD;
                  abstain from sexual activity during the study and for at least 6 months after the&#xD;
                  last study treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  13. Sexually active males patients must agree to use condom during the study and&#xD;
                  for at least 6 months after the last study treatment administration. Also, it is&#xD;
                  recommended their women of childbearing potential partner use a highly effective&#xD;
                  method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A woman is considered of childbearing potential following menarche and until becoming&#xD;
        post-menopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) unless permanently sterile.&#xD;
        Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and bilateral&#xD;
        salpingectomy. A highly effective birth control method is a one which can achieve a failure&#xD;
        rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:&#xD;
        combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) hormonal contraception; progestogen-only&#xD;
        hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine device (IUD);&#xD;
        intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal occlusion; vasectomized&#xD;
        partner (on the understanding that this is the only one partner during the whole study&#xD;
        duration), and sexual abstinence during the entire period of risk associated with study&#xD;
        treatment. To prevent the risk of interaction between the study drug and hormonal&#xD;
        contraceptives, hormonal contraceptives should be supplemented with a barrier method&#xD;
        (preferably male condom). Following methods are considered as unacceptable methods&#xD;
        (non-exhaustive list): periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
        methods) and withdrawal (coitus interruptus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        14. Patient should understand, sign, and date the written informed consent form prior to&#xD;
        any protocol-specific procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        15. Patient should be able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures as per&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        16. Patients must be affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of an equivalent&#xD;
        system.&#xD;
