  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every day the cells of the outer layer of skin die off, shed, and regenerate. When young,&#xD;
      skin cells turn over quickly, but that turnover rate begins to slow with age, beginning as&#xD;
      early as twenties. As a result, skin loses its luster and begins to look dull. Aging caused&#xD;
      by the genes is inherited and is called intrinsic (internal) aging. The other type of aging&#xD;
      is known as extrinsic (external) aging and is caused by environmental factors, such as&#xD;
      exposure to the sun's rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin ageing is mainly characterized by -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decrease in thickness, firmness &amp; elasticity of skin which results in wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction in antioxidant capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Formation of spider veins and dark circles under the eyes. This study is proposed to&#xD;
           evaluate skin antiaging efficacy along with the brightening attributes on face by visual&#xD;
           assessment by Dermatologist, image analysis using VISIA CR, skin elasticity by Cutometer&#xD;
           (MPA580) Hydration by Corneometer and skin texture by Antera 3 D and skin&#xD;
           lightening/fairness by spectrophotometer, water barrier function by TEWL and to skin pH&#xD;
           level by pH meter.&#xD;

      Every day the cells of the outer layer of skin die off, shed, and regenerate. When young,&#xD;

&#xD;
      Skin ageing is mainly characterized by -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decrease in thickness, firmness &amp; elasticity of skin which results in wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction in antioxidant capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Formation of spider veins and dark circles under the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissues are the top, middle and bottom layers of the&#xD;
      skin respectively. The top layer shows the wrinkles, age spots, deep lines, and depressions.&#xD;
      The skin dermis contains macromolecules, polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), fibrous&#xD;
      protein (collagens, elastin), salts and water which together are known as the extra cellular&#xD;
      matrix, responsible for tissue cohesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subcutaneous tissues contain fatty deposits. Another part of the skin is the sebaceous&#xD;
      glands that produce sebum which lubricates the skin and keeps it soft and smooth. All three&#xD;
      skin layers contribute to the aging process. As a person gets older, less sebum is produced,&#xD;
      and this makes the epidermis drier. Dry skin is more prone to wrinkling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of ageing include facial wrinkles, pigmentation, fine lines, crow's feet and Nasolabial&#xD;
      folds. Ageing also impacts texture and elasticity of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin lightening or skin brightening, refer to the application of topical products in an&#xD;
      attempt to lighten skin tone and provide an even skin complexion by reduction in melanin. The&#xD;
      glow is not dependent on the skin colour of the person, i.e. a darker skin tone person can&#xD;
      have very good Skin Glow. However, pigmentation errors like uneven skin tone, blemishes,&#xD;
      blotchiness and spots also results in varied reflectance of light from the skin surface and&#xD;
      results in dullness of the skin. It is also known that skin hydration, skin texture and&#xD;
      pigmentation concerns can impact the skin glow. This study is based on evaluating Skin glow&#xD;
      based on the relationship of these attributes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is proposed to evaluate skin antiaging efficacy along with the brightening&#xD;
      attributes on face by visual assessment by Dermatologist, image analysis using VISIA CR, skin&#xD;
      elasticity by Cutometer (MPA580) Hydration by Corneometer and skin texture by Antera 3 D and&#xD;
      skin lightening/fairness by spectrophotometer, water barrier function by TEWL and to skin pH&#xD;
      level by pH meter.&#xD;
