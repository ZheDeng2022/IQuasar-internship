  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goals are to characterize the effects of maternal obesity during pregnancy on infant&#xD;
      brain development, reveal the neurodevelopmental consequences, and identify possible&#xD;
      mechanisms causing these effects. Our overall hypothesis is that maternal obesity during&#xD;
      pregnancy exposes the fetus to an inflammatory environment that affects infant brain&#xD;
      structural and functional development and consequently neurodevelopmental outcomes. To test&#xD;
      this hypothesis, the investigators will recruit normal-weight and obese pregnant women,&#xD;
      examine inflammatory markers associated with obese pregnancy, and correlate them with&#xD;
      offspring's brain development evaluated using quantitative MRI methods and outcomes evaluated&#xD;
      using neurodevelopmental tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About one third of all women of reproductive age in the US are obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥&#xD;
      30). Recent studies show that children born to mothers who were obese while pregnant may have&#xD;
      lower cognitive performance and higher risk of developing neurodevelopmental conditions. The&#xD;
      goal of this study is to see 1) if there are negative effects of maternal obesity during&#xD;
      pregnancy on newborn's brain development; 2) if these effects on brain development persist to&#xD;
      age 1 &amp; 2 years, and if there are changes in neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with&#xD;
      maternal obesity; and 3) if inflammation in pregnant women associated with maternal obesity&#xD;
      is one of the main reasons for the brain changes in offspring. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      pregnant women from early pregnancy who are either obese or normal weight and are otherwise&#xD;
      healthy. The Investigators will measure their weight, body fat percentage, blood inflammation&#xD;
      markers, family environment, what the participants normally eat, how much physical activity&#xD;
      the participants usually have, and other characteristics during pregnancy. When their babies&#xD;
      are born, the investigators will evaluate the brain development of their babies use magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (during natural sleep) at age two weeks and again at age 1&amp;2 years. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure the neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 2 years. Then compare&#xD;
      the findings to see if there are group differences in these measures between babies born to&#xD;
      normal-weight and obese mothers, if other parameters measured at pregnancy also play a role,&#xD;
      and if inflammation markers during pregnancy strongly correlate with infant brain development&#xD;
      and neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;

        We will recruit 160 pregnant women (N=75 for normal weight, BMI 18.5-25, and N=85 for&#xD;
        obese, BMI 30-50) at &lt;12 weeks of pregnancy. The goal is to obtain neuroimaging data from&#xD;

        all children at age 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
