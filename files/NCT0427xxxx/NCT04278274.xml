  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators seek for a better way to identify the potential pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) patients form non-pCR patients with locally advanced rectal cancer&#xD;
      (LARC), based on their post-neoadjuvant treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, a post neoadjuvant treatment MRI based radiomics AI model had been constructed&#xD;
      and trained. Here, the predictive power of this artificial intelligence system and expert&#xD;
      radiologist to identify pCR patients from non-pCR LARC patients will be compared in this&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter, back-to-back clinical study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational clinical study for seeking out a better way&#xD;
      to predict the pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer (LARC) based on the post-neoadjuvant treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.&#xD;
      Patients who have been pathologically diagnosed as rectal adenocarcinoma and defined as&#xD;
      clinical II-III stage will be enrolled from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen&#xD;
      University, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical&#xD;
      College. All participants should follow a standard treatment protocol, including neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, total mesorectum excision (TME) surgery. Patients with LARC who received&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment will be enrolled and their post-neoadjuvant treatment MRI images will&#xD;
      be used to predict their pathologic response (pCR vs. non-pCR). The artificial intelligence&#xD;
      prediction system and the expert radiologist will define the pathologic response as pCR or&#xD;
      non-pCR, respectively. The pathologist will provide the final pathology report of TME surgery&#xD;
      specimen (pCR or non-pCR) as a standard. The predictive efficacy of these two back-to-back&#xD;
      approaches generated will be compared in this multicenter, prospective clinical study.&#xD;
