      calf is safe and effective in the treatment of critical limb ischemia&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Management of CLI process consumes a significant amount of healthcare resources,and the new&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to be a potent angiogenic growth factor&#xD;
      stimulating the growth of endothelial cells and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.&#xD;
      Because of its pluripotent capabilities, increasing the availability of HGF in ischemic&#xD;
      tissues to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis has been a growing area of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use NL003, which is a DNA plasmid that contains novel genomic cDNA hybrid&#xD;
      human HGF coding sequence (HGF-X7) expressing two isoforms of HGF, HGF 728 and HGF 723. As&#xD;
      there are currently no approved drugs that can reverse CLI and as most patients have&#xD;
      exhausted surgical and endovascular intervention options, inducing angiogenesis in the&#xD;
      affected limb with NL003 may result in an increase in tissue perfusion, which, in turn&#xD;
      improve wound healing, reduce pain and improve limb salvage rates.&#xD;
