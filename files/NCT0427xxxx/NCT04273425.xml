  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the survival expectancy of myeloma patients continues increasing due to the discovery&#xD;
      of novel treatments, bone pain remains one of the main symptoms of this patient population,&#xD;
      impairing their mood and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to characterize the subjective experience of pain in myeloma&#xD;
      patients, and its correlation with disturbances in serum biomarkers and bone innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How is the bone pain experienced by myeloma patients (intensity, location and type of pain)&#xD;
      and how does it affect their quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do myeloma cells induce changes in the density and/or location of nerve fibres innervating&#xD;
      the bone, and if so, are these correlated to the pain experience?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are the alterations in the bone innervation of myeloma patients similar to those of&#xD;
      immunocompetent animal models of the disease (the 5TGM1 model)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is serum paraprotein correlated with the subjective experience of myeloma-induced bone pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are the bone turnover biomarkers (C-terminal telopeptides Type 1 collagen, CTX, and&#xD;
      procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, P1NP) and inflammatory serum biomarkers correlated&#xD;
      with the subjective experience of myeloma-induced bone pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do myeloma cells affect the location, number or density of bone cells (e.g. osteoblasts,&#xD;
      osteoclasts)?&#xD;

      Patients undergoing diagnostic procedures (i.e. trephine bone biopsy) for suspected multiple&#xD;
      myeloma will be invited to participate in the study, and provided with time to consider their&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent will be provided with a set of seven standardized questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing their pain, quality of life and catastrophizing. Additionally, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be asked to donate a fasting blood sample and give permission to the&#xD;
      research team to retrieve their triphane bone biopsy, once the medical team has finished&#xD;
      evaluating it. The presence, location and density of nerve fibres innervating the bone will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Patients will also be consented to allow retrieval of medical information from&#xD;
      their medical records, and correlations between serum biomarkers, disturbances in bone&#xD;
      innervation, paraprotein levels, etc. and their self-reported experience of pain will be&#xD;
      investigated. Patients with a negative diagnosis for multiple myeloma (expectably monoclonal&#xD;
      gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) patients) will be used as negative controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive a positive diagnosis for multiple myeloma will be asked to fill in the&#xD;
      same set of questionnaires upon completion of the first-line treatment (approximately 7 to 8&#xD;
      months after baseline assessment). Fasting serum blood samples will be collected. To evaluate&#xD;
      treatmentÂ´s success, it is common medical practice to extract a new trephine bone biopsy upon&#xD;
      completion of first line treatment. The research team will access these biopsies and evaluate&#xD;
      the presence, density and location of nerve fibres in bone. Changes in nerve fibre profiles,&#xD;
      serum biomarkers and the self-reported experience of pain, quality of life and&#xD;
      catastrophizing following first-line treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;
