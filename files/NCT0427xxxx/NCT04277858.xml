    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to study the efficacy of treatment of human papilloma virus&#xD;
      (HPV) related oropharyngeal cancer with chemotherapy followed by Transoral Robotic Surgery&#xD;
      (TORS) as definitive treatment. Current treatment of oropharyngeal cancer are&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy. There is significant lifelong side effects associated with this approach&#xD;
      related to tissue effects of radiotherapy. The side effects results in significant quality of&#xD;
      life deterioration among the patients. Overall there is 20% failure rate with this treatment&#xD;
      approach. The study hypothesis is that treatment with upfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by transoral surgery and neck dissection is highly effective treatment allowing&#xD;
      competitive cure rate compared to chemo-radiotherapy with less than 10% failure rate, while&#xD;
      avoiding radiotherapy in majority of cases. It is also hypothesized that better functional&#xD;
      and quality of life outcome maybe achieved with this approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for advanced (AJCC-7 edition stage III and IV) oropharyngeal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma are concomitant chemoradiation, or surgery followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      radiation therapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy. These approaches have persistent&#xD;
      and significant lifelong side effects and sequelae related to treatment, and in particular&#xD;
      related to radiotherapy. The side effects of radiotherapy (augmented with concomitant&#xD;
      chemotherapy) include soft tissue fibrosis, loss of salivary function, dry mouth, life long&#xD;
      disturbed taste function, poor dental health with rapidly decaying teeth, dysfunction of&#xD;
      swallowing, significant loss of the mobility of the base of tongue and pharyngeal&#xD;
      constrictors, loss of laryngeal elevation, esophageal stricture, and at times severe side&#xD;
      effects such as soft tissue necrosis or osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. About 10% of the&#xD;
      patients undergoing chemoradiation for oropharyngeal cancer develop long term swallowing&#xD;
      dysfunction with feeding tube dependency. As a result , patient's quality of life (QOL) is&#xD;
      adversely affected. Improvements in the side effect profile of treatment, the functional&#xD;
      outcome, and the QOL remain very important areas of advancement in treating this patient&#xD;
      population. Improvements in functional outcome need to be achieved while maintaining or&#xD;
      improving the oncologic outcome and cure rates for cancer, compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Taxane based chemotherapy along with Platinum drugs (Cisplatin and Carboplatin) in&#xD;
      high dose neoadjuvant setting, coupled with Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) or Transoral&#xD;
      Robotic Assisted Surgery (TORS), allows potential for improved oncologic outcome as well as&#xD;
      avoidance of long term sequelae of high dose radiation therapy to head and neck. These&#xD;
      transoral surgical approaches (TLM and TORS) provide improved functional outcome compared&#xD;
      with traditional open composite resections and complex reconstructive algorithms for&#xD;
      oropharynx. TLM and TORS are currently in clinical use for early (stage T1 and T2 with N0 or&#xD;
      N+ve) oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-escalation treatment strategies of TORS followed by adjuvant radiotherapy are being&#xD;
      investigated currently. However even without de-escalation there is overall 18-20% rate of&#xD;
      treatment failure and half of failures are due to distant metastasis in the absence of&#xD;
      loco-regional recurrence. In this study the investigators propose systemic escalation of&#xD;
      treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel and cisplatin) followed by de-escalated&#xD;
      locoregional treatment with transoral surgery and neck dissection reserving radiotherapy for&#xD;
      salvage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach has the potential for improved functional outcome by avoiding short and more&#xD;
      importantly long term and permanent sequelae of radiation therapy in oropharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      treatment. This approach is a new paradigm in treatment of oropharyngeal cancer, and can&#xD;
      significantly improve the functional outcome of cancer treatment.&#xD;
