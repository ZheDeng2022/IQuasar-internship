      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes has a prevalence of 11.6% in China with diabetic foot ulcerations affecting over 30&#xD;
      million Chinese. 85% of these patients require amputation and 5-year mortality for diabetics&#xD;
      is 70% when associated foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials have shown that standing on whole-body vibration platforms, specifically&#xD;
      low-magnitude high-frequency vibration (LMHFV); promotes angiogenesis, enhances muscle bulk&#xD;
      and accelerates epithelization. Investigation on diabetic rats with foot wounds found&#xD;
      accelerated wound healing, increased perfusion and upregulation of factors such as VEGF,&#xD;
      PECAM-1 and PCNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate LMHFV will enhance diabetic foot ulcer healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single-centre, randomised control trial to treat 106 subjects with diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will stand on LMHFV whole-body vibration platforms for 20min on&#xD;
      alternate days for 20 weeks, together with conventional dressing by a trained wound-care&#xD;
      nurse as in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcer size will be measured at multiple time points, the incidence of amputations/infections&#xD;
      will be recorded, perfusion via ankle-brachial pressure index will be calculated and foot&#xD;
      function via the foot and ankle outcome score will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measure of ANOVA to analyze time-point differences and student's t-test for same&#xD;
      time-point comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first clinical trial to investigate the effect of whole-body vibration on&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers. It will show the investigators if the results from animal studies will&#xD;
      translate into clinically significant results. If positive effects are established,&#xD;
      whole-body vibration can be a valuable treatment regime to tackle diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;

      Plan of Investigation: (fig 04 in supplementary notes, CONSORT diagram)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the patients in the Orthopaedic &amp; Traumatology department&#xD;
      at the Prince of Wales Hospital, the tertiary teaching hospital affiliated to CUHK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 106 subjects randomized 1:1 into the two treatment groups accounting for a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated by using the primary endpoint of wound size in G*Power 3.1.9.4&#xD;
      (Germany). Using a 1:1 randomization ratio a type I error rate (a-level) of 0.05 and power of&#xD;
      0.95. Our vibration study of diabetic rat wounds showed an effect size d of 0.99. We estimate&#xD;
      a tuned-down effect in human subjects, thus using an effect size of 0.7 we calculated that we&#xD;
      should recruit 90 participants with 45 in each group. (22)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial 1:1 randomization into control n=58 or intervention (Vibration)&#xD;
      group n=58. Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: conventional dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibration group: conventional dressing + LMHFV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation performed using computer-generated randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio&#xD;
      using permuted block randomization to ensure similar numbers in the control and vibration&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance to intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional dressing: Each attendance to wound dressing will be recorded by the clinic&#xD;
      nurse; those with &lt;60% attendance to the wound clinic will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LMHFV Vibration: each participant in the vibration intervention group will be assigned a&#xD;
      personal 'smart card'. This smart card will record each utilization of the vibration platform&#xD;
      to ensure compliance, those with &lt;66% attendance will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures of ANOVA will be used to analyze the ulcer size groups and time points&#xD;
      differences with be analyzed with post-hoc Bonferroni tests. Student's t-test for two&#xD;
      independent samples will be used to compare groups of the same time point. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), and statistical&#xD;
      significance was considered at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>• The measurement of the ABI will be standardized. (24) The subject will be at rest in supine position for 10mins, Doppler ultrasound to measure systolic blood pressure twice in the posterior tibial artery (If there is no obtainable signal in the posterior tibial artery, the dorsalis pedis will be used.), the average systolic blood pressure in the posterior tibial artery/dorsalis pedis divided by the higher of the SBP in the two arms will be used to calculate the ABI. (The higher SBP of the arm will be used in these calculations due to previous studies showing a strong association between peripheral arterial disease and subclavian stenosis)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot function</measure>
    <time_frame>0weeks, 20weeks</time_frame>
    <description>• Foot function will be measured using the FAOS which is a variant of the KOOS specific for problems related to the foot and ankle region. The FAOS also has validated translations in English and Chinese; it is a questionnaire consisting of 5 Likert score subscales; Pain, Symptoms, ADL, Recreation and Foot related QOL. Answers are graded a score from 0-4 and a normalised score can be calculated for each subscale (100 is asymptomatic while 0 indicates extreme symptoms).</description>
