  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Anlotinib&#xD;
      wiht Toripalimab in advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer as first-line&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit. Toripalimab is a humanized&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory&#xD;
      human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (programmed death-1; PD-1), with&#xD;
      potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. In the present study,&#xD;
      we design a single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the combination of Anlotinib wiht Toripalimab in advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal&#xD;
      junction cancer as first-line treatment.&#xD;
