  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that ovaries of women with a history of poor response to&#xD;
      ovulation induction may benefit from exposure to growth factors known to be present in&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP). Since even ovaries from women with poor response still contain&#xD;
      primordial follicles (which, however, no longer undergo recruitment), it is hoped that PRP&#xD;
      injections into ovaries will activate follicular recruitment pathways and, subsequently,&#xD;
      result in follicle growth. Should such growth be observed, follicles will be supported with&#xD;
      routine daily gonadotropin stimulation until hCG trigger.&#xD;

      The hypothesis of the study is that ovaries of women with a history of poor response to&#xD;
      ovulation induction may benefit from exposure to growth factors known to be present in PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (A-PRP) is plasma with a concentration of platelets above the&#xD;
      blood baseline. A-PRP is developed from autologous blood. Within A-PRP, the concentration of&#xD;
      platelets delivers an increased number of growth factors. In this study A-PRP will be&#xD;
      prepared using Regen Lab PRP Kit which is approved by US-FDA for preparation of PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP is becoming widely used in a variety of medical procedures seeking tissue remodeling&#xD;
      and/or healing as an intervention. To date, applications in orthopedics, wound healing,&#xD;
      dermatology and plastic surgery have gained general acceptance, primarily as the role of&#xD;
      platelets and their activation in tissue repair and recovery has become better understood at&#xD;
      a cellular and molecular level. This knowledge base provides a foundation for the present&#xD;
      study because of the ready availability of FDA-approved kits for autologous PRP preparations&#xD;
      and the recognition that the aging ovary acquires tissue pathologies in the form of wound&#xD;
      healing and fibrosis as a result of repeat ovulations over the reproductive lifespan of&#xD;
      women. Since PRP is an autologous blood product, and is widely used via injection into&#xD;
      various organs and tissues, safety concerns are minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve only adult women with a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve. All&#xD;
      consenting participants will receive injections of autologous Platelet RIch Plasma (A-PRP) in&#xD;
      both ovaries under ultrasound guidance performed after induction of IV sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumption of this study is that in women with previous poor response to ovulation induction&#xD;
      will show limited follicle growth. The study will try to estimate effect of PRP on this&#xD;
      condition by comparing post-PRP response to the previous response. The investigators&#xD;
      recognize that there will be a possibility of apparent response based on regression to the&#xD;
      mean. The investigators expect that study of fifty patients should be enough to determine if&#xD;
      there is a potential clinical effect and to allow estimation of that effect for power&#xD;
      calculations for future studies.&#xD;
