      Spending time on intensive care can affect people in many different ways. Ability to move,&#xD;
      walk, concentrate and remember events can all be affected. People may find their mood is&#xD;
      altered and anxiety, stress and reduced confidence are common. These symptoms are frequently&#xD;
      grouped together in a term called 'post intensive care syndrome'. Recovery often takes time&#xD;
      and can be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Returning to driving is an important milestone and can enable individuals to return to&#xD;
      important activities such as work and hobbies. As a complex task, driving requires&#xD;
      individuals to do many things at once which initially can be demanding. Currently there is&#xD;
      limited guidance about driving after a period of time on intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being carried out to increase understanding of driving difficulties after a&#xD;
      stay on intensive care and how successful and safe return to driving can be ensured. It is&#xD;
      known that a stay on intensive care can have many effects on the body but currently the best&#xD;
      advice to give to patients about returning to drive is unknown. The investigators would like&#xD;
      to gather information on how many people do and do not return to driving and the reasons for&#xD;
      this so people can be provided with more accurate information in the future. Additionally, it&#xD;
      is important to find out if the driving assessment is practical and achievable for&#xD;
      individuals who have had a stay on intensive care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recovery from critical illness is often prolonged and challenging due to a combination of&#xD;
      acquired physical, psychological and cognitive impairments, which have been termed Post&#xD;
      Intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments are common, slow to recover and have&#xD;
      cumulative effects on patients' personal, social and financial wellbeing. An increasing&#xD;
      awareness and recognition of PICS has prompted commitments to enhance multidisciplinary&#xD;
      aftercare with the overall goal of improving patient-centred outcomes and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many adult ICU survivors, resumption of driving is perceived as an important milestone in&#xD;
      their recovery pathway. Driving is an advanced task reliant on complex physical and mental&#xD;
      functioning. It also necessitates independence, self-confidence and motivation. As such&#xD;
      clinicians may view the return to driving as an objective marker of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, returning to drive accelerates resumption of &quot;normal life&quot;, enablement of social&#xD;
      interactions, hobbies, leisure activities, and most vitally, returning to work. This is not&#xD;
      only because of its enabling effect on commuting to place of work. Approximately one million&#xD;
      people in the UK are employed primarily as drivers, or are required to drive or operate&#xD;
      motorised vehicles as part of their job. Thus driving after ICU is important for the UK&#xD;
      economy as well as for patients' wellbeing and that of their loved ones. Reducing avoidable&#xD;
      delay to driving ought therefore to be viewed as a low-cost high-impact intervention to&#xD;
      enhance health-related quality of life.&#xD;
