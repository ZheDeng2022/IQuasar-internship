    <textblock>
      Randomized coomparative trial of a 30% solution of ascorbic acid in 95% dimethylsulfoxide&#xD;
      applied topically twice a day for 8 weeks vs 5% imiquimod cream in the treatment biopsy&#xD;
      proven basal cell carcinomas inotherwise healthy adult patients. Outcome measure was biopsy&#xD;
      proven resolution of the carcinoma.&#xD;

      Importance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, with more people diagnosed each&#xD;
      year than all other cancers combined (1). Basal cell cancer is the most common form with an&#xD;
      estimated 4.3 million cases diagnosed annually (2,3). Costs of treating this cancer in the&#xD;
      U.S. are estimated at $4.8 billion annually (4). Task force consensus guidelines suggest Mohs&#xD;
      surgery as the treatment of choice, and as the single most precise and effective treatment&#xD;
      method (5). However, cost and issues of cosmesis are principal disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate efficacy of a therapeutic regimen in treating basal cell cancer, consisting of&#xD;
      30% ascorbic acid in 95% dimethylsulfoxide topically applied at home by patients twice a day&#xD;
      for 8 weeks, vs 5% imiquimod cream which is an FDA approved treatment for BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Setting, and Participants This study was carried out in accordance with principles of&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki. Detailed informed consent was obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants of any age had histologically confirmed primary, previously untreated,&#xD;
      nodular or superficial BCC not arising at sites of high risk for sub clinical tumor spread&#xD;
      (the nose, ear, eyelid, eyebrow, or temple ( )). Patients with infiltrative, recurrent, or&#xD;
      morphoeic BCC were excluded from the study. Imiquimod was applied once daily for 5 days per&#xD;
      week as per manufacturer instructions for treatment of BCC. Patients were randomly assigned&#xD;
      to treatment group. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment protocol.&#xD;
      Patients were seen at initial visit, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and six weeks after treatment&#xD;
      conclusion for final biopsy. Those participants in the IMQ group who continued through 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment were seen for an additional visit. The AA treatment was a solution while&#xD;
      the IMQ a cream, however participants were simply told they would be receiving a topical&#xD;
      treatment with instructions on how to apply, thus the blinding remained intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathology showed 21 nodular and 8 superficial BCC subtypes upon enrollment. Thirteen&#xD;
      patients (8 female 5 male) with a total of 15 lesions were randomized to the ascorbic acid&#xD;
      (AA) treatment group, and 12 patients (6 female 6 male) with 14 lesions were randomized to&#xD;
      the imiquimod group (IMQ). There was no difference in mean size of BCC in each group ( 11.4&#xD;
      +/-2.1 mm vs. 13.1 +/- 1.9mm). The AA group had 11 nodular and 4 superficial BCC and the IMQ&#xD;
      group 10 nodular and 4 superficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathology was confirmed by 2mm partial punch biopsy leaving&#xD;
&#xD;
      the bulk of the BCC intact prior to treatment. Patients in the AA group were treated&#xD;
&#xD;
      twice daily 7 days per week with a topical solution of 30% (w/v) ascorbic acid solution in&#xD;
      95% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and&#xD;
&#xD;
      5% (v/v) distilled water, while the IMQ patients received twice daily application of a&#xD;
      commercial 5% cream 5 days per week according to manufacturer recommendations for treatment&#xD;
      of BCC. Application was made with a small cuticle brush in the AA group. Patient compliance&#xD;
      was high and no&#xD;
&#xD;
      patient had difficulty with the application. Volume of the ascorbic acid solution applied was&#xD;
      0.2-0.3ml per application. Treatment was&#xD;
&#xD;
      continued for 8 wks or until the lesion cleared. Subjects in the IMQ group whose lesions had&#xD;
      failed to resolve at 8 weeks were treated for an additional 4 weeks in conformity with&#xD;
      reports showing better outcomes with 12 weeks of treatment with IMQ ( ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had an appointment set for Mohs surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      after study enrollment, so in the event of treatment failure no further delay in definitive&#xD;
      treatment would occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat 2mm punch biopsy of each site was taken at the conclusion of the study. Patients were&#xD;
      seen in follow up after&#xD;
&#xD;
      12, 24, and 30 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8 wk therapeutic regimen of topical 30% (w/v) ascorbic acid, 95% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide,&#xD;
      and 5% (v/v) distilled water applied twice daily at home, or 5% imiquimod cream applied 5/wk&#xD;
      according to manufacturer recommendations for treating BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcomes and Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of lesions out that were cancer free after 8 wks of treatment.&#xD;
