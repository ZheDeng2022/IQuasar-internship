  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major health problem leading to&#xD;
      significant morbidity and even mortality. Patients with superficial femoral artery stenosis&#xD;
      make up an important proportion of patients with PAD, and since this type of involvement was&#xD;
      reported to be most commonly associated with intermittent claudication, this patient&#xD;
      population has been subject to intensive research on methods to prevent disease progression&#xD;
      and further complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular treatment has become the first-line treatment for low-complexity femoropopliteal&#xD;
      (FP) lesions classified as TASC (Trans Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus) A and B.&#xD;
      Conversely, in case of more extensive lesions (TASC C), this treatment is still under debate&#xD;
      because of a primary permeability that is difficult to maintain over time. Recently, studies&#xD;
      have shown the interest of drug eluting technologies in the treatment of TASC A &amp; B&#xD;
      femoral-popliteal lesions, by significantly improving patency rates compared to uncoated&#xD;
      balloons or stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the endovascular treatment of FP complex lesions (TASC C) continues to&#xD;
      develop widely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During endovascular treatment, the quality of the artery preparation has recently been&#xD;
      identified as a factor improving outcomes. The dilatation of the artery with an uncoated&#xD;
      balloon or POBA (Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty) is the reference method performed before&#xD;
      stent placement or drug-coated balloons. However, some new alternatives to prepare the artery&#xD;
      have emerged, using no more dilatation but atherectomy (Jetstream™ system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherectomy appears to reduce the risk of dissections and bailout stenting and improve the&#xD;
      acute procedural results. Its long term outcome, when associated with drug coated balloons&#xD;
      (DCB), has recently been demonstrated in the USA to be superior to angioplasty in a single&#xD;
      center study JET-SCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of atherectomy,&#xD;
      using the Jetstream™ artery preparation associated to DCB treatment (Ranger™&#xD;
      Paclitaxel-Coated balloon), in symptomatic patients with claudication (Rutherford 2 and 3)&#xD;
      and with complex de novo FP arterial lesions (TASC C).&#xD;
