  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the&#xD;
      population, is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Despite the implication of&#xD;
      inflammation in this excess risk, it remains unclear whether reducing inflammation reduces&#xD;
      the risk of cardiac events. This study proposes to test whether Tildrakizumab, an FDA&#xD;
      approved therapy for psoriasis that blocks IL-23 and the Th17 pathway of inflammation,&#xD;
      improves coronary vascular function and coronary flow reserve, as measured by noninvasive&#xD;
      imaging with cardiac positron emission tomography. In so doing, improvement in coronary&#xD;
      vasoreactivity, endothelial function, and tissue perfusion may have beneficial effects on&#xD;
      myocardial mechanics, left ventricular deformation and function and, ultimately, symptoms and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research may offer novel insights into the contributors of CV risk in psoriasis and&#xD;
      provide data to support the development of strategies to prevent cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      psoriatic disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of Tildrakizumab therapy on&#xD;
      coronary vasoreactivity and myocardial mechanics, as indicators of subclinical cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in patients with psoriatic disease and intermediate-high CV risk. Impaired coronary&#xD;
      flow reserve (CFR) is a measure of coronary vasoreactivity and a manifestation of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia which may precede clinical CV events (and visible changes in plaque morphology) in&#xD;
      high-risk patients with psoriatic disease. From previous studies, it is known that&#xD;
      traditional risk factors underestimate cardiovascular risk in psoriatic disease.&#xD;
      Tildrakizumab, a p19 inhibitor which blocks IL-23 and Th17 mediated inflammation, is an FDA&#xD;
      approved therapy for moderate-severe psoriasis and has been shown to reduce inflammation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, IL-17 is associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that reducing systemic inflammation using tildrakizumab will&#xD;
      quantitatively improve myocardial blood flow and CFR as measured by PET over 6 months; and&#xD;
      this improvement in coronary vasoreactivity, endothelial function, and tissue perfusion may&#xD;
      have beneficial effects on myocardial mechanics, left ventricular function and, ultimately,&#xD;
      symptoms and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm open-label mechanistic clinical study in adult subjects with&#xD;
      moderate-severe psoriasis and increased cardiovascular risk. We plan to enroll approximately&#xD;
      35 patients to receive Tildrakizumab over 6 months. The study will consist of 4-5 visits&#xD;
      including a virtual or in person screening visit, a baseline visit in which baseline imaging&#xD;
      tests will be conducted and study drug will be dispensed, two in person visits for which&#xD;
      study drug will be given and monitoring of AE events and compliance, and a final visit in&#xD;
      visit in which imaging tests will be repeated&#xD;
