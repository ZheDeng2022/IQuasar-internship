    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is responsible for a quarter of all deaths in the UK and risk seems to&#xD;
      be higher in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) with lower body weight which may be due to&#xD;
      sarcopenci obesity (SO) or low muscle mass with high fat mass. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      investigate the prevalence of SO in cardiac populations and investigate teh effect of a high&#xD;
      protein Mediterranean diet with or without resistance exercise on improving lean mass and&#xD;
      reducing risk markers of cardiovascular disease&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the UK is behind 1 in 4 deaths/year (&gt;150,000&#xD;
      people), with coronary heart disease (CHD) being the most common type [1]. In addition to the&#xD;
      loss of life, the economic cost of CVD is considerable; in 2015 healthcare for CVD alone in&#xD;
      the UK amounted to £10.9 billion with a further £7.7 billion lost from the economy due to&#xD;
      productivity loses [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality figures due to CHD have been reduced recently, in part due to increased provision&#xD;
      of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a therapeutic approach based on exercise training to improve&#xD;
      cardiac function, plus advice regarding smoking cessation, dietary changes and weight loss&#xD;
      [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE Most of the evidence on the benefit of CR examines the links between exercise and&#xD;
      CV morbidity and mortality [4]; however, there is considerable evidence showing improvements&#xD;
      in markers of cardiovascular risk through different dietary strategies [5]. Of particular&#xD;
      relevance, results from studies on both the primary and secondary prevention of CVD suggest&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet-based approaches are the most adequate to treat these patients [6-13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, and in particular, visceral adiposity, is associated with cardiometabolic (CM) risk&#xD;
      markers (e.g., high cholesterol and triglycerides levels, HbA1c, etc.) [14-16], however, an&#xD;
      &quot;obesity paradox&quot; appears to exist in the cardiac population, where increased mortality has&#xD;
      been linked to low body mass index (BMI) [17, 18]. However, low lean body mass (LBM) is the&#xD;
      likely driver of this phenomenon due to sarcopenia, a progressive loss of LBM associated with&#xD;
      aging [19]. Patients with a combination of low LBM and abdominal distribution of body fat,&#xD;
      known as sarcopenic obesity (SO), are at greater risk of CVD, exacerbated in CR [20-23].&#xD;
      Thus, increasing relative LBM content, rather than simply promoting weight loss, may be an&#xD;
      appropriate target in CR patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One particular barrier to maintaining or accruing LBM is the presence of anabolic resistance&#xD;
      in older adults, which can result in a reduced muscle protein synthetic (MPS) response to&#xD;
      both exercise and the ingestion of currently recommended intakes of protein [24]. Protein&#xD;
      intakes above currently recommended levels (1.0-1.5 g/kg/BW) [25] combined with sufficiently&#xD;
      intense resistance training [26] can overcome this anabolic resistance and positively&#xD;
      influence muscle mass, ultimately leading to greater improvement in body composition, when&#xD;
      accompanied by a reduction in total body fat mass [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION The investigators aim to determine the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity in&#xD;
      a CR population and how this body composition relates to markers of cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
      As there is no consensus definition of SO, multiple definitions, along with their&#xD;
      relationship with CM risk markers, will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate to what extent a high-protein Mediterranean-style diet&#xD;
      and resistance exercise, alone and in combination, can augment LBM. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators will ascertain whether the above interventions improve markers of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will conduct a feasibility study with embedded pilot to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary data on the practical and clinical considerations and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      proposed interventions, in preparation for an appropriately powered randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial for increasing lean mass and improving cardiometabolic risk markers in patients with&#xD;
      SO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYSIS A single-centre,&#xD;
      cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence of SO in CR patients followed by a single-centre,&#xD;
      2x2 factorial, randomised, open label controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING All participants will be assigned to their group by computer&#xD;
      randomisation by the PhD student. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding will not be&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE ASSESSMENTS STAGE 1: Screening and focus group&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be carried out at LJMU Byrom St campus (L3 3AF) by the PhD student. The visit is expected&#xD;
      to last 30 minutes and will entail:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Assessing body composition. This will be done in three different ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstly, the investigators will measure participant height using a stadiometer and waist&#xD;
           circumference using a tape measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondly, the investigators will use a bioelectrical impedance analysis scale to measure&#xD;
           lean body mass, total body fat mass and visceral fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thirdly, the investigators will perform a DXA (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scan&#xD;
           for 15-20 minutes which allows us to create an image of the distribution of lean body&#xD;
           mass and fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Taking blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Following standard protocol, participants will be asked to sit for 5 minutes before the&#xD;
      investigators take blood pressure; the investigators will measure it three times to ensure an&#xD;
      accurate reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Grip strength test • Will be tested using a device that one squeezes as hard as possible&#xD;
      (grip strength dynamometer). The investigators will do this three times to ensure an accurate&#xD;
      reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Mediterranean Diet Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill in a brief 13-question questionnaire regarding the frequency of&#xD;
           their intake of certain foods (v) Sarcopenia quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill in a brief questionnaire regarding the current impact of&#xD;
           sarcopenia on their quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be invited to attend a focus group to share views and opinions about&#xD;
      food habits and preferences, and about physical activity. This will be carried out at&#xD;
      participants via phone or video call, will take 15-20 minutes and will be recorded and&#xD;
      transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS (IF APPLICABLE) Based on the results from the first visit, approximately 60&#xD;
      patients with lower proportions of muscle mass to fat mass will be asked to take part in the&#xD;
      diet and exercise intervention, which will last 12 weeks. Participants at this stage will be&#xD;
      allocated to one of four groups: 1) standard CR; 2) CR plus personalised advice to follow a&#xD;
      high-protein, healthier diet; 3) CR plus resistance exercise; 4) CR plus diet and resistance&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalised dietary advice: if allocated to groups 2 or 4, the investigators will ask&#xD;
      participants to make changes to their diet to adapt it to a high-protein, Mediterranean-style&#xD;
      diet. Research shows that Mediterranean-style diets can reduce cardiovascular risk, and&#xD;
      although there are different versions of this type of diet, they all have in common:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eating more fruit and vegetables,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reducing commercial pastries, and replacing refined carbohydrate foods (white bread,&#xD;
           white rice, white pasta) by wholegrains (wholegrain bread, rice and pasta),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  replacing butter and margarine by olive oil as the main culinary fat,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reducing fatty meat and replacing by lean meat, fish, and legumes (peas, beans,&#xD;
           lentils), and by high-protein, low fat foods, such as low-fat dairy (participants will&#xD;
           be provided with 2 high-protein yoghurts to eat each day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive personalised guidance to help follow the new diet in the form of&#xD;
      sessions at their community CR centre along with guide books and recipe guides. The goal is&#xD;
      to make small, easy changes to their current eating habits, so the diet will be easy to&#xD;
      follow. All foods included will be affordable and easy to find in local supermarkets&#xD;
      (shopping guides will be provided), and the investigators will provide suggestions and&#xD;
      recipes to prepare food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If allocated to groups 1 or 3, participants will be asked to follow the diet recommendations&#xD;
      given during phase 3 of CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance exercise: if allocated to groups 3 or 4, participants will be asked to perform&#xD;
      resistance exercise. This involves weights or weight machines aimed at building muscle&#xD;
      strength. Participants will be shown how to do the exercises by qualified instructors (BACPR&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation certified) in the community centre where they carry out their current&#xD;
      phase 3 cardiac rehabilitation. All exercises have been deemed safe for cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation patients and an instructor will be available at all exercise sessions should&#xD;
      they need assistance. Participants will be required to attend 3 sessions per week and each&#xD;
      session is expected to last approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If allocated to groups 1 or 2, participants will be asked to continue with the standard,&#xD;
      aerobic-style exercise (treadmills, rowing machines, elliptical trainers) they have used in&#xD;
      phase 3 of CR. This will also require 3 sessions per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 SUBSEQUENT VISITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL stage 2 participants will have to attend two more appointments at LJMU. The second visit&#xD;
      will be just before beginning the intervention, and the third immediately after completing&#xD;
      the intervention. Visits are expected to last 45-60 minutes and will entail:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Measures of body composition, blood pressure and grip strength, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) A venous blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The investigators will take about 8 teaspoons of blood. Particpants will need to fast for&#xD;
      at least 12 hours prior to their appointment (although water is encouraged), as otherwise&#xD;
      this may affect the result of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Focus Groups • At the final visit the investigators will also ask about participant&#xD;
      experiences with the diet and/or exercise regime allocated to them, and to check whether they&#xD;
      have experienced any so-called adverse events over the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Food diaries (prior to lab appointments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to second and third lab visits, participants will given a template of a three-day&#xD;
           food diary, which they will need to complete the week before their lab appointment (on&#xD;
           three working days plus one weekend or festive day, non-consecutive whenever possible),&#xD;
           and bring with them on the morning of the visit. Participants will be contacted the day&#xD;
           before to remind them of their appointment and what they must bring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (v) Mediterranean Diet Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill in a brief 13-question questionnaire regarding the frequency of&#xD;
           their intake of certain foods&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) Sarcopenia quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants will fill in a brief questionnaire regarding the current impact of sarcopenia&#xD;
      on their quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING This is a single centre study with all data collection taking place in LJMU,&#xD;
      Byrom St. campus. All exercise will be carried out at the participants community CR centre,&#xD;
      supervised by trained members of the community CR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS Cross-sectional study: from the results of body composition analysis,&#xD;
      the prevalence of SO will be analysed in the sample. Differences in prevalence between&#xD;
      genders, and between cardiac conditions (e.g. arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, coronary&#xD;
      artery disease etc.) will be assessed by Chi-squared tests. The investigators will use&#xD;
      Pearson or Spearman correlations (according to normality) to study the associations between&#xD;
      body composition variables, markers of strength and performance, and biomarkers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk (based on patient data requested from LHCH) and multiple regression to&#xD;
      assess the predictive capacity of indicators of sarcopenic obesity and muscle strength on&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study: comparisons between intervention groups for all outcome measures will be&#xD;
      performed by means of mixed model ANOVA, to account for inter-subject (differences between&#xD;
      treatments) and intra-subject (differences between baseline and endpoint) variability. Since&#xD;
      a sample size calculation will not be conducted for this component, interpretation of the&#xD;
      results will be largely descriptive and focused on confidence limits around parameter&#xD;
      estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05, and all analyses will be conducted using IBM&#xD;
      SPSS Statistics v25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT STUDY PARTICIPANTS Participants will be recruited from Liverpool&#xD;
      Heart &amp; Chest Hospital Cardiac Rehabilitation unit. Participants in the cross-sectional study&#xD;
      will be admissions to phase 3 CR. Participants in the intervention trial will have recently&#xD;
      completed phase 3 CR, will have been deemed as cardiac stable, and will be willing to&#xD;
      participate in phase 4 CR (Activity for Life). The minimum age restriction for participants&#xD;
      will be 40-years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the feasibility study has been arbitrarily kept small (10-15 participants&#xD;
      per intervention group) to allow ease of recruitment and management of participants before&#xD;
      development into a fully powered randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT TECHNIQUE Participants will be approached by members of their clinical care team&#xD;
      at LHCH, who will invite them to participate and confirm they are willing to be contacted by&#xD;
      the research team for more information. Please refer to 6.5 for further details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICATION Eligible participants will be recruited from patients recently&#xD;
      referred to cardiac rehabilitation (Liverpool Heart &amp; Chest Hospital Cardiac Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Unit), which is where the investigators will start the study. In collaboration with the LHCH&#xD;
      Cardiac Rehabilitation Uniteligible participants will first be identified by the clinical&#xD;
      care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be approached by members of the Knowsley Community Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Services team, part of Liverpool Heart &amp; Chest Hospital Cardiac Rehabilitation unit.&#xD;
      Participants will be informed of the research and provided with a participation information&#xD;
      sheet and asked to reply with their interest after 24 hours. They will then be contacted by&#xD;
      the PhD student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT The maximum period from screening in stage 1 to the&#xD;
      recruitment for the intervention (stage 2) will depend on the participant's progression&#xD;
      through CR phase 3. As phase 3 normally last 8 weeks, and assuming a participant has just&#xD;
      started CR phase 3 there may be up to 8 weeks from the first (screening) visit to second&#xD;
      visit (baseline) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT The participant must personally sign and date the latest approved version of&#xD;
      the Informed Consent form before any study specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written and verbal versions of the Participant Information and Informed Consent will be&#xD;
      presented to the participants detailing no less than: the exact nature of the study; what it&#xD;
      will involve for the participant; the implications and constraints of the protocol; the known&#xD;
      side effects and any risks involved in taking part. It will be clearly stated that the&#xD;
      participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice&#xD;
      to future care, without affecting their legal rights, and with no obligation to give the&#xD;
      reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be allowed as much time as wished to consider the information, and the&#xD;
      opportunity to question the Investigator, their GP or other independent parties to decide&#xD;
      whether they will participate in the study. Written Informed Consent will then be obtained by&#xD;
      means of participant dated signature and dated signature of the person who presented and&#xD;
      obtained the Informed Consent. The person who obtained the consent must be suitably qualified&#xD;
      and experienced, and have been authorised to do so by the Chief/Principal Investigator. A&#xD;
      copy of the signed Informed Consent will be given to the participant. The original signed&#xD;
      form will be retained at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS FROM STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, the&#xD;
      Investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if the Investigator&#xD;
      considers it necessary for any reason including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively having been overlooked&#xD;
           at screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant protocol deviation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant non-compliance with treatment regimen or study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a participant wish to withdraw from the study, their anonymised data will be retained&#xD;
      for 10 years. Their data may still be included in the analysis if they withdraw after&#xD;
      completing the intervention, and for reasons that do not affect the study outcomes. If the&#xD;
      participant wants their data to be removed from the study, they may contact us and request&#xD;
      such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawn participants may be replaced should sufficient time and resources be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for withdrawal by researcher (and by participant, if this information is&#xD;
      volunteered) will be recorded in a study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT ACCESS TO DATA Direct access will be granted to the research team, authorised&#xD;
      representatives from the Sponsor and host institution for monitoring and/or audit of the&#xD;
      study to ensure compliance with regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA RECORDING AND RECORD KEEPING The information provided as part of the study will be&#xD;
      anonymised. The investigators will use codes to label, trace and identify samples, records&#xD;
      and questionnaires; the investigators will never use any personal data from which&#xD;
      participants can be identified, such as name, initials, or date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documents that include personal data (such as the consent form, or contact details) will be&#xD;
      stored on password-protected computers and locked filing cabinets at LJMU, accessed only by&#xD;
      the research team. They will be destroyed upon completion of the study, unless they would&#xD;
      like a copy of the final study results; in that case, the investigators will retain their&#xD;
      names, phone numbers and email addresses, so the investigators can contact them later. The&#xD;
      results should be available approximately 1 year after the study is completed; participant&#xD;
      personal data will be then deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be stored in databases using the codes as identifiers, never personal&#xD;
      data, and they will be kept in password-protected computers only accessed by the research&#xD;
      team. Samples will be booked into a database and receive a laboratory code, with only those&#xD;
      involved in the research having access. All data and samples will be destroyed after 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of participants will never be published in any communication of results and&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE HANDLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be processed and stored according to current UK regulations and rules of&#xD;
      good research practice (Human Tissue Act 2004), and will be kept for a maximum of 10 years.&#xD;
      Briefly, blood samples will be processed immediately after collection, and the serum will be&#xD;
      stored in a secure freezer in the Life Sciences Building at LJMU's Byrom St campus. All&#xD;
      samples will be stored pseudo-anonymously; this means that all identifiable information will&#xD;
      be removed and replaced by a code to allow the research team to trace the samples and match&#xD;
      them with the other measurements (body weight, muscle mass measures, etc.). Once all&#xD;
      participants have completed the intervention, samples will be analysed. Once the specified&#xD;
      storage period ends, all samples will be disposed of following current UK regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS DECLARATION OF HELSINKI The Investigator will ensure&#xD;
      that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and relevant regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK Participants will be scanned by a DXA scanner, which will&#xD;
      involve use of small doses of ionising radiation, though this is a minimal amount compared to&#xD;
      other medical imaging techniques, such as standard X-ray and CT scans. The DXA scan would be&#xD;
      equal to approximately 2 microsieverts (μSv); this is compared to 20 microsieverts for a&#xD;
      chest X-ray and 10,000 microsieverts for a CT scan. It is also less than a transcontinental&#xD;
      flight (40 μSv) and one day of natural background radiation (8 μSv).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Great care will be taken to ensure vulnerable people (for example, pregnant women) will not&#xD;
      be permitted to take part, both during the initial screening and recruitment, and also during&#xD;
      the scans where mandatory exclusion criteria are checked before the scan can begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will limit the involvement of each participant to three scans, and they will be&#xD;
      fully informed as to the exposure they will have, should they choose to participate. The&#xD;
      radiation exposure is so low that no shielding of the room or of the person conducting the&#xD;
      scans is necessary; therefore, the anticipated risk to the participant is negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are being asked to be involved in a study which has a central focus on body&#xD;
      weight and composition, which can be a very sensitive subject. As the participants will be&#xD;
      willing volunteers for the study, it is expected that only people who are comfortable with&#xD;
      this issue will be involved. Additionally, the participants can request for their&#xD;
      bio-impedance and anthropometric measurements to be taken by a member of the research team of&#xD;
      the same gender. They can also request a chaperone to be present during the procedure.&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentially will be ensured when taking measurements, and all data will be&#xD;
      anonymised upon collection and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will be reminded that they can withdraw and remove themselves from&#xD;
      the situation (and the study) at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the DXA scans, questionnaires and anthropometric measurements, it is not anticipated that&#xD;
      there will be significant inconvenience for those who choose to take part in this project, as&#xD;
      their time involvement is minimal at 45 minutes per visit, and the investigators will do&#xD;
      their best to accommodate their visit times to their preferences and availability (within the&#xD;
      limits of the research requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be made aware of the requirements of the dietary intervention while seeking&#xD;
      consent, and it is expected that those who are comfortable with this dietary change will be&#xD;
      involved. The dietary intervention will not use difficult to source ingredients and will be&#xD;
      tailored to suit the tastes of the participants. Various recipes and food substitutions will&#xD;
      be provided to participants at the beginning of the protocol. The high-protein diet of the&#xD;
      protocol would only be potentially detrimental to individuals who have renal deficiency, and&#xD;
      therefore this is one of the studies exclusion criteria. Participants will also receive&#xD;
      regular contact from the PhD student regarding their adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be made aware of the requirements of the exercise intervention while&#xD;
      seeking consent, and it is expected that those who are comfortable with this change in&#xD;
      physical activity will be involved. All participants will have received exercise tolerance&#xD;
      tests as part of their NHS cardiac rehabilitation and will be cleared for the exercise&#xD;
      protocol. They will also receive instruction from a collaborator suitably trained in exercise&#xD;
      for cardiac rehabilitation regarding how to safely complete the exercise protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of the participants and their data will be kept confidential, with no&#xD;
      personal identifying data being present on questionnaires, forms or DXA scans. The unique&#xD;
      code that can identify a participant will be kept on a secure system that can only be&#xD;
      accessed by the research team. Therefore it is not expected that there will be a significant&#xD;
      risk of a confidentiality breach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the participant disclose information indicating a risk of potential harm to themselves&#xD;
      or others, the appropriate authority will be contacted (LHCH, patient's GP, police etc,).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT CONFIDENTIALITY The data custodian will be the PhD student. All investigators and&#xD;
      study site staff must comply with the requirements of data protection legislation with&#xD;
      regards to the collection, storage, processing and disclosure of personal information and&#xD;
      will uphold the Act's core principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information provided as part of the study will be anonymised. The investigators will use&#xD;
      codes to label, trace and identify samples, records and questionnaires; the investigators&#xD;
      will never use any personal data from which participants can be identified, such as name,&#xD;
      initials, or date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documents that include personal data (such as the consent form, or contact details) will be&#xD;
      stored on password-protected computers and locked filing cabinets at LJMU, accessed only by&#xD;
      the research team. They will be destroyed upon completion of the study, unless participants&#xD;
      would like a copy of the final study results; in that case, the investigators will retain&#xD;
      their name, phone number and email address, so the investigators can contact them later.&#xD;
      Their personal data will then be deleted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be stored in databases using the codes as identifiers, never personal&#xD;
      data, and they will be kept in password-protected computers only accessed by the research&#xD;
      team. Samples will be booked into a database and receive a laboratory code, with only those&#xD;
      involved in the research having access. All data and samples will be destroyed after 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of participants will never be published in any communication of results and&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPENSES AND BENEFITS Participants will not be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred while&#xD;
      participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the high protein diet groups will be provided with 2 high-protein yoghurts&#xD;
      per day for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diet and exercise chosen in this study have been shown to have a number of benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-protein foods may increase satiety after a meal, reducing hunger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This may also lead to a lower calorie intake and consequential potential weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This may lead to a loss of fat mass, improving body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscles may grow and become stronger, meaning everyday activities will feel easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sugar levels may improve due to healthier muscles helping with blood sugar&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood cholesterol and fats may improve, reducing risk of further cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS In the unlikely event of finding any abnormalities or anything&#xD;
      of clinical significance, the findings will be checked by a clinical specialist. If the&#xD;
      specialist feels that the abnormality was medically important, they will discuss the&#xD;
      implications with the participant and arrange for further investigations as necessary.&#xD;
      Participants will not be informed unless the doctor considers the finding has clear&#xD;
      implications for their current or future health. It is important to note that data collected&#xD;
      are not carried out for diagnostic purposes, and therefore the data are not a substitute for&#xD;
      a clinical appointment. Rather, the data are intended for research purposes only.&#xD;

&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC REVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol went through successive stages of scientific review:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It was first reviewed and approved for support under the cross-faculty PhD funding&#xD;
           scheme. The panel reviewing the proposals was formed by staff from the Faculty of&#xD;
           Science, Faculty of Education, Health and Community, and the Institute of Health&#xD;
           Research, LJMU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study was subsequently reviewed and approved by the Service Users Research Endeavour&#xD;
           (SURE) Group of the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, our study protocol was presented at and approved by the Research and Innovation&#xD;
           Committee of the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All different stages of review were carried out by independent reviewers, both internal (from&#xD;
      LJMU) and external (LHCH), meeting the requirements of Level 4 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE Protocol adherence will be monitored with weekly phone call with each&#xD;
      participant, carried out by the PhD student. This will also be an opportunity for participant&#xD;
      to inform the PhD student of any adverse events they have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accidental protocol deviations can happen at any time. They will be adequately documented on&#xD;
      the relevant forms and reported to the Chief Investigator and Sponsor immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations from the protocol which are found to frequently recur are not acceptable, will&#xD;
      require immediate action and could potentially be classified as a serious breach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if the Investigator&#xD;
      considers it necessary for any reason. Such occurrences will be detailed in the individual&#xD;
      participant study logs&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS A standard Non-Commercial Model Agreement (mNCA) will be negotiated&#xD;
      with Liverpool Heart &amp; Chest Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research passport (letter of access) will be applied for, for the PhD student who will&#xD;
      undertake the research within the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF END OF STUDY The end of study is the date of completion of analysis of samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      END OF STUDY AND ARCHIVING The end of study is the date of the last visit of the last&#xD;
      participant. Relevant consent forms will be obtained for each participant, allowing for the&#xD;
      samples to be stored and data to be archived for at least 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACCESS TO THE FINAL STUDY DATASET Aim: to describe who will have access to the final dataset&#xD;
      The PhD student, all supervisors and the lead clinician will have access to the full dataset.&#xD;
      The study will allow site investigators to access the full dataset if a formal request&#xD;
      describing their plans is approved by the steering group. Any secondary analysis will only be&#xD;
      undertaken with the consent of the participants. All patient documentation will reflect the&#xD;
      future use of data in research.&#xD;
