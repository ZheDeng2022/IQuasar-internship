  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce&#xD;
      uncontrollably. This study focuses on two types of cancers: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). AML (blood cancer) is cancer of the white blood cells&#xD;
      (WBC). NSCLC (solid tumor) is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the&#xD;
      lung. The purpose of this study is to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to see if&#xD;
      the study drug is safe and able to treat patients who have AML and NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABBV-184 is an investigational drug being developed for treatment of cancer. The study has&#xD;
      two arms and two phases: AML arm and NSCLC arm; dose escalation and dose expansion phase.&#xD;
      Adult participants with diagnosis of AML or NSCLC will be enrolled. In dose escalation phase,&#xD;
      around 36 participants will be enrolled in each arm. In dose expansion phase, around 20&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in each arm. The study will be conducted in approximately 50&#xD;
      sites across 10 countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive weight based intravenous (IV) infusion of ABBV-184 once a week. At&#xD;
      the beginning of the study, visits will occur daily during hospitalization followed by less&#xD;
      frequently over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking&#xD;
      for side effects, and questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
