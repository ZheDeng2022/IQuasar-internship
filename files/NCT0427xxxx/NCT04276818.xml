  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained from the patient's blood has been used in many clinical&#xD;
      and experimental studies, primarily wound healing, and successful results have been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP has been used in various studies in the treatment of burn wounds, and positive results&#xD;
      have been obtained. However, investigators did not find any study or publication about the&#xD;
      use of PRP in second-degree superficial burns in our screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators planned a prospective randomized controlled and multicenter study to&#xD;
      investigate the positive effects of PRP in the treatment of second-degree superficial burn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study was planned to be performed between 01.03.2020 and 01.04.2020 in Health Sciences&#xD;
      University Konya Training and Research Hospital Burn Unit and Health Sciences University&#xD;
      Mogadishu-Somalia Recep Tayyip Erdogan Training and Research Hospital General Surgery&#xD;
      Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized with a second degree superficial burn and treated with PRP will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary purpose: To investigate the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma in burn treatment&#xD;
      Secondary purpose: None. Platelet-rich plasma has recently been used in medicine for the&#xD;
      treatment of various diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, patients hospitalized in our clinic with the diagnosis of second-degree&#xD;
      superficial burn were randomized and divided into two equal groups. It was planned to treat&#xD;
      the first group with PRP, and the second group to be treated with a conventional method of&#xD;
      dressing containing silver sulfadiazine cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given clear and understandable information about the study. Patients who&#xD;
      agree to participate in the study will receive a consent form explaining that they have&#xD;
      participated in the study voluntarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secretary will do randomization with the help of a computer program. A note stating which&#xD;
      group the patient is in will be placed in a closed envelope. A randomization envelope will be&#xD;
      opened in each patient before starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study was determined as the day when the burn was epithelialized&#xD;
      100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are the deepening of the wound and the application of other treatment&#xD;
      modalities, including surgery, or an infection in the burn area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our power analysis, investigators found the number of patients as 80% power and 28&#xD;
      patients with an alpha value of 0.05. Assuming that 10% of patients will be excluded during&#xD;
      the study, investigators calculated that a total of 31 patients should be studied.&#xD;
