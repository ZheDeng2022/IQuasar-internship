  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label, single arm study in which ARQ-151 cream 0.3% is applied QD for&#xD;
      2 weeks to adolescent subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis involving at least 10% body&#xD;
      surface area (BSA) and adult subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis involving at least 20%&#xD;
      BSA (excluding scalp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the exposure and characterize the plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile and to assess the safety and tolerability of ARQ-151 cream 0.3%&#xD;
      administered once daily for 2 weeks to adolescent and adult subjects with chronic plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis.&#xD;
