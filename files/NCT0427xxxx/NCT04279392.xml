  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in three adults in the United States suffers from obesity. Bariatric surgery is an&#xD;
      increasingly utilized and effective treatment for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities,&#xD;
      however, the massive weight loss associated with bariatric surgery adversely affects bone&#xD;
      leads to an increased risk of fracture. Bisphosphonate medications, such as zoledronic acid,&#xD;
      are used to treat bone loss in patients with osteoporosis, and this study investigates&#xD;
      whether this medication can prevent bone loss associated with surgical weight loss&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      One in three adults in the United States suffers from obesity. Bariatric surgery is an&#xD;
      increasingly utilized and effective treatment for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities,&#xD;
      however, the massive weight loss associated with bariatric surgery adversely affects bone&#xD;
      metabolism. Significant decreases in bone mineral density lead to an increased risk of&#xD;
      fracture and subsequent reduction in physical function among bariatric surgery patients.&#xD;
      Bisphosphonate medications, such as zoledronic acid, have been evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in combating bone loss in patients with osteoporosis, but their use in bariatric&#xD;
      surgery-induced bone loss has not been explored. The primary goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether bisphosphonate therapies are able to combat bone loss associated with&#xD;
      surgical weight loss procedures. This research proposal is a 1-year, pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) involving 30 adult sleeve gastrectomy patients randomized to receive&#xD;
      either a one-time zoledronic acid infusion or placebo (n=15 per group). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that zoledronic acid, a standard treatment for low bone density, will be an&#xD;
      effective intervention to reduce sleeve gastrectomy-induced bone loss. Bone loss is an&#xD;
      unintended consequence of an otherwise life-saving procedure, with declining bone health&#xD;
      potentially contributing to major morbidity in those undergoing a bariatric procedure.&#xD;
      Identifying effective interventions to minimize bone loss is crucial for comprehensive&#xD;
      treatment of patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Specific Aim 1: To determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of zoledronic acid in preventing bone loss associated with sleeve gastrectomy (SG).&#xD;
      Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers will be measured at baseline and 9&#xD;
      months. The primary outcome is change in BMD as measured by Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DXA). Secondary outcomes are change in BMD as measured by Quantitative Computed Tomography&#xD;
      (QCT) and change in the serum bone turnover markers, urinary collagen type 1 cross-linked&#xD;
      N-telopeptide (CTX; bone formation marker), serum type 1 procollagen N-terminal (P1NP; bone&#xD;
      resorption marker), sclerostin, and osteocalcin. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      of this trial in those who have undergone SG surgery. The feasibility will be assessed by&#xD;
      documenting adverse events and compliance rates of the intervention at each study time point.&#xD;
