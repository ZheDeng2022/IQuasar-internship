    <textblock>
      The pilot study will assess the feasibility and efficacy of cryoablation procedure to freeze&#xD;
      the vagus nerve in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Aim 1 will focus on changes in&#xD;
      glycemic control. Aim 2 will evaluate differences in body weight and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements. This study will provide much needed data for a novel therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      to manage obese patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with type 2 diabetes are obese. Weight loss is recommended as a first line&#xD;
      treatment for overweight and obese individuals with diabetes. Unfortunately, it is difficult&#xD;
      for people to implement lifestyle changes that lead to significant weight loss, and even&#xD;
      harder to maintain weight loss. Manipulation of the gut-brain axis may be a means to augment&#xD;
      weight loss efforts. Preliminary data suggests that a simple cryoablation procedure to freeze&#xD;
      the vagus nerve is well-tolerated and leads to clinically significant weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will assess the feasibility and efficacy of this procedure in obese patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes. Aim 1 will focus on changes in glycemic control. Aim 2 will evaluate&#xD;
      differences in body weight and anthropometric measurements. This study will provide much&#xD;
      needed data for a novel therapeutic intervention to manage obese patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Hemoglobin A1c</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The hemoglobin A1c test result reflects average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. Specifically, the A1c test measures what percentage of hemoglobin is coated with sugar (glycated). The higher A1c level, the poorer blood sugar control and the higher risk of diabetes complications.</description>

    <measure>Change in insulin resistance score Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin resistance score (HOMA-IR) is computed with the formula: fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) times fasting serum insulin (mU/l) divided by 22.5. Low HOMA-IR values indicate high insulin sensitivity, whereas high HOMA-IR values indicate low insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance).</description>

    <description>The procedure will be done under CT guidance and involves a 4-5 mm scalpel incision followed by percutaneous probe placement about the posterior gastroesophageal junction (the location of the posterior vagal trunk). The probe will create a zone of decreased temperature (-20 to -40oC) involving the posterior vagal nerve fibers/plexus. The cryoablation process will include a 3-minute freeze, followed by a 1-minute thaw, and a second 3-minute freeze and 1 minute thaw.&#xD;
Participants will also receive standardized dietary and exercise counseling from a registered dietitian and exercise physiologist.</description>

    <description>The Visual ICE Cryoablation System is a mobile console system intended for cryoablative tissue destruction using a minimally invasive procedure. The system is computer-controlled with a touch screen user interface. The therapy delivered by the system is based on the Joule-Thomson effect displayed by compressed gases. The Visual-ICE System uses high-pressure argon gas that circulates through closed-tip cryoablation needles to induce tissue freezing. Active tissue thawing is achieved by circulating helium gas through the needles or, alternatively, by the use of Galil Medical i-Thaw technology.</description>

    <description>The lifestyle intervention structure will include three face-to-face counseling sessions at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Dietary counseling to follow a low carbohydrate diet will be provided by a registered dietitian. Focus will be on increasing fruits and vegetables and decreasing refined sugars and processed foods. It will also include motivational interviewing, goal setting and nutrition education. In addition, subjects will be encouraged by exercise physiologist to slowly increase physical activity to at least 150 minutes weekly. There will be weekly phone calls or texts (participants' choice) providing a total of 26 points of contact recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force.</description>
