      This study is a two-part, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of the&#xD;
      antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) DS-6157a given as a single agent to participants with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose Escalation (Part 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose Expansion (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation: Participants with histopathologically documented advanced GIST not amenable&#xD;
      to curative therapy may be included in which the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or&#xD;
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of DS-6157a monotherapy will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion: Once the RDE(s) is established for DS-6157a (Part 1), enrollment in Dose&#xD;
      Expansion (Part 2) will commence in 2 cohorts. Participants with GIST who have progressed on&#xD;
      or are intolerant to imatinib (IM) and at least one post-IM treatment will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Cohort 1, and participants with GIST who progressed on IM and had not received a post-IM&#xD;
      treatment (2nd line) will be enrolled in Cohort 2.&#xD;
