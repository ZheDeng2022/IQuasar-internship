  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental study will be carried out at Ege University Laboratory Animals Application&#xD;
      and Research Center to identify the efficacy of 10% propolis and 15% propolis on wound&#xD;
      healing in a second-degree superficial burn wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, 36 adult (8-12 week old) Wistar-Albino rats with a weight of 200-300 grams will&#xD;
      be used in each group. Each group will include 6 rats. Stratified randomization will be used&#xD;
      to randomize rats according to their gender and weight. After randomization, a burnt area&#xD;
      will be created on the back of the rats and dressings will be made every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the creation of the burn, biopsy samples will be taken on the 3rd, 7th, 14th and&#xD;
      21st days and at the light microscopic level; bulla, erythema, oedema, burn depth,&#xD;
      inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, ulceration, angiogenesis, neovascularization,&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation, collagenization, epithelization, fibrosis, the number of hair&#xD;
      follicles and damage to the skin attachments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the immunohistochemical examination of biopsy samples, samples will be taken for the&#xD;
      evaluation of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase in the evaluation of the&#xD;
      tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1Î² and oxidative stress in the EBB period in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the acute phase reactants. Fungal and gram staining will be done in order to&#xD;
      determine the pathogen reproduction in biopsy samples taken on the 3rd and 7th day. Masson&#xD;
      trichrome in order to detect fibrosis in biopsy samples taken on the 14th and 21st day;&#xD;
      Hydroxyproline examination will be examined in order to evaluate collagen formation.&#xD;
