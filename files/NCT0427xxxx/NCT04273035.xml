    <textblock>
      The first goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety between anxiolysis by&#xD;
      multimedia-distraction with an IPAD versus anxiolysis by premedication with midazolam prior&#xD;
      to the induction. Secondly to evaluate the need for midazolam-premedication in pediatric&#xD;
      day-care patients induced by inhalational anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative anxiety in children is a common multifactorial influenced and triggered entity&#xD;
      with an incidence as high as 50%. Especially (mask)induction of anesthesia is considered one&#xD;
      of the most stressful experiences for a child undergoing surgery. A common practice worldwide&#xD;
      to diminish the level of anxiety prior to anesthesia is premedication with the benzodiazepine&#xD;
      midazolam in order to improve cooperation during induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication with midazolam has a primary purpose to reduce preoperative anxiety and has&#xD;
      inherent to a benzodiazepine its sedative effects. Although these effects are implied,&#xD;
      negative effects of premedication: respiratory complications, paradoxical negative behavior&#xD;
      has been reported. Although alternative medications have been studied, studies for&#xD;
      non-pharmacological anxiety-reduction remain limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological anxiety-reduction by distraction including Tablet or IPAD-multimedia&#xD;
      might be a readily available alternative for midazolam premedication. Potentially limiting&#xD;
      the use of psychoactive agents, limiting the need for preoperative sedation and therefore&#xD;
      possibly decrease secondary respiratory complications in pediatric surgical day-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety between anxiolysis by&#xD;
      multimedia-distraction with an IPAD versus anxiolysis by premedication with midazolam prior&#xD;
      to the mask-induction of anesthesia. Secondly to evaluate the need for midazolam&#xD;
      premedication in pediatric day-care surgery patients induced by inhalational anesthesia.&#xD;
