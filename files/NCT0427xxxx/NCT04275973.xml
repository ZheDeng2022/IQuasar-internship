  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to test the comparative biomechanical benefits of different lower-limb&#xD;
      prostheses and orthoses using data collected over extended periods of everyday life using&#xD;
      wearable sensors. Investigator seek to improve physical health, functional activity level,&#xD;
      independence, workforce participation, and mental health in participants with lower limb&#xD;
      amputation and other lower-limb impairments. Investigator seek to study the similarities and&#xD;
      differences in participants' movement using prostheses and orthoses with different&#xD;
      technological features or designs. Study team also seek to develop technologies that enhance&#xD;
      the methods for using wearable sensor technology to perform this type of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with lower-limb amputation, participants who use lower limb orthoses,&#xD;
      participants with unilateral drop-foot (including a specific group with Multiple Sclerosis),&#xD;
      and healthy control participants will be recruited in this study.&#xD;

Outcomes will generally be compared using a repeated-measures design, in which each participant acts as his/her own control. This design is chosen to minimize the statistical problems caused by heterogeneity in the participant population.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility (PLUS-M) is a 12 item questionnaire. It is a self-report instrument for measuring mobility of adults with lower limb amputation.&#xD;
PLUS-M instruments measure prosthetic users' mobility (i.e., the ability to move intentionally and independently from one place to another). PLUS-M questions assess respondents' perceived ability to carry out actions that require use of both lower limbs, ranging from household ambulation to outdoor recreational activities. The described activities relate to two primary forms of movement, locomotion (i.e., movement in a continuous, repeatable pattern) and/or postural transitions (i.e., movement from one position to another or one type of activity to another).&#xD;
PLUS-M instruments provide a T-score that ranges from 17.5 to 76.6. A higher PLUS-M T-score corresponds to greater mobility.</description>
