  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is highly prevalent in US adults and is a major cause of missed work&#xD;
      days and disability. While several treatment options exist, chronic opioids are commonly used&#xD;
      for these conditions even though there are limited data supporting efficacy, and clear&#xD;
      evidence of harm associated with chronic opioid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality has been proposed as a treatment option that may lead to decreased pain and&#xD;
      improved physical functioning, while avoiding the harms associated with medication&#xD;
      management. This study is intended to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data to guide&#xD;
      the design of a larger clinical trial.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Kauruna Virtual Reality&#xD;
      program for the treatment of chronic low back pain. This study is intended to document the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the use of virtual reality for the treatment of chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be physical functioning as measured by the PROMIS 6.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include patient-reported pain intensity, adverse side effects,&#xD;
      disability as measured by the Oswestry Low back disability questionnaire, and mental&#xD;
      functioning as assessed using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Finally, impact on opioid use in patients&#xD;
      on chronic opioids will be assessed by documentation of daily opioid dose in oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty adult patients with chronic low back pain who are receiving care through the Penn Pain&#xD;
      Medicine Center are eligible to participate in the study. The study will consist of a&#xD;
      screening visit, followed by randomization into 1 of 2 study groups. Both study groups will&#xD;
      participate in two 20-minute virtual reality sessions a week for 8 weeks. Study group 1 will&#xD;
      participate in 20 minutes of mindfulness mediation. Study Group 2 will undergo initial&#xD;
      sessions focused on graded motor imagery, followed by sessions focused on graded exposure.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcomes data will be obtained at baseline, then weekly during the 8-week&#xD;
      study period, then 4 weeks following completion of the study sessions.&#xD;
