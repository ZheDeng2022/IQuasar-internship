    <description>Mean change in NOSE score from Baseline to 24 months post study procedure. Scores may range from the best score of 0, meaning no nasal obstructive symptoms to the worst score of 100, meaning severe nasal obstructive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in symptoms as documented by the subject in the Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post study procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Subject self reported study-specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire - The QOL questionnaire will be used to gain better understanding of the impact of nasal obstruction on the subject's daily activities, feelings, symptoms and medication use. Symptoms will be recorded on a scale of 0, No problem to 5, Problem as bad as it could be. A satisfaction with outcome of Vivaer treatment will be asked in one question on a scale where 1=symptoms have no effect on daily activity to 10=symptoms completely effect daily activity. The QOL will be completed by the subject at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post study procedure.</description>
