  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate and describe perceptions of nutrient content, including calories, of&#xD;
           plant-based milks and dairy milks without food labels (ie., no Ingredient or Nutrition&#xD;
           Facts label) and how this impacts consumption choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine understanding of nutrient content, including calories, of plant-based milks&#xD;
           and dairy milks after given access to food labels (ie., Ingredient or Nutrition Facts&#xD;
           label) and how this impacts consumption choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess influence of age, gender, economic status, and race/ethnicity on results.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate the nutrient content understanding of subjects before and&#xD;
      after exposure to nutrition facts and ingredients list labels, along with the decision-making&#xD;
      behind consumption choices. Before the activity, subjects will complete a consumer choice&#xD;
      questionnaire and an eating habits questionnaire, which evaluates grocery shopping patterns&#xD;
      and typical 'milk' beverage preferences of subjects prior to participation in the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be presented with several 'milk' products in a four-section activity. Carton&#xD;
      set-up will vary between sections in terms of number and order. The order the cartons will be&#xD;
      set up on the tables will be randomized for each subject in order to avoid having results&#xD;
      attributed to the order the cartons are seen. In order to make a smooth randomization&#xD;
      process, each carton with has a number sticker on it, such as '#1' '#2' and so on. If carton&#xD;
      '#1' is almond milk in section I, it will remain carton '#1' for all subjects during section&#xD;
      I - only the order that the cartons are placed will change. Each of the four sections of the&#xD;
      activity will take place in its own cubicle. Subjects will be able to look at, move around,&#xD;
      and compare cartons while answering questions for that section's respective questionnaire&#xD;
      booklet. There will be no time limit on questionnaires. Questions in the booklet will be&#xD;
      separated onto different pages in order to prevent subjects from looking back at previous&#xD;
      answers and/or changing answers due to surrounding questions. Questionnaires throughout the&#xD;
      four sections will assess consumer perceptions of nutrient content of 'milk' beverages before&#xD;
      and after exposure to nutrition labels, exposure to varieties of 'milk,' and an ingestion&#xD;
      component - the requirement to choose one smoothie in front of a 'milk' carton to consume.&#xD;
      All cartons will remain unbranded throughout the activity. The difference between labeled and&#xD;
      unlabeled cartons will be only the presence or absence, respectively, of a nutrition facts&#xD;
      table and ingredients list on the side of the carton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study Subjects Subjects will be recruited through online advertisements, flyers&#xD;
      distributed throughout the university and local communities, and word of mouth. Interested&#xD;
      individuals can either click a link or scan a QR code to a secure online pre-screen survey&#xD;
      available in online advertisements and on flyers, or will be directed to the secure online&#xD;
      pre-screen survey by phone and/or email through using the contact information provided to the&#xD;
      subject on the online advertisements and flyers. Based upon this initial screening outcome,&#xD;
      subjects will be contacted to schedule their study visit. Upon arrival to the study visit,&#xD;
      subjects will have their birth date and hunger level confirmed by study personnel. Hunger&#xD;
      level will be analyzed through a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) question. Subjects that mark a&#xD;
      vertical line on the VAS that is under 25mm or over 75mm, meaning extreme fullness or extreme&#xD;
      hunger, respectively, will be dismissed from the lab and are able to return at another time.&#xD;
      One hundred (n=100) subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study Procedures Recruited subjects must meet all eligibility criteria (age requirement,&#xD;
      no allergies that could produce bias in choice during this study); sign and date a written&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form prior to any study&#xD;
      procedures, and be willing and able to comply with study schedule and procedures. Subjects&#xD;
      will also be asked to fast for two (2) hours before coming to our site - this means no eating&#xD;
      or drinking other than water. During the screening visit, which includes confirming age and&#xD;
      collecting basic health information (weight, height, body composition), participants will&#xD;
      also complete questionnaires relating to eating habits and choice patterns in purchasing,&#xD;
      including general questions about dairy milks and plant-based milk alternatives to assess&#xD;
      consumption preferences. These will not be used for exclusion, but rather to characterize&#xD;
      population included in the study from a general health standpoint. These answers will allow&#xD;
      for understanding of selection bias when comparing those who do and do not complete the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be required to drink a smoothie containing strawberries and banana&#xD;
      during their visit at the CNRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Visit After completion of the initial online pre-screen questionnaire, eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be provided the option to schedule a study visit time, meaning a time to come&#xD;
      into the CNRC to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity portion will be divided into four sections. Throughout this study, font, font&#xD;
      size, and color will be standardized among all cartons. In the first section, the participant&#xD;
      will be presented with five brand-less, unlabeled cartons: each of the five cartons will have&#xD;
      only one of either a cow, almond, soy, rice, and coconut sticker on them, along with a number&#xD;
      given to each carton for randomization purposes. In this section, the varieties in&#xD;
      plant-based milk alternatives (sweetened and unsweetened) and the varieties in dairy milks&#xD;
      (whole, 2%, 1%, and skim) will not be shown. A questionnaire booklet will be given to&#xD;
      subjects, which will ask about word associations (the first words or phrases that come to&#xD;
      mind when thinking of each type of 'milk' beverage) and preferences. This section serves to&#xD;
      assess opinions on the beverages in the absence of variety and nutrition labeling. The second&#xD;
      section introduces variety in that 12 brand-less, unlabeled cartons will have only a name and&#xD;
      number sticker on them: whole, 2% fat, 1% fat, skim, unsweetened almond, sweetened almond,&#xD;
      unsweetened coconut, sweetened coconut, unsweetened soy, sweetened soy, unsweetened rice, and&#xD;
      sweetened rice will be shown. A questionnaire will be given to subjects, which will ask about&#xD;
      preferences and nutrient content associations, along with interfering questions that are&#xD;
      still of interest in order to avoid asking the nutrient association questions immediately&#xD;
      after one another. The third and fourth sections will have the same 12 brand-less cartons,&#xD;
      except all cartons will now have a nutrition facts and ingredients list label on their side.&#xD;
      A questionnaire booklet will ask about preferences and potential standout information to the&#xD;
      subject after the viewing of the nutrition labels. In the fourth section, the questionnaire&#xD;
      booklet will ask about preferences and see if the decision-making process to consume a 'milk'&#xD;
      beverage differs from that of only hypothetically choosing a 'milk' beverage. There will be a&#xD;
      strawberry banana smoothie in a cup in front of each of the 'milk' cartons and subjects will&#xD;
      answer the section's questionnaire before consuming the smoothie of their choice. Only the&#xD;
      fourth section of the activity will require consumption of a 'milk' beverage; sections one,&#xD;
      two, and three will not involve any smoothie consumption. Subjects will consume 2 ounces (oz)&#xD;
      of the beverage they choose. These beverages will all be made of the same recipe containing&#xD;
      strawberries, bananas, and water in the metabolic kitchen using appropriate standard food&#xD;
      safety protocols. Each of the various 'milk' cartons will have a smoothie placed in front of&#xD;
      it so that the subject chooses the smoothie they associate with that particular 'milk'&#xD;
      carton. The second section will assess consumer opinions in the presence of variety without&#xD;
      exposure to nutrition labeling, the third section will assess those opinions after exposure&#xD;
      to nutrition labeling, and the fourth section will assess if those opinions differ when&#xD;
      ingestion is added into the activity. Each subject will go through sections 1-4 in the same&#xD;
      order. Upon completion of the activity, subjects will complete a post-screen to re-assess&#xD;
      nutrient associations and opinions on dairy milk and plant-based milk alternatives after the&#xD;
      activity compared to before the activity.&#xD;
