      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesiology is still an emerging specialty in comparison to medicine and the field of&#xD;
      surgery. Unawareness, infrequent exposure, and limited direct patient interaction have&#xD;
      resulted in into least knowledge regarding the field of anaesthesiology among patients get&#xD;
      admission to the hospital. The role, status of the anaesthesiologist and the awareness about&#xD;
      the specialty of anaesthesiology has always been an active issue in the general population of&#xD;
      most of the countries. Ongoing advancement in the field of anaesthesiology has facilitated&#xD;
      complex surgical procedures, but it has never been acknowledged anywhere in media. Several&#xD;
      studies done on the same subject is a reflection of efforts of professional bodies around the&#xD;
      world towards improvement in the spread of awareness about the field of anaesthesiology and&#xD;
      role of anaesthesiologist but these are still largely inaccurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey done even in developed countries outside the operating rooms depicted that the&#xD;
      patients have limited awareness about the role of anaesthesiologists. A survey was done in&#xD;
      India in 2018 showed that there was widespread ignorance about the anaesthesiology and role&#xD;
      of anaesthesiologist in patients attending rural healthcare facilities. A 2009 survey in&#xD;
      government busy setting of India showed that only 56% of patients knew that anaesthesiologist&#xD;
      is a doctor. A survey done in the year 2004 revealed a high number of around 80% of patients&#xD;
      visiting hospital recognized anaesthesiologist as a doctor but were unaware of their&#xD;
      responsibilities in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the era of the rise in media and the Internet, an enhancement can be seen in awareness&#xD;
      about anaesthesiology. Awareness about anaesthesiology and anaesthesiologists is an important&#xD;
      better relationship between patient and doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia from 1st December 2017 to 30th March 2018. The sample size was calculated using the&#xD;
      WHO Sample Size Calculator. In a previous study, knowledge regarding anaesthesiologists and&#xD;
      anaesthesiology was about 51.52% therefore 384 patients will be included in this study to&#xD;
      estimate knowledge within 5 percent point (margin of error) of the true value (51.52%) with&#xD;
      95% confidence interval. Using Non-probability purposive sampling patients falling in&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were included after taking ethical committee approval and patient's&#xD;
      consent. Patients of either gender aged 18 to 60 years were included regardless of the&#xD;
      specialty of surgery. We excluded those patients who refused to give consent and those were&#xD;
      unable to give consent because of being language bearer, mentally not bill to understand&#xD;
      questionnaires and doctors who were admitted as patients. Knowledge about anaesthesiologists&#xD;
      and the field of anaesthesiology was measured by asking the questionnaire comprising 12&#xD;
      questions. Patients were interviewed by the preoperative anaesthetist and principal&#xD;
      investigator on the ward. Each interview lasted for 10-20min and was based on a questionnaire&#xD;
      in English and Arabic language. The questionnaire consisted of questions modified from&#xD;
      previous studies and added questions. It had two parts; demographics i.e. age, gender,&#xD;
      educational level, occupation, previous anaesthesia experience and type of surgery, the&#xD;
      second part will consist of 12 questions about anaesthesiology and anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
      Patients giving the correct responses to 8 out of 12 questions were considered to have&#xD;
      knowledge. Data were analyzed using statistical packages for social science version 19 (SPSS&#xD;
      Inc., Chicago, IL). Frequency and percentage were computed for gender, type of surgery,&#xD;
      education level, previous surgery, Patient's knowledge about anaesthesiology and&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist. Mean and the standard deviation was estimated for age. Stratification was&#xD;
      done to control effect modifiers like gender, age, education level, previous surgery to&#xD;
      observed the Patient's knowledge about anaesthesiology and anaesthesiologist through the&#xD;
      chi-square test. pâ‰¤0.05 is considered as significant.&#xD;
