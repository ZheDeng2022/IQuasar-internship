  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults having chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher rate of fracture than those&#xD;
      without chronic kidney disease. Osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease mineral and bone&#xD;
      disorder (CKD-MBD) are risk factors for skeletal fractures. In addition, CKD-MBD is also a&#xD;
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy are&#xD;
      both important to prevent complications of chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis.&#xD;
      Therefore, a prospective intervention study is purposed to investigate the effect of a&#xD;
      multifaceted intervention including exercise, diet modification, and pharmacological therapy&#xD;
      on their outcomes. Patients who are older than 50 years old and have chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      G3-G4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2) with a high risk of&#xD;
      fracture (screening by Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®)) are enrolled. Baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire, clinical, laboratory and radiological examination are performed. If CKD-MBD or&#xD;
      osteoporosis are revealed, the intervention will be given accordingly. All examinations will&#xD;
      be repeated every 3 months, except bone mineral density and x-ray film for the spine to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of the intervention. After one-year, primary outcomes including&#xD;
      mortality, cardiovascular events, subsequent fracture, and fall rate will be examined. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include changes in biochemistry laboratory data before and after&#xD;
      interventions (pharmacological therapy and lifestyle modifications). The bivariate analysis&#xD;
      will be performed using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables with&#xD;
      normal or non-normal distribution, respectively. Chi-squared test for categorical variables&#xD;
      will be used to test correlations between baseline characteristics, change of laboratory&#xD;
      results and outcomes. The paired t-test will be used to examine the difference between before&#xD;
      and after the interventions. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression models will be used to&#xD;
      identify the correlates of outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders.&#xD;

      Background: Older adults having chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher rate of fracture.&#xD;
      Osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) are risk factors&#xD;
      for skeletal fractures. However, most chronic kidney disease patients did not have data of&#xD;
      bone mineral density before the recommendation of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes&#xD;
      (KDIGO) guideline. The correlation of the CKD-MBD and osteoporosis was not fully elucidated.&#xD;
      Also, the effect of a multifaceted intervention on those having both diseases was less&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To observe the clinical outcomes and the trends of biochemistry laboratory data before&#xD;
      and after the multifaceted intervention Method: Sixty subjects with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      stage 3-4, and estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;20 mL/min/1.73m2 and high risk of&#xD;
      fracture (FRAX screening: risk of hip fracture (HF) and major osteoporotic fracture (MOF)&#xD;
      (HF: men&gt;6%, women &gt;7%; MOF: men&gt;15%, women&gt;12.5%) are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects received CKD-MBD and osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultation on&#xD;
      diet, medications, exercise. Followed assessments and interventions are conducted every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include one-year mortality, cardiovascular events, subsequent fracture, and&#xD;
      fall events during the one-year intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include trends of biochemistry laboratory data before and after&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

          <title>Bone mineral density</title>
          <description>Bone mineral density was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Most commonly, the test results are compared to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult, and you are given a T-score. A score of 0 means participant's bone mineral density is equal to the norm for a healthy young adult. Differences between the participant's bone mineral density and that of the healthy young adult norm are measured in units as standard deviations. The more standard deviations below 0, indicated as negative numbers, the lower participant's bone mineral density and the higher the risk of fracture.</description>
