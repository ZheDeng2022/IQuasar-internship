      Eighteen preschool aged children and their families will attend structured,&#xD;
      multidisciplinary, family-centered intensive education sessions over a 3-day weekend in a&#xD;
      residential camp setting to address the unique challenges of managing type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus in young children.&#xD;

      The invesigators propose to deliver a structured multidisciplinary family-centered&#xD;
      intervention over a 3-day weekend. The intervention will be based at a regional camp. The&#xD;
      proposed camp encounters aim to provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An opportunity for intensive education beyond that achievable in a single class, and&#xD;
           without the unfavorable impacts of multiple weekday classes on family and work time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varied educational modalities including didactic sessions, practical demonstrations and&#xD;
           role playing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close observation of each child throughout the day and night by experienced diabetes&#xD;
           counselors and medical staff to identify and help correct maladaptive family behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A safe environment where parents can participate in group therapy sessions without child&#xD;
           care worries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An opportunity for age-appropriate child-centered educational and therapeutic&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An opportunity for families to form mutually-supportive friendships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fun weekends away where the parents have help caring for their diabetic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct this pilot study, which will enroll 18 preschool children age&#xD;
      3-5.5 years, with the goal of obtaining preliminary results for 15 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, to be determined approximately one month before and 3 months after the&#xD;
      camp session, is improvement in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with pretreatment baseline, subjects attending a 3-day session at a family diabetes&#xD;
      camp will improve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c 3 months after the first camp session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral/QoL assessments, including the parents of young children version of the&#xD;
           hypoglycemia fear survey (HFS-P-YC), the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale&#xD;
           (BPFAS), and the general and diabetes modules of the PedsQL.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 3-5.5 years old (+/- 2 months) at the date of camp session they are eligible to&#xD;
             join.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child and Parents fluent in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed for at least 10 months previous to date of first&#xD;
             camp they are eligible to join.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Custodial parent or guardian (preferable both parents or guardians) willing to attend&#xD;
             both session of camp and the activities scheduled for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent or guardian must sign consent before any study procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neonatal diabetes (diagnosis in the first 3 months of life) or documented Monogenic&#xD;
             Diabetes of Youth; i.e., a likely genetic form of diabetes rather than an autoimmune&#xD;
             etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-surgical diabetes (e.g., pancreatectomy for congenital hyperinsulinism). Such&#xD;
             patients often cannot secrete glucagon, leading to a particularly severe inability to&#xD;
             defend against hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe chronic disease (e.g., cancer, cystic fibrosis) which in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator is likely to significantly affect glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients cannot be taking systemic corticosteroids at enrollment because of adverse&#xD;
             effects on glycemic control, but the investigators will not disqualify subjects who&#xD;
             require such therapy during the study. Inhaled or topical corticosteroids are&#xD;
             permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism must be clinically euthyroid and have&#xD;
             free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone within age-appropriate reference ranges at&#xD;
             last medically indicated testing. Patients with out of range values may be retested&#xD;
             after medication dose adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Developmental delay or behavioral disorder in the patient of sufficient severity, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, to interfere with group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychiatric disorder in a parent of sufficient severity, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, to interfere with group activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Celiac disease is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
