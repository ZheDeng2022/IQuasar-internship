  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study conducted in subjects aged 65 or older visiting the French&#xD;
      Balaruc-les-bains climatic health resort was to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine factors that distinguish fallers from not fallers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine factors that may predict falls and injurious falls, 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
           stay in the resort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of the 3-week stay in the health resort on quality of life, fear&#xD;
           of falling, fatigue, and physical activity&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In all subjects aged 65 or older visiting consecutively the resort over a 5-month period, a&#xD;
      questionnaire was administered in order to record:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of falls and injurious falls in the previous 12 months. Injurious falls are&#xD;
           falls complicated by serious or moderate injuries. Falls with serious injuries were&#xD;
           those that caused fractures, head injuries requiring admission to hospital, joint&#xD;
           dislocations, sprains accompanied by reduced physical function, other non-specified&#xD;
           serious joint injuries, and lacerations requiring sutures. Falls with moderate injuries&#xD;
           were those that resulted in bruising, sprains, cuts, abrasions, or reduction in physical&#xD;
           function for at least three days or in medical help&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity over the last 7 days, using the International Physical Activity&#xD;
           Questionnaires (IPAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fear of falling, using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The feeling of fatigue over the previous month, using a visual analogue scale (0 to 10)&#xD;
           A questionnaire was administered to record quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), at baseline and 7&#xD;
           days after the end of the stay A questionnaire snt by mail was filled in by subjects 3&#xD;
           and 6 months after the stay in the resort in order to record falls and injurious falls,&#xD;
           fatigue, fear of falling, and physical activity (using the above questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical measurements were performed at the entrance of the health resort :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body height and body weight to the nearest 0.5 cm and 0.1 kg to calculate the body mass&#xD;
           index (kg.m-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Timed Up and Go test and the time to walk 4 meters at usual pace (Lusardi-2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 5 repeated chair stand test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The maximum grip strength: using a Camry Electronic Hand Dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The one-leg stand test (lowest value on the right and the left leg), and stand tests&#xD;
           feet together, in semi-tandem, and tandem position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The score of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was calculated based on&#xD;
           results of the 4-meter gait speed, and the 5-chair stand and balance tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Fried's frailty phenotype score was calculated, based on - the weight loss in prior&#xD;
           year (body weight at baseline ˗ the self-assessed body weight 12 months before&#xD;
           inclusion) (1 point if ≥ 10 lbs lost unintentionally); - muscle strength (1 point if the&#xD;
           maximum grip strength was low based on the dynamometer manual); - self-reported fatigue&#xD;
           (1 point if Visual Analog Fatigue Scale ≥ 5 in men and ≥ 4 in women), - walking speed (1&#xD;
           point if 4-m walking speed at comfortable pace was in the lowest quintile of values of&#xD;
           subjects with the same gender) (≤ 0.71 m.s-1 in women and ≤ 0.76 m.s-1 in men), -&#xD;
           physical activities in the previous week (1 point if in the lowest quintile of values of&#xD;
           IPAQ of subjects with the same gender) (≤ 2076 MET (Metabolic Equivalent Task) in women&#xD;
           and ≤ 2320 MET in men). A total score of ≥ 3 points was indicative of frailty, 1 or 2&#xD;
           points of prefrail phenotype and a score of 0 is indicative of robustness&#xD;
