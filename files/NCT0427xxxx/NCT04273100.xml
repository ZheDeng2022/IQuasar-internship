  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of primary liver cancer (90%) is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the&#xD;
      majority of HCC patients have been locally advanced or metastatic disease when they are&#xD;
      diagnosed in clinics. Most of them are not suitable for radical treatment. In the case of&#xD;
      supportive treatment, the median survival time was only 7.9 months. Therefore, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need for effective treatment for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the overall objective response rate (ORR) of single or sequential therapy is not&#xD;
      satisfied, and the over survival (OS) improvement is not ideal. Therefore, combined therapy&#xD;
      maybe the good choice for patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the in-operable, middle and late stage (BCLC-B and BCLC-C) HCC&#xD;
      patients. Through the combination of immunotherapy (PD-1 monoclonal antibody), local therapy&#xD;
      (TACE) and anti-angiogenic therapy (lenvatinib), it is expected to change the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, restore the immune response, strengthen the anti-tumor effect of various&#xD;
      treatments, and improve the therapeutic efficacy in patients with middle and late stage HCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single center, non randomized, open label study. It is estimated&#xD;
      that 56 patients with advanced HCC who can not receive radical resection will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial period of subjects includes screening period, treatment period and follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug treatment was 240 mg of PD-1 monoclonal antibody, intravenous infusion on the first&#xD;
      day, every 21 days as a treatment cycle; lenvatinib mesylate capsule, 12 mg (body weight ≥ 60&#xD;
      kg) or 8 mg (body weight &lt; 60 kg), oral once a day, continuous oral; TACE, the blank&#xD;
      microspheres and lobaplatin (30 mg) + epirubicin (40 mg) were injected into the hepatic&#xD;
      artery by routine procedure, repeated every 4-6 weeks, and administered for 2-4 cycles.&#xD;
      Treatment continues until the disease progresses, intolerable toxicity occurs, new anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment is started, informed consent is withdrawn, follow-up is lost, death occurs or&#xD;
      treatment termination is required。&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will be performed between days - 21 and - 4. Informed consent was signed up to 4&#xD;
      weeks prior to the first day of cycle 1 before any screening procedure or evaluation was&#xD;
      performed and the trial was fully explained to each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation results must be collected prior to the first trial drug administration&#xD;
      (day 1 of cycle 1). Baseline assessments may be performed between days - 3 and - 1 or on day&#xD;
      1 of cycle 1. If performed within 3 days before the first day of cycle 1, the screening&#xD;
      results can be used as baseline results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor imaging was evaluated every 8 weeks (± 7 days) since the first administration, and&#xD;
      every 12 weeks (± 7 days) after 36 weeks. If there are clinical indications for disease&#xD;
      progression, tumor evaluation is more frequent. In the event of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, the subject's request to discontinue the trial or the subject's&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, the subject will discontinue the trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the trial treatment is stopped, the treatment visit shall be stopped within 7 days after&#xD;
      the treatment is stopped in order to stop the treatment examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the treatment period (up to 2 years), subjects who can benefit from the&#xD;
      study drug will continue to study the treatment of the drug until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable adverse reactions, withdrawal of intensive care facility (ICF), other anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment, loss of follow-up, death or termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the occurrence of a clinical event, if it is judged by the investigators that it should&#xD;
      be attributed to the progress of the disease and it is unlikely to recover even if the&#xD;
      patient continues to receive treatment, it can be evaluated as clinical deterioration. It is&#xD;
      up to the investigator to discuss and decide whether to continue or stop the treatment for&#xD;
      the subject and record in the study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, subjects who are still under study treatment can continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment through another extended study or other forms at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
      if they are stable or relieved in the efficacy evaluation and can tolerate the adverse&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
