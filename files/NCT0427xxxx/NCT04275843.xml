  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Western diet pattern or standard American diet is a modern dietary pattern that is&#xD;
      characterized by high intakes of meat, pre-packaged foods, fried foods, high-fat dairy&#xD;
      products, eggs, refined grains etc. When considering the role of saturated fat, it may be&#xD;
      prudent to advise limiting all foods that contain saturated fats, including traditional foods&#xD;
      such as unprocessed/minimally processed meat, eggs, whole dairy in addition to processed,&#xD;
      pre-packaged foods; however, this reductionist approach fails to take into account the food&#xD;
      matrix and overall diet in which these nutrients are consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional whole food sources such as beef, poultry, dairy, and eggs have increasingly been&#xD;
      replaced by processed, pre-packaged versions in the Western diet pattern. Epidemiological&#xD;
      evidence suggests that increased modern, pre-packaged food consumption is a major risk factor&#xD;
      for metabolic disease by promoting inflammation. Based on these data, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the pro-atherogenic effect of the Western diet is caused by the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory effects of consuming large amounts of modern pre-packaged foods, and that&#xD;
      consumption of a similar amount of total and saturated fat from minimally processed beef,&#xD;
      poultry, dairy and eggs will positively impact inflammatory markers and lipoprotein profiles&#xD;
      of study participants.&#xD;
