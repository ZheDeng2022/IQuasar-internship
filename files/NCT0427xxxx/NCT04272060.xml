    <textblock>
      Cardiac catheterization with invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for&#xD;
      determining the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease (CHD). However,&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization is costly and, as an invasive procedure, it is associated with some&#xD;
      risk of adverse events, rarely even stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Recent advances&#xD;
      in multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have allowed rapid, noninvasive&#xD;
      coronary artery imaging in patients with suspected CHD. CTA generally yields high accuracy&#xD;
      for identifying patients with CHD when compared to cardiac catheterization. However,&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy is reduced in the setting of severe coronary artery calcification and&#xD;
      coronary stents due to its inferior spatial resolution compared to cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
      Because high-risk patients often have severe coronary calcification or stents, the&#xD;
      application of CTA has been particularly limited in this important patient group. Recently,&#xD;
      an ultrahigh-resolution CT scanner was released which has shown promise to overcome the&#xD;
      limitation of conventional CTA in the setting of severe coronary artery calcification or&#xD;
      stents. This ultrahigh-resolution &quot;precision&quot; CT scanner (UHR-CT) contains detector rows with&#xD;
      half the width than currently available systems (0.25 mm vs. 0.5 mm) resulting in&#xD;
      approximately twice the spatial resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that high-resolution CTA is not&#xD;
      inferior to the current standard of cardiac catheterization for identifying significant CHD&#xD;
      in patients with high-risk characteristics, including severe coronary artery calcification&#xD;
      and coronary stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to enroll 43 patients over 24 months in this pilot investigation.&#xD;
      Patients referred for cardiac catheterization with known CHD and suspected obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis will be included. All patients will undergo both cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization and UHR-CT for determining significant CHD as defined by coronary functional&#xD;
      assessment. The primary end point will be the diagnostic accuracy by area-under-curve (AUC)&#xD;
      method for identifying patients with hemodynamically significant CHD.&#xD;

      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to generate preliminary data in&#xD;
      support of the hypothesis that noninvasive UHR-CT is not inferior to invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography by cardiac catheterization for identifying patients with hemodynamically&#xD;
      significant CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives include testing the diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT&#xD;
      vs. cardiac catheterization on a vessel and segment based analysis, comparison of UHR-CT&#xD;
      Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) to conventional angiography, and comparison of adverse events&#xD;
      and radiation doses between the CT and conventional angiography groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Based Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using visual assessment of coronary artery disease is&#xD;
           non-inferior to invasive, conventional coronary angiography for identifying patients&#xD;
           with hemodynamically significant CHD defined by an FFR or QFR-value of &lt;0.8 in at least&#xD;
           one vessel of 2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using quantitative assessment of coronary artery disease&#xD;
           is non-inferior to invasive, conventional coronary angiography for identifying patients&#xD;
           with hemodynamically significant CHD defined by an FFR-value of &lt;0.8 in at least one&#xD;
           vessel of 2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using CT-FFR is non-inferior to invasive, conventional&#xD;
           coronary angiography for identifying patients with hemodynamically significant CHD&#xD;
           defined by an FFR-value of &lt;0.8 in at least one vessel of 2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. UHR-CT coronary angiography is associated with lower radiation dose than conventional,&#xD;
           invasive coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. UHR-CT coronary angiography is associated with lower adverse effects than conventional,&#xD;
           invasive coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vessel Based Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using visual assessment of coronary artery disease is&#xD;
           non-inferior to invasive, conventional coronary angiography for identifying vessels with&#xD;
           hemodynamically significant CHD defined by an FFR or QFR-value of &lt;0.8 in a vessel of&#xD;
           2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using quantitative assessment of coronary artery disease&#xD;
           is non-inferior to invasive, conventional coronary angiography for identifying vessels&#xD;
           with hemodynamically significant CHD defined by an FFR-value of &lt;0.8 in a vessel of 2.0&#xD;
           mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using CT-FFR is non-inferior to invasive, conventional&#xD;
           coronary angiography for identifying vessels with hemodynamically significant CHD&#xD;
           defined by an FFR-value of &lt;0.8 in a vessel of 2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Segment-Based Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using visual assessment of coronary artery disease is&#xD;
           non-inferior to invasive, conventional coronary angiography for identifying arterial&#xD;
           segments with hemodynamically significant CHD defined by an FFR-value of &lt;0.8 in a&#xD;
           vessel of 2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT using quantitative assessment of coronary artery disease&#xD;
           is non-inferior to invasive, conventional coronary angiography for identifying arterial&#xD;
           segments with hemodynamically significant CHD defined by an FFR-value of &lt;0.8 in a&#xD;
           vessel of 2.0 mm or larger in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Background Cardiac catheterization with invasive coronary angiography has remained the&#xD;
      gold standard for determining the presence or absence of significant coronary luminal&#xD;
      stenosis despite its limited accuracy compared to the standard of intravascular ultrasound.&#xD;
      Because of the inherent risks involved with this invasive procedure (e.g., stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, death or need for emergency surgical intervention) with a major complication rate&#xD;
      of 1-2%), and considerable costs, non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease would be&#xD;
      preferred. Advances in multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have made the&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging of the coronary arterial lumen and wall feasible. Numerous studies have&#xD;
      since demonstrated good accuracy of CTA to identify patients with obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. However, studies also demonstrated that CTA's diagnostic accuracy is only modest in&#xD;
      patients with severe coronary artery calcification or stents, representing a major limitation&#xD;
      of the technology. This limitation is due to fair spatial resolution and associated image&#xD;
      artifacts in the setting of an attenuation-based image reconstruction algorithm. In this&#xD;
      situation, high density structures, such as calcium or metal, will disproportionally dominate&#xD;
      information derived from an affected image voxel leading overrepresentation of these&#xD;
      structures on image display (partial volume effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, an ultrahigh-resolution CT scanner has been released which has shown promise to&#xD;
      overcome the limitation of conventional CTA in the setting of severe coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification or stents. This ultrahigh-resolution &quot;precision&quot; CT scanner (UHR-CT) contains&#xD;
      detector rows with half the width than currently available systems (0.25 mm vs. 0.5 mm)&#xD;
      resulting in approximately twice the spatial resolution. It is likely that this improvement&#xD;
      will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy in high-risk patients. To conclusively test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, a larger, multi-center study is required. The purpose of this investigation is to&#xD;
      test the feasibility of such study and to generate initial data on the hypothesis that&#xD;
      high-resolution CTA is not inferior to the current standard of cardiac catheterization for&#xD;
      identifying significant CHD in patients with high-risk characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Study design The CORE (CORonaryEvaluation)-PRECISION Pilot study is a prospective single&#xD;
      center study of comparing the diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT to conventional, invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography by cardiac catheterization for the presence of hemodynamically&#xD;
      significant CHD in 43 patients with CHD. For each participant, the screening evaluation&#xD;
      periods will last less than 60 days and will be followed by the imaging period (less than 60&#xD;
      days). All patients will be followed by additional 30 days after cardiac catheterization for&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening-Evaluation Period: The screening period will begin when a patient is scheduled for&#xD;
      a clinically indicated coronary angiogram. The protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be reviewed for each potential participant. If the patient appears to be eligible for the&#xD;
      study based on the initial evaluation, informed consent will be obtained. Baseline&#xD;
      information and medical history will be collected. Blood will be obtained at the time of CTA&#xD;
      (during intravenous cannula [IV] placement) for laboratory testing of cholesterol profile and&#xD;
      serum biomarkers. No genetic testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinically indicated coronary angiogram will not be delayed to complete the research&#xD;
      protocol. If the CTA scan cannot be scheduled prior to the clinically indicated coronary&#xD;
      angiogram the patient will not be enrolled in the trial. Consented patients will continue to&#xD;
      be evaluated for participation in the trial through the imaging period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Period The imaging period will consist of two tests: 1) ultra-high resolution CT&#xD;
      (UHR-CT) angiography; 2) conventional coronary angiography (CTA). All enrolled patients&#xD;
      referred for a clinically indicated catheterization will first a UHR-CT angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UHR-CT Imaging Patients will have one 18-20 gauge intravenous lines placed, preferably in an&#xD;
      antecubital vein for contrast administration. The patient will be hydrated with normal saline&#xD;
      intravenously (250 - 500 ml) prior to UHR-CT scanning. The patient will lie supine on the&#xD;
      scanner table and be attached to a 12 lead electrocardiographic monitor and an automated&#xD;
      blood pressure monitor. Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, and blood pressure will&#xD;
      be recorded and reviewed by one of the study investigators. Due to resultant artifacts from&#xD;
      precordial leads, the 12 ECG leads and electrodes will be removed and rhythm monitoring will&#xD;
      continue using the 3-lead system attached to the scanners monitoring system during scanning.&#xD;
      Patients may receive oral metoprolol and/or oral ivabradine 1-2 hours prior to the CT&#xD;
      according to a hospital approved heart rate control algorithm. Specifically, if the heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) is &gt;70 beats per minute, 50 mg of oral metoprolol will be given along with 15 mg of&#xD;
      oral ivabradine. If the heart rate is &gt;65 but lower than 70 beats per minute, 25 mg of oral&#xD;
      metoprolol will be given along with 15 mg of oral ivabradine. If the heart rate is &gt;60 beats&#xD;
      per minute but lower than 65 beats, only 15 mg of ivabradine is given. If HR remains &gt;60&#xD;
      beats per minute after 60 minutes post initial dosing of metoprolol and ivabradine, a second&#xD;
      doses of 25-50 mg oral metoprolol is given. Scout images for determining scanning range will&#xD;
      be obtained in the anterior-posterior and lateral views. Patients with systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure ≥110 will receive 0.8 mg sublingual nitroglycerin for vasodilation. The adequate&#xD;
      calcium score scan protocol will be confirmed on the scanner for each participant prior to&#xD;
      the initiation of the calcium score scan. Patients will then be asked to hold patients'&#xD;
      breath (approximately 10-15 seconds) and non-contrast CT imaging will be performed starting&#xD;
      just cranial to the coronary ostia and extending just caudal to the apex of the heart in&#xD;
      order to obtain a coronary calcium score. To limit radiation exposure, a coronary calcium&#xD;
      score will only be generated for patients who have not previously been stented as the&#xD;
      presence of stents affects the accuracy of the calcium score. CT angiogram will then be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the coronaries using iodine contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UHR-CT Protocol for Coronary Angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If no previous stents, coronary calcium scan will be performed using the following&#xD;
           protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CT Imaging: tube voltage = 120 kilovolt (kV), tube current = 140 milliAmpere (mA),&#xD;
                gantry rotation speed = 0.275 seconds, slice thickness = 0.25 mm, rows = 100, range&#xD;
                = 40 mm. Estimated radiation dose = 1.0-2.5 milli-Sievert (mSv).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Coronary arterial imaging Coronary arterial imaging will be performed during a 4-6&#xD;
           ml/sec intravenous iodinated contrast iohexol (Omnipaque-350) infusion for a total&#xD;
           volume of 60-100 ml. The automated bolus tracking feature will be used to judge contrast&#xD;
           bolus arrival and optimize image quality. Bolus tracking will result in approximately&#xD;
           0.7-1.2 mSv radiation dose to the patient (weight dependent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be prospectively triggered using ECG gating which reduces radiation exposure to&#xD;
      the patient compared to retrospective gating. The estimated range of radiation dose for CT&#xD;
      coronary angiography will be 3.2-8.0 mSv depending on patient size and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total estimated radiation dose, including calcium scoring, bolus tracking, and CT coronary&#xD;
      angiography, will therefore range between 4.9-11.7 mSv. For comparison, a standard nuclear&#xD;
      stress test typically results in a radiation dose of 10-12 mSv to the patient. Diagnostic&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization for conventional coronary angiography typically averages 12 mSv&#xD;
      radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT raw data and reconstructed data will be saved by the site for at least 2 years after&#xD;
      completion of the study. Within 3 weeks of the CTA, the CTA will be reviewed for non-cardiac&#xD;
      findings by a locally qualified, institutionally approved radiologist, and reported. The&#xD;
      investigator will report these findings to the patient's clinical physician and patient in a&#xD;
      timely fashion preferably prior to or during the 30-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-catheterization serum creatinine should be obtained post CTA (per local standard, or&#xD;
      preferably &gt; 3 days post CTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Coronary Angiography Patients will undergo patients' clinically indicated&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography, within 60 days of CT imaging with a recommended&#xD;
      goal of completing all imaging within 30 days. A time window of ≥ 48 hours is recommended&#xD;
      between CT imaging and conventional coronary angiography to minimize cumulative risk of&#xD;
      contrast exposure from these two tests. Coronary angiography guidelines to obtain optimum&#xD;
      angles and images for comparison will be enforced. Isocenter calibration will be performed&#xD;
      for all studies to enable quantitative flow reserve (QFR) assessment. Intracoronary&#xD;
      nitroglycerine will be administered (150-200 mcg) prior to first image of the left coronary&#xD;
      artery system and right coronary artery. This is to standardize the vasomotor state of the&#xD;
      coronary artery and eliminate any potential for catheter-induced changes (i.e., catheter&#xD;
      induced spasm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional-flow-reserve (FFR) assessment will be performed as clinically indicated but not&#xD;
      solely for research purposes. Coronary angiographic images will be saved in the universal&#xD;
      DICOM format and forwarded to the Angiographic Core Laboratory for Quantitative Coronary&#xD;
      Angiographic Analysis. Quantitative coronary analysis (QCA) will be performed using standard,&#xD;
      validated analysis software from Pie Medical Systems. QFR will be performed using a dedicated&#xD;
      software (QFR, Medis Medical Imaging Systems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-catheterization serum creatinine should be obtained per local standard, or preferably&#xD;
      within 48-72h post invasive coronary angiogram. Primary Objective The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to generate preliminary data in support of the hypothesis that noninvasive&#xD;
      UHR-CT is not inferior to invasive coronary angiography by cardiac catheterization for&#xD;
      identifying patients with hemodynamically significant CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives include testing the diagnostic accuracy of UHR-CT&#xD;
      vs. cardiac catheterization on a vessel and segment based analysis, comparison of UHR-CT&#xD;
      Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) to conventional angiography, and comparison of adverse events&#xD;
      and radiation doses between the CT and conventional angiography groups.&#xD;
