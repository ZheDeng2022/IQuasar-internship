  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the proposed research is to test the effect of a culturally centered&#xD;
      treatment protocol, the Socio-cognitive behavioral therapy (SCBT), versus Treatment as Usual&#xD;
      on suicidal thoughts and attempts, and depressive symptoms, in a clinical sample of Latinx&#xD;
      adolescents. The study is trying to determine, if we take into account perspectives of Latin&#xD;
      immigrant families and minority youth, whether better outcomes can be found for this high&#xD;
      risk group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research program is to provide effective culturally relevant care to&#xD;
      Latin families, and address the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities&#xD;
      (NIMHD) mission of reducing disparities in underserved and minority populations.&#xD;
      Evidence-based and culturally centered treatments for Latinx teens (Latinx = gender inclusive&#xD;
      term) with suicidal ideation and attempts (SIA) and their families are quite limited.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence indicate that Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment&#xD;
      approach in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts in Non-Latinx White adolescents. However,&#xD;
      culturally adapted treatments have been shown to benefit Latin families more that&#xD;
      non-culturally adapted treatments. This study is innovative in its use of a culturally&#xD;
      centered CBT treatment protocol (Socio-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicidal&#xD;
      Behavior-SCBT-SB) to address the specific needs of Latinx teens and their families. The&#xD;
      SCBT-SB, is a modified version of two CBT protocols, which addresses central issues in&#xD;
      adolescent identity formation (e.g. ethnicity, sexual orientation), family interactions and&#xD;
      communication, and parenting skills. The SCBT-SB was developed with Latinx youth with SIA in&#xD;
      Puerto Rico and further modified for Latin families in the US. Feasibility of this modified&#xD;
      version of the SCBT-SB was tested in the US by conducting a pilot randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) (n=46) of SCBT vs treatment-as-usual (TAU) with positive results. It was found that&#xD;
      SCBT-SB was feasible to implement in a community mental health center with frontline&#xD;
      therapists, acceptable to families, and showed reductions in suicidal ideation and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. The scientific premise of the proposed study is that immigration and acculturation&#xD;
      (the process of assimilation to the host culture) and enculturation (maintaining cultural&#xD;
      values and costumes) experiences have an impact on SIA in Latinx teens; and that&#xD;
      personalization of an evidence-based treatment, according to cultural and immigration&#xD;
      experiences, will result in better treatment outcomes than TAU. This application proposes a&#xD;
      hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial with 160 suicidal Latinx teens randomly assigned,&#xD;
      following baseline assessment, to 2 treatment conditions, TAU and SCBT-SB. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessment will take place at 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline. All treatment will take&#xD;
      place at a community mental health clinic. The specific aims are: 1) To test the effect of&#xD;
      the SCBT-SB versus TAU on suicidal ideation in a clinical sample of adolescents under&#xD;
      conditions of strong external validity, and 2) To test the effect of the SCBT-SB versus TAU&#xD;
      on depressive symptoms, given its high correlation with SIA. Exploratory aims are: 3) To&#xD;
      examine the effect of SCBT-SB versus TAU on suicide attempts, and 4) To examine potential&#xD;
      mediators (family environment) of treatment outcome. Successful completion of this study will&#xD;
      positively impact treatment of Latinx immigrant adolescents at high risk of SIA in the US.&#xD;

    <description>The SCBT-SB is a manualized and flexible intervention that uses a modular approach to the treatment of adolescent suicidality. After the first mandatory module (Crisis module), and at the end of each subsequent module, the therapist works with the teen and caregivers to determine the next one. The Crisis Module is fixed and represent the intervention core skills with 9 sessions. The optional coping skills modules include Thoughts, Emotional Regulation, Family Communication, Social Interaction, Activity, Trauma, and Substance Use.</description>
