  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is an important procedure for patients undergoing a surgery. When&#xD;
      awakening is required after the surgery, the supply of anesthetic gas is terminated together&#xD;
      with the administration of reversal drugs. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were the main&#xD;
      drugs of choice in the past, most of the patients will awake in 15 to 30 minutes. The&#xD;
      breathing circuit will then be extracted when patient breathing has recovered to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sugammadex, a new generation reversal drug, is a type of selective relaxant-binding agent&#xD;
      which recover patient muscle and breathing activities at around 3 minutes. In comparison with&#xD;
      neostigmine, sugammadex has a shorter awakening time and lower risk of bradycardia,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea vomiting, and postoperative residual paralysis. However, the drug has&#xD;
      not been widely applied in Taiwan because it is not covered by the national insurance. We&#xD;
      believe it would the patients to understand the characteristics of sugammadex in fair&#xD;
      perspectives and increase the operation power of surgical rooms if shared decision making&#xD;
      with the use of Patient Decision Aids (PDAs) is used during anesthesia consultation.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PDA was developed to be administered during anethesia consultation for surgical patients.&#xD;
      We expect the PDA would benefit the intervention group in the aspects of knowledge and&#xD;
      communication in choosing reversal drugs.The aim of this study is to conduct a multicenter&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the benefit of PDAs on decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision aids are interventions designed to help surgical patients with general anethesia to&#xD;
      choose their options of neostigmine or sugammadex by providing information on those options.&#xD;
      In this multicenter RCT, surgical patients are randomly divided into SDM and control groups.&#xD;
      In control group, patients will receive details of anesthesia using single introductory&#xD;
      sheet. In SDM group, PDA will be used as a tool to explain the benefits and harms between the&#xD;
      traditional reversal drugs and sugammadex. And by following SDM principles, the patients are&#xD;
      guided to consider their individual values and preferences and helped to make a choice that&#xD;
      best meet their needs. This study will be conducted in 2 hospitals (Shuang Ho Hospital and&#xD;
      Chi Mei Medical Center). The outcomes are decision conflicts and decision-making difficulties&#xD;
      after consultation of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of the SDM group are predicted to have lower decisional conflict scores and&#xD;
      higher knowledge scores when compared with controlled group. Our study hopes to support the&#xD;
      efficacy of PDAs in helping surgical patients to make a choice that best meet their needs.&#xD;
