  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of nivolumab in combination with decitabine and&#xD;
      venetoclax and to see how well they work in treating patients with TP53-mutated acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine and venetoclax, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This study is being done to find out whether&#xD;
      giving nivolumab, decitabine, and venetoclax is better or worse than the usual approach for&#xD;
      TP53-mutated acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary data regarding the safety and tolerability of decitabine and&#xD;
      venetoclax in combination with nivolumab when given for frontline therapy in TP53 mutated&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain preliminary data regarding the rate of complete remission (CR), complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete hematological recovery (CRh), and complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery (CRi) in TP53 mutated AML who are treated with decitabine and&#xD;
      venetoclax in combination with nivolumab for frontline therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To obtain preliminary data regarding&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) for TP53 mutated AML patients receiving combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain preliminary data regarding the overall survival (OS) for TP53 mutated patients&#xD;
      receiving this combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To obtain preliminary data regarding minimal residual disease through monitoring TP53&#xD;
      mutational burden prior and throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To obtain preliminary data regarding the frequency of graft versus host disease (GVHD)&#xD;
      including veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in patients who subsequently receive allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation after this combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 15 of cycle 1&#xD;
      and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, decitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-10 of&#xD;
      induction cycle 1 (and cycles 2 and 3 if needed), and venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients who achieve a CR or CRi receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 15, decitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5, and venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;

          -  Risks from venetoclax and nivolumab to the developing human fetus cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
             For this reason and because decitabine is known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Contraception use should be continued 6 months after&#xD;
             the completion of all study treatments for women of child bearing potential. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 7 months after&#xD;
             completion of decitabine, venetoclax, or nivolumab administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Patients with impaired decision-making are allowed to participate as long as the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of prior allogeneic transplantation. This is due to this being a&#xD;
             pilot study with a limited number of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known autoimmune disease. Patients with active autoimmune disease or&#xD;
             history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function&#xD;
             or require immune suppressive treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be&#xD;
             excluded. These include but are not limited to patients with a history of immune&#xD;
             related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy,&#xD;
             Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as&#xD;
             systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients&#xD;
             with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or&#xD;
             phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or&#xD;
             exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including&#xD;
             thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids&#xD;
             are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's&#xD;
             syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive&#xD;
             serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be&#xD;
             evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic&#xD;
             treatment but should otherwise be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to&#xD;
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hyperleukocytosis requiring immediate cytoreductive chemotherapy (WBC &gt;=&#xD;
             100,000 with symptoms of leukostasis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolated extramedullary leukemia of central nervous system (CNS) involvement with&#xD;
             leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to decitabine, venetoclax, or nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because fetal risk has been demonstrated&#xD;
             with decitabine with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with decitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with decitabine. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study&#xD;
