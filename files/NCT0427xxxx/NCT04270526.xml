  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing two&#xD;
      pre-treatment protocols for patients undergoing intradetrussor botox injections to determine&#xD;
      if a buffered lidocaine solution offers superior pain control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine is a commonly used amide-type local anesthetic. Lidocaine exists as both a&#xD;
      quaternary water soluble structure, and a tertiary lipid-soluble structure. Only the tertiary&#xD;
      lipid-soluble structure can cross the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane and thereby enter a&#xD;
      neurons axoplasm and induce the desired effect. The ionization constant of lidocaine is 7.7&#xD;
      which means that at a pH of 7.7, 50% of lidocaine is available in the tertiary lipid-soluble&#xD;
      structure. At a physiologic pH between 7.35 and 7.45 only around 44% of lidocaine is in the&#xD;
      tertiary lipid-soluble structure. However, for lidocaine to be stable in solution, it is&#xD;
      typically formulated as a hydrochloride salt and the pH of most commercially available&#xD;
      lidocaine solutions are at a pH of 6.09. In an acidic solution the majority of lidocaine is&#xD;
      available in the quaternary water-soluble structure and at this pH only 2.5% of lidocaine is&#xD;
      in the tertiary lipid-soluble structure. A Cochrane review found that increasing the pH of&#xD;
      lidocaine prior to injection decreased pain and increased patient satisfaction perhaps&#xD;
      because of the aforementioned pharmacokinetic principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine is typically used as anesthetic for intradetrussor injections of onabotulinum toxin&#xD;
      A for the treatment of refractory overactive bladder. In 2003, a technique for intradetrussor&#xD;
      injections of onabotulinum toxin A was first described using only local anesthesia. At that&#xD;
      time, the procedure involved intrauerthral lidocaine. The procedure has evolved since that&#xD;
      time and currently many physicians utilize protocols with both utraurethral and intravesical&#xD;
      lidocaine. At baseline intradetrusor onabotulinum toxin A injections are generally well&#xD;
      tolerated and with reported mean VAS scores around 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with refractory overactive bladder, the standard of care is intradetrussor&#xD;
      onabotulinum toxin A injections. The standard protocol used by the investigators involves&#xD;
      emptying the bladder then retrograde filling the bladder with a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine&#xD;
      normal saline. This solution remains in the bladder for approximately 15 minutes prior to&#xD;
      injection. Given that urine is typically acidic and commercially available lidocaine&#xD;
      solutions are similarly acidic, it is likely that only a fraction of intravesical lidocaine&#xD;
      is in the active tertiary lipid-soluble form. The goal of this study is to determine if the&#xD;
      investigators can improve the procedural pain of intradetrusor onabotulinum toxin A&#xD;
      injections using a buffered solution compared to our standard solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval by the IRB, investigators will approach possible participants who are having&#xD;
      intradetrussor botox injection for overactive bladder which is the standard of care for&#xD;
      patients with refractory overactive bladder. If the patient meets eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      consent forms will be signed and the patient will be randomized 1:1 to receive either our&#xD;
      standard pretreatment regimen with 50 mL 1% lidocaine + 50ml of 0.9% normal saline or our&#xD;
      buffered bicarbonate protocol with 50 mL 1% lidocaine + 45ml of 0.9% normal saline + 5 mL&#xD;
      8.4% sodium bicarbonate. The primary end point of this trial is to assess the pain scores&#xD;
      measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) immediately following the procedure. Secondary end&#xD;
      points include patient satisfaction, willingness to undergo repeat treatment and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be randomized 1:1 at the first intervention visit to one of the two&#xD;
      protocols using a random block design . At the completion of the procedure, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a brief questionnaire about their experience. Patients will follow up in&#xD;
      clinic for a post-void residual check two weeks after the procedure as is standard for our&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
