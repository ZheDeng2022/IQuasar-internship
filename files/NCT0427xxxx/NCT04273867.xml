      The objective of this study is to administer and validate a disease-specific health related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQOL) survey for patients with Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (CHP).&#xD;
      The survey items have been developed and revised from prior qualitative research with CHP&#xD;
      patients. Potential participants will be recruited from WCMC, the Pulmonary Fibrosis&#xD;
      Foundation (PFF) Registry and outside physician referral for the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to sign informed consent. At the initial visit participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the survey and two additional PROs needed for concurrent validity testing. Participants will&#xD;
      then be asked to complete the HRQOL survey under study a second time 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      initial visit for test-re-test reliability testing. Pulmonary function testing and six minute&#xD;
      walk test results will be collected. Pertinent demographic and clinical information will be&#xD;
      collected from the patients and their medical records or registry data (if a PFF Registry&#xD;
      participant). All information will be entered into a REDCap database for secure data&#xD;
      management and storage. Psychometric testing will be performed on the overall survey&#xD;
      instrument and the individual items in order to test validity and reliability. The goal is&#xD;
      that the survey developed will be a reliable and valid measurement tool for use in both&#xD;
      clinical practice and research settings.&#xD;

        the EMR for patients with diagnosis of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, multi-disciplinary&#xD;
        conference discussions of patients with a diagnosis of Chronic Hypersensitivity&#xD;
        Pneumonitis, physician Referrals from both WCM and local outside institutions, recruitment&#xD;
