  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-arm study of endoscopic resection (ER) following concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy for stage I esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, to find if the treatment&#xD;
      combination is useful by assessing its safety and efficacy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy after&#xD;
      endoscopic resection in early stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness, including 3-year OS, DFS, LRFS, DMFS, LCR, DMR and QOF, and analyzing the&#xD;
      toxicity and side effects in 3 years follow-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study preliminarily explored the recurrence patterns of solely ER for early esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma with high risk factors, analyzed the rationality of target areas and&#xD;
      dose choices in the treatment regimen of concurrent chemoradiotherapy after ER, and proposed&#xD;
      modification schemes of the target area and dose of radiotherapy. Prospectively acquired&#xD;
      hematological samples and tissue samples during the treatment will be tested for genetic&#xD;
      testing, single-cell genome sequencing, transcriptome and epigenomic analysis, to screen the&#xD;
      population with high risk of recurrence or the population who will benefit from this&#xD;
      treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of sample size, The estimates of survival rate at 3 years for operation group is&#xD;
      85.1% (95% CI: 82.0%, 87.7%) based on SEER study. Assuming that the survival rate at 3 years&#xD;
      for ER+CRT is about 90.7%. The difference between operation and ER+CRT is marginal and&#xD;
      clinically meaningless. In our study, we will target to establish that the ER+CRT is&#xD;
      non-inferiority to operation in term of survival rate at 3 years, and further investigate the&#xD;
      benefit of ER+CRT in safety profile and quality of life. A non-inferiority margin 10% is&#xD;
      applied with respect to 85.1%. A number of 50 subjects is adequate to achieve 80% statistical&#xD;
      power under a type one error rate 0.025 one-sided. The power analysis is based on simulation,&#xD;
      10000 iterations are carried out, Greenwood's method is applied.&#xD;
