    <textblock>
      Background: OHCA is a rare condition for children and young adults. Overall incidence rates&#xD;
      are reported as 3.3-5.97 per 100.000 inhabitants. Previous studies from different data&#xD;
      sources have identified a diverse and slightly incompatible etiologies. The purpose of this&#xD;
      investigation was to analyze presumed etiologies of pediatric OHCA and report incident and&#xD;
      survival rates. Further the investigators wish to present central characteristics of&#xD;
      pediatric OHCA in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data will be collected from the verified 2016-2019 Danish OHCA register. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were age ≤ 16 years at the time of the event. All included EMS reports will read by&#xD;
      two authors [MGH and TWJ] and the presumed reversible cause assigned to each case. Incidence&#xD;
      rates per 100.000 citizens, survival rates to hospital, initial rhythm, use of AED by&#xD;
      laypersons, EMS treatment and presumed etiology are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test feasibility a study was conducted in 2018, on the 56 verified cases of children with&#xD;
      OHCA was reported in the capital region of Denmark in 2016-2018 (among 1.8 million&#xD;
      inhabitants). Incident rates were 0.83-1.34 per 100.000 inhabitants per year. Preliminary&#xD;
      data show survival to hospital was 46% which was markedly higher than the adult population&#xD;
      (28%, p = 0.002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common cause of OHCA was hypoxia (50%) followed by trauma/hypovolemia (14%) and&#xD;
      others (7%). Approximately 23% did not present with an apparent etiology. Hereditary&#xD;
      disorders as the primary cause was noted in 7% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conclusion from the feasibility study is that the study is possible and that a reasonable&#xD;
      proportion of pediatric OHCA can be analyzed from EMS medical reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables included in the study: age, gender, initial rhythm, etiology of cardiac arrest,&#xD;
      event location, observation of occurrence, cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (CPR),&#xD;
      defibrillation and use automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), EMS-response time,&#xD;
      hospitalization, return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC), state at hospital admission,&#xD;
      30-day survival, airway management and use of epinephrine. See the dedicated study protocol&#xD;
      for an extended description of the variables and associated analyses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background In 2016 the Danish Emergency Medical Services (EMS) introduced a nationwide&#xD;
      electronic medical reporting system. This provided new possibilities for exploring many of&#xD;
      the aspects surrounding the daily practice the EMS, including information on selective&#xD;
      subgroups of cardiac arrest patients. The Danish out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA)&#xD;
      registry is based on electronic EMS reports together with a strenuous manual validation&#xD;
      process. The product is a solid base for identification and verification of OHCA. Whenever a&#xD;
      cardiac arrest is identified, EMS medical reports can be accessed supplying information on&#xD;
      the background, observations and treatments that can be extracted systematically. The gain of&#xD;
      insight from this process, provide us with the possibility to explore several novel aspects&#xD;
      of pediatric OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OHCA is a rare event in pediatric populations with varying reports of incidence rates,&#xD;
      ranging from 3.3 to 19.7 per 100.000 person years. Most studies, however, are centered around&#xD;
      an incidence rate of about 8-9/100.000 person years. Generally, increased incidence rates are&#xD;
      reported for infants compared to older children, and discrepancies in the overall incidence&#xD;
      rates could partly be explained by different age-caps when defining the pediatric population.&#xD;
      These inconsistencies unfortunately underline a general trend in pediatric OHCA studies, with&#xD;
      different term definitions and data validation obscuring the overall overview and&#xD;
      complicating more in-depth aggregate analyses. This calls for more high-quality data sources,&#xD;
      including data validation, and a more strict adherence to standardized reporting templates&#xD;
      such as the Utstein style for pediatric advanced life support (PALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unquestionably, pediatric settings of cardiac arrest embarks an inherent urge to perform&#xD;
      beyond ones supreme, but though discrepancies exist, overall survival is reported to be less&#xD;
      than 11%, with 30-day survival ranging from 8.1% to 11%, and survival until hospital&#xD;
      discharge ranging from 2% to 10.9%. This leads to a potential for improvement, which requires&#xD;
      first and foremost clarification of the most obvious causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of OHCA is often categorized by cardiac or non-cardiac etiology as an object of&#xD;
      prevention and post-mortem determination. However, OHCA in children are less likely to be a&#xD;
      primary cardiac event. When the focus is solely on increasing survival, reversible causes is&#xD;
      more often the focus and is labelled a key component of adult advanced resuscitation&#xD;
      algorithms. The most commonly used denomination for reversible causes to consider during&#xD;
      advanced life support is &quot;H's&quot; (Hypoxia, Hypovolemia, Hydrogen ion (acidosis),&#xD;
      Hypo-/hyperkalemia and Hypothermia) and &quot;T's&quot;(Toxins, Tamponade cardiac, Tension&#xD;
      pneumothorax, Thrombosis, pulmonary and Thrombosis coronary). Likewise, PALS operate in &quot;H's&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;T's&quot;, and more often than not, prescribe a primary focus on hypoxia as the most&#xD;
      prominent reversible cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators speculate that the EMS medical reports provide new and central information&#xD;
      about etiology and, perhaps more central to survival, reversible causes of pediatric OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The purpose of this analysis is to describe the incidence, presumed etiology and&#xD;
      survival-rates for pediatric OHCA within a four-year period in a Danish setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is a registry-based follow-up, including prehospital medical record&#xD;
      registrations of pediatric EMS patients in Denmark in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 with cardiac&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data source:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis will be based on data from the national verified Danish OHCA registry. In,&#xD;
      Denmark all cases of OHCA with resuscitative attempts are immediately followed up with&#xD;
      recording of specific data, including EMS reports, aimed at the registry. In 2016 the&#xD;
      registry became electronic, as one central database enabling an easier approach to research&#xD;
      on OHCA. The registry contains approximately 5.400 registrations of OHCA annually. These&#xD;
      composed of active entries, as well as advanced text searches of prehospital patient charts&#xD;
      maximizing the likelihood of identifying and collecting all possible cardiac arrests. In a&#xD;
      large validation process, all identified cases are read through manually by an external&#xD;
      verification team, ensuring a high standard of data quality. During this process, several&#xD;
      additional data sources is coupled with each registered OHCA, notably survival, initiation of&#xD;
      bystander CPR and actions from EMS personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of pediatric cardiac arrests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The external verification team indirectly mark cases as pediatric, whenever a subject is less&#xD;
      than 16 years of age at the time of the event. This together with age derived from individual&#xD;
      personal identification numbers is used to identify all pediatric cases. All Danish citizens&#xD;
      is provided with a unique personal identification number at birth, containing the individuals&#xD;
      date-of-birth. Subjects reported as unquestionably deceased (late signs of death) at EMS&#xD;
      arrival will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of presumed causes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three individual raters [MGH, TWJ and NB] will independently review all cases for an&#xD;
      assessment of the suspected cause of arrest and assign a presumed reversible cause based on&#xD;
      &quot;H's&quot; and &quot;T's&quot; alongside a free-text description for justification. Disagreement will be&#xD;
      resolved by third party members [HCC, SM or FL]. If a case does not present with any obvious&#xD;
      information indicating a reversible cause or with several competing reversible causations,&#xD;
      the cases will be denoted as &quot;NA&quot; and &quot;Inconclusive&quot; respectively. If a case is obviously a&#xD;
      result of a chronic disease and no reversible causality was possible the case will be noted&#xD;
      &quot;non-reversible&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: Age will be defined as the subject age at the time of the event. Subjects will be&#xD;
           stratified into four age-groups, including; infants (&lt;1 years of age), pre-school&#xD;
           children (1-5 years of age), school children (6-12 years of age) and teenagers (&gt;12&#xD;
           years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender: Gender will be defined as either male, female or undetermined, and derived from&#xD;
           personal identification numbers. In the expected minority of cases without a number,&#xD;
           gender will, as far as possible, be defined based on EMS-charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial rhythm: The initial rhythm will be defined as the first rhythm observed by EMS&#xD;
           personnel, and categorized as either shockable, non-shockable (asystole), non-shockable&#xD;
           (other) and undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etiology of cardiac arrest: Presumed etiology will be categorized as either reversible&#xD;
           (including a subcategorization into the 4H's and 4T's) and non-reversible. Further, the&#xD;
           investigators aim to categorize the preceding event, stratifying this into either; a&#xD;
           medical cause, trauma, drug overdose, drowning, asphyxia, sports-related or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Event location: This will be classified as either; private home, public space, outdoor&#xD;
           nature or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation of occurrence: Arrests will be classified as either unwitnessed, bystander&#xD;
           witnessed or EMS-witnessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (CPR): CPR will include bystander initiated and EMS&#xD;
           treatment with CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defibrillation and use automatic external defibrillators (AEDs): Defibrillation will&#xD;
           include defibrillation by bystanders and/or EMS personnel, including the use of publicly&#xD;
           available AEDs that have analyzed the rhythm without delivering shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EMS-response time: This will include the time between a dispatcher receiving the&#xD;
           emergency call and the arrival of the first EMS-personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization: This will be categorized as either; transported to hospital or declared&#xD;
           dead by EMS-personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC): ROSC will be defined as cases achieving ROSC&#xD;
           anytime between recognition of the event and termination (defined as either hospital&#xD;
           admission og declaration of death by EMS-personnel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State at hospital admission: The investigators will define the case state on arrival at&#xD;
           the hospital as either; ROSC or ongoing CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival: Survival will be defined as ROSC at the time of hospital admission, further&#xD;
           the investigators will include rates for 30-day survival derived with data from the&#xD;
           National Patient Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway management: The investigators aim to describe the airway maneuvers performed on&#xD;
           each case by listing the use of nasopharyngeal airways, oropharyngeal airways,&#xD;
           endo-tracheal intubation, supraglottic airways and isolated bag-valve-mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of epinephrine: This will include a binary (yes/no) variable based upon the&#xD;
           potential administration of epinephrine for each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and presentation of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to provide a descriptive analysis of the reversible causes&#xD;
      (H's and T's) in a Danish nationwide setting of pediatric OHCA. The secondary goal is to&#xD;
      provide updated annual incidence- and survival rates. Descriptive statistics will include the&#xD;
      variables listed above with a denotation of the absolute numbers with percentages and&#xD;
      stratified in the specified age-groups. Comparative analyses, addressing between age-group&#xD;
      differences, will be performed using non-parametric statistics. The data will be&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymized all analyses will be performed on an aggregated nationwide level. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is ROSC at hospital admission, in relation to reversible causes and&#xD;
      age-groups. The secondary outcome is 30-day survival in relation to reversible causes. Final&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared to a control-group of adult OHCA with an aim to quantify&#xD;
      differences in survival including influencing variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study, the investigators initiated a pilot project based on available data&#xD;
      (from 2016-2019) from the capital region of Denmark within the verified Danish OHCA registry.&#xD;
      The aim was to investigate the feasibility of the proposed methods. The investigators&#xD;
      identified 56 cases and were able to deduct a presumed cause in 73% of cases. Reasonably&#xD;
      amounts of information was attainable from exploration of the prehospital EMS-charts. The&#xD;
      other Danish regions will provide data with a similar setup, and hence the investigators&#xD;
      expect the presumed methods to be feasible at a nationwide level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective The descriptive part of this study will provide updated realistic numbers on&#xD;
      pediatric OHCA from a thoroughly reviewed, high-quality database. In addition, a review for&#xD;
      reversible causes will contribute to an understanding of the extent of cardiac arrests where&#xD;
      focus should be extended to involve more than hypoxia, including associated survival rates.&#xD;
