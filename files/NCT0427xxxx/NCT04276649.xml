      Aims:Retrospectively observe the effects of Caltrate supplementation on the clinical effect&#xD;
      of mesalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: From January 2015 to December 2020, through retrieving the clinical database of the&#xD;
      Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, patients with active UC who&#xD;
      accepted mesalazine treatment were enrolled. According to whether Caltrate was supplemented&#xD;
      at the same time, the patients were divided into supplementary group and non-supplementary&#xD;
      group. The modified Mayo score and several laboratory indicators were compared between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;

      1. The research has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated&#xD;
           Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. According to the &quot;Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&quot;&#xD;
           formulated by the Beijing Conference in 2018 as a standard, patients with clear&#xD;
           diagnosis of UC are collected. Exclusion criteria included: history of vitamin D&#xD;
           treatment within the previous 3 months; treated with glucocorticoids,&#xD;
           immunosuppressants, biologic agents, or colectomy during the follow-up; severe liver and&#xD;
           kidney dysfunction; other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess disease activity of UC participants based on the &quot;Mayo score&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. General information about participants with UC is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serum C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, albumin,&#xD;
           creatinine, calcium and phosphorus levels are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The level of serum 25 (OH) D of participants is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participants are divided into two groups, one group was given oral Caltrate 0.6g/d&#xD;
           +Mesalazine, and the other group only took Mesalazine .&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The above serum indicators are re-measured in the 12th month, and the condition of UC&#xD;
           participants is also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Follow-up for 12 months. By comparing the above indicators, observe that in the Han&#xD;
           population:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Can Caltrate supplementation increase serum 25 (OH) D levels in patients with UC?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Can Caltrate supplementation improve the condition of patients with UC?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Whether Caltrate works synergistically with Mesalazine?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. whether the effect of Caltrate on UC patients is affected by factors such as&#xD;
                disease site, disease activity, treatment, etc ..&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Through statistical analysis, comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
           Caltrate supplementation in Han patients with UC, providing a theoretical basis for&#xD;
           further &quot;precise treatment&quot; intervention in inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
