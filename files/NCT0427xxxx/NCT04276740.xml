  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with treatment phase&#xD;
      over 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a condition that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner&#xD;
      lining of the rectum and colon (the large bowel). In UC, ulcers develop on the surface of the&#xD;
      lining and these may bleed and produce mucus. Individuals with UC can become very unwell with&#xD;
      disabling bloody diarrhoea, uncontrollable bowel habit and profound tiredness. In very severe&#xD;
      cases, UC carry the risks of rupture of the inflamed bowel wall requiring an emergency&#xD;
      operation to remove the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MARVEL study investigates whether MitoQ is a beneficial drug treatment for UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies have shown that the inflamed UC gut lining releases 'danger signals' arising&#xD;
      from the mitochondria. These 'danger signals' attract immune cells and make inflammation&#xD;
      worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondria are the 'batteries' or 'power stations' that reside within, and provide energy&#xD;
      for living cells. In the gut lining of individuals with UC, the mitochondria are more prone&#xD;
      to damage that increases the release of these danger signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MitoQ protects the mitochondria and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesise that MitoQ will improve UC and allow the bowels to heal properly following a&#xD;
      disease flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MARVEL study, individuals with an active flare of UC requiring standard oral&#xD;
      Prednisolone will be given either MitoQ or placebo as a daily capsule for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will carry out an assessment after 12 and 24 weeks to find out if MitoQ&#xD;
      will result in higher rates of improvement in the participants' symptoms and gut lining&#xD;
      inflammation. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate if their UC will be better&#xD;
      controlled and that they are less likely to need further steroids or more potent forms of&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MitoQ has been shown to be safe in 2 large human clinical studies in Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      Hepatitis C, but the MARVEL study will be the first study in UC. At low doses, MitoQ is used&#xD;
      as a nutritional supplement that has an anti-oxidant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, many drug treatments in UC are very strong, expensive and aimed at suppressing the&#xD;
      immune system. If the MARVEL study provides supportive data, MitoQ can be a safe and&#xD;
      cost-effective new treatment that works at blocking the specific inflammatory signal found in&#xD;
      the gut lining of individuals with UC.&#xD;

    <description>MitoQ in inflammation: In the experimental setting, MitoQ has been extensively studied with clear mode of action on inflammatory mechanisms relevant to IBD:&#xD;
MitoQ can limit the damage to mitochondria caused by mitochondrial ROS and thereby reducing the leak and oxidisation of mtDNA that are critical to its pro-inflammatory actions within the cell.&#xD;
MitoQ reduces the inflammatory potential of mitochondrial DNA which have escaped or released from dying inflammatory cells.&#xD;
MitoQ can influence how the immune cells generate their energy, diverting it away from a more inflammatory type of metabolism (glycolysis)&#xD;
MitoQ can induce autophagy, a cellular recycling mechanism that removes damaged mitochondria. Defective autophagy is heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD.&#xD;
Hence collectively, MitoQ acts upstream of several pro-inflammatory mechanisms with the net effect to promote resolution of inflammation and mucosal healing.</description>
