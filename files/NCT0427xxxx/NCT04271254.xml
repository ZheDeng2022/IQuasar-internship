  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate the utility of simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in characterizing the molecular subtypes of clear cell renal&#xD;
      cell carcinomas (ccRCC) to potentially inform prognosis and treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Seventeen subjects diagnosed with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) will&#xD;
      be imaged in a single session on PET-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The investigators will image 17 ccRCC subjects on simultaneous PET-MRI&#xD;
      and quantify the metabolically-active fraction of the tumor from images. Ten core samples&#xD;
      will be taken from each tumor post-surgery and classified as ccA or ccB subtype using&#xD;
      transcriptome analysis. The imaging-based measures will be correlated with the fraction of&#xD;
      tumor cores classified as ccB.&#xD;

      Simultaneous PET/MR imaging [1]-[7] offers exciting opportunities to visualize and quantify&#xD;
      soft-tissue tumors [2]. MRI offers superb soft-tissue contrast for anatomical information as&#xD;
      well as a flexible suite of other techniques providing functional and physiological&#xD;
      information. PET offers sensitive molecular imaging via radioactive tracers and is widely&#xD;
      used for assessment of tumor glucose metabolism. Together, the two modalities provide&#xD;
      complementary, synergistic information. Because of MRI's superior soft-tissue contrast, it is&#xD;
      considered a much better anatomical guide for PET quantitative analyses for tumors in soft&#xD;
      tissue regions as compared to standard-of-care PET-CT. Simultaneous PET-MR also provides&#xD;
      inherently-aligned PET and MR, efficient simultaneous acquisition, and the opportunity for&#xD;
      new approaches to PET quantitative analysis guided by detailed MR images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonmetastatic clear cell renal cell carcinomas are generally treated with nephrectomy,&#xD;
      although research has subclassified them into two [8] or as many as four [9] subtypes based&#xD;
      on gene expression; the subtypes have been shown to have differing prognoses and progression&#xD;
      [8]-[11]. The investigators focus primarily on the two subtypes ccA and ccB [8] and ask&#xD;
      whether these two exhibit distinct PET-MRI imaging characteristics that can be used to&#xD;
      subtype them noninvasively. An eight-subject pilot study conducted on PET-MRI at UNC&#xD;
      demonstrated that quantitative PET-MRI imaging, using nonstandard measures incorporating the&#xD;
      entire tumor, was strongly correlated with presence or absence of ccB patterns in the tumors&#xD;
      [12]. Transcriptome analysis results from the study justified the import of PET in noting&#xD;
      that many of the upregulated genes associated with ccB were involved in glucose transport and&#xD;
      metabolism, the mediators of 18-FDG uptake. Thus, there is a strong biologic rationale as to&#xD;
      why PET-MRI could predict ccB burden, but the small number of subjects in that study limits&#xD;
      confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the fact that these tumors are highly heterogeneous suggests that imaging alone&#xD;
      provides an opportunity for early characterization of ccB burden across the entire tumor&#xD;
      where gene expression profiling would be invasive and costly. Also, with the excellent&#xD;
      soft-tissue contrast of MRI, the system has the potential for greater anatomical detail to&#xD;
      guide interpretation of FDG activity. UNC has one of the few PET-MR scanners in the country,&#xD;
      making it one of few centers in the US capable of conducting this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study of the use of combined PET-MR [1-7] for prediction of tumor&#xD;
      subtype composition in ccRCC. Additional data analysis using the prior study from UNC&#xD;
      suggests a strong correlation between the fraction of the tumor exhibiting moderate to high&#xD;
      FDG uptake and the number of cores found to be ccB type. These results guide the hypothesis&#xD;
      of this study: the metabolically-active tumor volume fraction derived from simultaneous&#xD;
      PET-MRI imaging of clear-cell renal cell carcinomas is correlated with the fraction of tumor&#xD;
      cores classified as ccB subtype from transcriptome analysis. If so, in the future,&#xD;
      application of PET-MRI may offer prognostic information and opportunities for risk&#xD;
      stratification.&#xD;
