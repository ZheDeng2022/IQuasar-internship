  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn if creative arts programs that include visual, musical, written, or&#xD;
      physical expression can reduce symptoms of burnout syndrome, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD), depression, and anxiety in critical care healthcare professionals. This study also&#xD;
      explores if creative arts can enhance the connection to the purpose of work, the development&#xD;
      of adequate coping skills, while providing time to connect with peers.&#xD;
