  <brief_summary>

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Anlotinib&#xD;
      and Sintilimab in advanced colorectal cancer as first-line treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit. Sintilimab is a fully human IgG4&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1), thereby blocking&#xD;
      the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands (PD-L1 and PL-L2) and consequently helping to&#xD;
      restore the endogenous antitumour T-cell response. In the present study, we design a&#xD;
      single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of Anlotinib and Sintilimab in advanced colorectal cancer as first-line&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
