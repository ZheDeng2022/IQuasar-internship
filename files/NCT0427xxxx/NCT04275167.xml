      This pilot study will test the feasibility and tolerability of the tethered OCT capsule and&#xD;
      Trans Nasal imaging probe for imaging the small intestine in subjects with EED and a matched&#xD;
      non-EED cohort. This study will assess subject tolerability, optimal imaging technique, and&#xD;
      imaging of EED features.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The laboratory has developed a minimally invasive screening method known as tethered capsule&#xD;
      endomicroscopy (TCE) for imaging intestinal mucosa. With TCE, an unsedated subject swallows a&#xD;
      tethered pill, which captures microscopic images of the entire esophagus, stomach, and small&#xD;
      intestine, as it is naturally transits these organs via peristalsis and under the influence&#xD;
      of gravity. The capsule implements a microscopic imaging technology called optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) that obtains 10-Âµm-resolution cross-sectional images of tissue. The&#xD;
      procedure is brief, well tolerated, and can be much less expensive than endoscopy. The&#xD;
      Investigators have implemented TCE for imaging the upper gastrointestinal tract of adults and&#xD;
      adolescents with Celiac Disease (CD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions that are common in the US. The qualities seen thus far in their TCE studies - high&#xD;
      imaging resolution, comprehensive tissue assessment, and minimal invasiveness - are also the&#xD;
      qualities needed for evaluating the intestinal mucosa in populations with EED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tearney Lab has also developed a new technique of deployment, Trans Nasal Endomicroscopy&#xD;
      (TNE). The TNE catheter comprises of an introduction tube, similar to a standard Nasojejunal&#xD;
      tube, with one or two balloons attached at the distal end. These balloons are inflated with&#xD;
      Galinstan, a safe liquid metal alloy used in pediatric thermometers, which provides weight&#xD;
      for the device to move to the duodenum under the forces of gravity and peristalsis.&#xD;
      Alternatively, a sugar water mixture /saline may also be used to inflate a balloon. The TNE&#xD;
      catheter encloses the OCT optics within, and is designed to have many of the same imaging&#xD;
      properties of TCE but is introduced Trans nasally so that it can be effectively used in&#xD;
      children and eventually infants.&#xD;
