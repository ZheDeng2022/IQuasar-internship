  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy (FA) is &quot;an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that&#xD;
      occurs reproducibly&quot; according to the 2010 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIAID/NIH)-supported Guidelines for the Diagnosis&#xD;
      and Management of Food Allergy in the United States (Boyce et al. 2010). Studies have&#xD;
      suggested that the natural history of FA has changed during the last two decades, with a&#xD;
      dramatic rise in the prevalence, severity of clinical manifestations, and risk of persistence&#xD;
      into later ages, leading to an increase in hospital admissions, medical visits, treatments,&#xD;
      and burden of care on families and to an important economic impact, with significant direct&#xD;
      costs for the families and healthcare system (Skripak et al. 2007; McBride et al. 2012; Gupta&#xD;
      et al. 2013). The development of FA might be influenced by genetics, environment, and&#xD;
      genome-environment interactions, leading to immune system dysfunction, mediated at least in&#xD;
      part by epigenetic mechanisms (Berni Canani et al. 2015; Paparo et al. 2018). Many factors&#xD;
      have been postulated to contribute to the onset of FA. Among dietary factors, it has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), present at high level in junk food,&#xD;
      could be involved in FA pathogenesis. AGEs are a heterogeneous group of compounds deriving&#xD;
      from a non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins,&#xD;
      lipids, or nucleic acids. This reaction is also known as the Maillard or browning reaction.&#xD;
      The formation of AGEs is a part of normal metabolism, but if excessively high levels of AGEs&#xD;
      are reached in tissues and the circulation they can become pathogenic. AGEs are naturally&#xD;
      present in uncooked animal-derived foods, and cooking results in the formation of new AGEs&#xD;
      within these foods. Consumption of AGE-rich diets is associated with elevated circulating and&#xD;
      tissue AGEs and an increase of their pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects. On the other&#xD;
      hand, restriction of AGEs prevents inflammation. AGEs not only exert their deleterious&#xD;
      actions due to their biological properties, but also through their interaction with specific&#xD;
      receptors (RAGE). AGEs are able to activate mast cells and induces a chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      state that promotes a Th2 type response. The aim of this study is to evaluate the AGEs levels&#xD;
      in FA children compared with healthy controls and subjects with other allergic diseases.&#xD;

      The study is designed to evaluate the AGEs concentration in allergic children compared with&#xD;
      healthy controls and to investigate the potential role of AGEs in FA pathogenesis. First, the&#xD;
      investigators will define subcutaneous AGEs levels in children affected by allergy, comparing&#xD;
      to non-allergy children AGEs levels. Subsequently, the investigators will investigate the&#xD;
      possible correlation with dietary habits and the potential effects of AGEs on gut barrier&#xD;
      components and on non-immune and immune mechanisms in experimental models.&#xD;

        Children with confirmed diagnosis of allergy and healthy controls consecutively observed at&#xD;
        our tertiary center for pediatric allergy will be evaluated for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
        Only subjects who will meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
        study. Anamnestic, demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data, as well as information&#xD;
        on use of drugs, pre-, pro- or symbiotic products will be collected. Also dietary habits&#xD;
        will be evaluated, particularly number, place and time of meals, special diets or&#xD;
        elimination diets, frequency of consumption of cereals and derivatives, meat products,&#xD;
        fish, eggs, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, legumes, sweets, sweetened beverages and&#xD;
        possibly alcoholic drinks and the corresponding cooking methods.&#xD;
