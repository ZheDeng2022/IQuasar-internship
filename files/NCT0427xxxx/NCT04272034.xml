    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation design to identify the maximum tolerated dose and/or pharmacologically active dose for INCB099318. Part 2 is an expansion at 1 or more dose levels to further explore safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacoketics, and pharmacodynamic effects.</intervention_model_description>
