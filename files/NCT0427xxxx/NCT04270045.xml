  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use forced oscillometry technique (FOT) to measure pulmonary&#xD;
      mechanics and function in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary function testing has been the standard of care to diagnose and evaluate response to&#xD;
      therapy in various respiratory diseases in adults and children. There are several equipment&#xD;
      and techniques that are FDA approved for these purposes. However, there are currently no lung&#xD;
      function tests that are practically feasible, clinically meaningful and widely used in&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a non-invasive method that had been used to measure&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics. FOT employs small amplitude pressure oscillations superimposed on the&#xD;
      normal breathing and therefore has the advantage over conventional lung function techniques&#xD;
      that it does not require the performance of respiratory maneuvers. To date, the use of this&#xD;
      technique is FDA approved in adults and children but remains largely experimental in infants&#xD;
      and newborns. THORASYS has recently developed a new respiratory function test device aimed&#xD;
      specifically at newborn and infants (0 - 2 years age group) called tremoflo N-100 (&quot;Neo&quot;).&#xD;
      This new device measures lung function in only a few minutes while the newborn or infant is&#xD;
      sleeping normally. It uses an adapted version of the Airwave Oscillometry (AOS) to calculate&#xD;
      the impedance of the lungs and quantify airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diuretics and bronchodilators are two on the most commonly used medications to ameliorate the&#xD;
      symptoms of BPD. The benefits of these therapies have not been shown to prevent the&#xD;
      development of BPD in a randomized control trial (RCT). More recently, there have been some&#xD;
      evidence from pharmacogenetic studies that the variability in bronchodilator responsiveness&#xD;
      in patients with asthma, (and possibly BPD) may lie on the gene encoding the B2-adrenergic&#xD;
      receptor (ADRB2) as well as within the associated G-protein receptor pathway, the nitric&#xD;
      oxide biosynthetic pathway and other novel loci identified in recent genome-wide studies.&#xD;
      This part of the study will be hypothesis generating to try to understand the variability in&#xD;
      bronchodilator response in infants with BPD.&#xD;

    <description>This non-invasive device will measure pulmonary mechanics in spontaneously breathing premature infants. Infant will be in supine position and breathing regularly. A cushioned mask will be placed on the infant's face, covering the nose and mouth. Measurements typically take less than 20 seconds and no more than 3 repetitions will be done at each time point.</description>
