  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community First Responders (CFRs) are trained members of the public, lay people or off-duty&#xD;
      healthcare staff who volunteer to provide first aid. CFRs help ambulance services to provide&#xD;
      care for people having health emergencies, from falls to road accidents to heart attacks, at&#xD;
      home or in public places. CFRs are particularly important in rural areas where it is more&#xD;
      difficult to provide or access emergency care, and where they are an important part of the&#xD;
      care workforce. CFRs are broadly perceived to be positive, however evidence is needed about&#xD;
      how they contribute to rural health services, which patients/conditions they attend, what&#xD;
      care they provide, how effective they are and at what cost, how they are perceived by&#xD;
      patients and other health workers, and how they could be developed to improve care for rural&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to develop recommendations for rural CFRs, by exploring their&#xD;
      contribution to rural care, evaluating their value for money, understanding experiences and&#xD;
      views of patients, CFRs and other healthcare staff, and exploring the potential for CFRs to&#xD;
      provide new services.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The project will involve the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyse records from six ambulance services to see: how many people CFRs attended; the&#xD;
           proportion of ambulance calls attended; age, sex and conditions of people attended; how&#xD;
           quickly CFRs attended and what happened to the patient(s) when the ambulance arrived.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate benefits and costs of CFRs attending rural emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interview patients/relatives, ambulance staff, GPs, funders, CFRs and CFR leads to&#xD;
           obtain views on rural CFR current and potential future roles. Interviews will also&#xD;
           explore with CFRs and CFR leads, challenges and solutions to recruiting, training,&#xD;
           retaining rural CFRs and ensuring safe, high quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Combine this knowledge (gained in steps1-3 above) to develop recommendations for change;&#xD;
           who will be involved and how services should change to solve the most pressing problems&#xD;
           for the rural communities served.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Present recommendations to a workshop of experts and public to agree priorities for&#xD;
           future development.&#xD;
