  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, single group, non-randomised, single oral dose study in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects designed to assess the mass balance recovery, PK, metabolite profile&#xD;
      and metabolite identification, and exploratory pharmacodynamics of acoziborole. It is planned&#xD;
      to enrol 6 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive an oral dose of 960 mg [14C] acoziborole on a single occasion as 4&#xD;
      capsules containing a small amount of radioactivity (not more than [NMT] 1000 nCi [37 KBq]&#xD;
      14C).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to further understand and quantify the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
      metabolism and elimination (ADME) of acoziborole in humans through the assessment of the mass&#xD;
      balance recovery after a single oral dose of [14C]-acoziborole. The routes and rates of&#xD;
      elimination of [14C]-acoziborole will be determined and plasma, urine and faecal samples will&#xD;
      be used for metabolic profiling and structural identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for inclusion in the study up to 28 days before dosing. Subjects&#xD;
      will be admitted in the evening on the day before dosing (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight fast of a minimum of 9&#xD;
      h, and will remain resident in the clinic until up to 240 h after dosing (up to Day 11).&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinical unit for 5 additional 48 h collection periods, admitting&#xD;
      to the clinical unit the evening before the collection period. The additional collection&#xD;
      periods will be on Days 14 to 17, 28 to 31, 58 to 61, 88 to 91 and 118 to 121. A follow up&#xD;
      call will take place 5 to 10 days post-final discharge to ensure the ongoing wellbeing of&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
