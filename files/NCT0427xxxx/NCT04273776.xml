  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate two pharmacotherapeutic approaches to&#xD;
      sleep induction, both of which have been shown to be effective hypnotics, but may have unique&#xD;
      side effect profiles. These profiles may have markedly different impacts on performance in a&#xD;
      military setting. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, the side&#xD;
      effects of these drugs will be compared - suvorexant, a dual orexin receptor antagonist and&#xD;
      zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist - in healthy controls&#xD;
      comparable in age and gender to the target military population.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study sessions will be randomized prior to the study (e.g. Session 1 = placebo, Session 2 = zolpidem, etc.) and volunteers will be assigned a session (treatment group) when they are scheduled for their enrollment visit (Day 1). The randomization schedule will be generated using a random number generator by a person who is not involved in data collection prior to commencement of the study, with the following qualification (hence &quot;pseudo-random&quot;): that all volunteers participating in the same session be randomized or &quot;blocked&quot; together (i.e., assigned the same condition). This will help ensure double-blinding since it may be obvious to volunteers and staff within the same session if some volunteers receive placebo whereas others receive active drug. To help maintain confidentiality, each participant will also be given a unique numerical identifier (e.g., 01-120).</masking_description>

&#xD;
        Healthy males and non-pregnant, non-lactating female volunteers must be between the ages of&#xD;
        18 and 39&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  learned English as a first language (inclusive)*.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be included in the study, volunteers will have to pass a &quot;Volunteer Comprehension&#xD;
             Assessment&quot; with a score of 80% or greater. A maximum of two attempts is permitted.&#xD;

             active (e.g., oral contraceptive, condom, intrauterine device, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Volunteers must have learned English as their first language. This is because&#xD;
                  there are cognitive tests administered during the study that require a mastery of&#xD;
                  the English language.&#xD;

             of a potential sleep disorder (e.g., use of a sleep aid for several nights following&#xD;
             travel across multiple time zones would not necessarily constitute evidence of a sleep&#xD;
             disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;

             no sequelae) may be deemed non-exclusionary at the discretion of the examining study&#xD;
             medical investigator.&#xD;
