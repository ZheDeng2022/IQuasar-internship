  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study the investigators have developed a novel biological age model. Assessing&#xD;
      biological age is the assessment of the present health status and functional&#xD;
      capacity/physiological reserve of that person in comparison with people of the same age and&#xD;
      sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the utility and validity of this novel biological age&#xD;
      model designed for health promotion in real world conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: This is a longitudinal study, where biological age assessment is conducted in&#xD;
      the first and final week of an 11-14 week lifestyle intervention course. These courses take&#xD;
      place at a Danish folk high school (Ubberup), which is specialized in performing intensive&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions targeting a 10% weight loss. The intention is to include 80 adult men&#xD;
      and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: This will take place at the facilities at Ubberup folk high school,&#xD;
      participants being overnight fasted and without having exercised for the previous 24 hours.&#xD;
      All analysis will be performed in investigators lab (Xlab) at the Department of Biomedical&#xD;
      Sciences, Copenhagen University. When all samples are analysed Biological age will be&#xD;
      calculated for each particpant.&#xD;
