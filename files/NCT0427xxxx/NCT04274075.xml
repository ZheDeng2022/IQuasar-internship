    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0 hour) and post-dose at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 hours on Day 1 and post-dose once a day on Days 2 to 8 of Periods 1-3 (up to 27 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters were determined where possible from the plasma concentrations of GDC-9545 using non-compartmental methods performed using Phoenix WinNonlin. The PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for GDC-9545 were analyzed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of GDC-9545 as a Phase 3 capsule formulation compared to a Phase 1 tablet formulation under fasted conditions (Treatment B vs. Treatment A) and to assess the food effect on GDC-9545 PK for a Phase 3 capsule formulation (Treatment C vs. Treatment B). The mixed-effect analysis of variance model for three-period crossover design was used for formulation comparison and fasted state and fed state comparison of capsule. The model included sequence, formulation, and period as fixed effects and a random effect for subject within sequence. An unstructured covariance structure was to be used; however, if it failed to converge, an alternative covariance structure may have been applied.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until 14 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 41 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with a participant. All AEs, whether reported by the participant or noted by study personnel, were recorded. All AEs were assigned a severity grade (from 1 to 5) using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0). Severity refers to the intensity of an AE. The following is the severity grading scale used for AEs that are not specifically listed in the NCI-CTCAE: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe or medically significant; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death related to an AE.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 2 and 8 of Period 1-3, and 12-14 days after last dose (up to 34 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants provided blood and urine samples at the specified timepoints for laboratory analysis of clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis parameters (please refer to Appendix A of the protocol for a complete list of parameters). Any of the laboratory test results that were outside of the reference range were considered abnormalities. Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event (AE). A laboratory test result was reported as an AE if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment; resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. All AEs were assigned a severity grade (from 1 to 5) using the NCI-CTCAE v5.0; for AEs not specifically listed in the NCI-CTCAE: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe or medically significant; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death related to an AE.</description>

    <description>A single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained at the specified timepoints. To minimize variability in autonomic tone and heart rate, participants rested quietly and in a supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to recording the ECG. Blood draws, other procedures, activity, and environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) were to be avoided during the pre-ECG resting period and between ECG recordings to minimize variability due to the effects of activity and stress on cardiac electrophysiology. Whenever possible, ECG tracings for each participant were to be obtained from the same type of machine throughout the study. The baseline value was defined as the last value recorded prior to the first dose in each treatment period. The following are the normal reference ranges for ECG interval durations in milliseconds (msec): PR [120-210 msec]; QRS [upper limit: &lt;120 msec]; QT, QTcB, and QTcF [upper limit: &lt;470 msec].</description>

        <title>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of GDC-9545</title>
        <description>The pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters were determined where possible from the plasma concentrations of GDC-9545 using non-compartmental methods performed using Phoenix WinNonlin. The PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for GDC-9545 were analyzed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of GDC-9545 as a Phase 3 capsule formulation compared to a Phase 1 tablet formulation under fasted conditions (Treatment B vs. Treatment A) and to assess the food effect on GDC-9545 PK for a Phase 3 capsule formulation (Treatment C vs. Treatment B). The mixed-effect analysis of variance model for three-period crossover design was used for formulation comparison and fasted state and fed state comparison of capsule. The model included sequence, formulation, and period as fixed effects and a random effect for subject within sequence. An unstructured covariance structure was to be used; however, if it failed to converge, an alternative covariance structure may have been applied.</description>

        <description>The pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters were determined where possible from the plasma concentrations of GDC-9545 using non-compartmental methods performed using Phoenix WinNonlin. The PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for GDC-9545 were analyzed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of GDC-9545 as a Phase 3 capsule formulation compared to a Phase 1 tablet formulation under fasted conditions (Treatment B vs. Treatment A) and to assess the food effect on GDC-9545 PK for a Phase 3 capsule formulation (Treatment C vs. Treatment B). The mixed-effect analysis of variance model for three-period crossover design was used for formulation comparison and fasted state and fed state comparison of capsule. The model included sequence, formulation, and period as fixed effects and a random effect for subject within sequence. An unstructured covariance structure was to be used; however, if it failed to converge, an alternative covariance structure may have been applied.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event by Severity, According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0)</title>
        <description>The investigator sought information on adverse events (AEs) at each contact with a participant. All AEs, whether reported by the participant or noted by study personnel, were recorded. All AEs were assigned a severity grade (from 1 to 5) using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0). Severity refers to the intensity of an AE. The following is the severity grading scale used for AEs that are not specifically listed in the NCI-CTCAE: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe or medically significant; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death related to an AE.</description>

All AEs were assigned a severity grade (from 1 to 5) using the NCI-CTCAE v5.0; for AEs not specifically listed in the NCI-CTCAE: Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe or medically significant; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death related to an AE.</description>

        <description>Vital signs (including oral temperature, respiratory rate, and supine blood pressure and pulse rate) were obtained at the specified timepoints. Supine blood pressure was obtained after the participant had been supine for at least 5 minutes. When vital signs were scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws were obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital signs were obtained as close to the scheduled blood draw as possible, but prior to the blood draw. The baseline value was defined as the last value recorded prior to the first dose in each treatment period. The normal reference range for supine systolic blood pressure was 90-140 millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</description>

        <description>A single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained at the specified timepoints. To minimize variability in autonomic tone and heart rate, participants rested quietly and in a supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to recording the ECG. Blood draws, other procedures, activity, and environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) were to be avoided during the pre-ECG resting period and between ECG recordings to minimize variability due to the effects of activity and stress on cardiac electrophysiology. Whenever possible, ECG tracings for each participant were to be obtained from the same type of machine throughout the study. The baseline value was defined as the last value recorded prior to the first dose in each treatment period. The following are the normal reference ranges for ECG interval durations in milliseconds (msec): PR [120-210 msec]; QRS [upper limit: &lt;120 msec]; QT, QTcB, and QTcF [upper limit: &lt;470 msec].</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate Over Time, as Measured by Electrocardiogram</title>
        <description>A single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained at the specified timepoints. To minimize variability in autonomic tone and heart rate, participants rested quietly and in a supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to recording the ECG. Blood draws, other procedures, activity, and environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) were to be avoided during the pre-ECG resting period and between ECG recordings to minimize variability due to the effects of activity and stress on cardiac electrophysiology. Whenever possible, ECG tracings for each participant were to be obtained from the same type of machine throughout the study. The baseline value was defined as the last value recorded prior to the first dose in each treatment period. The normal reference range for heart rate was 50-100 beats per minute.</description>
