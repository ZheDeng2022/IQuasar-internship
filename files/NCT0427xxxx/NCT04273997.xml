      Route of Administration: Cutaneous&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product and dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group A: Metronidazole 10% w/w ointment. A 2.5 cm strip of ointment (approximately&#xD;
      700 mg) will be administered topically to the wound together with suitable dressing, once&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose contains approximately 70 mg metronidazole in a formulation of white soft paraffin.&#xD;
      The Investigator will demonstrate to the subject how to apply a 2.5 cm of IMP and dress the&#xD;
      wound by applying the first dose and covering with a dry, gauze dressing which is to be&#xD;
      retained with tape. Larger wounds may require additional amount of IMP to ensure sufficient&#xD;
      cover of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator and dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group B: Placebo ointment. A 2.5 cm strip of ointment (approximately 700 mg) will&#xD;
      be administered topically to the wound together with suitable dressing, once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of placebo ointment contains titanium dioxide and white soft paraffin. The&#xD;
      Investigator will demonstrate to the subject how to apply a 2.5 cm of IMP and dress the wound&#xD;
      by applying the first dose and covering with a dry, gauze dressing which is to be retained&#xD;
      with tape. Larger wounds may require additional amount of IMP to ensure sufficient cover of&#xD;
      the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's participation in the study will last 10 weeks (including 2 week screening, 6&#xD;
      weeks clinical phase and 2 week follow-up phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited through surgical out-patient clinics who will be contacted&#xD;
      directly or through advertisements. Potential Subjects will have the opportunity to read or&#xD;
      hear the study advertisement and contact the researcher through the contact details provided.&#xD;
      Potential participants will have the opportunity to ask any questions to the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will then send a copy of the information sheet (either by email&#xD;
      or post) or hand to the participant, who will have the opportunity to ask any questions to&#xD;
      the researchers, either by email or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects expressing an interest in participating will be interviewed at their scheduled&#xD;
      clinic appointment to explain the study in detail, and discuss the risks, benefits, goals and&#xD;
      limitations of the study by the treating nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible Subjects will provide written informed consent prior to any study&#xD;
      specific procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the provision of written, informed consent, the Subject's demography, medical&#xD;
      history, especially that relating to pilonidal sinus including details on surgical&#xD;
      interventions, will be documented. Female Subjects of child-bearing potential will undergo a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test. Following a physical examination, height, weight and checks on vital&#xD;
      signs, the Subjects will have blood samples drawn for routine haematology and biochemistry&#xD;
      analyses. Subjects will be asked to provide details of any concomitant medications. The wound&#xD;
      will be sized and graded using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) tool 3.0. Subjects&#xD;
      will have their wound assessed, then debrided and any surrounding hair removed by shaving,&#xD;
      cleaned and dressed in accordance with normal management procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of non-healing pilonidal sinus wound, compliance with the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and providing written informed consent will be registered on&#xD;
      the electronic case report form (eCRF) to obtain a screening number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will demonstrate to the subject how to clean and dress the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be educated on the use of the diary and asked to record at the end of each&#xD;
      day the number of times they cleaned and dressed the wound and any changes in their condition&#xD;
      or concomitant medication. Subjects will be asked to complete the diary over the subsequent 2&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects not wishing to participate, or who are ineligible, will be followed up in accordance&#xD;
      with the clinic's standard management procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will attend the clinic and the diary will be reviewed to ensure completion of the&#xD;
      diary, the number of times the wound was cleaned and dressed, any changes in their condition&#xD;
      or concomitant medications. Haematology and biochemistry test (from Screening) results will&#xD;
      be confirmed as being acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have the status of their pilonidal disease assessed and the wound will be sized&#xD;
      and graded using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) tool 3.0, to confirm that it&#xD;
      remains unhealed with no improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects demonstrating improvement in the wound and healing in the screening period, will be&#xD;
      followed up in accordance with the clinic's standard management procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female Subjects of child-bearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test. Subjects compliant&#xD;
      with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups: metronidazole 10%w/w ointment or matching placebo ointment. Randomisation&#xD;
      will be stratified by wound size less than 3cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a physical examination, weight and checks on vital signs, blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn for routine haematology and biochemistry analyses. The wound will be swabbed for&#xD;
      microbial analysis, then debrided and any surrounding hair removed by shaving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be provided with two pre-weighed tubes of IMP together with a supply of&#xD;
      sterile dressings. The Investigator will demonstrate to the subject how to apply 2.5 cm of&#xD;
      IMP and dress the wound by applying the first dose and covering with a dry, gauze dressing&#xD;
      which is to be retained with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be retrained on completion of the diary and asked to record each day&#xD;
      confirmation of wound cleansing, IMP dose application and wound dressing as well as any&#xD;
      changes in their condition or concomitant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after randomisation, the subject will be contacted by telephone to check on their&#xD;
      progress, compliance with study medication, concomitant medications and the occurrence of any&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 2, 4 and 6 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two, four and six weeks after randomisation, the subject will attend the clinic for review of&#xD;
      the healing status of their pilonidal disease including sizing of the wound and assignment of&#xD;
      a PUSH score, together with checks on vital signs and a physical examination. In addition,&#xD;
      the subject will complete the PGI I in relation to their pilonidal disease, relative to the&#xD;
      baseline condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haematology and biochemistry test (from Baseline) results will be confirmed as being&#xD;
      acceptable (Week 2 Visit only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit the IMP tubes will be weighed to determine the amount used as a check on&#xD;
      compliance with study treatment. The subject diary will be reviewed and any changes in&#xD;
      symptoms and concomitant medications registered in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will clean the wound and remove any surrounding hair by shaving. During each&#xD;
      visit apply the dose of IMP and dress the wound for that day (Week 2 and Week 4 Visits only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Week 6 visit, subjects will also provide blood samples for routine haematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry analyses. Female subjects of child-bearing potential will undergo a pregnancy&#xD;
      test. Subjects considered a clinical failure will have the pilonidal sinus wound swabbed for&#xD;
      microbiological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the wound is judged to be completely healed at any visit, the subject will&#xD;
      be instructed to stop applying the study medication. The Week 6 procedures will be performed&#xD;
      and the subject will be asked to attend the clinic after a further 2 weeks, when the Week 8&#xD;
      procedures will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a subject wishes to withdraw prior to the end of the study, they will be&#xD;
      asked to undertake the Week 6 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who have failed to heal, appropriate post-study treatment will be instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8 (follow-up):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight weeks after randomisation (or two weeks after a visit at which complete healing is&#xD;
      confirmed), the subject will attend the clinic for review of the healing status of the&#xD;
      pilonidal disease including wound size and PUSH score, together with checks on vital signs,&#xD;
      changes in symptoms and concomitant medications. The subject will complete the PGI I in&#xD;
      relation to their pilonidal disease, relative to the baseline condition. Haematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry test (from Week 6 Visit) results will be confirmed as being acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be drawn at the Screening, Baseline and Week 6 Visits for routine&#xD;
      haematology and biochemistry tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted at Screening, Baseline and Week 6 Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be asked to record any changes in symptoms in the diary provided on a&#xD;
      daily basis. This will be reviewed at each study visit and any adverse events will be&#xD;
      documented in the eCRF. Changes in vital signs and outcome of routine blood analyses will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) will be classified using a coding thesaurus (MedDRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete wound healing by Week 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of wound healing [(baseline mm3 - Current mm3) / baseline mm3 x 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects with complete healing by Week 2 and 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects with complete healing maintained over two consecutive visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to response, defined as complete healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from baseline in PUSH score at Weeks 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at Weeks 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety analysis will be conducted in all randomised subjects receiving at least one dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number and proportion of subjects with adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of clinical laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of subjects with complete healing and with partial healing will be presented using&#xD;
      point estimates with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the rates of healing will be determined by difference in the mean. SE of the&#xD;
      mean and 95% confidence interval will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to response will be presented in Kaplan-Meier curves. PUSH score will be presented by&#xD;
      using point estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Comparisons between each treatment and&#xD;
      placebo will be based on an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGI-I will be presented by category using point estimates with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
      Comparisons between each treatment and placebo will be based on a proportional odds model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs will be classified into standard terminology using a coding thesaurus (MedDRA).&#xD;
      Treatment-related AEs will be summarised separately from all AEs. In addition, the maximum&#xD;
      intensity of AEs will be summarised. For AEs these will be summarized using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. Results of laboratory tests and measures of vital signs will be presented as&#xD;
      summary statistics and as shift tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data will be handled using a worst observation carried forward (WOCF) imputation.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses will be included in the SAP.&#xD;
