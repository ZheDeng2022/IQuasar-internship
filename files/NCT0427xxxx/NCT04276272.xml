      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment on the tumour&#xD;
      choline metabolism as determined by [18F]D4-FCH PET/ computed tomography(CT) in breast cancer&#xD;
      and to determine the suitability of [18F]D4-FCH-PET/CT as a non-invasive, early imaging&#xD;
      biomarker for therapy response following CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A target of 16 evaluable participants will be recruited to this study. Participants will&#xD;
      have[18F]D4-FCH PET/CT imaging on each of 2 visits Scan 1: Baseline scan to be conducted&#xD;
      prior to initiating standard of care CDK4/6 inhibitor-based therapy drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan2: Early post-treatment scan to be conducted at 4-6 weeks after initiating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will provide written consent to take part in the study before they undergo&#xD;
      screening assessments to confirm eligibility. On the day of imaging the participants will&#xD;
      have a blood sample taken for circulating tumour DNA prior to the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of [18F]D4-FCH IV will be administered to the participant followed by dynamic/&#xD;
      whole body imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional tumour biopsies at baseline and after 4-6 weeks of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment will&#xD;
      be obtained, or if there is a suitable archival pre-treatment biopsy that has been taken&#xD;
      within 18 months, this can be retrieved for baseline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data for progression/ survival followed up for up to 24 months.&#xD;
