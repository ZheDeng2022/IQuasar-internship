  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a dialogue-based online intervention&#xD;
      (ceprica) that provides information regarding cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in patients&#xD;
      with A) tension-type headache and B) migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to test the hypothesis that ceprica has a greater positive impact on&#xD;
      psychometric parameters than the active control. The effect of ceprica will be examined in&#xD;
      two sub-trials (A, B) each compared to a control group with access to evidence-based online&#xD;
      information. The intervention groups will have access to the online program for a period of&#xD;
      three months in addition to routine treatment. The primary endpoints are self-reported days&#xD;
      with headache and self-reported mean pain intensity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tension-type headache and migraine are common in the German population and lead to a&#xD;
      decreased quality of life as well as high economic consequences. Cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy has shown to be effective in the treatment of all types of headache, especially the&#xD;
      chronic ones. Web-based psychological interventions are easily accessible and preliminary&#xD;
      evidence suggests that such interventions can be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the treatment effects of a novel dialogue-based online intervention compared&#xD;
      to an active control group will be investigated. The interventional online program ceprica&#xD;
      contains elements of cognitive behavioural therapy that address specific approaches in the&#xD;
      management of pain, integrated in an individually tailored dialogue that is based on the&#xD;
      responses given in the program. The intervention is delivered via the internet and protected&#xD;
      by individually assigned passwords. The active control will receive an online intervention&#xD;
      that contains evidence-based information regarding headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled trial will include 520 patients divided into two sub-trials: (A)&#xD;
      tension-type headache and (B) migraine (260 participants for each indication). Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited via a website containing relevant information about the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either a control group, in which they receive online&#xD;
      evidence-based information regarding headache and continue their usual care or an&#xD;
      intervention group that may also use care as usual and in addition receives the online&#xD;
      intervention ceprica. Data are collected at baseline (T0), and three months later (T1).&#xD;
