  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is a chronic degenerative retinal disease, which can lead to&#xD;
      a progressive loss of visual acuity without affecting peripheral vision. It is a public&#xD;
      health problem as it remains the leading cause of visual impairment in people over 50 years&#xD;
      of age in industrialized countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related macular degeneration has two clinical forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrophic or dry form: progressive disappearance of photoreceptors, alteration of the&#xD;
           pigmentary epithelium leading to a thinning of the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exudative or humid form: development of immature choroidal neo-vessels, leading to the&#xD;
           formation of edema or intra or sub-retinal hemorrhage at the origin of the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are still many questions about the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration,&#xD;
      and there is currently no etiological treatment. The disorder is thought to have a&#xD;
      multifactorial, genetic and environmental origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the environmental risk factors, dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated acids and its&#xD;
      effect on the retina are factors that influence both the incidence and progression of the&#xD;
      disease. However, intervention studies have not been able to demonstrate the preventive value&#xD;
      of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is likely that the precise identification of&#xD;
      patients who could benefit from this supplementation is necessary. Currently, the estimation&#xD;
      of dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is based on dietary surveys, which&#xD;
      implies a number of limits. A blood biomarker of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content&#xD;
      in the retina has been previously identified, which if lowered may be a risk factor for&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration. A low level could also help to identify patients who would&#xD;
      best respond to supplementation. A publication has been submitted and a patent has been filed&#xD;
      for this biomarker. The objective of this project is to confirm the relationship between this&#xD;
      biomarker and the presence of age-related macular degeneration. The analysis will be refined&#xD;
      by correlating the discriminating character of the biomarker with factors that may influence&#xD;
      the intestinal metabolism of dietary lipids and their bioavailability in the blood. For this&#xD;
      purpose, the status of the subjects with regard to their intestinal flora (microbiota) will&#xD;
      be evaluated. The relationship between lipid metabolism, microbiota and age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration should also provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      that link diet, lipid metabolism and age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
