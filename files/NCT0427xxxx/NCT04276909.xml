    <textblock>
      This single-site, non-randomized, open-label study to assess the initial safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the LUM Imaging System for detection of primary pancreatic cancer and peritoneal invasion&#xD;
      from primary pancreatic cancer during surgery. In this feasibility study, the tumor detection&#xD;
      algorithm will be developed for this indication.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to see if LUM015 can be safely given to human patients before&#xD;
      surgery at a dose that allows the removed tumor tissue to be identified when imaged by the&#xD;
      LUM imaging device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be administered with LUM015&#xD;
      at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Due to the expected duration of these surgeries (up to 14 hours), all&#xD;
      subjects will require LUM015 administration intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care&#xD;
      used by the surgeon. Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will&#xD;
      continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will&#xD;
      continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is&#xD;
      required. Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM&#xD;
      Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histological or cytological confirmation of pancreatic cancer on a&#xD;
             biopsy prior to the operation with planned surgical resection. Subjects at any cancer&#xD;
             stage will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received and signed an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be otherwise healthy except for the diagnosis of cancer, as per the&#xD;
             exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
