  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety of bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in elderly&#xD;
      frail patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Progression-Free Survival&#xD;
&#xD;
           : The time from randomization into the date of first observation of documented disease&#xD;
           progression or any-kinds of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Study Objectives 1) Complete Response (CR)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Response will be determined by the International Myeloma Working Group Response&#xD;
                Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CR is defined as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance&#xD;
                of any soft tissue plasmacytoma and &lt; 5% of plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The determination of stringent CR and Imaging will be done 2) Overall response rate&#xD;
                consisting of complete response, very good partial response, and partial response&#xD;
                3) Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The time from randomization into the date of any-kinds of death. 4) Time to&#xD;
                     next treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The time from randomization into the first date of second-line treatment. 5)&#xD;
                     Toxicity profiles&#xD;
