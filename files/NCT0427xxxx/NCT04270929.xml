    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single institution, dose-escalation phase 1 study designed to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of oxaliplatin administered via Pancreatic Retrograde&#xD;
      Venous Infusion (PRVI) using Pressure Enabled Drug Delivery (PEDD) technology. Oxaliplatin&#xD;
      PEDD-PRVI is administered with systemic FOLFIRI followed by FOLFIRINOX therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment period consists of 6 cycles. Cycles 1 and 2 involve the regional administration&#xD;
      of oxaliplatin via PEDD-PRVI with systemic FOLFIRI. During cycles 1 and 2, patients are&#xD;
      evaluated on days 1, 2, 4, and 8. Cycles 3 through 6 include the systemic administration of&#xD;
      standard of care FOLFIRINOX. During cycles 3 through 6, patients are evaluated on days 1 and&#xD;
      8.&#xD;
