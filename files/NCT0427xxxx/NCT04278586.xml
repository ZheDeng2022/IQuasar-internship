  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to compare live-online Mindful&#xD;
      Recovery Opioid Care Continuum (M-ROCC) groups with a live-online control group on the&#xD;
      primary outcome of number of biochemically confirmed opioid negative abstinent periods&#xD;
      (defined by a negative oral fluid test [negative for opiate, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone]&#xD;
      AND no self-reported illicit opioid use) during the final six two-week periods of the study&#xD;
      (study weeks 13-24).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a RCT comparing Mindful Recovery Opioid Care Continuum&#xD;
      (M-ROCC), a 24-week motivationally-responsive, trauma-sensitive, Group-Based Opioid Treatment&#xD;
      (GBOT) program to a live-online control group, on the number of biochemically confirmed&#xD;
      opioid negative abstinent periods (defined by a negative oral fluid test [negative for&#xD;
      opiate, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone] AND no self-reported illicit opioid use) during the&#xD;
      final six two-week periods of the study (study weeks 13-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical secondary outcomes include level of anxiety measured by the Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes Measurement Information System - Anxiety Short Form 8a (PROMIS-ASF) among those with&#xD;
      at least mild anxiety disorder at baseline (PROMIS-ASF T-score &gt;55), level of pain&#xD;
      interference measured by the PROMIS Pain Interference Scale (PROMIS-PISF), and the number of&#xD;
      BZD or cocaine positive oral fluid tests (during weeks 13-24 of the study). Other exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes will be level of anxiety measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), 24-week&#xD;
      treatment retention, as well as mechanisms of self-regulation assessed by self-report and&#xD;
      behavioral measures (emotion regulation, decentering/metacognitive monitoring, interoception,&#xD;
      experiential avoidance, self-critical rumination, and self-compassion) and their mediating&#xD;
      effects on anxiety and opioid abstinence. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with at&#xD;
      least 12 M-ROCC completers until thematic saturation is met to examine themes regarding&#xD;
      live-online mindfulness delivery and to compare responses with our R21 qualitative outcomes&#xD;
      from our in-person M-ROCC group model. Computerized Adaptive Testing for Mental Health&#xD;
      (CAT-MH) will also be used to assess changes in psychiatric co-morbidity. Finally,&#xD;
      exploratory outcomes of stigma, mindfulness, perceived stress, pain catastrophizing,&#xD;
      interpersonal conflict, and shared identity within group will be measured.&#xD;

    <description>Live-Online Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC) builds on other mindfulness interventions for addictive disorders, but is specifically designed for patients with OUD prescribed buprenorphine to be delivered in a live-online environment. It focuses on integration of mindfulness practice for living well through stress, anxiety, depression, pain and addiction recovery. The live-online M-ROCC curriculum has three primary components, including a low-dose mindfulness phase, an intensive mindfulness training phase and then a mindfulness maintenance check-in support group.</description>

    <description>A time- and attention-matched live online control group. The manualized control intervention developed for the basic group-based opioid treatment group in primary care uses 16 core modules and 8 elective modules that are common to eclectic approach in treatment as usual addiction recovery groups (including engagement and group development activities with a mix of basic CBT skills, twelve-step facilitation, community reinforcement, and motivational interviewing). As an active group control, this method will help to isolate mindfulness as the putative mechanism of action by controlling for the therapeutic aspects of group without any reference to mindfulness.</description>
