  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to establish a pharmacologically active dose of&#xD;
      mavorixafor in combination with ibrutinib based on pooled safety, clinical response,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to select the recommended dose for a&#xD;
      randomized registrations trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intrapatient dose-escalation study. Three dose levels of mavorixafor will be&#xD;
      explored: 200 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) (dose level 1), 400 mg QD (dose level 2), and&#xD;
      600 mg QD (dose level 3). Ibrutinib will be administered at its labeled dose for participants&#xD;
      with WM, 420 mg orally QD. Each treatment cycle will be 28 days.&#xD;

Cohort A participants will start at Dose Level 1 and be allowed to dose escalate after the first cycle to Dose Level 2, if no DLTs are observed during the first cycle of each participant. Cohort B will comprise the next 6 participants enrolled into the study that complete at least their 1st cycle at Dose Level 3 (600 mg QD). Cohort B participants will start at Dose Level 1 and be allowed to dose escalate up to Dose Levels 2 and 3. Cohort C will comprise the remainder of participants enrolled up to the total of 18. Cohort C participants will start at Dose Level 1 and be allowed to escalate to 400 and 600 mg after each dose level has been deemed safe by participants from Cohort A and B.</description>
