&#xD;
          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient should understand, sign, and date the written informed consent form prior to&#xD;
             any protocol-specific procedures performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For part A &amp; B: patients must have a histologically confirmed and clinically or&#xD;
             radiologically progressing unresectable advanced cancers relapsing or refractory after&#xD;

             have not developed treatment-related CTCAE v.5 grade ≥ 4 irAE or any grade ≥ 3 irAE&#xD;
             lasting for more than 21 days. However, patients who developed auto-immune&#xD;
             endocrinopathies during previous immunotherapy and are well treated with hormone&#xD;
             substitutive therapy do not fell into this category and should remain eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For part B (expansion cohorts):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For part B1: histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically&#xD;
                  progressing unresectable Stage III or Stage IV NSCLC, with a history of&#xD;
                  pre-treatment by anti-PD-1. Patients should have a clinically or radiologically&#xD;
                  documented disease progression after having either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. received an anti-PD-1 monotherapy first line followed by a chemotherapy&#xD;
                       second line&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. or a combination of anti-PD-1 + chemotherapy first line&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For B2 cohort: histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically&#xD;
                  progressing unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, as per AJCC staging&#xD;
                  system, naïve of anti-PD-(L)1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 (ocular melanoma excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. For part B3: histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically&#xD;
                  progressing unresectable Stage III or Stage IV MSS CRC cancer naïve of&#xD;
                  anti-PD(L)1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy . Patients must have received or must be&#xD;
                  ineligible to standard treatments (chemotherapy with 5-FU, oxaliplatin,&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patient with at least one injectable tumor lesion (largest diameter ≥1cm; smallest&#xD;
             diameter ≥1,5cm if lymph node) which is measurable as per RECIST 1.1 criteria and&#xD;
             which will be used as the intratumoral immunotherapy priming site. Patients with&#xD;
             additional tumor lesions should be monitored for both injected and non-injected&#xD;
             lesions as per iRECIST criteria. Patients with additional peritoneal carcinomatosis or&#xD;
             pleural tumoral effusions or other tumoral involvement could be included if they can&#xD;
             be evaluable by an objective criteria such as PET-scan or tumor marker or ctDNA.&#xD;

             completed at least 28 days or 5 times its half-life (whichever is shorter) prior to&#xD;
             the first study dose, and all clinically significant related adverse events have&#xD;
             either returned to baseline or stabilized. Treatment naïve patients are allowed if&#xD;
             they are unsuitable for conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;

             intratumoral injections should be performed without any pain. Local anesthesia should&#xD;
             be performed if necessary prior any intratumoral injection/biopsy. If a patient needs&#xD;
             to undergo a systemic sedation or anesthesia for his intratumoral biopsies/injections,&#xD;
             this should be validated during the screening phase by a consultation with an&#xD;
             anesthesist from the team who would be in charge of such procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug&#xD;

               -  ALT ≤3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if liver metastases ALT ≤5.0 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have&#xD;
                  total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  LDH ≤ Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Albumin ≥ Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)&#xD;

             being a barrier method, or to abstain from sexual activity during the study and for at&#xD;
             least 5 months after last study drug administration. Sexually active males patients&#xD;
             (and their female partners) must agree to use two methods of effective contraception,&#xD;
