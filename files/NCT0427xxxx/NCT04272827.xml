  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether surgical treatment of lipedema (stage I, II&#xD;
      or III) using liposuction significantly improves leg pain compared to the use of complex&#xD;
      decongestive therapy (CDT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients that gave written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a run-in phase of up to seven months for edema elimination and&#xD;
      maintenance of results using complex decongestive therapy (CDT). Afterwards, patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups via internet randomization, provided that all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria continue to be met. Randomization will be 2:1 (intervention:&#xD;
      control). In the intervention arm, patients will receive liposuction treatment (number of&#xD;
      surgeries at the discretion of the treating study physician: a maximum of four surgical&#xD;
      procedures, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 7 weeks between each surgery) with, if&#xD;
      necessary, concomitant CDT to maintain the surgical results as required by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint (regarding pain in the legs in stages I, II or III) will be assessed&#xD;
      after an observation period of 12 months after final liposuction surgery. This is followed by&#xD;
      a further follow-up period for 24 months to observe and document the further course.&#xD;
