    <textblock>
      Circulating blood platelets are small cellular elements that help to control bleeding (a&#xD;
      process called hemostasis) and to avoid hemorrhage when blood vessels are injured. Platelets&#xD;
      originate from cells in the bone marrow, the megakaryocytes (MKs), following a complex&#xD;
      process of morphological transformation and maturation, which finally leads to the production&#xD;
      of blood platelets. Multiple genes are implicated in this process. Constitutive&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (CT) are rare hematological diseases characterized by a decreased number of&#xD;
      circulating platelets that are often larger than normal, that may lead to more or less severe&#xD;
      hemorrhagic events. However, CT can be difficult to diagnose and differentiate from various&#xD;
      forms of acquired thrombocytopenia. The ultimate diagnosis for CT is thus based on the&#xD;
      molecular diagnosis, obtained by identifying and characterizing the abnormal gene and&#xD;
      protein. About 40 genes / proteins have been identified so far as causal in CT, however, in&#xD;
      about half of the patients suspected to have CT, genomic analysis does not detect a variant&#xD;
      in one of these genes, and etiology of CT thus remains unknown. But insuring the diagnosis of&#xD;
      CT is important: it will avoid misdiagnosis and inefficient or deleterious therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, while allowing a proposal of an adapted curative/preventive medical action. At&#xD;
      the Resource and Competence Center for Constitutional Hemorrhagic Diseases (CRCMHC)&#xD;
      (University Hospital Robert Debré, Paris, France), the investigating team has evidenced in&#xD;
      unrelated patients presenting with familial forms of thrombocytopenia and no known molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis, variants of genes not yet described as formally implicated in the occurrence of&#xD;
      CT. Molecular genetic evidence must be completed by functional studies. Such functional&#xD;
      studies are conducted in a research laboratory from the National Institute for Health and&#xD;
      Medical Research (Inserm), &quot;Innovative Therapies in Haemostasis (IThEM)&quot; (Faculty of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences, University of Paris, Paris, France), and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of how blood progenitor cells mature into MKs, by comparing cells obtained&#xD;
           from patients to those of members free of the disease (the latter taken as normal&#xD;
           control subjects);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of platelet functionalities, such as ability to form a blood clot similar&#xD;
           to what happens during hemostasis, with the aim to detect not only quantitative (number&#xD;
           and size) but also any qualitative (functions) defects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of the ultrastructure (the structure of intracellular components) and&#xD;
           biochemistry of MKs and platelets, focusing on the molecular pathways the variant&#xD;
           protein is implicated in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is aimed to precisely delineate the mechanism of action of newly&#xD;
      identified CT genetic variants, and will fulfill the aims of (1) offering the patient(s) a&#xD;
      formal molecular diagnosis of CT, (2) ameliorating patients' medical support, both for&#xD;
      diagnosis and therapy, (3) providing patients and family members with a pertinent genetic&#xD;
      counseling, and (4) expanding the validated panel of genes implicated in CT to be explored in&#xD;
      new suspected cases of CT. It will also help in extending the basic knowledge of the process&#xD;
      of MK and platelet formation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circulating blood platelets are essential in the maintenance of vascular integrity and&#xD;
      functionality in numerous pathophysiological situations, such as the control of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      or thrombotic events. Platelets are released into the circulation from highly specialized&#xD;
      bone marrow cells, the megakaryocytes (MKs) that undergo a complex process of differentiation&#xD;
      and maturation. This process starts with the differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic&#xD;
      progenitor cells (HPC) into enlarging, polyploid immature MKs that evolve into giant cells&#xD;
      apposed on the bone marrow microvasculature, and finally release into the blood stream&#xD;
      fragments of their cytoplasm that make the circulating platelets. This ultimate step of MK&#xD;
      maturation is called thrombopoiesis. Multiple genes are implicated in the whole process, and&#xD;
      particularly in precisely defining both the size and number of circulating platelets.&#xD;
      Constitutive thrombocytopenia (CT) are rare hematological diseases etiologically&#xD;
      heterogeneous, characterized by a markedly decreased number of circulating platelets. In most&#xD;
      of the cases, thrombocytopenia is accompanied by a change in cell size that very often&#xD;
      appears as an increased mean volume. Thrombocytopenia is a life-long status for the patient,&#xD;
      and when circulating platelets are strongly diminished, this may lead to hemorrhagic events&#xD;
      of variable severity that may require urgent intervention such as transfusion of blood&#xD;
      products. Depending on the gene that is altered, CT may be present in parallel with other&#xD;
      blood cell diseases, such myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, or even with&#xD;
      extra-hematological syndromes, such nephropathy, deafness, etc. However, CT can be difficult&#xD;
      to diagnose and difficult to differentiate from various forms of acquired thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
      such as idiopathic or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. The ultimate diagnosis for CT is based&#xD;
      on the molecular diagnosis that must show that a variant gene and protein harboring&#xD;
      identified mutation(s) do alter platelet production and result in clinical CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge about the genetic basis of CT is continuously expanding, with ~ 40 genes identified&#xD;
      so far as causative in CT cases. This identification is based on rigorous criteria such as&#xD;
      (1) bioinformatics-based evaluation of the pathogenicity of the mutations, (2) genotype -&#xD;
      phenotype association in informative CT families, and (3) reproduction of the molecular and&#xD;
      cellular abnormalities noted in the patients by using experimental cellular or animal models.&#xD;
      All implicated genes and proteins act at important steps during MK differentiation /&#xD;
      maturation, and particularly during thrombopoiesis. In addition to important biomedical&#xD;
      outcomes, characterization of mutations of these genes and the impact they have on various&#xD;
      biological processes is also an irreplaceable source of discoveries in basic cell biology.&#xD;
      However, in about half of clinically suspected CT cases, genomic analysis of the known&#xD;
      implicated genes does not recover a variant in one of these genes. Thus, some etiologies of&#xD;
      CT are yet unknown, and there is still a lot of investigation to perform in order to expand&#xD;
      and complement the list of genes and mutations implicated in CT. This is important for the&#xD;
      patients and families, because insuring the diagnosis of CT will avoid misdiagnosis and its&#xD;
      potential inefficient or deleterious therapeutic interventions, including blood products&#xD;
      transfusion when non pertinent, while allowing a proposal of an adapted curative/preventive&#xD;
      medical action, especially when the CT is associated with an extra-platelet or&#xD;
      extra-hematological syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Resource and Competence Center for Constitutional Hemorrhagic Diseases (CRCMHC;&#xD;
      University Hospital Robert Debré, Paris, France), the investigating team has built a cohort&#xD;
      of more than 650 subjects presenting with CT, which only about half have received a genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis. Among the patients without such a molecular diagnosis, several, unrelated patients&#xD;
      with a familial form of thrombocytopenia have been recently investigated by the investigating&#xD;
      team and shown to harbor variants of genes not yet described as formally implicated in the&#xD;
      occurrence of CT. However, clinical and molecular genetic evidence must be completed by&#xD;
      functional studies of the corresponding variant proteins in their cellular environment, and&#xD;
      this experimental, cell biology approach of the CT pathology makes the basis of the present&#xD;
      clinical trial. Such functional studies will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of how blood HPC obtained from patients and family members either with CT&#xD;
           or free of the disease (the latter taken as normal control subjects), differentiate into&#xD;
           MKs when seeded in culture dishes, then mature into MKs forming proplatelets, that are&#xD;
           similar to the early platelets formed in the bone marrow before their release into&#xD;
           blood. The purpose is to observe and analyze any morphological and protein expression&#xD;
           abnormality that may be present in CT cells, and absent in non-CT cells. The techniques&#xD;
           used are cell culture, microscope observation and analysis, both qualitative and&#xD;
           quantitative, of modifications in protein expression and / or distribution in cells,&#xD;
           using probes such as antibodies raised against the proteins of interest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of platelet functionalities, such as their ability to adhere to the&#xD;
           surface of a blood vessel, then to aggregate, an hallmark of their essential role in&#xD;
           stopping bleeding, and to retract a clot, characteristic of their role in the sealing of&#xD;
           a damaged blood vessel, thereby avoiding infections and preparing the tissue for repair.&#xD;
           The aim here is to observe and analyze any alteration of these highly platelet-specific&#xD;
           functions during hemostasis in CT platelets compared to normal platelets, because&#xD;
           certain genes affecting the platelet production in the bone marrow may also play a role&#xD;
           in the functions of circulating platelets. Techniques to be used are microscopy imaging&#xD;
           of platelet adherence to experimental protein-coated surfaces, or to genuine vascular&#xD;
           material;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of the MK/platelet ultrastructure and biochemistry, focusing on the&#xD;
           intracellular molecular pathways the variant protein is implicated in. Techniques to use&#xD;
           for this purpose are confocal or electronic microscopy, protein extraction, purification&#xD;
           and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experimental studies are conducted in a research laboratory from the National Institute&#xD;
      for Health and Medical Research (Inserm), &quot;Innovative Therapies in Haemostasis (IThEM)&quot;&#xD;
      (Faculty of Pharmacy - University of Paris, Paris, France). The laboratory is acting in this&#xD;
      clinical trial on a collaborative basis with the CRCMHC, which is operating upstream for the&#xD;
      medical, clinical and genetic characterization of patients and family members who may be then&#xD;
      asked for enrollment in the trial. The IThEM laboratory has also the expertise to generate&#xD;
      cellular models for the study of one particular gene and protein variant, that can be&#xD;
      experimentally introduced into laboratory human primary cells or cell lines in order to&#xD;
      reproduce the biologic alterations originally observed in cells from the CT patients. This&#xD;
      serves to strengthen the demonstration that the variant gene is truly pathogenic, but this&#xD;
      part of the study is outside the present clinical trial because it does not require access to&#xD;
      biological material from the patients and family members in order to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the whole, this clinical trial is aimed to precisely delineate the mechanism of action at&#xD;
      the molecular and cellular levels of newly identified CT-associated gene variants, in order&#xD;
      to confirm or, conversely, invalidate the pathogenicity of the variant gene. It will fulfill&#xD;
      several objectives, (1) to offer the patient(s) a formal molecular diagnosis of CT, (2) to&#xD;
      precise and elucidate the phenotypic presentation of the form of CT generated by this&#xD;
      variant, (3) to help to ameliorate patients' medical support, both for diagnosis and therapy,&#xD;
      particularly if CT have extra-platelet and / or extra-hematological counterparts, (4) to&#xD;
      provide patients and family members a pertinent genetic counseling, and (5) to expand the&#xD;
      validated panel of genes implicated in CT and to be explored on presentation of a new&#xD;
      suspected case of CT. It will also help in extending the basic knowledge of the process of&#xD;
      megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, both normal and pathological.&#xD;
