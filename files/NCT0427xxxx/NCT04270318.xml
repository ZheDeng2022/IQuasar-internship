      Aim: The aim of this study was to report the 24-Month radiographical and histological outcome&#xD;
      on these previously reported calcium hydroxide (CH) and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)&#xD;
      pulpotomies using of five percent sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as an antibacterial agent to&#xD;
      clean the chamber prior to application of the pulpotomy agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: 128 primary molars were randomly divided into two main groups&#xD;
      according to pulpotomy material (CH/MTA) and into two sub-groups according to selected the&#xD;
      antibacterial agent (NaOCl/physiologic saline) used in the pulpotomy procedure. After these&#xD;
      procedures, teeth were followed radiographically for 24 months. Thirty-four successfully&#xD;
      treated teeth whose successors roots had completed formation of at least two-thirds of their&#xD;
      lengths were extracted for histological evaluation. Fisher's-exact test, Pearson's-chi-square&#xD;
      test and MannWhitneyU test with Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analysis.&#xD;

      The procedure and possible discomforts, risks, and benefits had been fully explained to the&#xD;
      parents of the children, and informed consent forms were signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 64 children (37 boys and 27 girls), between six to 10 years old (mean=8.2 years&#xD;
      old) who had at least two mandibular primary molars with nearly equal carious involvement&#xD;
      that required pulpotomy were included in the study. Following anesthesia and rubber dam&#xD;
      isolation, the pulpotomy procedure was realized. After amputation of the coronal pulp tissue,&#xD;
      pulpal hemorrhage was controlled using dry sterile cotton pellets under slight pressure for&#xD;
      approximately 5 min. Four teeth were excluded from the study because of uncontrolled&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 124 teeth were randomly distributed (by a coin toss) among groups representing&#xD;
      different pulpotomy materials (CH or MTA) and cleansing agents (NaOCl or physiologic saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH pulpotomy (n = 62 teeth): After hemorrhage control, two teeth in each child were randomly&#xD;
      assigned by the toss of a coin to receive two cleansing agents, the experimental disinfecting&#xD;
      agent 5% NaOCl (Wizard, Rehber Chemistry, Istanbul, Turkey) or the physiologic saline. CH&#xD;
      control (n = 31 teeth): Pulp chamber was cleansed with physiologic saline prior the CH&#xD;
      pulpotomy. CH NaOCl (n = 31 teeth): Pulp chamber was cleansed with 5% NaOCl for 30 s prior&#xD;
      the CH pulpotomy. Then, canal orifices were sealed with CH (Kalsin, Aktu, Izmir, Turkey)&#xD;
      paste (CH powder mixed with physiologic saline). After the canal orifice dressing, the&#xD;
      chamber was based with reinforced ZOE (IRM; Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE) and the tooth&#xD;
      immediately restored with a stainless steel crown (SSC; 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTA pulpotomy (n = 62 teeth): As stated above, following the hemorrhage control, two&#xD;
      cleansing agents were randomly applied to the cavity. MTA control (n= 31 teeth): Pulp chamber&#xD;
      was cleansed with physiologic saline prior the MTA pulpotomy. MTA NaOCl (n = 31 teeth): Pulp&#xD;
      chamber was cleansed with 5% NaOCl for 30 s prior the MTA pulpotomy. Then, canal orifices&#xD;
      were sealed with MTA (ProRoot MTA; Dentsply, Tulsa, OK, USA) and a moistened cotton pellet&#xD;
      was placed over the MTA paste to allow setting of the material. Reinforced ZOE was placed as&#xD;
      a temporary restoration; the ZOE and the cotton pellets were removed after 24 h, and the&#xD;
      teeth finally restored with SSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments received follow-up evaluations every six months, for 24 months, following the&#xD;
      completion of the treatments. One examiner, who was blinded to treatment type, evaluated the&#xD;
      teeth clinically and radiographically. At follow-up appointments, clinical success was&#xD;
      confirmed by the absence of spontaneous pain, pathologic mobility, tenderness to percussion,&#xD;
      swelling, fistula, or gingival inflammation. Radiographic success was considered when&#xD;
      internal/external root resorption and periapical/furcal radiolucency was not observed.&#xD;
      Calcific metamorphosis of the pulp was not considered a failure. The data were analyzed using&#xD;
      Fisher's exact, McNemar, and Pearson's chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological assessment Clinically and radiologically successful teeth -whose successors&#xD;
      roots had completed formation of at least two thirds of their lengths- were extracted for&#xD;
      histopathological evaluation. Following extraction, the teeth were immediately immersed in 10&#xD;
      % buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned through the root canals in&#xD;
      a mesiodistal direction using a microtome to obtain sections of 5 Î¼m in thickness. Sections&#xD;
      were stained using hematoxylin eosin and examined under a light microscope.&#xD;
