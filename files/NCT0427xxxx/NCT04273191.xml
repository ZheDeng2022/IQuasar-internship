    <textblock>
      In this Phase 4 study, women who have been prescribed commercial ZULRESSO™ (brexanolone) by a&#xD;
      physician as standard of care for postpartum depression (PPD) and who are planning to receive&#xD;
      the infusion per United States Prescribing Information (USPI) at a Risk Evaluation and&#xD;
      Mitigation Strategy (REMS)-certified healthcare center are being asked to participate to&#xD;
      collect data on multimodal neuroimaging parameters in order to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between changes in depressive symptoms and changes in neuroimaging parameters.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Infusion on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D total score comprises a sum of 17 individual item scores. Items scored in a range of 0 to 2 include: insomnia (early night, middle night, early morning), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, loss of weight, and insight. Items scored in a range of 0 to 4 include: agitation, depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, work and activities, retardation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), and hypochondriasis. The total score can range from 0 to 52.</description>

    <description>rsfMRI is used in brain mapping to evaluate regional interactions that occur in a resting or task-negative state, when an explicit task is not being performed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been prescribed brexanolone for PPD and plans to receive commercially&#xD;
             available brexanolone per the USPI at a REMS-certified healthcare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant agrees to adhere to the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had a major depressive episode that began no earlier than the third&#xD;
             trimester and no later than the first 4 weeks following delivery, as diagnosed by the&#xD;
             Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             Disorders (SCID-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant agrees not to be the primary caregiver of any dependents during the&#xD;
             infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a HAM-D total score of ≥22 at screening and baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is ≤12 months postpartum at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing at screening to delay the start of any new pharmacotherapy&#xD;
             regimens, including antidepressant or antianxiety medication until the brexanolone&#xD;
             infusion and post-Infusion assessments have been completed. If medically justified,&#xD;
             any new medication should be delayed until after the Day 30 follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant is taking medications administered to treat the symptoms of&#xD;
             depression or anxiety (such as anxiolytics or antidepressants), these must be at a&#xD;
             stable dose from 30 days prior to dosing until the brexanolone infusion and&#xD;
             post-infusion assessments have been completed. If medically justified, any change of&#xD;
             preexisting medication should be delayed until after the Day 30 follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

             participation in the study and for 30 days following the end of the brexanolone&#xD;

             prescribed medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been exposed to an investigational medication or device within 30 days&#xD;

             other study employing brexanolone, SAGE-217, ganaxolone, or a similar compound, or has&#xD;
             received prior treatment with ZULRESSO™.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is investigative site personnel, sponsor personnel, or an immediate member&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has received electroconvulsive therapy within 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
