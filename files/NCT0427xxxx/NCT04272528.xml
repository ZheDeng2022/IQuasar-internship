      This project plans to take the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University as the&#xD;
      lead hospital to establish a uniform care network for stoma patients in Shaanxi Province.&#xD;
      This network includes the management system of stoma nursing and the management organization&#xD;
      of stoma patients in Shaanxi Province. It formulates the whole quality standard of stoma&#xD;
      nursing in Shaanxi Province, carries out &quot;standard training&quot; for the stoma specialty nurses&#xD;
      in the group, and carries out on-site inspection in various hospitals from time to time,&#xD;
      establishes the feedback mechanism and standardizes the stoma nursing process. The contact&#xD;
      card of stoma therapists was made and distributed to patients with stoma, so that patients&#xD;
      can easily get the information of stoma therapists in the nearest hospital and receive&#xD;
      professional and convenient care. WeChat group of specialized stoma nurses was established to&#xD;
      provide remote guidance for difficult cases, share new stoma ideas and knowledge, and&#xD;
      facilitate communication among stoma nurses in the group. The leading hospital holds training&#xD;
      courses on knowledge and progress of stomatology every year, competitions on knowledge and&#xD;
      skills, and dispatches therapists to provide work guidance, so as to share new knowledge,&#xD;
      skills and scientific research abilities. At the same time, the efficacy of the network was&#xD;
      evaluated by investigating the complication rate, self-care ability, quality of life, medical&#xD;
      costs of stoma patients,as well as the specialized nursing skills and professional&#xD;
      development of nurses.&#xD;
