  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BKR-017 on insulin resistance in type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2D) subjects during 28 days of active test product administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening period followed by a 28-day treatment period. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive test product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a total of 4 study visits including screening. Visit 1 is the screening visit.&#xD;
      Eligible subject must have an HbA1c between 6.5 -10.5% and with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.7 (calculated&#xD;
      from fasting insulin and fasting glucose). Visits 2 and 4 are overnight visits during which&#xD;
      time a Mixed Meal Tolerance (MMTT) will be performed after an overnight fast. The MMTT&#xD;
      requires an indwelling IV catheter so that 11 blood draws can be more comfortably be obtained&#xD;
      over a period of 4 hours. At Visit 3,subjects will be evaluated and test product will be&#xD;
      replenished. Routine chemistry and hematology testing are done and two time periods during&#xD;
      the study and a physical exam is performed at screening&#xD;
