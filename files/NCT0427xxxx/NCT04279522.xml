  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MOOD study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive, self-administered&#xD;
      external Combined Occipital and Trigeminal Neurostimulation (eCOT-NS) treatment for Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (Relivion®DP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, 2-arm randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      sham-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the following stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening, Eligibility evaluation and Randomization to Relivion®DP vs. Sham control (1:1&#xD;
           randomization) (Baseline - Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Daily treatment period: Active/Sham (Group A/B) treatment protocol (Baseline to end of 8&#xD;
           weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Open label phase: Active treatment period of additional 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the open label period the subject's participation in the study will be&#xD;
      over.&#xD;
