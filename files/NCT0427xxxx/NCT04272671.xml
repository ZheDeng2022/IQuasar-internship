      Purpose: The proposed study will implement and evaluate the effect of an opioid and&#xD;
      benzodiazepine (BZD) de-prescribing intervention on falls risk in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Outpatient clinics with older adult patients, healthcare providers, older adult&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): In this proposed study, there will be 10 primary care clinics randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention arm and 10 primary care clinics randomly assigned to the control&#xD;
      arm. In the first phase of this study, patient and provider focus groups will be used to&#xD;
      inform the development of the intervention which will be tested during the active trial&#xD;
      phase. The intervention has the following components: 1) alerts given to providers to&#xD;
      identify patients taking opioids or benzodiazepines (BZD) and therefore at risk for falls; 2)&#xD;
      educational materials to inform providers on best practices for de-prescribing opioids and&#xD;
      BZDs in patients at risk; and 3) recommendations on de-prescribing provided by a consultant&#xD;
      pharmacist. Impact of the intervention will be evaluated using pre-post surveys evaluating&#xD;
      changes in providers' knowledge, confidence, and skills as well as information from the&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate impact of the intervention on de-prescribing&#xD;
      opioids and BZDs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls among older adults is costly and dangerous. Observational studies show consistent&#xD;
      associations between falls and certain medications. It is widely accepted that falls-related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality could be reduced if systems were in place to identify falls risks and&#xD;
      intervene to reduce the risks identified. In this study, health care professionals (HCPs)&#xD;
      within UNC outpatient clinics will be alerted to patients on high-risk medications and&#xD;
      provide team-based interventions to maximize the success of falls education and medication&#xD;
      deprescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This deprescribing intervention will focus specifically on opioids and benzodiazepines (BZDs)&#xD;
      in patients 65 years of age and older since these medications have high susceptibility to&#xD;
      negative cognitive effects in older adults and contribute to a higher risk of falls. This&#xD;
      study will identify factors affecting the adoption, effective implementation, and maintenance&#xD;
      of a deprescribing program focused on opioids and BZDs with the intent of reducing falls.&#xD;
