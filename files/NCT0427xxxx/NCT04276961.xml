      The trial aims to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of&#xD;
      refractory irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The investigators will include 170 participants to&#xD;
      receive acupuncture plus usual care or sham acupuncture plus usual care. Twelve sessions of&#xD;
      acupuncture will be delivered to participants over a period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is defined as proportion of participants with adequate relief of global IBS symptoms at week&#xD;
      8, which is defined as &gt;50% reduction in IBS-SSS scale.&#xD;
