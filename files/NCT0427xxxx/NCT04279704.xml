      Background Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., however&#xD;
      scientists have failed to learn fully what are the causes of this disease. A promising lead&#xD;
      in understanding the origins of cardiovascular disease may be in gene expression changes&#xD;
      occurring in utero in response to environmental (non-genetic) factors. Such changes govern&#xD;
      whether a gene is turned on or turned off during an individual's lifetime. Twin pregnancies&#xD;
      and twin infants help researchers to have a better understanding of whether the gene&#xD;
      expression changes are genetic or environmental in origin. Therefore, the purpose of this&#xD;
      project is to examine which body tissues (such as hair, fingernails, urine or blood) are&#xD;
      needed to accurately study how gene activity is affected by prenatal factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, emphasizing an&#xD;
      incomplete understanding of its pathology and translation into effective interventions. The&#xD;
      fetal origins hypothesis posits that the risk of CVD is partially set in utero. Individual&#xD;
      differences in epigenetic DNA methylation are a leading candidate mechanism to explain the&#xD;
      association between CVD risk and the fetal environment. Indeed, differences in DNA&#xD;
      methylation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD and its risk factors. Previous&#xD;
      studies in rats have been characterizing a specific class of epigenetic loci known as&#xD;
      metastable epialleles (MEs). Methylation of DNA in utero can be in response to non-genetic&#xD;
      factors and the degree of hypo- or hyper- methylation remains stable throughout the lifespan.&#xD;
      Studies in mice further have shown that methylation has dramatic and permanent phenotypic&#xD;
      effects. In recent studies over 100 human MEs have been identified. Several of these loci&#xD;
      have been associated with phenotypes related to CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators now need to determine the phenotypic consequences of interindividual variation&#xD;
      in DNA methylation at human MEs. Studies in inbred mice have been instrumental in showing&#xD;
      that there are non-genetic influences on the establishment of methylation at MEs. Twin&#xD;
      studies, typically using saliva or peripheral blood cells (PBCs), have been used to assess&#xD;
      whether individual epigenetic variation in humans is influenced by non-genetic factors.&#xD;
      Indeed, in translating epigenetic findings from mice to humans, monozygotic (MZ;&#xD;
      genetically-identical) twins are commonly viewed as the human equivalent of isogenic mice.&#xD;
      However, there is an important difference between MZ twins and isogenic mice. Whereas each&#xD;
      inbred mouse littermate has its own placenta, about 75% of MZ twins share a single placenta&#xD;
      (monochorionicity) and therefore have intermingled circulation during fetal development. It&#xD;
      is therefore essential to determine whether the resulting &quot;cross pollination&quot; of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in peripheral blood (and salivary) DNA of two&#xD;
      monochorionic MZ twins being more epigenetically similar than that of other somatic tissues.&#xD;
      Accurately quantifying epigenetic effects of periconceptional nutrition in twin studies, and&#xD;
      thereby providing future intervention targets to reduce CVD risk in offspring, will likely&#xD;
      require analyses of DNA methylation in tissues other than saliva or peripheral blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators need to examine whether Monozygotic:Dizygotic twin comparisons, without regard&#xD;
      to placental sharing in utero (chorionicity), are a suitable model for future work which will&#xD;
      characterize ME loci and establish their associations with phenotypic consequences. Infancy&#xD;
      is the ideal time to examine the association between MEs and CVD factors, since it provides&#xD;
      the earliest time for risk prediction and intervention. Therefore, for this study&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit 40 twins pairs under 4 months of age to identify more easily&#xD;
      available tissues for epigenetic analyses than hair follicles (which has been previously used&#xD;
      as an alternative to PBCs or saliva). The plucking of hair follicles from infants is too&#xD;
      burdensome on participants to accrue the large samples intended for future analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary: Studies in rats provide evidence that maternal nutrition around the time of&#xD;
      conception can alter epigenetic mechanisms affecting obesity, and obesity itself is a strong&#xD;
      CVD risk factor. This relationship is mediated by the early embryonic methylation at&#xD;
      metastable alleles. Following the identification of over 100 MEs in humans many of which are&#xD;
      associated with obesity or other CVD risk factors, investigators are now ready to implement&#xD;
      studies to examine whether periconceptional nutrition influences CVD risk via methylation.&#xD;
      Investigators seek to translate this work on MEs into human populations since it suggests an&#xD;
      important CVD risk. Further, investigators want to establish the importance of chorionicity&#xD;
      as a factor in epigenetic analyses of MZ twins, and to validate a new tissue for such&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Validate nail clippings as an acceptable DNA source for the study for human MEs&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: At MEs, DNA methylation in infant nail clippings (which can be easily&#xD;
      collected) is highly correlated with that in hair follicles, urine and buccal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare epigenetic discordance at MEs in monochorionic vs. dichorionic MZ twins&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: At MEs, dichorionic MZ twin pairs (with separate placentae) will show greater&#xD;
      epigenetic dissimilarity in PBCs than monochorionic MZ twin pairs (which share a placenta),&#xD;
      but not in other tissues.&#xD;
