    <textblock>
      Povidone Iodine solution is a nasal antiseptic. Its application has been shown to be&#xD;
      clinically safe, tolerable and effective against bacteria and fungi associated with chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is determining the effectiveness of PVP-I in comparison to a&#xD;
      placebo for post-operative refractory CRS patients in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and scientific rationale Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition&#xD;
      of the paranasal sinuses affecting millions of patients, resulting in billions of dollars&#xD;
      being spent annually in associated health care costs. Biofilm has been implicated in chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis recalcitrant to appropriate medical therapy and well-executed endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery. The presence of biofilm results in patients having worse postoperative symptoms,&#xD;
      recurrent infections, and persistent inflammation. Biofilms are bacterial or fungi&#xD;
      communities surrounded by an extracellular polysaccharide matrix, which facilitates&#xD;
      attachment to mucosa, survival, protection and proliferation. This configuration allows for&#xD;
      resistance to innate host defenses and resistance to antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine bound to the synthetic carrier polymer povidone (PVP-I), has been used in wound care&#xD;
      for several decades. The microbial activity of iodine has been thought to be facilitated&#xD;
      through several oxidative mechanisms of action and has been shown to be effective against a&#xD;
      wide variety of pathogens. These mechanisms include inhibition of vital bacterial cellular&#xD;
      mechanisms, denaturation of enzymes in the respiratory chain, and oxidation of key structures&#xD;
      in cell membranes. Previously, PVP-I-containing dressings have demonstrated complete&#xD;
      destruction of biofilm bacteria. As well, using PVP-I as a gargle has shown bactericidal&#xD;
      activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&#xD;
      Enterococcus faecium, among others, more so than other antimicrobials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of antibiotics immediately after surgery, saline irrigation, and debridement in the&#xD;
      office are relatively consistent post-surgical procedures for CRS patients. However,&#xD;
      resistance to topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, fusidic acid, and gentamicin has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in recent years. Furthermore, out of a survey of 265 otolaryngologists, it has&#xD;
      been found that most physicians (86.8%) prescribe antibiotics following surgery, with the&#xD;
      majority (63.9%) only taking cultures on occasion and therefore using broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics despite issues of overuse. In contrast, resistance to PVP-I has not been&#xD;
      documented to date and is therefore an attractive alternative in post-surgical management of&#xD;
      CRS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of published data on the use of iodine after sinus surgery to treat&#xD;
      biofilm.The purpose of this study is determining the effectiveness of PVP-I in comparison to&#xD;
      a placebo for post-operative refractory CRS patients in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if PVP-I rinses will reduce the need for antibiotics post-FESS. The need for&#xD;
      antibiotics will be determined by an increase in the discharge score component of the&#xD;
      Modified Lund-Kennedy score, and/or positive Culture and Sensitivity testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess SNOT-22 scores as well as culture and sensitivity testing which will be collected&#xD;
      at follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be obtained from each participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age Gender Smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MLK endoscopic scores, Sinus culture and sensitivity, Blood work for inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      Thyroid Stimulating Hormone levels, Saccharin test, Sniffin' Sticks smell test and SNOT-22&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing primary functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) at St. Paul's&#xD;
      Hospital or False Creek Surgical Centre will be included. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a placebo or 0.10% PVP-I (0.01% available iodine). Patients will be instructed&#xD;
      to dilute 2.5mL of either the placebo or the betadine (unmarked bottles) into a 240mL bottle&#xD;
      of saline and rinse once per day. Both groups of patients will be concurrently using the&#xD;
      standard of care rinses as well (Pulmicort, if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PVP-I group, the final concentration of available iodine in the solution will be&#xD;
      0.01%, (from diluting 10% PVP-I solution), as previously demonstrated to be below ciliotoxic&#xD;
      levels of 1.25% and greater than 0.01% which is the lower limit of active potency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a patient develop symptoms of infection post-surgery, they will be instructed to&#xD;
      contact the PI (Dr. Javer) or a member of his research staff. At this point they will be&#xD;
      instructed to come for a follow-up appointment for assessment and determination of their MLK&#xD;
      score and/or Culture and Sensitivity Testing. If they start antibiotics they will be removed&#xD;
      from the study, and this will be indicated by censoring in the survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not subjectively feel unwell will come for the indicated follow-up&#xD;
      appointments for objective and subjective assessment of their sinuses and nasal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Patient Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Patients who experience signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of hypersensitivity to iodine, burning, itching, pain redness, tiredness, nausea&#xD;
      or vomiting will be asked to stop the rinses immediately. The reaction will be noted and the&#xD;
      code will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the physician and the patient&#xD;
      regarding the use of iodine with the nasal rinses. Patients who meet any of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria that were not noted at the beginning of the study will be removed from this study&#xD;
      and the physician will discuss the future management options with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Povidone Iodine (PVP-I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing and Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVP-I is provided in the form of a liquid at a concentration of 10% (1% available iodine).&#xD;
      2.5 mL of PVP-I will be diluted into 240 mL of saline solution. The final concentration of&#xD;
      available iodine in the solution would be 0.01%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will dilute 2.5 mL of 10% iodine or placebo into a 240 mL rinse bottle once a day.&#xD;
      Both groups of patients will be concurrently using the standard of care rinses, Pulmicort, if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will administer the PVP-I or Saline rinse for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature has some isolated reports of adverse reactions to iodine administration to&#xD;
      include burning, swelling, and pain. No documented episode of anaphylaxis due to iodine has&#xD;
      been identified in the literature. There are reports of TSH suppression with excessive mouth&#xD;
      gargles with iodine, however, this is quickly reverses upon cessation of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ascertain the appropriate amount of participants for a survival analysis that is&#xD;
      sufficiently powered at 80%, the investigators will aim to complete a proof-of-concept study&#xD;
      with 100 participant's total, 50 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survival analysis will be undertaken, with the event of interest being presence of&#xD;
      infection in the sinuses. An 'event' will be considered a patient's need for antibiotics&#xD;
      either by an increase in the discharge component of their MLK score and/or positive Culture&#xD;
      and Sensitivity Testing. Time-to-event will be the duration between surgery and the point at&#xD;
      which the patient will be removed from the study. The study period will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience signs and symptoms of iodine reaction will be noted and the code will&#xD;
      be broken so that a discussion can occur between the research supervisor and the patient&#xD;
      regarding the use of the topical iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can contact the office anytime if they notice any of the signs or symptoms of iodine&#xD;
      reaction and will be seen by the research supervisor (or designate) within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All expected and unexpected adverse events will be recorded and graded by the research&#xD;
      supervisor. Stable chronic conditions, which are present prior to the clinical trial entry&#xD;
      and do not worsen, are not considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the&#xD;
      patient's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording/Documentation of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each patient visit, the research supervisor will ask appropriate questions and perform&#xD;
      a physical exam to elicit any adverse events. The research supervisor will also review blood&#xD;
      work obtained from the patient. All reportable adverse events will be recorded on appropriate&#xD;
      case report form. The research supervisor will also write the stop date, the severity of the&#xD;
      AE and his judgment of the AE's relationship to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death occurring between Day 0 and 182 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life Threatening Event (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time&#xD;
           of the event)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization between Day 0 and&#xD;
           182 (6 months) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity In the event of SAE, the&#xD;
      research supervisor will discuss with the patient (or next of kin) whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between the study and the SAE. If there is a relationship, the PI will be&#xD;
      responsible for coordinating care for the patient until the SAE has been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy During the Trial Patients will be responsible for determining if they are pregnant&#xD;
      or become pregnant during the study. If patients notify the PI they are pregnant, they will&#xD;
      be removed from the study and the medical management options will be discussed.&#xD;
