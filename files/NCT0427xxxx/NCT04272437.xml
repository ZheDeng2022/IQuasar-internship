  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infection in nursing home residents,&#xD;
      and symptomatic UTI in the nursing home setting is the most frequent reason for&#xD;
      hospitalization and antimicrobial therapy in Taiwan. Increasing antimicrobial resistance has&#xD;
      stimulated interest in non-antibiotic prophylaxis of UTI. The primary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of standardized concentrated herbal extract granules TRA in the reduction&#xD;
      of the incidence of symptomatic UTI and associated hospitalization in high-risk nursing home&#xD;
      residents. These aims were accomplished by conducting a double-blind randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled efficacy trial of TRA daily versus placebo granules in a cohort of&#xD;
      Changhua County nursing home residents in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 164 nursing home residents at high risk for UTI were be enrolled. A permuted block&#xD;
      design with a block size of 6 were conducted. And a Stratification by nursing home accounted&#xD;
      for potentially different standards of care. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either TRA (10 g) or the placebo two times per day for 42 consecutive days. All subjects in&#xD;
      both groups will also continuously receive their daily medication without any dose or&#xD;
      medicine change. Urinalysis was evaluated before and after administration. Independent&#xD;
      statisticians performed the data analysis at the end of the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The standardized concentrated herbal extract granules TRA were the combination of &quot;Tokoro&#xD;
      Combination(Pi-Hsieh-Fen-Ching-Yin Extract Granules)&quot; and &quot;Rehmannia and Akebia Formula (Dao&#xD;
      Chi San Extract Powder)&quot;. &quot;Tokoro Combination&quot; and &quot;Rehmannia and Akebia Formula&quot; in each one&#xD;
      batch number were used, manufactured by Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a famous&#xD;
      GMP manufacturer of concentrated herbal extract granules in agreement with international&#xD;
      standards. The TRA was prepared in small granules, including concentrated herbal extract&#xD;
      granules of &quot;Tokoro Combination&quot;(50%) and &quot;Rehmannia and Akebia Formula&quot; (50%). Both&#xD;
      medicines have already been approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan as&#xD;
      ethical drugs. TRA granules were packed in oblique glassine packages. The placebo was also&#xD;
      prepared as granules by Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and the packaging of the&#xD;
      placebo was identical to that of TRA. The chemical composition of TRA was analyzed and&#xD;
      profiled by using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The major components were&#xD;
      diosgenin, yamogenin, betulin, oleanolic acid, hederagenin, akeboside, Î²-sitosterol,&#xD;
      stigmasterol, inositol, catalpol, glycyrrhizin, etc.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants were randomly assigned to take either TRA or placebo. Participants in the two groups orally ingested one package of granules (5 g/package) two times daily after lunch and dinner. The placebo was prepared as granules by Chuang Song Zong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, and the packaging of the placebo was identical to that of herbal extract granules. During the trial, neither the care providers(including family numbers and nursing-home colleagues) nor investigators ( assist doctors or nurses ) were aware of the group.</masking_description>
