      Protocol YY-20394-007 is a phase1 open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of YY-20394 in participants with relapse and/or refractory B cell&#xD;
      malignant hematological tumor. eligible participants will initiate oral therapy with YY-20394&#xD;
      at a starting dose of 80mg taken once per day. treatment with YY-20394 can continue in&#xD;
      compliant participants as long as the study is still ongoing and the participants appear to&#xD;
      benefiting from treatment with acceptable safety.&#xD;
