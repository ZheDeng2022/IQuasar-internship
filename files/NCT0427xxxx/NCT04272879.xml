  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking related lung disease or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterised&#xD;
      by periods of worsening symptoms termed exacerbations. In some patients these may be severe&#xD;
      enough to require hospitalisation and support for their breathing. Patients who suffer a&#xD;
      severe exacerbation requiring breathing support using mask ventilation (also termed&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation, NIV) have a high chance of being readmitted to hospital in the&#xD;
      following 12 months. Recent evidence suggests that the provision of a breathing machine at&#xD;
      home (home mechanical ventilation, HMV) may reduce the risk of readmission to hospital in&#xD;
      selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality in the 12 months following a life-threatening exacerbation of COPD&#xD;
      remain high. Recent data from the Lane Fox Clinical Respiratory Physiology Research Centre&#xD;
      supports the addition of home non-invasive ventilation to standard care to improve&#xD;
      admission-free survival in patients with persistent hypercapnia following a decompensated&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical implementation of the delivery of home&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation in COPD patients with persistent hypercapnia following an acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD to validate that the clinical benefit derived from the HOT-HMV trial is&#xD;
      maintained when the home non-invasive ventilation is implemented into routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following publication of the home oxygen therapy-home mechanical ventilation (HOT-HMV) trial,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical service delivery of home non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV) therapy in patients who have recently undergone, and recovered, from a&#xD;
      life-threatening exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort observational study is designed to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      implementation of the delivery of home non-invasive ventilation in COPD patients with&#xD;
      persistent hypercapnia following an acute exacerbation of COPD to validate that the clinical&#xD;
      benefit demonstrated by the HOT-HMV trial is maintained when the home non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation is incorporated into routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have an admission to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation will be referred for assessment. Eligible patients will be referred&#xD;
      by the critical care or appropriate respiratory team to a monthly assessment clinic for&#xD;
      assessment of chronic hypercapnia. The total UK sample size will be 200 participants. St&#xD;
      Thomas' critical care unit managed between 80-100 patients per year with non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation for life threatening exacerbation of COPD. This study will run over 4 years;&#xD;
      therefore it is anticipated that 200 patients will be enrolled into the trial over this&#xD;
      period. Patients will also be referred from peripheral hospitals to the Lane Fox Unit as a&#xD;
      regional centre for home ventilation.&#xD;
