      Aim to investigate the effect of sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling on the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with middle-high risk endometrial cancer obviously confined to the uterus before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale The diagnostic value of sentinel lymph node sampling has been widely approved. NCCN&#xD;
      guideline suggested that &quot;SLN mapping can be considered for the surgical staging of apparent&#xD;
      uterine-confined malignancy when there is no metastasis demonstrated by imaging studies or no&#xD;
      obvious extrauterine disease at exploration&quot;. However, the role of SLN in the prognosis of&#xD;
      mid-high risk endometrial cancer clinically confined to the uterus is unclear. There are big&#xD;
      concerns that SLN sampling only without lymph node dissection might miss isolated para-aortic&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis or remain lymph node with metastasis other than SLN unremoved and thus&#xD;
      affect the prognosis of patients. NCCN also suggested that &quot;Para-aortic nodal evaluation from&#xD;
      the inframesenteric and infraenal regions may also be utilized for staging in women with&#xD;
      high-risk tumors such as deeply invasive lesions, high-grade histology, and tumors of serous&#xD;
      carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma or carcinosarcoma. Thus, it is necessary to carry out a&#xD;
      randomized trail to investigate the role of SLN in the prognosis of middle-high risk&#xD;
      endometrial cancer obviously confined to the uterus before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethnics This study were approved by the Ethics Committees of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      Hospital of Fudan University and all other institutes. Before initiation of study procedures,&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained from each patient regarding risks of treatments and&#xD;
      agreement of using their clinical data for research purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Treatment This is a multicentered, open-label, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out in each center. A computer-based procedure of simple&#xD;
      randomization (SPSS for Mac, version 22.0; IBM ) will be used for participant enrollment and&#xD;
      randomization. Before an individual is successfully enrolled, her treatment assignment will&#xD;
      remain concealed. This trial will be open label: patients and study physicians were aware of&#xD;
      treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients in each center will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Total hysterectomy with/without bilateral salpingooophorectomy (THBO) plus pelvic&#xD;
      lymphonodectomy (PLN) with para-aortic sampling, or 2. Total hysterectomy with/without&#xD;
      bilateral salpingooophorectomy (THBO) plus sentinel lymph node sampling (SLN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The principles of surgery procedures and post-operative adjuvant therapies will follow&#xD;
           the latest NCCN guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgery carried out by laparotomy, laparoscope, or robotic surgery are accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Colored dyes including indocyanine green (ICG) (preferred), methylene blue, carbon&#xD;
           nanotube for sentinel lymph node are accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postoperative adjuvant treatments are carried out following the latest NCCN guidelines&#xD;
           according to doctors' choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses On the basis of data from previous studies (GOG249, FRACOGYN), the&#xD;
      2-year PFS is expected to be 88% in the PLN group and 87% in SLN group. SLN would be&#xD;
      considered as inferior to PLN if the 2-year PFS in SLN group is higher than 80%. An accrual&#xD;
      of 780 patients in 3 years will provide the study with adequate power (80%) to detect a&#xD;
      clinically relevant absolute difference of 8% in 2-year PFS (88% vs 80%) between both groups&#xD;
      (one-sided test, a=0.025), with a lost follow up rate ≤10% . Analyses will be done firstly by&#xD;
      intention to treat.&#xD;
