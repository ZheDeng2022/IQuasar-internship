  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19-targeted CAR-T cells&#xD;
      therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory B Cell Leukemia and&#xD;
      Lymphoma.CD19 is expressed on most B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma cells so it is an ideal&#xD;
      target for CAR-T. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T&#xD;
      targeting CD19 in patients with elapsed/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma. The&#xD;
      primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse events and disease status&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
