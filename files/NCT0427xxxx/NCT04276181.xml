    <textblock>
      Tetraplegia after a cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) radically alters an individual's&#xD;
      ability to perform normal activities of daily life due to paralysis in all extremities,&#xD;
      resulting in lifelong dependence.[1] Traditional tendon transfer surgery has proven&#xD;
      successful in restoring grip functions which greatly improves autonomy, but with a restricted&#xD;
      passive opening of the hand. The number of transferrable muscles in the arm is however&#xD;
      limited, why nerve transfer surgery is a new attractive option to further improve hand&#xD;
      function by enabling active opening of the hand. Significant advantages of distal nerve&#xD;
      transfers include less extensive surgical dissection, greatly reduced hospital stay,&#xD;
      rehabilitation and restrictions, and thereby less health care use and costs. In an effort to&#xD;
      further improve hand function and independence in patients with tetraplegia, hand surgeons at&#xD;
      Centre for Advanced Reconstruction of Extremities (C.A.R.E.), Sahlgrenska University Hospital&#xD;
      (SUH)/Mölndal have developed a strategy in which a nerve transfer procedure aiming to restore&#xD;
      active opening of the hand is done prior to reconstruction of grip functions. To date, no&#xD;
      study has compared the efficacy of this combined nerve and tendon transfer (CNaTT) procedure&#xD;
      to traditional grip reconstruction by means of tendon transfer alone, thus constituting a&#xD;
      major gap in the literature. The purpose of this study is therefore to fill that knowledge&#xD;
      gap by comparing the clinical outcomes of a cohort of patients who undergo the CNaTT&#xD;
      procedure to restore hand function, to those treated by means of tendon transfer alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite its incurability, surgical reconstruction of arm and hand function is a powerful tool&#xD;
      to restore upper limb functions, as well as independence and control in individuals with&#xD;
      tetraplegia. Patients with tetraplegia rank better use of the upper limb as their top&#xD;
      functional priority, and surgical rehabilitation of the upper limb is proven highly&#xD;
      rewarding. Starting in the 70s, pioneering work by dr. Moberg, and continued work by&#xD;
      professor Fridén at SUH has guided the development of reconstructive surgical procedures in&#xD;
      tetraplegia. As one of the leading units in the field C.A.R.E., SUH/Mölndal is responsible to&#xD;
      continue the refinement of surgical treatment strategies. The center works in a value-based&#xD;
      patient-oriented environment, with high demands on quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional approach to surgical reconstruction of hand function in SCI uses tendon&#xD;
      transfer, in which a functionally intact muscle is detached, rerouted and re-attached to a&#xD;
      nonworking muscle to replace its original function. By this procedure, finger- and thumb&#xD;
      flexion can be successfully and predictably restored, enabling strong active grip functions,&#xD;
      but with passive and limited hand opening. Successful nerve transfer surgery in brachial&#xD;
      plexus injuries has inspired interest in nerve transfers for patients with C-SCIs. Nerve&#xD;
      transfers are conceptually quite similar to tendon transfers but are rarely applied in&#xD;
      tetraplegia. To maximize outcome, nerve transfers must be done no later than 1 year after&#xD;
      injury. In this procedure, a healthy nerve serving one function is cut and reconnected to a&#xD;
      nonfunctional nerve (below the injury level), serving a more important function. Within 6-12&#xD;
      months, the recipient muscle has begun to receive nerve impulses. The preliminary results are&#xD;
      very promising and show re-innervation of paralyzed muscles, enabling active opening of the&#xD;
      hand. It is an attractive surgical procedure since it allows direct reanimation of the&#xD;
      muscle, which is anatomically and mechanically designed to perform that function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further advantages of nerve transfers include less extensive surgical dissection, minimal&#xD;
      hospital stay, rehabilitation and restrictions, and thereby less health care use and costs.&#xD;
      Although the utility of nerve transfers in tetraplegia has yet to be fully determined, early&#xD;
      results show promise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of nerve transfer surgery to incomplete tetraplegia offers novel and exciting&#xD;
      reconstructive possibilities when combined with tendon transfer techniques, especially in&#xD;
      groups with very limited resources. Due to nerve regeneration factors, nerve transfers are&#xD;
      not as reliable as tendon transfers, why restoring finger flexion in terms of strength is&#xD;
      preferably performed with tendon transfers. It has been suggested that research should be&#xD;
      directed at evaluating combined tendon and specific nerve transfer techniques, such as the&#xD;
      Bertelli S-PIN (supinator to posterior interosseous nerve transfer) procedure. The S-PIN&#xD;
      nerve transfer procedure can reanimate not only the finger extensors, but also allows&#xD;
      independent thumb extension and abduction, and thereby enables active opening of the hand.&#xD;
      Opening of the hand does not require much strength, and partial outcomes may work&#xD;
      satisfactory. The S-PIN procedure combined with the tendon transfer technique has the unique&#xD;
      potential to restore hand function to a level as near normal as possible in patients with&#xD;
      tetraplegia. This strategy referred to as Combined Nerve and Tendon Transfer (CNaTT)&#xD;
      procedure thus allows both opening and strong active closing of the hand, and most likely&#xD;
      also result in fewer compensatory movements, which reduces the risk for shoulder pain that&#xD;
      interfere with daily activities. At C.A.R.E. there is empirical evidence that support the&#xD;
      potential of the combined procedure, such as patients' satisfaction and reporting of being&#xD;
      able to better engage in activities in daily life that requires active opening of the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has an observational controlled design to which the investigators plan to include&#xD;
      40 cases of CNaTT. As control, patients who undergo tendon transfer alone will be included&#xD;
      (due to lack of the prerequisite for nerve transfer; &gt;12 months since injury), in parallel&#xD;
      with the cohort of patients who have undergone the traditional procedure in the past (20&#xD;
      prospective cases and 100 historical cases). The results at one year after the tendon&#xD;
      transfer procedure will constitute the main outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve transfer to achieve opening of the hand by means of Bertelli S-PIN&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this procedure performed bilaterally, the supinator motor nerve gets transferred to the&#xD;
      posterior interosseous nerve (S-PIN) according to the technique described by Bertelli.&#xD;
      Preoperatively, both donor and recipients nerves and muscles are assessed with&#xD;
      electromyography to make sure they are stimulatable on both sides. After a short&#xD;
      immobilization period of 2 weeks in a hinged orthosis restricting full extension of the&#xD;
      elbow, patients are free to move and train without restrictions. When the first evidence of&#xD;
      re-innervation is noticed, patients are instructed to enhancing strength in extensor muscles.&#xD;
      Initially, patients activate the donor nerve movement (supination) while the forearm is&#xD;
      locked in pronation to facilitate thumb- and finger extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional approach to surgical reconstruction of grip by means of tendon transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The so-called grip reconstruction is a combination of surgical procedures, customized&#xD;
      according to the patient´s needs that can be done many years after a C-SCI. The procedure is&#xD;
      developed at SUH by professor Fridén, and has been entitled the alphabet or ABCDEFG&#xD;
      procedure, an abbreviation for Advanced Balanced Combined Digital Extensor Flexor Grip&#xD;
      reconstruction. The procedure is a one-stage grip and release procedure, a result from&#xD;
      several previous studies to improve strength of tendon attachments, early active mobilization&#xD;
      etc. The active tendon transfers will typically include brachioradialis to flexor pollicis&#xD;
      longus (BR-FPL) transfer and extensor carpi radialis longus to flexor digitorium profundus&#xD;
      (ECRL-FDP) transfer. The balancing procedures differ depending on the muscle strength (MRC)&#xD;
      after the nerve transfer procedure. A typical OCu 4 patient with some finger extension will&#xD;
      undergo: split flexor pollicis longus (FPL)- extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tenodesis,&#xD;
      passive reconstruction of the interossei, carpometacarpal (CMC) joint capsulodesis, EPL&#xD;
      tenodesis and extensor digiti minimi (EDM)- abductor pollicis brevis (APB)&#xD;
      transfer/tenodesis. Our specific and active rehabilitation protocol start within 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery and has previously been described in detail.&#xD;
