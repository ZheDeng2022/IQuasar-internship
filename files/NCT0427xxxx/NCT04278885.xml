    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, exploratory, proof-of-concept, single-center, open-label pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the effects and safety of Lanadelumab in patients with FXII-associated cold&#xD;
      autoinflammatory syndrome (FACAS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Factor XII is a serine protease with diverse functions that participates in coagulation,&#xD;
      fibrinolysis, complement and contact system activation. So far, mutations in the factor XII&#xD;
      gene were linked to the rare coagulation disorder Hagemann factor deficiency and hereditary&#xD;
      angioedema (FXII-HAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently identified a novel FXII mutation in a 4-generation family with&#xD;
      profound contact system activation and an autoinflammatory clinical phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lanadelumab is a specific kallikrein Inhibitor that is known to prevent clinical symptoms and&#xD;
      contact system activation in hereditary angioedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at assessing the clinical effects and safety of Lanadelumab in patients with&#xD;
      FXII-associated cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FACAS).&#xD;
