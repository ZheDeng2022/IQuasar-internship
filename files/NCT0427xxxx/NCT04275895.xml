  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurely born children (PC) have academic difficulties related to poorer attention&#xD;
      capabilities. Additionally, they often show excessive mobility, quoted as agitation. Some&#xD;
      consider it could be related to poorer postural control and impaired perception of gravity&#xD;
      vertical. But, this excessive mobility could also be an unconscious way for PC to improve&#xD;
      their attention performance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interdependence between&#xD;
      postural and cognitive activities in school age PC versus term born children (TC). First, the&#xD;
      performance of PC and TC at the Attention Network Test for Children will be analyzed with the&#xD;
      use of a mobile versus a classic school chair. Secondly, participants will have to position a&#xD;
      stick vertically to measure their perception of vertical gravity. Finally, the spontaneous&#xD;
      postural activity of PC and TC (evaluated by the center of pressure displacement) will be&#xD;
      studied during the execution of three different attention tasks at different levels of&#xD;
      difficulty. Success rate and reaction time will be analyzed for all attention tasks.&#xD;
      Moreover, center of pressure displacement calculation will allow evaluation of infants'&#xD;
      spontaneous mobility, the precision of their postural control and the attention allocated to&#xD;
      their posture.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prematurely born children (PC) at school age have academic difficulties related to poorer&#xD;
      attention capabilities. Posner (1990) described three distinct attention functions: Alert (to&#xD;
      maintain a vigilance state), Orientation (to select the relevant information) and Inhibition&#xD;
      (to resist distraction). Additionally, teachers and parents are often concerned because they&#xD;
      move more than term born children; this excessive mobility being often quoted as agitation.&#xD;
      Some consider it would be related to a poorer postural control potentially explained by a&#xD;
      poorer perception of vertical gravity. Another explanation is that this mobility could be an&#xD;
      unconscious way for PC to increase their arousal level to improve their attention&#xD;
      performance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the interdependence between&#xD;
      postural and cognitive activities in school age PC and term born children (TC). First, the&#xD;
      performance of PC and TC at the Attention Network Test for Children will be analyzed&#xD;
      evaluating Alert and Inhibition, and its evolution when the infants will use a mobile school&#xD;
      chair, compared to a classic school chair. Secondly, participants will perform a test of&#xD;
      perception of vertical gravity in which they will have to position a stick vertically.&#xD;
      Finally, the spontaneous postural activity of PC and TC (evaluated by the center of pressure&#xD;
      displacement measured with a forced plate) will be studied during the execution of three&#xD;
      different attention tasks: a vigilance task, a visual search task or an inhibition task at&#xD;
      two different levels of difficulty. Success rate and reaction time will be analyzed for all&#xD;
      attention tasks. Moreover, center of pressure displacement calculation will allow evaluation&#xD;
      of infants' spontaneous mobility, the precision of their postural control and the attention&#xD;
      allocated to their posture. Success rate and reaction time will be analyzed for all the&#xD;
      attention tasks as well as the angle errors in degree between the stick orientation given by&#xD;
      the children and the real vertical. Furthermore, the sway path, the surface area and the&#xD;
      entropy of the displacement of CP will be computed to determine respectively the mobility,&#xD;
      the precision of the postural control and the attention allocated to the posture of these&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Attention performance of a group of prematurely born children will be compared on a classical school chair and a mobile school chair. The same comparison will be made for a group of term born children.&#xD;
The perception of the Vertical gravity of the two groups will be evaluated in sitting position, lying to the right side and lying the left side.&#xD;
The postural control of the two groups will be evaluated standing on a force plate in three conditions : eyes opened watching a cartoon, eyes opened gazing a fixation cross on the wall and eyes closed.&#xD;
The postural control of the two groups will be measured during the execution of three different attentional tasks. For each task, two levels of difficulty will be tested.&#xD;
Finally, growth trajectory from birth will be analysed as a confounding factor.</intervention_model_description>
