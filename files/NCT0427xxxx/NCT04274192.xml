  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to begin the study with either NAVA-synchronized or continuous&#xD;
      HFNC. Each patient will receive two 15-minute trials at different levels of continuous HFNC&#xD;
      and two 15-minute trials at corresponding levels of synchronized HFNC. In synchronized HFNC,&#xD;
      using the NIV NAVA mode on the ventilator each subject will receive a constant minimum flow,&#xD;
      but with each neurally triggered breath (as measured with an Edi catheter), an additional&#xD;
      flow will be given to the patient. This differs from continuous HFNC in which the subject&#xD;
      receives a constant flow without variation. Subjects will be observed during the entirety of&#xD;
      these trials. Values for the primary and secondary outcomes will be monitored, recorded, and&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the study period each subject will have the following monitoring equipment placed&#xD;
      (if not already present): Edi catheter, transcutaneous monitor (TCM4, Radiometer, Brea, CA,&#xD;
      USA) to measure CO2 and O2 levels, pulse oximeter probe (MasimoSET, Irvine, CA, USA) to&#xD;
      measure oxygen saturations and heart rate, and RIP bands (SleepSense, MFI Medical, San Diego,&#xD;
      CA, USA) around the chest and abdomen to measure breathing movements and relative tidal&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be randomized on the day the study is to occur to begin with either&#xD;
      NAVA-synchronized or continuous HFNC before crossing over to the other mode to serve as&#xD;
      his/her own control. The same RAM cannula will be used in both study arms and will provide a&#xD;
      leak of 60-80% as recommended by the product manual. The delivery of high flow during both&#xD;
      synchronized and continuous HFNC will be given at two commonly provided levels of high flow:&#xD;
      6 LPM and 8 LPM, given in the same order in each mode (6 LPM then 8 LPM). Each subject will&#xD;
      receive 15-minute trials of each mode-level combination, for a total of four trials. During&#xD;
      each trial, the first 10 minutes will be used for stabilization, and the last 5 minutes will&#xD;
      be used for data collection, as has been done in previous trials. Thus, the mode-level&#xD;
      combinations of the trials will be as follows: for infants randomized to begin with&#xD;
      synchronized support: synchronized-6 LPM, synchronized-8 LPM, unsynchronized-6 LPM,&#xD;
      unsynchronized-8 LPM. For infants randomized to begin with unsynchronized support:&#xD;
      unsynchronized-6 LPM, unsynchronized-8 LPM, synchronized-6 LPM, unsynchronized-8 LPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flows described in the NAVA-synchronized trials refer to the peak flow provided during&#xD;
      inspiration. A baseline flow rate of 2 LPM will be provided expiration in these trials (using&#xD;
      the PEEP setting corresponding to the appropriate flow rate). During the unsynchronized&#xD;
      trials, the continuous high flow rate will be provided (as is common practice with the use of&#xD;
      HFNC). During the NAVA-synchronized HFNC trials, the Edi trigger will be set to 0.5&#xD;
      microvolts, apnea time to 5 seconds, back up rate to 10 breaths per minute, and backup&#xD;
      pressure settings will be set to provide an estimated peak flow of 6 or 8 LPM according to&#xD;
      the designated trial (again, using the pressure setting corresponding to the appropriate flow&#xD;
      rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During NAVA-synchronized HFNC, the NIV NAVA mode will be set in such a way that synchronized&#xD;
      HFNC will be provided. A minimal end-expiratory flow of 2 LPM will be provided using the&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) setting in the NIV NAVA mode on the ventilator. The&#xD;
      PEEP setting corresponding to 2 LPM via the pneumotachograph will be used. In order to&#xD;
      deliver the desired peak flow rate with each neurally-triggered breath, a NAVA level of 15&#xD;
      cmH2O/Î¼V will be set, then the maximum pressure setting that corresponds to the desired flow&#xD;
      rate using the pneumotachograph will be used for the study. The subject will thus be provided&#xD;
      with &quot;synchronized HFNC&quot;. This contrasts with the constant-flow trials when subjects will&#xD;
      receive a constant and non-synchronized flow using the HFNC software on the ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Servo-u ventilators and Servo Tracker Software (Maquet Critical Care, Solna, Sweden) will be&#xD;
      used in order to track Edi signal. The MP100 Biopac data acquisition (Biopac Systems Inc.,&#xD;
      Goleta, CA, USA) will be used to collect data from the monitoring devices. HFNC will be&#xD;
      delivered using appropriately sized RAM cannula to allow for air leak around the subject's&#xD;
      nares. Persistent bradycardia (less than 100 beats per minutes), desaturation (&lt;85%), or&#xD;
      hypercarbia (transcutaneous CO2 &gt;70) will result in cessation of the study.&#xD;
