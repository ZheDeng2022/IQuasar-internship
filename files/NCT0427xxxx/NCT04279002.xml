  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Rehabilitation (RR) is based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of&#xD;
      personalized and tailored care for patients with chronic respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of RR in improving quality of life and exercise capacity has long been&#xD;
      demonstrated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). More recently,&#xD;
      its interest has been highlighted in other chronic respiratory pathologies: asthma,&#xD;
      interstitial pathologies, cancer, restrictive pathologies or pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
      Although the efficacy of RR has been well demonstrated on the scale of a patient population,&#xD;
      the benefits derived on an individual scale remain unpredictable and variable from one&#xD;
      individual to another, without knowing the major determinants of this benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empirically, RR professionals suspect an association between some psychosocial&#xD;
      characteristics and the importance of the benefit derived by patients from RR programmes.&#xD;
      Individual personality traits and their relationship to health status, integration into a&#xD;
      group, interaction with other group members, and the existence of anxiety or depressive&#xD;
      symptoms may be determinants of RR benefit. These psychosocial determinants could also play a&#xD;
      central role in the patients' adherence to the long-term rehabilitation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis being tested is that there is an association between personality traits,&#xD;
      anxiety, depressive symptoms, social support, and the benefit of an initial course of RR and&#xD;
      the subsequent continuation of maintenance practices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Respiratory Rehabilitation (RR) is based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of&#xD;
      personalized and tailored care for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Carried out in&#xD;
      small groups of patients, it offers effort re-training combined with therapeutic education&#xD;
      and psychological and social care. It aims at the long-term change of life habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of RR in improving quality of life and exercise capacity has long been&#xD;
      demonstrated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). More recently,&#xD;
      its interest has been highlighted in other chronic respiratory pathologies: asthma,&#xD;
      interstitial pathologies, cancer, restrictive pathologies or pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;
      Although the efficacy of RR has been well demonstrated on the scale of a patient population,&#xD;
      the benefits derived on an individual scale remain unpredictable and variable from one&#xD;
      individual to another, without knowing the major determinants of this benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empirically, RR professionals suspect an association between some psychosocial&#xD;
      characteristics and the importance of the benefit derived by patients from RR programmes.&#xD;
      Individual personality traits and their relationship to health status, integration into a&#xD;
      group, interaction with other group members, and the existence of anxiety or depressive&#xD;
      symptoms may be determinants of RR benefit. These psychosocial determinants could also play a&#xD;
      central role in the patients' adherence to the long-term rehabilitation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis being tested is that there is an association between personality traits,&#xD;
      anxiety, depressive symptoms, social support, and the benefit of an initial course of RR and&#xD;
      the subsequent continuation of maintenance practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective n°1: to describe the distribution of 17 psychosocial traits of interest in&#xD;
      patients who had a major benefit from the initial RR stage (defined by a decrease ≥7 points&#xD;
      of Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) compared to patients who did not have a&#xD;
      major benefit (defined by a decrease &lt;7 points of the SGRQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 17 traits describe the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Personality traits&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Existence of anxiety or depressive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-assessment of health status and the degree of control that the subject feels he or&#xD;
           she has over the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Felt social support&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Interpersonal dimensions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. General satisfaction of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the distribution of the 17 psychosocial traits of interest in patients who have&#xD;
      implemented maintenance practices for at least one year after the 1st RR course (defined by&#xD;
      paramedical care or participation in activities offered by a patient association or&#xD;
      declaration of the maintenance of supervised physical activity), compared to patients who&#xD;
      have not pursued such an activity or for whom this data is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective n°2: Describe the correlations between 17 psychosocial traits of interest&#xD;
      and the variation of the following variables between the initial and final assessment of the&#xD;
      first RR stage: SGRQ, VQ11 quality of life score, Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)&#xD;
      dyspnea scale, 6-minute walking distance.&#xD;
