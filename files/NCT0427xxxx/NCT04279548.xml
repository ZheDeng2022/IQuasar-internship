      This study evaluates the long term pain relief after deep brain stimulation on&#xD;
      posterior-superior insula (PSI) in patients with refractory peripheral neuropathic pain who&#xD;
      responded to real but not to sham non-invasive stimulation by deep repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation - PSI-drTMS.&#xD;

      This study has two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I) This study is an extension of 690.455/NCT01932905, in which non invasive stimulation&#xD;
      of the posterior-superior insula (PSI) was performed by deep repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (drTMS) in patients with central neuropathic pain. Patients responding to active&#xD;
      stimulation would be invited to join a phase II study aiming at the long term effects of&#xD;
      drTMS by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the PSI. The original 690.455/NCT01932905 study was&#xD;
      negative concerning pain intensity reduction compared to sham stimulation, its main outcome.&#xD;
      However, in this same study, active but not sham PSI stimulation provided significant&#xD;
      anti-nociceptive effects, with anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This, and a number of experimental studies on peripheral neuropathic pain relief after PSI&#xD;
      stimulation has lead us to perform an extension of the initial study, now including patients&#xD;
      with refractory peripheral neuropathic pain to receive an induction series (5 consecutive&#xD;
      daily stimulation sessions) of navigated PSI-deep rTMS against sham stimulation in a&#xD;
      cross-over design. The calculate sample size for this cross-over screening study is 32. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is number of patients reaching significant pain relief (&gt;50% pain intensity&#xD;
      reduction assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0: no pain, to 100mm:maximal&#xD;
      pain imaginable) one week after the 5th stimulation session compared to baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Other pain, quality of life and mood data were collected : pain interference with daily&#xD;
      living (brief pain inventory), medication quantification score, neuropathic pain symptom&#xD;
      inventory (NPSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this screening trial, actual responders: patients refractory peripheral neuropathic pain&#xD;
      with &gt;50% pain intensity reduction after real but not sham PSI-drTMS will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to join a subsequent PSI-DBS phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II) In this phase, the PSI-DBS phase II trial (ethics review board number #690.455)&#xD;
      will enroll 10 patients with refractory peripheral neuropathic pain from study 1 who&#xD;
      responded to real but not to sham PSI-drTMS. Patients will have a stimulation electrode&#xD;
      inserted neurosurgically by neuronavigation to the PSI, on the target used for drTMS, on the&#xD;
      insula contralateral to the pain side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will be randomized to be in in either the ON or OFF DBS mode for&#xD;
      three months, and then, after a flexible washout period, participants will be switched to the&#xD;
      other corresponding mode (OFF or ON) for more three months. The study main outcome is number&#xD;
      of responders (number of patients achieving &gt;30% pain intensity reduction). Pain intensity&#xD;
      will be measured on a 11-point visual numerical scale anchored at 0 (no pain) and 10 (maximal&#xD;
      pain imaginable) and the score at the end of the three-month ON/OFF conditions will be&#xD;
      compared to the respective baseline values in order too classify patients as responders or&#xD;
      non-responders in each of the ON/OFF conditions. The main secondary outcome is safety, along&#xD;
      with other clinical and general patients characteristics such as quality of life( QoL), mood,&#xD;
      pain characteristics (McGill Pain Questionnaire-MPQ) and neuropathic pain symptom clusters&#xD;
      (Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ON/OFF double blinded period (main outcome) patients will be maintained for 3&#xD;
      months in the ON mode in a single blinded design, and then for more 6 months, maintained in&#xD;
      the open phase of the study. This followup phase will allow us to gain insights into the&#xD;
      potential long term effects of the treatment.&#xD;
