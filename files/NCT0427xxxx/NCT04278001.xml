  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SOMNOtouch NIBP is a cuffless device for continuous blood pressure measurement. The&#xD;
      device is widely used, but validation for 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement&#xD;
      (ABPM) is limited. This study seeks to validate the SOMNOtouch device for use in 24-hour ABMP&#xD;
      as compared to a validated oscillometric device for 24-hour ABPM. A total of 60 patients with&#xD;
      indication for 24-hour BP measurement will be recruited from our tertiary hypertension&#xD;
      Clinic. All included patients will conduct dual 24-hour ABPM with both the SOMNOtouch NIBP&#xD;
      and a the oscillometric device. Furthermore, patients will undergo measurement of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness with a Sphygmocor device as well as complete a questionaire on device related&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;

      Recruitment of study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients with indication for 24-hour BP measurement will be recruited from our&#xD;
      tertiary hypertension clinic at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. Patients will be&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion if they are 18 years or older and have indication for ABPM with an&#xD;
      automated oscillometric device. Exclusion criteria will be as follows: Known significant&#xD;
      arterial abnormalities in the upper extremities, known cardiac arrythmia, upper arm&#xD;
      circumference &gt;16,5&quot; or &lt;6&quot;, or extreme uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. resting office BP &gt;&#xD;
      230/140 mmHg). To enable testing of the device at both normal and elevated BP-levels, we will&#xD;
      aim at including at least 15 patients in each of the following categories: Normal BP, stage 1&#xD;
      hypertension and stage ≥2, based on NICE guidelines for ABPM17. Informed consent will&#xD;
      obtained from all patients prior to inclusion in the study. At inclusion, a simultaneous&#xD;
      bilateral BP-measurement will be performed with three consecutive measurements using an&#xD;
      automated oscillometric device (Microlife WatchBP Office®) after 5 minutes of rest. If the&#xD;
      difference in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) between the arms is found to be &gt;5 mmHg, the&#xD;
      patient will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hour BP measurements: All staff related to the project are familiar with the SOMNOtouch&#xD;
      NIBP™ (SomBP) device, which has been used in our clinic for selected patients with high&#xD;
      cuff-based BP and at the same time symptoms of hypotension, since 2015. Mounting and&#xD;
      calibration of both devices will be conducted according to manufacturers' instructions. With&#xD;
      the patient sitting in an upright position with back-support, a conventional oscillometric&#xD;
      BP-device (Spacelabs 90217 / 90207, OscBP) will be fitted on the right arm, while the SomBP&#xD;
      will be fitted on the left arm. The SomBP will be calibrated with a single BP measurement&#xD;
      with a cuff-based sphygmomanometer. The OscBP will record BP three times every hour during&#xD;
      daytime and two times every hour during nighttime, while the SomBP will measure BP&#xD;
      continuously. The patients will be instructed to engage in normal activities but refrain from&#xD;
      strenuous exercise and, at the time of cuff-inflation, to stop moving and talking, while&#xD;
      keeping the arm still with the cuff at heart level. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) as well as&#xD;
      pulse wave analysis (PWA) will be performed in duplicate with the SphygmoCor system (version&#xD;
      8.2, Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia). A small questionnaire on device-related pain and/or&#xD;
      discomfort as well as sleeping habits will be provided to all participants. As per ESH&#xD;
      guidelines, a minimum of 70% useful measurements on the oscillometric device during the ABPM&#xD;
      will be required for the data to be considered useful. Assessment the acceptability of&#xD;
      data-quality of SomBP will be made on the basis of discussion between the primary&#xD;
      investigator and KLC, who, at the time of evaluation will both be blinded to the&#xD;
      corresponding OscBP measurement. No SomBP measurements will be accepted with more than 50%&#xD;
      failed measurement in the report. Data from both devices will be excluded from the study if&#xD;
      data-collection from either device is deemed to have insufficient quality to be usable. For&#xD;
      these instances, patients will be asked to repeat examination with both devices. SomBP1 data&#xD;
      will extracted ad hoc using Domino Light 1.4.0 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analysis will be performed using STATA software. A p-value of 0.05 will be&#xD;
      prespecified as statistically significant. Variables will be checked for distribution through&#xD;
      histograms and QQ-plots. Means will be compared using paired t-test. Standard regression&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to test for association in continuous variables. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be compared using chi-squared tests.&#xD;
