  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) secukinumab has&#xD;
      on the subject and their pyoderma gangrenosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secukinumab is a type of medicine called human monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      are proteins that recognize and attach to other specific proteins (in this case, immune&#xD;
      system hormones called &quot;cytokines&quot;) that your body produces. The cytokine (a &quot;messenger&quot;&#xD;
      protein in the body) that secukinumab binds to and reduces the activity of is a naturally&#xD;
      occurring cytokine called interleukin-17A (IL-17A). IL-17A is believed to be partly&#xD;
      responsible for inflammation (pain, swelling, redness), and researchers believe that IL-17A&#xD;
      may cause symptoms PG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, Phase IIa study of secukinumab in the treatment of&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with PG. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline (week 0), Week&#xD;
      1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, and then every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The total duration of&#xD;
      treatment is up to 20 weeks. Subjects may be treated for shorter durations if the lesions&#xD;
      clear prior to week 20. Subjects will have a follow-up visit at 24 weeks, or 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug. Subjects will also have standard of care wound dressings done at&#xD;
      each visit. Subjects will be given 300 mg of secukinumab SQ at week 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4,&#xD;
      followed by injections every 4 weeks, for up to 20 weeks. Subjects may receive a dose&#xD;
      increase at week 16 (if there is not at least a 25% reduction in target lesion size) to 300&#xD;
      mg every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic panel (CMP), C- reactive protein&#xD;
           (CRP), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Hepatitis panel, HIV test, Pregnancy test,&#xD;
           and QuantiFERON gold TB test will be performed at screening. (Appendix 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBC, CMP, CRP, ESR will be performed at week 8 and week 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain rating by Likert scale (A 10-point scale to rate the level of pain - Appendix 2),&#xD;
           an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) (Appendix 3), Subject Global Assessment (SGA)&#xD;
           (Appendix 3), and Ulcer Lesion Assessment (Appendix 5) will be done at Screening,&#xD;
           Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesion photography will be done at Screening and all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection and adverse event assessments and concomitant medication assessments will be&#xD;
           performed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life will be measured with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at&#xD;
           Baseline and Week 20 (Appendix 4).&#xD;
