  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The newborn infants who are sick and those who are born prior to due date (preterm) are&#xD;
      admitted to the neonatal unit. These babies are unable to feed through their mouth, so a&#xD;
      special tube is passed through their nose to the stomach, nasogastric (NG) tube) to provide&#xD;
      milk feeds. The bedside nurse inserts the tube and then aspirate some of the fluid from the&#xD;
      stomach. As the stomach normally produce acid, these aspirate is then tested on a colour&#xD;
      coded paper strip to check if the fluid is acidic. However, on many occasions this test is&#xD;
      not very clear. This could be due to misplacement of the tube or the stomach in a newborn not&#xD;
      being able to produce enough acid. This then leads to re-siting of another tube and following&#xD;
      the same procedure. Sometimes the clinical team may like to do an X Ray to check the position&#xD;
      of the tube resulting in unnecessary exposure to radiation. The study will use a special&#xD;
      chemical added to the currently existing paper test strip which the investigators believe&#xD;
      will enhance the capability of detecting the correct position of the NG tube. This idea has&#xD;
      been tested in adults and found to have increased the sensitivity of the test strip&#xD;
      significantly. Based on the adult study the study will require to test 233 babies to see if&#xD;
      this increases the sensitivity of correct NG tube placement. Parents of all babies who&#xD;
      requires an NG tube for milk feeds will be approached and after appropriate consent could be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. Babies who are clinically very unstable, moribund and those with&#xD;
      diagnosis of bowel obstruction will be excluded from the study.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the sensitivity of the chemical (tributyrin) impregnated pH test strip in&#xD;
      comparison to the routine pH test strip to increase the sensitivity of detection of correct&#xD;
      positioning of the nasogastric tube&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the number of nasogastric tube re-insertion attempts that could be avoided if&#xD;
           the tributyrin impregnated pH test strip was used instead of the standard pH test strip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the number of chest radiographs which could be avoided if the tributyrin&#xD;
           impregnated pH test strip was used instead of the standard pH test strip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To carry out human factors assessment of perceived usability, trust and acceptance of&#xD;
           the lipase-based pH test strip&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Prospective point of care diagnostic accuracy study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Sensitivity of proposed test in determining correct nasogastric (NG) tube position&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of chest x rays performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to confirm tube placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of nasogastric tube attempts to get the correct pH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of human factors - Perceived usability, trust and acceptance from&#xD;
           professionals' perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust from the neonatal&#xD;
      units at both the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea and St. Mary's hospital sites. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be identified by the clinical team and recruited by a member of the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of admitted infants will require nasogastric tube insertion as part of&#xD;
      their clinical management such as preterm infants, sick term infants with hypoxic- ischaemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and meconium aspiration syndrome as well as admitted infants for hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      and jaundice management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will be a diagnostic accuracy study of two diagnostic tests and will be&#xD;
      reported in accordance with the Standards for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD)&#xD;
      guidelines. The index tests will be (i) the novel tributyrin impregnated pH test strip and&#xD;
      (ii) standard pH test strip. The reference test used for comparison will be chest x-ray&#xD;
      performed earlier or later but with the same nasogastric tube in situ; or where this is not&#xD;
      required 'trial by use' (any chest x-rays undertaken would be decided and authorised by the&#xD;
      participant's clinical team who are clearly separated from the research team. Undergoing a&#xD;
      chest x-ray does not from part of screening for the study and is not a requirement of the&#xD;
      study protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingenza novel lipase/pH test strip&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test detects the organic acid released from tributyrin, a chemical ester impregnated onto&#xD;
      pH paper by the action of human gastric lipase that is stable in gastric juice and resistant&#xD;
      towards antacid medications, as well as unlikely to migrate. Ingenza have impregnated enteral&#xD;
      pH indicator strips that are in current clinical use with emulsion formulations of&#xD;
      tributyrin, protected by intellectual property as human gastric lipase substrates. Therefore,&#xD;
      the novel test strips will provide a positive result in the presence of an acidic environment&#xD;
      (pH less than or equal to 5.5) or gastric lipase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the tube insertion, the carer will aspirate the tube to obtain a sample of gastric&#xD;
      fluid. This will be done immediately following insertion or as part of daily position&#xD;
      confirmation that is routinely performed prior to initiation of nasogastric feeding. The&#xD;
      aspirate will be used by the healthcare professional, as part of routine care and the&#xD;
      remaining sample passed to a member of the research team. The healthcare professional will&#xD;
      test the aspirate routinely and make their decision based on the current standard pH strip&#xD;
      test. The remaining sample will be used by the research nurse blinded to the standard test,&#xD;
      to wet the gastric lipase enhanced pH test strip. The research nurse will then independently&#xD;
      assess the results of the study test paper at two minutes. Digital photographs of both the&#xD;
      routine and the study test papers will be assessed independently by member of the study team&#xD;
      to verify the findings. The healthcare professional will be blinded to the results of the&#xD;
      proposed test strip. The research nurse will record the results of the standard test strip&#xD;
      only after documenting the result of the proposed test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For standard pH strips a pH of ≤5.5 will indicate correct tube placement and &gt;5.5 indicates&#xD;
      incorrect nasogastric tube position. For the gastric lipase enhanced pH strip test a positive&#xD;
      result will be determined according to the manufacturer's recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants (preterm and term) who require the insertion of nasogastric tubes for&#xD;
      supplementary enteral feeding as part of their routine clinical management&#xD;
