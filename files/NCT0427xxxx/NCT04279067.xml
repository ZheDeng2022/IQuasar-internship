  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US alone, with approximately 795,000 new&#xD;
      cases annually. Despite the best available physiotherapy, 30-60% of stroke survivors remain&#xD;
      affected by difficulty walking, with foot weakness often being the main cause. Given that&#xD;
      post-stroke gait impairments remain poorly addressed, new methods that can provide lasting&#xD;
      improvements are necessary. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology may be one such novel&#xD;
      approach. BCI technology enables &quot;direct brain control&quot; of external devices such as assistive&#xD;
      devices and prostheses by translating brain waves into control signals. When BCI systems are&#xD;
      integrated with functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems, they can be used to deliver&#xD;
      a novel physical therapy to improve movement after stroke. BCI-FES systems are hypothesized&#xD;
      to stimulate recovery after stroke beyond that of conventional physical therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research indicates that applying this technique to foot weakness after stroke is&#xD;
      safe and may improve walking function. Hence, this warrants further investigation to: 1.&#xD;
      determine if BCI-FES therapy can provide lasting gains in walking in chronic stroke patients;&#xD;
      2. determine what factors influence BCI-FES therapy; and 3. explicitly elucidate the&#xD;
      underlying neural repair mechanisms. First, a Phase II clinical trial in patients with foot&#xD;
      drop due to chronic stroke will compare the effect of BCIFES dorsiflexion therapy to that of&#xD;
      dose- and intensity-matched standard physical therapy (Aim 1). Comparing the improvement in&#xD;
      walking speed and other secondary outcome measures between the two groups will test if&#xD;
      BCI-FES therapy provides functional and neurological gains beyond those of standard physical&#xD;
      therapy. The relationship between the patient baseline characteristics (walking speed, ankle&#xD;
      function, stimulated muscle responses, brain wave features, sensation) and the outcomes will&#xD;
      determine what features influence responsiveness to BCI-FES dorsiflexion therapy (Aim 2).&#xD;
      Finally, the underlying mechanism driving the improvements of BCI-FES will be studied (Aim&#xD;
      3). Determining that BCI-FES therapy can provide improvements beyond that of standard therapy&#xD;
      may lead to a new treatment for stroke patients. The underlying mechanism can inform the&#xD;
      design of future physical therapy techniques or improve current ones. Finally, BCI-FES&#xD;
      therapy may ultimately become a novel form of physical therapy to reduce post-stroke&#xD;
      disability, and in turn reduce the public health burden of stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will undergo placement of an EEG cap using standard technique connected to our custom BCI system. Subjects will provide 5 min of training EEG data as they engage in alternating epochs of idling and attempted foot dorsiflexion (of the paretic side). In the online phase, the subjects will perform 20-25 BCI-FES runs. A total of 12 sessions will be performed at a rate of 3x/week (over 4 weeks). Each BCI-FES therapy session will be followed by 1 hour of conventional physiotherapy.&#xD;
Conventional Physical Therapy: This will consist of a standardized regimen of activities typical of conventional post-stroke gait therapy, including passive/active range of motion exercises (to reduce/prevent excessive plantarflexor contractures), lower-extremity muscle strengthening, and a progression from treadmill to overground walking exercises.</description>
