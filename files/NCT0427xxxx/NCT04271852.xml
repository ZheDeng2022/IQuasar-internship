    <textblock>
      Background: Patients' life quality and physical and mental health are seriously affected by&#xD;
      Urgent Urinary Incontinence(UUI). The cause is not clear at present. It has been found that&#xD;
      the injury of the prefrontal lobe and damage to the surrounding cerebral cortex leads to&#xD;
      significant lower urinary tract dysfunction. Therefore, some scholars believe that urinary&#xD;
      axis of the brain exist between the urinary system and the central nervous system, and the&#xD;
      two are controlled by each other. Therefore, to study central conduction in patients with UUI&#xD;
      and changes of physiology, pathology, brain chemical, brain structure in brain functional&#xD;
      area caused by central sensitivity, in particular, changes in urine control cognition and&#xD;
      midbrain limbic system (including memory function areas) in the brain, is beneficial to more&#xD;
      in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis and treatment options. The Functional Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging provides a possibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method / design:Taking female UUI patients as target, through questionnaire survey, voiding&#xD;
      diary, specialist physique, examination,ultrasonic examination of pelvic floor muscle,&#xD;
      urodynamic examination and three sequence magnetic resonance scanning, after analyzing&#xD;
      structural image of brian, resting functional images, dispersion tensor image, comparing with&#xD;
      the normal control group and the female UUI group, before and after behavioral therapy in&#xD;
      patients with UUI, and those who have no urinary incontinence and those who still have&#xD;
      urinary incontinence after behavioral treatment, specific brain function biomarkers for&#xD;
      female UUI patients are found and the brain function mechanism of the female UUI is to be&#xD;
      explored in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study breaks through the traditional limitations on the cause of&#xD;
      incontinence.And it is the first time,the mental/behavior indicators of uui patients were&#xD;
      combined with fMRI(Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to explore biomarkers of brain and&#xD;
      brain structural changes in patients .Then,it is becoming more and more important that the&#xD;
      personalized treatment by building a UUI digital model using fMRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial that study on the mechanism of brain function in&#xD;
      women with urgent urinary incontinence by using fMRI. According to the exclusion criteria, 50&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and 50 UUI patients are recruited to carry out the related experimental&#xD;
      research.This study had been approved by the Ethics Committee of the second affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (No. LCK2019-291) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.50 UUI patients and 50 healthy volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Approved by the Scientific Research Ethics Review Committee of the second affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 20- 70 years old female volunteers are recruited by&#xD;
      studying advertising, reminding volunteers that the study is recruiting women with well&#xD;
      bladder control function through the answer to the relevant questionnaires as a screening&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Healthy volunteers (n=50) should empty thier bladder first ；than they perform a fMRI&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 The selected patients (n=50) will be inserted into 8F catheter for urine emptying,&#xD;
      determination of bladder pressure and injection of aseptic water. First of all, the subjects&#xD;
      empty their urine through the catheter, perform a fMRI scan first, and perform the following&#xD;
      cycle module after the first scan is complete:①Paused for 11s ②.Injecting 22ml aquae&#xD;
      sterilisata into bladder through catheter (completed in 11s ) ③.Paused for 11s ④.withdraw15ml&#xD;
      liquid through catheter (completed in 11s ) , running 1-5 modules in circles until the&#xD;
      subject issues a urination signal. With the subject's consent, the above cycle is repeated&#xD;
      once, to exclude dropout who will be marked as a failure in the study. The rest of the&#xD;
      patients completed the above circulation and patients with urine leakage scan the fMRI again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Every fMRI scan of each subject included in the study will be scanned on GE-Discovery 7503T&#xD;
      magnetic resonance machine for three sequences (T1,rsfMRI, DTI). The total scanning time is&#xD;
      about 25 minutes. The brain structural image (T1) uses GE BRAVO sequence for about 5 minutes&#xD;
      and the specific parameters are as follows:TR/TE=7.7/3.4 ms, Flip angle=12°, FOV=256 mm×256&#xD;
      mm, Resolution=256×256, Slice per volume=176, Slice thickness=1 mm. The rsfMRI(resting-state&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance) uses a single EPI sequence for about 10 minutes and the&#xD;
      specific parameters are as follows.TR/TE=2000/30 ms, Flip angle=90°, FOV=220 mm×220 mm,&#xD;
      Resolution=64×64, Slice thickness=4 mm, Slices per volume=32, Number of volumes=230. The&#xD;
      diffusion tensor image (DTI) uses a single diffusion-weighted spin echo EPI sequence for&#xD;
      about 10 minutes and the specific parameters are as follows:TR/TE=8000/80 ms, Flip angle=90°,&#xD;
      FOV=256 mm×256 mm, Resolution=128×128, Slice thickness=2 mm, Slices per volume=75. In order&#xD;
      to use the latest method to analyze the gray microstructure of the brain,investigators will&#xD;
      choose two non-zero b values:b=1000 s/mm2 , with a total of 23 dispersion directions; b =&#xD;
      2000 s/mm2 , with a total of 49 dispersion directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The 50 UUI patients who completed the above trial will be treated with behavioral therapy&#xD;
      for 3 months under the guidance of medical staff. The behavioral therapy includes: (1)&#xD;
      changes in the way of life including quit smoking, lose weight, keep a normal bowel movement,&#xD;
      drinking water in a regular basis, no coffee and white spirit, don't eat spicy and irritating&#xD;
      foods, regular urination and defecation, etc. (2) Bladder training: set a urination schedule,&#xD;
      with a short interval of time at first, when feeling urination is urgent, the tension of&#xD;
      bladder can be alleviated by slow deep breathing and mental transfer to increase the interval&#xD;
      of urination gradually. (3) have pelvic floor muscle exercise by drawing up the anus such as,&#xD;
      hold on to exhaust and defecate from the anus. The contraction lasts 3, 5 or 10 seconds. And&#xD;
      then completely relax the anus. The relaxation time is equal to the drawing up time of anus&#xD;
      with 10 to 15 times per exercise, and3 to 5 times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Patients with UUI who completed 3 months' behavioral therapy repeat the above 2 -5 study&#xD;
      steps again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.Relevant research parameters:Image parameters of brain function:investigators will first&#xD;
      get the whole brain voxel image parameters and investigators get local gray matter density in&#xD;
      structural image. Local degree will be gotten in functional image while local fractional&#xD;
      anisotropy, FA will be gotten in the dispersion tensor image. Then by calculating global gray&#xD;
      matter density, global degree and global FA, investigators will get the global variables of&#xD;
      the brain function (structural, functional and white matter connection anisotropy) of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Data analysis:①By comparing the image parameters of whole brain function with those of the&#xD;
      normal control group (Student t-test group comparison, two tails, p &lt; 0.05/3=0.017&#xD;
      （family-wise correction）),investigators will verify one of research assumptions, that is,&#xD;
      whether the brain of the UUI patient has a significant change in function and structure&#xD;
      (structural, functional, and white matter connection anisotropy) as compared to the brain of&#xD;
      a normal person; At the same time, By comparing the image parameters of whole brain voxel&#xD;
      image parameters with those of the normal control group (student t group comparison，two&#xD;
      tails, p &lt; 0.05, cluster size &gt; 30 (cluster-wise correction)), investigators find out those&#xD;
      specific significantly altered data (questionnaire for quality of life of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence I-QOL, FSFI- female sexual function index assessment) that shows significant&#xD;
      linear correlation (Pearson Correlation, p &lt;0.05, with age as covariate) with praxiology&#xD;
      where the brain region is a unique biomarker of brain function in patients with UUI. ②UUI&#xD;
      patients will be divided into two groups after treatment, that is, the symptoms of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence disappeared after treatment (abbreviated as the disappeared) and the urinary&#xD;
      incontinence was not relieved after treatment (abbreviated as the the unrelieved). Through&#xD;
      comparing the image parameters (F-test one-way ANOVA，two tails, p &lt; 0.05/3=0.017 (family-wise&#xD;
      correction))，of whole brain function among the three groups (normal control group, the&#xD;
      disappeared group and unrelieved group), investigators will verify the second hypothesis,&#xD;
      that is, for patients with UUI whose symptoms of urinary incontinence disappear after&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, whether the function and structure of the brain (structural, functional&#xD;
      and white matter connectivity) will change reversibly and return to its original state;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ③ Through analysis of changes in behavioral data before and after treatment (questionnaire&#xD;
      for quality of life of urinary incontinence I-QOL, FSFI- female sexual function index&#xD;
      assessment) and linear correlation analysis of all-brain functional image parameters (Pearson&#xD;
      Correlation, p &lt; 0.05, age as covariate), investigators can verify the third hypothesis, that&#xD;
      is, the degree of unrelieved urinary incontinence after UUI behavior therapy is significantly&#xD;
      correlated with his / her brain function and structural changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.Data analysis tools:FSL software will be applied for brain function image analysis, and&#xD;
      MATLAB and SPSS for data statistical analysis.&#xD;
