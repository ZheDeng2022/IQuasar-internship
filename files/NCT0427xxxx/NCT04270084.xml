  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate plasma ceramides (Cers) as early&#xD;
      nutrition-sensitive biomarkers of metabolic health. The investigators will implement a diet&#xD;
      and lifestyle intervention to improve cardiometabolic risk factors and test the corresponding&#xD;
      change in Cer levels. The intervention will incorporate: a) family-level engagement,&#xD;
      enrolling both adolescents and one parent/adult caretaker (PAC); and b) a behavior change&#xD;
      mobile health (m-health) app, which will offer real-time support, education and monitoring of&#xD;
      diet and activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dysregulated sphingolipid ceramide (Cer) metabolism impairs mitochondrial function, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and vascular reactivity and has been identified as a central common pathway&#xD;
      towards the dyslipidemia, central adiposity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension that define&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, characterized as cardiometabolic risk (CMR). The decrease in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity that occurs with age and predisposes to metabolic syndrome is preventable, a&#xD;
      reflection of changes in body composition rather than the aging process itself. Ectopic fat,&#xD;
      not fat mass per se, drives CMR, but despite mounting concern about rising prevalence of&#xD;
      pediatric CMR in America and globally, the use of plasma Cer as potentially mechanistic&#xD;
      biomarkers of ectopic fat and lipotoxicity has not been well explored. This may be driven in&#xD;
      part by our incomplete understanding of i) the consequences of Cer dysregulation in pediatric&#xD;
      CMR; ii) putative interactions between Cer and ectopic lipotoxicity; and iii) how lifestyle,&#xD;
      notably nutrition, impacts Cer metabolism. Information in these areas may support use of&#xD;
      plasma Cers as sensitive, prognostic biomarkers to guide more effective preventive lifestyle&#xD;
      management of aberrant weight gain and associated CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary work, the investigators compared plasma sphingolipid profiles in obese&#xD;
      adolescents and their parent/adult caretakers (PAC). Data from this study demonstrated that&#xD;
      Cers (notably C:14 and C:16) are associated with dyslipidemia in both adults and youth. The&#xD;
      investigators also found that 2-mo of a daily nutrient bar supplementation (coupled with&#xD;
      weekly group counseling and exercise) significantly decreased plasma Cers more effectively&#xD;
      than counseling and physical exercise alone, without change in traditional biomarkers but the&#xD;
      extent of Cer reduction correlated with improved dyslipidemia. The investigators also found&#xD;
      that 10 days of dietary fructose reduction in obese pre-adolescents significantly lowers cers&#xD;
      in direct proportion to the clearance of ectopic hepatic adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study hypotheses are supported, these findings will identify sensitive Cer biomarkers of&#xD;
      CMR with putative mechanistic insight to mitochondrial function requisite for insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, metabolic flexibility, lipolysis, and weight loss, that might therefore be used&#xD;
      to monitor early success in lifestyle change trials.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked use a mobile health (m-health) app for 2 months. The app is designed to provide weekly education and motivation about healthful diet and physical activity behaviors in adolescents and their parent/adult caretaker. Both adolescent and parent/adult caretaker participants will use the app to enter weekly self-report data, set healthy eating and exercise goals, and receive educational and motivational content. Participants will conduct a weekly self-assessment of waist circumference, diet, and physical activity during the 2 month trial.</description>
