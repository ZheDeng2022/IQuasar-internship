      Methods for breast reconstruction after mastectomy vary from rather simple techniques using&#xD;
      expanders and implants, local flaps alone or in combination with implants, to more complex&#xD;
      methods using autologous tissue.Transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flap has since 1983&#xD;
      become golden standard in autologous breast reconstruction. The deep inferior epigastric&#xD;
      perforator (DIEP)-flap, the very last improvement of TRAM flap, has been used in breast&#xD;
      reconstruction after mastectomy and radiation therapy as the method of choice at the&#xD;
      Department for Plastic Surgery at Hospital of Telemark since 2000.Transplantation of fat&#xD;
      tissue by lipoinjections is an alternative method for partial breast reconstruction. In&#xD;
      recent years, fat transplantation techniques have gained interest even for patients after&#xD;
      mastectomy, as donor site morbidity and operative trauma seem to be less than when free flaps&#xD;
      are used. Best results are obtained if the skin around mastectomy scar is pretreated with&#xD;
      external expansion. The results of breast reconstruction with fat transplantation are&#xD;
      promising, but have not been compared to microsurgical reconstruction of the breast in a&#xD;
      scientific manner. The present project is designed to address clinical questions regarding&#xD;
      efficiency and patient satisfaction of the two methods.&#xD;

      When used for breast reconstruction on irradiated patients, breast implants can result in 50%&#xD;
      or higher rate of complications included capsular contracture and implant rupture. For this&#xD;
      reasons secondary breast reconstruction in irradiated patients is preferably done with&#xD;
      autologous tissue.Reconstruction methods employing microvascular transfer of autologous&#xD;
      tissue are time consuming having a long learning curve for surgeons. The present project aims&#xD;
      to evaluate fat transplantation in combination with external tissue expansion (Brava method)&#xD;
      as an alternative to microsurgical complexe methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Early complication/ drop out occur more frequently in fat transplantated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: External tissue expanders (Brava, Brava, LLC 14221 SW 142nd St, Miami, FL 33186)&#xD;
      will be used 3 weeks prior to reconstruction in order to enhance the volume and survival of&#xD;
      fat cells. The investigators expect that each patient in the fat transplantation group will&#xD;
      need 4-6 transplantation sessions of about 1.5 to 2 hours each to achieve satisfactory volume&#xD;
      and shape of the breast. The investigators expect 1-2 operative sessions of respectively 5-7&#xD;
      and 2-3 hours duration in the DIEP group. The risk of reoperation (second operation during&#xD;
      the first postoperative week) in the DIEP group is 5-10 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the fat transplantation group experiencing poor compliance or early complications&#xD;
      as well as patients with unsatisfactory results will be offered alternative methods of&#xD;
      reconstruction such as superior or inferior gluteal perforator flap (SGAP or IGAP),&#xD;
      Latissimus dorsi pedicled flap alone or in combination with implant. In some cases even&#xD;
      simple implant reconstruction could be offered assuming that the quality of previously&#xD;
      irradiated skin has been improved by fat transplants .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Reconstruction with BRAVA and fat transplantation is a good alternative to&#xD;
      reconstruction with DIEP flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables: MRI-based volume estimates, anthropometric measurements, VAS scale (Breast-Q&#xD;
      - questionnaire measuring patient-related outcome) and Telemark breast score evaluation&#xD;
      through independent investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Power analysis determine that 25 patients are required in each group in this&#xD;
      study considering 80 % power with 95 % significance and 40 % difference with regard to&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and early complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: 6 months after DIEP reconstruction and 3 months after the second session of fat&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: assessment of early complications in both study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: patient satisfaction with shape and symmetry of the breast, Satisfaction&#xD;
      with psychosocial, psychological and sexual well-being, satisfaction with process of care,&#xD;
      shape of the body and postoperative scars (Breast-Q).&#xD;
