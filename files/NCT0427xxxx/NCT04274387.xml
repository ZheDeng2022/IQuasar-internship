      Background Emotional distress is known to render vicious effects both mentally and&#xD;
      physiologically to human beings. Emotional regulation is therefore an important capability to&#xD;
      dilute the poisonous effect of emotional distress. The cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness&#xD;
      thinking are two major strategies that have been empirically tested and supported to be&#xD;
      effective emotional regulation approaches. Oftentimes, entry-level practitioners of&#xD;
      mindfulness get confused easily between the cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness approach to&#xD;
      emotional regulation in that they look similar in some of their practice forms. However, they&#xD;
      are quite different from each other in terms of their fundamental concept. Although there are&#xD;
      already many studies contribute to the mechanisms underlying these two approaches&#xD;
      independently, very few studies have been proposed to directly investigate the fundamental&#xD;
      differences of the underlying neural mechanisms between the two approaches. The current&#xD;
      proposal therefore aims to compare the underlying neural mechanisms between the cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal and the mindfulness approaches within the context of emotional processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives We propose herein a 2-year research project to address the following two&#xD;
      hypotheses: (1) we hypothesize that the differences in terms of neural activation patterns&#xD;
      between the mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal responses toward positive or negative&#xD;
      stimuli in the emotion regulation task (ERT) will appear only after certain amount of MBSR&#xD;
      training and (2) we hypothesize that the 10-week Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR)&#xD;
      training will be accompanied by the increased resting-state functional connectivity between&#xD;
      the salience network (involved in the process of meta-awareness) and both the dorsal&#xD;
      attention network (i.e., attention to the outside world) and the default mode network (i.e.,&#xD;
      attention to the internal state).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods For the current proposal, we will use a pre-post-test plus longitudinal follow-up&#xD;
      design research design. Based on the power analysis, we expect to recruit 45 adults&#xD;
      (convenient sampling). We will collect neuropsychological, EEG and fMRI data from each&#xD;
      participants at three time points with one time point before the MBSR training course&#xD;
      (pre-test), one time point immediately after completing the MBSR training course (post-test)&#xD;
      and one time point 8 months after completing the MBSR training course (8-month follow-up).&#xD;
      For the neuropsychological measures, we will use the MAAS for evaluating trait mindfulness,&#xD;
      DERS for evaluating emotional regulation and dysregulationand IRI for evaluating cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional empathy level. For the fMRI measures, we will analyze the functional activation&#xD;
      patterns between the cognitive reappraisal and the mindfulness process of emotion regulation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will analyze the functional connectivity based on the resting-state fMRI data&#xD;
      to investigate the change of pre- and post-MBSR training. For EEG measures, we will further&#xD;
      analyze the different time-frequency patterns between these two types of emotional&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results We expect that the results will help unravel the functional changes of&#xD;
      neuronal circuits associated with the transition from habitual cognitive reappraisal strategy&#xD;
      to a mindfulness strategy, after an intensive mindfulness-based training. We hope that the&#xD;
      overall outcomes from the current proposal will help enrich our knowledge that will enhances&#xD;
      the translation of applying cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness based approaches in&#xD;
      clinical psychiatry.&#xD;
