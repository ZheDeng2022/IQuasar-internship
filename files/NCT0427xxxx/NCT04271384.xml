    <textblock>
      Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carries up to 30% chance of relapse in 5 years.&#xD;
      Surgery is standard-of-care for this population. For patients who are not candidate for&#xD;
      surgery, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is standard, with good local control but&#xD;
      locoregional and distant failure. The use of preoperative SABR leads to a pathological&#xD;
      complete response rate (pCR) of 60%. Anti-PD-1 has the ability to provoke a pCR in around 20%&#xD;
      of patients as a single agent. Moreover, it has synergic activity with radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This a phase 2 study that aims to determine the pathological complete response of the&#xD;
      combination of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy plus nivolumab as neoadjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The patients will receive standard SABR, given either&#xD;
      as 3, 5 or 8 fractions (depending on tumor size and location) + nivolumab at a dose of 360 mg&#xD;
      every 21 days for 3 doses. The patient will undergo surgery 10 weeks after the last&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose. We will measure translational biomarkers associated with either pCR or&#xD;
      resistance to therapy.&#xD;
