  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current proposal is to determine the effectiveness of long-term&#xD;
      consumption of Fibersym® RW for improving blood lipids (including cholesterol) and body&#xD;
      composition. The overall goal of this clinical research is to determine the potential effects&#xD;
      that RS4 consumption may have on the prevention of obesity and obesity-related diseases.&#xD;
      Fiber in the form of RS4 will be used for the proposed study, given that fiber has been shown&#xD;
      to have many beneficial effects on modifiable risk factors associated with obesity-related&#xD;
      diseases. Using a long-term randomized-controlled intervention design, blood lipids (total&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides) and body composition will be assessed. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate reductions in cholesterol and body fat percentage following 8-weeks&#xD;
      of Fibersym® RW consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the metabolic effects of daily RS4 consumption in overweight and&#xD;
      obese adults. The investigators will recruit approximately 50 (BMI: 23-34.9kg/m2) adults ages&#xD;
      18-65yrs, who have elevated to borderline-high LDL-cholesterol (116-159mg/dL) to an 8-week&#xD;
      randomized controlled intervention. Participants will be recruited in three waves of 16&#xD;
      participants each. Following a 7-10-day run-in where fiber intake is monitored, participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the control or the RS4 group. The RS4 group will consume a high&#xD;
      fiber bar, daily, for 8-weeks that will contain approximately 60-70% of the daily reccomended&#xD;
      allowance of fiber. The primary outcome for this study will be fasting plasma LDL-Cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-c). Secondary outcomes include body composition following daily RS4 consumption for&#xD;
      8-weeks. All health assessments will be conducted before the intervention begins, at the&#xD;
      4-week mid-point, and immediately following the 8-week intervention. Participants will fast&#xD;
      for 10 -12 hrs. before reporting to the PAN-CRC for each testing session. The meal consumed&#xD;
      prior to each testing session will be standardized so that it does not vary within the&#xD;
      individual between testing sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments. The two treatment conditions are RS4 and control. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      consume one nutrition bar as part of their breakfast each day with no other changes to their&#xD;
      diet. The control group will consume one native wheat starch bar per day. The RS4 group will&#xD;
      consume one nutrition bar per day formulated using Fibersym® RW containing 20g fiber. This&#xD;
      amount would likely put individuals in the recommended dietary fiber intake range according&#xD;
      to the dietary recommended intake ( Institutes of Medicine: 14g fiber/1000 kcal). All&#xD;
      nutrition bars will contain the same ingredients and be matched for calories; however, fiber&#xD;
      will vary between the bars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health assessments. The KSU Nutrition team will conduct all health assessments at each time&#xD;
      point. Height (cm), weight (kg), and waist circumference (cm) will be measured to determine&#xD;
      basic anthropometrics, and a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) will be used to&#xD;
      determine body composition (body fat percentage and non-fat mass). Blood pressure (systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic (mmHg) will be measured using a standard automated monitor. Fasting total&#xD;
      cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TRG), glucose, LDL-c, and HDL-c will be measured via an LDX&#xD;
      Cholestech using a single venous blood draw for assessment. Plasma glucose and insulin will&#xD;
      be determined via the same venous sample. Satiety will be measured during each testing&#xD;
      session to determine how Fibersym® RW impacts feelings of fullness and hunger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Checks. To ensure compliance with consumption of the nutrition bars provided,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to return to the PAN-CRC to return any leftover bars at the end of&#xD;
      each intervention week (if any remain), and to pick up a new supply of their assigned bar.&#xD;
      Participants will also be given a checklist that indicates their daily consumption of the&#xD;
      given bars. The checklist will include options such as: I consumed the 100% of the bar,&#xD;
      forgot to consume, consumed part of the bar (with options to check a percent of the bar&#xD;
      consumed). To ensure that habitual dietary intake is maintained, participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to complete a 3-day dietary record (two weekdays and 1 weekend day) prior to each&#xD;
      testing session, allowing the investigators to determine any dietary changes that may occur&#xD;
      during the 8-week intervention.&#xD;
