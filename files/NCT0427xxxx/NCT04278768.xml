      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2a dose escalation and expansion study of orally&#xD;
      administered CA-4948 monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine or venetoclax in adult&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Phase 1 of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for CA-4948 in monotherapy in patients with AML,&#xD;
      intermediate high risk, high risk MDS based on the safety and tolerability, dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs), and Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacodynamic (PD) findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Phase 1b of the study is to determine MTD and RP2D for CA 4948 in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine (AZA) in treatment naïve patients with AML or hrMDS or in&#xD;
      combination with venetoclax (VEN) in relapsed/ refractory (R/R) patients with AML or high&#xD;
      risk myelodysplastic syndrome (hrMDS) after first line treatment, that are VEN naïve, based&#xD;
      on the safety and tolerability, DLTs and PK and pharmacodynamic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Phase 2a of the study (CA-4948 monotherapy expansion) is to assess&#xD;
      complete response (CR) and duration of response in patients with R/R FLT-3 AML, R/R AML&#xD;
      FLT3-Wildtype (WT) and R/R hrMDS and to assess tolerability, and long-term safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA-4948 is formulated as tablets for twice daily oral administration. Each treatment cycle&#xD;
      will be 28 days in length and repeated in the absence of toxicity. Patients who tolerate&#xD;
      CA-4948 may continue to receive CA-4948 until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal from the trial, or study termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CA-4948 starting dose level will be 200 mg twice daily (BID) which was determined to be&#xD;
      safe, capable of achieving relevant levels of drug exposure as well as demonstrating signs of&#xD;
      biologic activity and clinical efficacy in an ongoing study (Study CA-4948-101). For phase 1,&#xD;
      CA-4948 is taken daily for 28 days of a 28 day cycle. For Phase 1b, CA-4948 is taken daily&#xD;
      for 21 days of a 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax will be administered at 100 mg orally (Day 1) per the product label at the same&#xD;
      time each day with a ramp up over 3 days to 400 mg for 21days of a 28-day Cycle. Second and&#xD;
      subsequent cycles start with the target dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) will be administered as 7 doses&#xD;
      on a 28 Cycle (e.g., 7 consecutive doses or split doses with weekend break 5-2), starting at&#xD;
      Day 1, and in accordance with local prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the Phase 1/1b cohorts, three patients with AML or MDS will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      designated dose. If none of the first 3 patients experience a DLT during the first cycle,&#xD;
      patients may be enrolled into the next higher dose level. If 1 patient out of the first 3&#xD;
      experiences a DLT, the dose level may be expanded with an additional 3 patients. If 2 or 3&#xD;
      patients out of the first six experience a DLT, this will be considered a DLT rate above the&#xD;
      MTD (&gt; 33%), and additional enrollment will proceed at a lower dose level. Any adverse&#xD;
      reaction that leads to dose reduction or discontinuation is considered a DLT unless the&#xD;
      adverse reaction is clearly and solely related to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RP2D will be determined by the Clinical Safety Committee (CSC) in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Sponsor, considering all aspects of safety, tolerability, biologic activity, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy in the trial population. The intent of the RP2D is to provide a dose&#xD;
      and schedule that will maximize the opportunity for clinical benefit, while minimizing the&#xD;
      risk of toxicity. The RP2D may be below the MTD. The CSC may request enrollment of additional&#xD;
      patients at any previously-explored dose level in order to make an appropriate RP2D or MTD&#xD;
      determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion phase will begin once the RP2D from Phase 1 Dose Escalation phase has been&#xD;
      identified. There will be 4 Cohorts and patients will be assigned to each Cohort based on&#xD;
      baseline disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: R/R AML, FLT3-ITD mutant AML patients after failing at least 1 to 3&#xD;
           pretreatments, including a FLT3 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: R/R AML with FLT3 WT, after failing 1 to 3 pretreatments. Desired enrichment&#xD;
           for expression of spliceosome mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: R/R hrMDS with spliceosome mutations (SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2, ZRSR2),&#xD;
           resistant/refractory to HMA; ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; maximal 3&#xD;
           pretreatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: R/R hrMDS without spliceosome mutations; resistant/refractory to r/r to HMA;&#xD;
           ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; maximal 3 pretreatments&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 and 1b follow a 3 + 3 design where 3 patients will be enrolled at the starting dose level. If none of the first 3 patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) during the 1st cycle, patients may be enrolled into the next higher dose level. If 1 patient out of the first 3 experiences a DLT, the dose level may be expanded with an additional 3 patients. If 2 or 3 patients out of the first siz experience a DLT, this will be considered a DLT rate above the max tolerated dose (&gt; 33%), and additional enrollment will proceed at a lower dose level. In Phase 2a Dose Expansion (Monotherapy), for each Cohort a Simon-2-Stage design will be employed with a minimum of 9 patients enrolled in each cohort (Stage 1). If a response is observed, a total of 30 patients will be enrolled in each Cohort. If the clinical response rate is ≥ 30% in any Cohort, additional patients (max of 35) may be entered to provide a tighter estimate of the 95% confidence interval around the clinical response rate.</intervention_model_description>
