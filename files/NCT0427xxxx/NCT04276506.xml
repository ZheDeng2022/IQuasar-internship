  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, due to the increasing frequency of cardiovascular diseases the number of coronary&#xD;
      angiography performed has also risen. This invasive procedure has an effect on patients which&#xD;
      causes anxiety. Its important to determine of the level of anxiety so experienced nurses&#xD;
      carried out various interventions to reduce anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the effect of listening music and getting information on the&#xD;
      level of anxiety and vital signs of the patients who are planned to undergo coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, calming music which is suitable for the heart rhythm and booklets which is&#xD;
      prepared with various visuals will be used. In the study, apart from a control group that&#xD;
      routine clinical procedures will be applied, there will be two more groups which are called&#xD;
      as music and information groups. Patients' participation in these groups will be distributed&#xD;
      randomly by computer.&#xD;

      The patients will be included to this study who will undergo coronary angiography first time&#xD;
      and admitted to hospital by appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inserting IV canulla, taking and recording vital signs, and informing about angiography are&#xD;
      routine procedures for patients who are admitted to hospital for coronary angiography. These&#xD;
      procedures will also be applied to the patient groups involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to the groups in accordance with the randomization table. After&#xD;
      explaining the purpose and method of the study to the patients, their consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.In this experimental study all datas will be collected by Descriptive&#xD;
      Characteristics Form, Vital Findings Follow-Up Form and The State-Continuity Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital Signs Follow-Up Form will be recorded according to patients' findings, such as heart&#xD;
      rate per minute, blood pressure as mmHg and respiratory rate per minute both before and after&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The State-Continuity Anxiety Inventory will be applied before angiography to determine the&#xD;
      anxiety level of the patients. After the angiography, the state anxiety inventory will be&#xD;
      repeated.The information group; A visual information booklet which is prepared by the&#xD;
      researcher will be used. In the booklet; Information about coronary arteries, angiography&#xD;
      laboratory features, patient preparation procedure and post-procedure are explained with&#xD;
      various visuals. The booklet which contains researchers telephone numbers will be given to&#xD;
      patients, when they come to hospital to get an angiography appointment. The patients will be&#xD;
      asked to read the booklet until the day of angiography. If patients need to ask some&#xD;
      questions, they will be able to reach the researchers within specified hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Music group; A soothing type of music including five kinds sounds of nature which&#xD;
      suitable for heart rate was selected and recorded on MP3. When they arrive hospital for&#xD;
      angiography they will be explained how to use MP3 player and headset in the room. All music&#xD;
      stored on the MP3 player will be played to the patient for five to ten seconds. They will be&#xD;
      asked to choose their preferred music. The patient will listen the music which is chosen for&#xD;
      30 minutes via headset. In order to prevent contamination, disposable ear cups will be used&#xD;
      for each patient.&#xD;
