      Introduction: Inguinal hernioplasty is the standard treatment for inguinal hernia. Mesh&#xD;
      fixation is used to keep mesh in place for which various mesh fixation techniques have been&#xD;
      used in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, but their effectiveness has remained&#xD;
      inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: Randomized comparative study comparing early and late outcome of different&#xD;
      method of mesh fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In Zagazig University Hospitals, over the period from July 2016 to July 2018,&#xD;
      patients with with oblique inguinal hernias undergoing Tans abdominal preperitoneal technique&#xD;
      were randomized into 3 groups: Group A; mesh non fixation . Group B; tacker mesh fixation&#xD;
      Group C: Cyanoacrylic tissue glues (Histoacryl) mesh fixation Clinical effects were assessed&#xD;
      by the following variables: intraoperative data, postoperative outcome as regard recurrence&#xD;
      rate, postoperative complications, analgesic consumption, operation time, hospital stay, and&#xD;
      patient costs. Follow up was 18 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernias are the commonest hernia met in clinical practice and accounts for 75% of&#xD;
      abdominal hernia. Inguinal hernia repair is regarded as the standard treatment for adult&#xD;
      symptomatic inguinal hernia following the international guideline for groin hernia management&#xD;
      in which mesh is used to reinforce inguinal floor. Surgical mesh repair can be performed by&#xD;
      open or laparoscopic techniques. Lichtenstein repair is commonly applied for open approach&#xD;
      whereas trans-abdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) and totally extra peritoneal repair (TEP)&#xD;
      are commonly used for laparoscopic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the repair of an inguinal hernia, sutures or tacks are generally used to secure the&#xD;
      prosthetic mesh in place. In TAPP repairs the peritoneum is closed using sutures or tacks.&#xD;
      These mesh ﬁxation or peritoneal closure techniques may contribute to postoperative chronic&#xD;
      pain presumably due to nerve irritation or entrapment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques for mesh fixations have been used including suture, glue or self-gripping&#xD;
      mesh for open hernia repair (OHR); metallic tack, absorbable tack, glue, suture,&#xD;
      self-gripping mesh or even non-fixation techniques for laparoscopic hernia repair (LHR). Up&#xD;
      to date, there have been eight systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) on OHR (ie, glue&#xD;
      vs suture (n=5) and self-gripping mesh vs suture (n=3) and one network meta-analysis (NMA For&#xD;
      LHR, comparisons were tack and glue (n=6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      fixation versus no fixation (n=3) .Although evidences were interesting, the overall results&#xD;
      were inconclusive. In mesh-based repair, flat mesh is recommended over three-dimension mesh,&#xD;
      while self-gripping mesh is another alternative mesh..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative strategies to reduce pain include the non-ﬁxation of mesh or the use of&#xD;
      non-mechanical methods of mesh ﬁxation other than tacking or suturing, which may be less&#xD;
      traumatic to the local tissue and less likely to cause local nerve entrapment. These&#xD;
      non-mechanical methods include self-ﬁxating meshes or glue. Similarly, closing the peritoneum&#xD;
      with sutures may be less traumatic than the use of tacks, thus resulting in less&#xD;
      postoperative pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once positioned, meshes are designed to be integrated in local tissue by a fibrotic reaction&#xD;
      that gradually incorporates them. Therefore, a good fixation is essential to secure the mesh&#xD;
      in its correct position, while the integration process occurs. The introduction of synthetic&#xD;
      meshes and their proper fixation has reduced recurrence rates to below 5%. As a consequence,&#xD;
      the most frequent postoperative morbidities have become mesh migration, chronic pain,&#xD;
      infection, and seroma .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyanoacrylic glues ensure high-degree and strong bonding to biologic tissues .When they get&#xD;
      in contact with blood or water contained in the tissue, they form a very tight cover, binding&#xD;
      to the surface within 5-6 s Overall, tacks provide excellent fixation strength, and they are&#xD;
      also easy to apply. Nevertheless, their use is associated with significant morbidity. The&#xD;
      penetration of the abdominal wall, in fact, may cause nerve and vessel entrapment. Also,&#xD;
      tacks are themselves foreign bodies introduced in the abdomen, so they may cause inflammatory&#xD;
      reactions. As a result, a significant number of patients suffer from pain and develop&#xD;
      adhesion in the postoperative period. Moreover, cases of migration of titanium tacks have&#xD;
      been described. At present, absorbable tacks are connected to lower inflammation rates,&#xD;
      adhesion formation, and migration so the use of titanium tacks is no longer advisable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to determine whether there is any clinical or statistical difference in outcomes and&#xD;
      morbidity when mesh is ﬁxed or not during laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair. We will&#xD;
      also compare different methods of mesh ﬁxation (i.e.no fixation, tacks (non-absorbable and&#xD;
      absorbable), and histoacryl) and techniques of peritoneal closure in TAPP repairs&#xD;
      (tacks/sutures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. It was conducted on sixty adult male&#xD;
      patients presenting with oblique inguinal hernia admitted in general surgery department,&#xD;
      faculty of medicine Zagazig university from June 2016 to June 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients in this study were performed under the same surgical team after fulfilling&#xD;
      the consent of the operation and after acceptance of the faculty of medicine Zagazig ethical&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly divided into three groups Group (A): includes twenty patients: no&#xD;
      mesh fixation. Group (B): includes twenty patients: fixation of the mesh by tacker Group C:&#xD;
      includes twenty patients: fixation of mesh by histoacryl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of outcome measures Primary outcomes: Hernia recurrence (clinical or radiological at&#xD;
      any time point), Chronic pain: pain persisting beyond three months postoperatively and&#xD;
      persisting numbness: numbness in the groin or testicle persisting beyond three months&#xD;
      postoperatively Secondary outcomes: Length of surgery (in minutes), Immediate postoperative&#xD;
      pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)/ pain score),Vascular/visceral injury at&#xD;
      operation,Haematoma/seroma development in postoperative period, Length of hospital stay (in&#xD;
      days),Urinary retention in immediate postoperative period, Wound infection/mesh infection at&#xD;
      any time point and Recovery time to normal activity (in days)&#xD;
