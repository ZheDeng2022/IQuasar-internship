  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot study examining the feasibility and potential utility of&#xD;
      administering a psychosocial intervention termed Affective Modulation of Positivity (AMP) for&#xD;
      individuals suffering from co-morbid depression or anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      (AMP-A). The aims of this study are to (1) determine the feasibility and potential utility of&#xD;
      administering AMP-A with individuals suffering from alcohol use disorders, (2) explore the&#xD;
      potential impact of training on positive and negative affect, symptom severity, and&#xD;
      functional disability, and (3) explore the potential impact of training on neural reactivity&#xD;
      to reward and alcohol cues during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

      This study is a non-randomized, single-arm, single-site clinical trial conducted at Laureate&#xD;
      Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) in Tulsa, OK. The primary objective for this study is to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting positive affect training with&#xD;
      individuals suffering from substance use disorder. Primary outcome will include treatment&#xD;
      completion rate; secondary outcome will include the score on a participant feedback&#xD;
      questionnaire. The investigators hypothesize that the majority of participants (&gt;60%) will&#xD;
      complete all 11 sessions of the intervention and that participant feedback concerning the&#xD;
      intervention will be at least moderately favorable on average.The secondary objective(s) is&#xD;
      to explore the potential impact of training on positive and negative affect, symptom&#xD;
      severity, and functional disability. The investigators hypothesize that positive affect will&#xD;
      significantly increase from baseline to post-intervention, while negative affect,&#xD;
      alcohol-related craving, and functional disability will significantly decrease. A tertiary&#xD;
      objective is to explore the potential impact of training on behavioral and neural responses&#xD;
      involving the processing of positively valenced or alcohol-related cues. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that activation with striatal and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regions to&#xD;
      alcohol-UNrelated reward cues will increase from baseline to post-intervention, while&#xD;
      striatal and OFC response to alcohol-related cues will decrease from baseline to&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete interview and pencil-and-paper questionnaires related&#xD;
      to clinical symptoms, traits and personality characteristics, daily life function, and&#xD;
      medical and mental health history at both pre- and post-intervention. Participants will also&#xD;
      be asked to complete brief follow-up survey sessions 3 months after completing treatment. If&#xD;
      there are participants who are only able to complete part of the intervention (i.e., only&#xD;
      able to attend a few of the sessions) either due to their own wish to terminate or due to&#xD;
      exclusion criteria or clinical concerns, they will only be asked to complete survey sessions&#xD;
      for weeks that they attend. Neuroimaging procedures will be conducted at both pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention. Each neuroimaging session will last approximately 1.5-2.5 hours and will&#xD;
      involve completion of self-report measures regarding current affective state and sleepiness&#xD;
      and a functional MRI session during which participants will complete tasks related to reward&#xD;
      processing and alcohol cue reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of baseline assessments, participants will be asked to complete 11&#xD;
      sessions of the positive affect intervention, conducted once or twice weekly and with each&#xD;
      session lasting 1 - 1.5 hours. If the content of sessions is too much to cover for any one&#xD;
      client, the intervention may be extended to 13 sessions as needed. Participants will be&#xD;
      expected to complete all intervention sessions within 16 weeks of starting the first session.&#xD;
      Each session will be completed as individual therapy sessions (i.e., one-on-one with a&#xD;
      therapist). The positive affect intervention will involving positive emotion enhancement&#xD;
      exercises established in prior studies, including noticing and amplifying positive emotions,&#xD;
      practicing gratitude, engaging in acts of kindness, and pleasurable or meaningful activities,&#xD;
      identifying strengths and values, being optimistic, engaging in activities meant to make&#xD;
      others happy, and living life to its fullest. The investigators will use the protocol&#xD;
      developed by Taylor et al. with modifications to specifically address alcohol use, based on&#xD;
      previous work. The general structure of each session will follow standard cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral treatment regimens as follows: (1) meet with clinician to review completion of the&#xD;
      prior week's exercises, including self-monitoring forms of emotions and exercise completion;&#xD;
      (2) identify and troubleshoot any issues that arose during exercise completion; (3) introduce&#xD;
      material about a new positive emotion enhancement activity; (4) identify concrete exercises&#xD;
      to implement for the upcoming week.&#xD;

        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unwillingness or inability to complete any of the major aspects of the study protocol,&#xD;
             including self-report or behavioral assessment. However, failing to complete some&#xD;
             individual aspects of these assessment sessions will be acceptable (i.e., being&#xD;
             unwilling to answer individual items on some questionnaires or being unwilling to&#xD;
             complete a behavioral task).&#xD;
&#xD;

             posttraumatic amnesia) or other neurocognitive disorder with evidence of neurological&#xD;
             deficits, neurological disorders, or severe or unstable medical conditions that might&#xD;
             be compromised by participation in the study (to be determined by primary care&#xD;
             provider).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Severity of alcohol use disorder requiring more intensive treatment (i.e., intensive&#xD;
             outpatient or residential), as determined by baseline assessments conducted by&#xD;
