      A advisory will be activated in the ICUs patient data management system. The trial will be&#xD;
      conducted as observational cohort trial. During the first six month all patients with a LIPS&#xD;
      ≥ 4 will be included in the control group. No change of care is needed. In a second phase&#xD;
      during the next six months, all patients with a LIPS ≥ 4 will be included into the advisory&#xD;
      group where advisories will be shown in the patient data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create this advisory, a clinical advisory rule is executed every 4 hours and the&#xD;
      appropriate advisory text is calculated. If the defined threshold values (driving pressure ≥&#xD;
      15mbar) are reached, then the advisory displays a recommendation to rethink the patient's&#xD;
      ventilation strategy. Furthermore, permissive hypercapnia and oxygen saturating limits&#xD;
      considered as safe will be given. (paCO2: 55mmHg, pH: 7.25, paO2: 80 mmHg, SaO2: 92%)&#xD;

      Background Lung protective ventilation is a well-established treatment to reduce&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in patients suffering from ARDS. To quantify lung&#xD;
      protective ventilation the concept of driving pressure (ΔP) and mechanical power were&#xD;
      postulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although low tidal volumes and low driving pressures are considered standard of care, it was&#xD;
      shown that lung protective ventilation is very little used in ICU patients. Especially in&#xD;
      those with a less severe lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are gaining more attention in clinical&#xD;
      practice. They have been successfully used to increase medical provider adherence to&#xD;
      guidelines or local department policy. Another successful means of influencing behavior of&#xD;
      medical providers are so called nudge-based interventions. Currently there is little evidence&#xD;
      on nudge-type interventions or automated alerts for ventilator settings in the ICU. To our&#xD;
      knowledge studies that linked these interventions to a change in patient's outcome are&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Activation of an advisory in the patient data management system accompanied by&#xD;
      educational sessions and feedback emails decrease ventilation driving pressure in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients at increased risk of ARDS (LIPS ≥ 4). As secondary outcome&#xD;
      parameters, incidence of ARDS, ventilator free days, reintubation rate, length of stay in the&#xD;
      ICU or the hospital and mortality at day 28 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods As an advisory is activated in the ICU software, medical staff caring for the&#xD;
      patients can't be blinded. Therefore, the trial will be conducted as observational cohort&#xD;
      trial. During the first six month all patients with a LIPS ≥ 4 will be included in the&#xD;
      control group. No change of care is needed. In a second phase during the next six months, all&#xD;
      patients with a LIPS ≥ 4 will be included into the alert group where advisories will be shown&#xD;
      in the patient data management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create this advisory, a clinical advisory rule is executed every 4 hours and the&#xD;
      appropriate advisory text is calculated. If the defined threshold values (driving pressure ≥&#xD;
      15mbar) are reached, then the advisory displays a recommendation to rethink the patient's&#xD;
      ventilation strategy. Furthermore, permissive hypercapnia and oxygen saturating limits&#xD;
      considered as safe will be given. (paCO2: 55mmHg, pH: 7.25, paO2: 80 mmHg, SaO2: 92%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome The primary outcome is an improvement of medical stuff's adherence to current&#xD;
      recommendations shown by a reduction of the mean ventilator driving pressure (by using the&#xD;
      AUC of driving pressures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are ventilator free days, 28-day mortality, reintubation rate,&#xD;
      incidence of ARDS and length of stay in the ICU and the hospital.&#xD;
