  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are common in adolescence and recognized as an international public health&#xD;
      concern given their links to a range of adverse outcomes. Adolescents with&#xD;
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience more sleep problems than their&#xD;
      peers, including delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, more&#xD;
      sleep variability, and greater daytime sleepiness. Further, research conducted by the&#xD;
      investigator's team has shown that sleep problems are strongly associated with - and causal&#xD;
      contributors to - functional impairment in adolescents with ADHD, including increased mood,&#xD;
      behavior, and academic problems. However, sleep problems are not currently addressed in any&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment for adolescents with ADHD, and no study has evaluated an&#xD;
      intervention targeting sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD. This is a notable gap in the&#xD;
      field since consensus statements on sleep suggest that treating sleep problems may improve&#xD;
      ADHD and associated impairments. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral sleep interventions,&#xD;
      including the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention for Youth (TranS-C)&#xD;
      intervention, are effective for improving sleep and associated impairments (e.g., attention,&#xD;
      mood) in adolescents with sleep problems. However, these interventions have never been tested&#xD;
      in adolescents with ADHD specifically. This will be the first to evaluate a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral sleep intervention (TranS-C) in adolescents with ADHD who experience&#xD;
      co-occurring sleep problems. This study will recruit 15 adolescents with ADHD and sleep&#xD;
      problems to enroll in and complete an open trial of the TranS-C intervention to evaluate its&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Findings will provide key pilot data&#xD;
      regarding treatment of sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD.&#xD;
