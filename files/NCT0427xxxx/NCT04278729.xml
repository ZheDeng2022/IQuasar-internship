  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study is a single arm, multi-dose study that will evaluate steady-state apixaban&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in subjects with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) vs&#xD;
      healthy control subjects. This study will enroll 20 subjects diagnosed with NS and 10 healthy&#xD;
      control subjects. Comparing differences in steady-state apixaban PK/PD parameters between&#xD;
      subjects with NS and healthy volunteers will be essential to identifying a safe and effective&#xD;
      apixaban dose and dose administration schedule for future randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs).&#xD;
