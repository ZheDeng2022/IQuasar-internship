  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell (WBC) found in the participant's blood. During&#xD;
      radiation treatment, moving blood is exposed to radiation. This may cause a decrease in the&#xD;
      amount of lymphocytes. A researcher at UVA has created a system to predict and reduce the&#xD;
      immune cell reduction following lung SBRT treatments beyond standard of care tx in&#xD;
      lymphocytes in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The predicted decrease of&#xD;
      lymphocytes will be compared to the actual decrease in lymphocytes found in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have found a way to give radiation that they think will result in a smaller&#xD;
      decrease in lymphocytes after radiation. There will be two groups in this study, about half&#xD;
      of the participants will have their radiation designed to decrease radiation to organs with a&#xD;
      lot of blood and the other half will receive standard radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are being asked to take part in this study because the participants have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with NSCLC and will be receiving a type of radiation therapy called stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) where high doses of radiation will be delivered to the tumor,&#xD;
      while minimizing damage to healthy surrounding tissues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphopenia, a known consequence of radiation therapy to virtually every part of the body,&#xD;
      was first described in the early 20th century shortly after the discovery of X-rays.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy (RT) can induce lymphopenia in the absence of concomitant chemotherapy or&#xD;
      steroids and even when neither bone marrow nor lymphatic tissue is included in the treatment&#xD;
      field. It is highly possible that irradiation of blood rich organs such as the great vessels,&#xD;
      would reduce the lymphocyte count significantly. Given this known radiation-induced toxicity,&#xD;
      circulating blood should be considered an organ at risk during irradiation, and efforts&#xD;
      should be made to understand the toxicity from radiation to circulating blood -normal tissue&#xD;
      complication probabilities (NTCP) so that this may be included in the optimization strategy&#xD;
      during radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, recent data have suggested that lymphocyte subsets exhibit differential&#xD;
      sensitivity to radiation, with helper CD4+ T cells being more sensitive than cytotoxic CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with RT and temozolomide, and naïve T cells more&#xD;
      sensitive than memory T cells in prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on existing data on the effects of irradiation on total lymphocyte count and the&#xD;
      effects on subsets of T cells, the investigators have created a lymphodepletion predictive&#xD;
      algorithm. In this clinical trial, the investigators will test whether optimized SBRT plans&#xD;
      lead to lower lymphocyte depletion and whether the algorithm can accurately predict&#xD;
      lymphocyte decreases following SBRT. Optimized SBRT plans will meet all standard of care&#xD;
      dose-volume objectives for SBRT and for protection of organs-at-risk (OAR), but will also&#xD;
      reduce radiation to the regional great vessels, lungs, and heart beyond what is currently&#xD;
      optimized to reduce the integral dose to circulating blood/lymphocytes. This study will allow&#xD;
      us to evaluate the performance of our predictive algorithm for post-SBRT decrease in&#xD;
      lymphocyte count and to determine whether additional steps in SBRT planning will deliver&#xD;
      lower risk of post-SBRT decreases in lymphocyte count.&#xD;
