  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary angiography (CAG) for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes such as percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) is one of the common procedures which require the use of&#xD;
      intravenous contrast media. The reported incidence of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in&#xD;
      high-risk patients following CAG varies from 10% to 30%. The high rate of CIN in post-PCI&#xD;
      patients could be related either to the patient (advanced age, previous CKD, diabetes,&#xD;
      dehydration, and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs) or procedure related&#xD;
      (intra-arterial route of administration, use of high osmolar contrast media, repeated&#xD;
      exposure to contrast within 48 hours, volume of contrast used). Several strategies to prevent&#xD;
      or treat CIN have been developed, including hydration, N-acetyl-cysteine, statins, ascorbic&#xD;
      acid, bicarbonate, aminophylline, forced diuresis, renal replacement therapy, and choice of&#xD;
      low-osmolarity or alternative agents, but one of the most obvious means is to minimize&#xD;
      contrast volume. The DyeVert plus Contrast Reduction System, is designed to lower the amount&#xD;
      of contrast dye the kidneys are exposed to during a procedure. Because the amount of contrast&#xD;
      dye is precisely controlled. The purpose of this prospective study is to understand how the&#xD;
      monitoring system of Dye-Vert Plus will impact Acute Kidney Injuries rates in high-risk&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac catheterization when used in conjunction with a standardized&#xD;
      hydration policy.&#xD;

      Coronary angiography (CAG) for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes such as percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) is one of the common procedures associated with Contrast-induced&#xD;
      nephropathy (CIN). The reported incidence of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in high-risk&#xD;
      patients following CAG varies from 10% to 30%1. The development of CIN after diagnostic&#xD;
      coronary angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with&#xD;
      prolonged hospitalization and a remarkable increase in morbidity, early and late mortality&#xD;
      and costs. The high rate of CIN in post-PCI patients could be related either to the patient&#xD;
      (advanced age, previous CKD, diabetes, dehydration, and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic&#xD;
      drugs) or procedure related (intra-arterial route of administration, use of high osmolar CM,&#xD;
      repeated exposure to contrast within 48 h, volume of contrast used, etc.)2-5. Several&#xD;
      strategies to prevent or treat CIN have been developed, including hydration,&#xD;
      N-acetyl-cysteine, statins, ascorbic acid, bicarbonate, aminophylline, forced diuresis, renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy, and choice of lowosmolarity or alternative agents, but one of the most&#xD;
      obvious means is to minimize contrast volume. Patients that have a serum creatinine of &gt;&#xD;
      1.5mg/dl and an eGFR &lt; 60ml/min might be at higher risk for AKIs. In quarter one of 2018,&#xD;
      CAMC's in-hospital risk-adjusted acute kidney injury for patients undergoing PCI was 10.64,&#xD;
      and the US 50th percentile was 6.476. The goal of this study is to reduce in-hospital&#xD;
      risk-adjusted acute kidney injury for patients undergoing PCI, below the US 50th,&#xD;
      percentile-based NCDR quarterly results of the Cath-PCI registry by quarter one of 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIN is one of the leading causes of acute kidney injury at Charleston Area Medical Center it&#xD;
      is imperative to take steps to prevent it. CIN is associated with a 13% increase in one- year&#xD;
      mortality rate when comparing patients without CIN. Studies have also shown an increase in&#xD;
      inpatient length of stay and substantial increase cost for patients who experienced CIN. The&#xD;
      economic burden associated with CIN is high, the average in-hospital cost of CIN is $10,345&#xD;
      7. Adopting targeted interventions will reduce the incidence of CIN and the overall economic&#xD;
      burden at Charleston Area Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is aimed at observing whether the use of the monitoring system Dye-Vert PLUS in&#xD;
      conjugation with implementing a pre-hydration protocol on patients with high risk for CIN&#xD;
      admitted for cardiac angiography and/or interventional cath lab procedures may reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of CIN. An additional aim of the study will be to assess if use of the Dye-Vert&#xD;
      PLUS monitoring system reduces the use of mean contrast media given in high-risk patients.&#xD;
      Additional aims of this initiative will be to evaluate contrast-related complications, such&#xD;
      as hypersensitivity reactions, as well as the associated impact of contrast-related&#xD;
      complications on hospital health 3 care economics. This initiative will strive to incorporate&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines from SCAI Expert Consensus Statement: 2016 Best Practices in the&#xD;
      Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory related to patient risk screening, pre-procedure&#xD;
      hydration, and minimizing contrast media dose used.&#xD;
