      This study will evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between dolutegravir (DTG) and&#xD;
      steady state rifapentine (RPT) when RPT is given with isoniazid (INH) daily for 4 weeks (1HP)&#xD;
      as part of treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) in HIV-1 and LTBI co-infected&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between&#xD;
      dolutegravir (DTG) and steady state rifapentine (RPT) when RPT is given with isoniazid (INH)&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks (1HP) as part of treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) in HIV-1 and LTBI&#xD;
      co-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study-provided INH and RPT once daily for 4 weeks (1HP). During the&#xD;
      1HP treatment, DTG will be administered twice daily in Arm 1, and once daily in Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, all participants must also be on DTG-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatment&#xD;
      with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (excluding tenofovir alafenamide&#xD;
      [TAF]) during the study. In Arm 1 participants, DTG 50 mg will be administered twice daily;&#xD;
      the morning dose from non-study ARV supply and the evening dose from study supply. In Arm 2&#xD;
      participants, DTG 50 mg will be administered once daily, in the morning, from non-study ARV&#xD;
      supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must receive pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with each dose of INH based on the current&#xD;
      local, national, or international dosing guidelines. NRTI therapy and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)&#xD;
      will not be provided by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin enrollment with Arm 1. Opening of Arm 2 will depend on assessment of DTG&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) data from participants in Arm 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of participants will be on study for 6 weeks (a 4-week on-study treatment period&#xD;
      and a 2-week follow-up period). Some participants may be on study for up to 11 weeks if the&#xD;
      on-study treatment duration has been extended or if participants need to have additional&#xD;
      follow-up visits to measure viral load.&#xD;
