    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study examines the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of arbaclofen in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects with 16p11.2 deletion. Male or female subjects aged 5 to 17 years of age will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either placebo or arbaclofen in a double-blind study design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll male or female subjects, aged 5 to 17 years, who have the 16p11.2&#xD;
      bp4-bp5 deletion. Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either placebo or arbaclofen.&#xD;
      Subjects and study staff will be blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study. Both&#xD;
      placebo and arbaclofen will be administered as orally disintegrating tablets. Dosing will be&#xD;
      flexible, with subjects titrating up to the highest tolerated dose, with maximum permissible&#xD;
      dose dependent on age. The treatment period is 12 weeks, after which subjects will taper off&#xD;
      of study drug. Subjects will be required to attend multiple study visits, and to communicate&#xD;
      with the study staff by phone multiple times throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy assessment focuses on speech. Secondary and exploratory endpoints assess&#xD;
      motor, memory, general cognitive, and other neuropsychological abilities, and brain&#xD;
      electrophysiology. The safety evaluations include blood tests, physical exam, and assessment&#xD;
      of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete study participation through the end of the Withdrawal Period may be&#xD;
      eligible to enroll in a subsequent open-label study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:To be eligible to participate in this study, all of the following&#xD;
        criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects, 5 through 17 years of age, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neurodevelopmental disability requiring current educational or other therapeutic&#xD;
             support.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any educational, behavioral, other therapeutic, and/or dietary interventions must have&#xD;
             been continuous during the 2 months prior to Screening (with the exception of the&#xD;
             anti-epileptic drug (AED) 6-month requirement in Inclusion Criterion #5). Subjects and&#xD;
             their parent/caregiver/legally authorized representative (LAR) may not electively&#xD;
             initiate new, or modify ongoing, interventions for the duration of the study. Typical&#xD;
             school vacations are not considered modifications of stable programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a history of seizure disorder must have been seizure-free and on a&#xD;
             stable antiepileptic therapy regimen for 6 months OR must have been seizure-free for&#xD;
             the 3 years prior to Screening if not currently receiving antiepileptics. If currently&#xD;
             receiving treatment with antiepileptics that are typically monitored by serum&#xD;
             concentration, serum concentrations of the antiepileptic drugs must be tested and&#xD;
             confirmed to be within the therapeutic range at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All medication regimens must be stable for 30 days prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior to the conduct of any study-specific procedures, the subject must provide assent&#xD;
             to participate in the study (if developmentally appropriate), and the&#xD;
             parent/caregiver/LAR must provide written informed consent. If the caregiver attending&#xD;
             the clinic visits is not the parent or LAR, written consent must also be obtained from&#xD;
             the parent or LAR for the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject's parent/caregiver/LAR must be able to speak and understand English&#xD;
             sufficiently to understand the nature of the study and to allow for the completion of&#xD;
             all study assessments. The parent/caregiver/LAR should be capable of providing&#xD;
             reliable information about the subject's condition, agree to oversee the&#xD;
             administration of the study drug, and accompany the subject to all clinic visits. The&#xD;
             same parent/caregiver/LAR should accompany the subject to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Negative pregnancy test for females who are 9 years of age or older. Both male and&#xD;
             female subjects who are sexually active must agree to consistently use an accepted&#xD;
             form of contraception (i.e., surgical sterilization, intrauterine contraceptive&#xD;
             device, subcutaneous implant, oral contraceptive, or diaphragm or condom in&#xD;
             combination with contraceptive cream/jelly, or abstinence) throughout the trial and&#xD;
             for 30 days (females) or 90 days (males) following last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Subjects are not permitted to enroll in the study if any of the&#xD;
        following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with additional known genetic disorder besides 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with an additional neurologic or psychiatric condition that might confound&#xD;
             performance on assessments measures, e.g., significant impairment in hearing or&#xD;
             vision, severe motor impairment (e.g., non-ambulatory) from cerebral palsy, birth&#xD;
             injury, or other injury, or cleft lip or palate (including submucous cleft).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with any seizures within the previous 6 months; subjects who are not&#xD;
             currently receiving antiepileptics AND have had one or more seizures during the 3&#xD;
             years prior to Screening; and subjects who are shown to have non-therapeutic AED&#xD;
             levels at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             conduct of the study, confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their&#xD;
             own well-being. This includes, but is not limited to substance use disorders,&#xD;
             impairment of renal function, evidence or history of malignancy or any significant&#xD;
