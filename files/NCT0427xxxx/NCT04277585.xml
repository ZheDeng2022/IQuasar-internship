  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of developing an Early Psychosis CSC&#xD;
      service delivery model suitable for rural settings in NC. Major challenges to delivery of&#xD;
      specialized health care services for persons in the early stages of psychosis include the&#xD;
      high level of provider expertise and the frequency and intensity of services. These&#xD;
      challenges limit the feasibility of brick-and-mortar programs to serve individuals living in&#xD;
      rural settings. This study proposes to expand service delivery methods to include telehealth&#xD;
      as a potential solution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UNC OASIS program currently provides evidenced-based outpatient coordinated specialty&#xD;
      care services (CSC) to persons within the first five years of a psychotic disorder. Medical&#xD;
      management and psychotherapy services are mainly provided in brick and mortar offices.&#xD;
      Supported education, supported employment, and peer support services are provided in offices&#xD;
      and also in the community. The service model is relatively intense, involving treatment&#xD;
      sessions up to several times a week. Thus a barrier to persons in rural North Carolina&#xD;
      receiving CSC services is the time taken to travel to office based appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility and acceptability of providing some of&#xD;
      the services provided by OASIS via telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Up to 10 patients who have been accepted by the OASIS program and who live&#xD;
      45-minutes or more from the UNC OASIS program or another CSC program. Participants must also&#xD;
      have home internet bandwidth sufficient to support the telehealth platform and own a computer&#xD;
      or other device (smart phone, tablet, etc.) compatible with the telehealth platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The OASIS program does not exclude patients based on where they live in&#xD;
      North Carolina. Potential OASIS patients and their families participate in an initial&#xD;
      psychosocial and medical evaluation. At this time the OASIS program director reviews the&#xD;
      OASIS program expectations with the patient and family. If the OASIS program and the patient&#xD;
      and the patient's family member agree that the OASIS program is a good fit, the patient is&#xD;
      then accepted into the program. After acceptance into the OASIS program patients who live 45&#xD;
      minutes or more away from the UNC OASIS or another CSC program and who reside in North&#xD;
      Carolina will be informed about the availability of the telehealth pilot project by the OASIS&#xD;
      program director.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UNCH has developed a telehealth service that is provided via the UNC electronic medical&#xD;
      record platform, EPIC. If interested, the OASIS patient and their family member will meet&#xD;
      with a study staff person, who will evaluate whether their internet bandwidth is sufficient&#xD;
      to support the EPIC telehealth platform and if they own a computer or other device that&#xD;
      supports the EPIC telehealth platform. Patients who are interested and who meet these&#xD;
      requirements will then participate in the oral and written informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who consent to participate in the study will receive some of their CSC services&#xD;
      via telehealth, and will continue to receive some of their services in the OASIS offices.&#xD;
      During this pilot phase the project will be flexible about the relative proportion of&#xD;
      services delivered via telehealth and in-person. The main study participant is the patient,&#xD;
      however since family therapy may be delivered via telehealth interested family members are&#xD;
      also asked to consent to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OASIS program routinely collects quality assurance data via self-report and&#xD;
      clinician-administered assessments. The study will obtain consent from study participants to&#xD;
      access this information. In addition to the Quality Assurance document patients who are&#xD;
      subjects and their family members who also consent to participate in the the telehealth pilot&#xD;
      project will also complete a self-report survey inquiring about their satisfaction with&#xD;
      telehealth services.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UNC OASIS Telehealth Satisfaction and Usability Survey is a self-report measure with 8 items assessing satisfaction with aspects of telehealth service delivery. Items using 5-item likert scale ranged from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. Items include: 1) sessions ran smoothly, 2) preference for in-person or telehealth service or no preference, 3) comfortable using telehealth technology, 4) technical difficulties encountered (5-item likert ranging from Never to Often), 5) privacy/confidentiality of telehealth as either better than/same as/not as good as in-person visits and any comments, 6) comfort level communicating to staff using telehealth, 7) whether telehealth made attending appointments easier/same as/more difficult than in person visits, 8) whether would use telehealth services again. Lower scores reflect higher satisfaction.</description>
