      This study evaluates if the early utilization of ketamine infusion therapy among acutely&#xD;
      injured adult trauma hospital inpatients with an ISS &gt;15 will decrease the amount of opioid&#xD;
      pain medication used as compared with placebo group. Ketamine infusion therapy initiated&#xD;
      within 12 hours of hospital arrival will lead to decreased total opiate consumption&#xD;
      (standardized to oral morphine equivalent units) in the first 24 and 48 hours compared to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traumatically injured hospital inpatients aged 18 - 64 will be enrolled into the study within&#xD;
      12 hours of admission to the hospital. The patients randomized to the experimental arm will&#xD;
      receive early ketamine infusion therapy at a rate of 3 mcg/kg/min. All ketamine infusions&#xD;
      will be calculated based on ideal body weight (IBW), unless actual body weight is less than&#xD;
      ideal. IBW will be calculated for males as 50kg + 2.3*(number of inches above 5 feet) and for&#xD;
      women as 45.5kg + 2.3*(number of inches over 5 feet). The 65 patients randomized to the&#xD;
      control arm will receive placebo saline solution at a rate equivalent. Time zero will be&#xD;
      defined as the time at which the &quot;ketamine / placebo&quot; infusion is begun. For inclusion in the&#xD;
      study, initiation of ketamine / placebo infusions must take place within 12 hours of&#xD;
      presentation to Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital (FMLH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting the investigational infusion, a single IV push of ketamine/placebo (Dose&#xD;
      0.2mg/kg) over 5 min (MAX 20mg) will be administered to any patient with a numeric pain score&#xD;
      between 7-10. This is done to achieve more rapid pain control as poor pain control has been&#xD;
      shown to lead to higher rates of chronic pain and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient controlled analgesia will be provided using either morphine or hydromorphone with an&#xD;
      initial starting dose of Morphine (1.5mg bolus, 12 min lockout, no continuous rate) or&#xD;
      Hydromorphone (0.2mg, 12 min lockout, no continuous rate). Dose or lockout adjustments to the&#xD;
      PCA should be done only after first adjusting the Investigational Drug dose. For example, if&#xD;
      a patient continues to complain of severe pain (â‰¥6) after 2-4 hours of initiation of the&#xD;
      Investigational Drug then the rate of the infusion should be increased (as described below).&#xD;
      The adjustments can be initiated by either the RAAPS team or Trauma service. No more than 1&#xD;
      change to PCA or Investigational Drug rate should be performed every 4 hours (ie if PCA was&#xD;
      adjusted at midnight, then an adjustment to the Investigational Drug should not be made&#xD;
      before 4 am).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the 48-hour infusion the inpatient team has the option of transitioning&#xD;
      the patient from the PCA to oral pain medications. Additional adjuncts to pain control&#xD;
      including epidural or other regional techniques are at the discretion of the primary team but&#xD;
      ideally would be delayed until the investigational infusion is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine infusions will be prepared by the IDS service but will be hung and administered by&#xD;
      the inpatient nursing staff. Ketamine infusion therapy will be continued for 48 hours. At 2-4&#xD;
      hours post-infusion the patient's pain will be reassessed. If the NPS is more than 5 the&#xD;
      infusion will be increased to 5mcg/kg/min. Following each change in the infusion rate the&#xD;
      patient's pain will be reassessed at 2-4 hours and adjustments made accordingly. Maximum&#xD;
      infusion rate will be set at 9mcg/kg/min. Conversely, The RAAPS team should be notified if&#xD;
      neurologic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disturbing dreams, vertigo) are developing&#xD;
      and, at the discretion of the RAAPS service, a single dose of lorazepam or midazolam may be&#xD;
      utilized. The infusion can be decreased from in 2 mcg/kg/min increments if there are symptoms&#xD;
      believed to be related to the infusion that do not respond to benzodiazepines.&#xD;
