  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transverse abdominis (TrA) is the deepest muscle layer of lateral and anterior abdominal&#xD;
      wall and also known as a significant component of core stability. Abdominal draw-in maneuver&#xD;
      (ADIM) is the main for the strengthening of the deep muscle, however, sufficient activation&#xD;
      of TrA by ADIM is limited. Blood flow restriction (BFR) training is a technique combined with&#xD;
      low intensity exercise that produces similar results to high intensity training. However,&#xD;
      there is few evidences for BFR training on core muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults (age ranged 18-34 years and BMI between 18.5~24.99) were randomly recruited in&#xD;
      the study. For the intervention group, an inflatable cuff (14 cm in width * 84 cm in length)&#xD;
      is warped around abdominal muscles below ribs which may cause to at least 60% restriction of&#xD;
      blood flow detected by Power Doppler ultrasonography. All participants are instructed to&#xD;
      perform ADIM both condition of BFR and BFR-free twice a week, for six weeks. Outcome&#xD;
      measurements include Double leg lowering test (DLLT) for muscle strength, brightness mode&#xD;
      ultrasound (USD) for muscle hypertrophy and electromyography (EMG) muscle activation. The&#xD;
      same physical therapist will do the measurement at first week, third week and the sixth week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expects to provide a new alternative way to improve the muscle activation,&#xD;
      strength and activation of transverse abdominis in abdominal draw-in maneuver combined with&#xD;
      blood flow restriction&#xD;
