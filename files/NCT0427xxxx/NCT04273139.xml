  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of Ibrutinib combined with Venetoclax (IVEN) in&#xD;
      the treatment of adults diagnosed with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) cancer with a&#xD;
      specific MYD88 gene mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves an experimental drug combination of targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ibrutinib&#xD;

      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in&#xD;
           treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ibrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be on the research study for up to 2 years on combined venetoclax&#xD;
                and ibrutinib and 4 years of follow-up .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved venetoclax for your&#xD;
           specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- Venetoclax is a targeted therapy that blocks BCL-2, a protein that is important for&#xD;
           the survival of WM cells. Laboratory studies and early clinical data have shown that the&#xD;
           investigational new agent, venetoclax, may kill cancer cells and may cause tumors to&#xD;
           shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ibrutinib as a treatment option&#xD;
           for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Ibrutinib is a targeted therapy that blocks BTK. It has been FDA approved in chronic&#xD;
           lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle cell lymphoma&#xD;
           (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD), and&#xD;
           Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). It is also used in research studies in&#xD;
           participants with recurrent B-cell lymphoma), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and&#xD;
           prolymphocytic leukemia. In a study of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM patients,&#xD;
           response rates were high and the treatment was well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of&#xD;
           ibrutinib and venetoclax as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the MYD88 test. This test&#xD;
           is investigational.&#xD;
