      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a new monitored self-guided&#xD;
      digital cognitive behavioural therapy format through one of the key components of an&#xD;
      intervention for depression and anxiety (Problem Solving) and to answer the question: Do&#xD;
      patients with significant levels of depression and/or anxiety symptoms consider the monitored&#xD;
      self-guided digital format usable and credible? An uncontrolled trial will explore&#xD;
      participant's usability and treatment credibility ratings.&#xD;

      Objective. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a new monitored&#xD;
      self-guided digital cognitive behavioural therapy format through one of the key components of&#xD;
      an intervention for depression and anxiety (Problem Solving) and to answer the question: Do&#xD;
      patients with significant levels of depression and/or anxiety symptoms consider the monitored&#xD;
      self-guided digital format usable and credible?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Problem Solving is a behavioral modification intervention focusing on the&#xD;
      training of adaptive problem-solving skills in order to cope more effectively with everyday&#xD;
      stressful events. It is one of the most well-examined therapeutic interventions for&#xD;
      depression, with reliable support regarding symptom improvement in depression traditionally&#xD;
      delivered with therapist-guidance when administered via the Internet. Since a new monitored&#xD;
      self-guided digital intervention for depression and anxiety has been developed, including the&#xD;
      key component Problem Solving, it is of importance to assess both the usability and&#xD;
      treatment-credibility of this format to evaluate if it is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Based on similar feasibility studies including around ten participants, a number&#xD;
      of 16-30 participants will be included in this study to compensate for potential drop-outs.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via a psychiatric clinic belonging to Stockholm County Council&#xD;
      in Stockholm, Sweden, and will be patients in queue for treatment for depression and/or&#xD;
      anxiety in a psychiatric setting. Inclusion criteria will be significant depression and/or&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms. The participants included in the study will access the key component&#xD;
      Problem Solving during four weeks while being on waitlist for regular treatment. They will be&#xD;
      introduced to the intervention as a self-explanatory tool with possible beneficial effects on&#xD;
      depression symptoms. Self-assessments will be carried out during the intervention. The scores&#xD;
      on these scales will be compared to available published data from these scales from&#xD;
      evaluations of therapist-guided Internet-based interventions if available, and otherwise data&#xD;
      from these scales from studies on other digital interventions for mental health. The&#xD;
      participants will also answer questions concerning their experience of the format.&#xD;
