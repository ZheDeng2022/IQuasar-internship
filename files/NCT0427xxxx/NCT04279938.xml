      Safety run-in (part 1): Relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study (part 2): Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the safety run-in phase (part 1) is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with R-tinostamustineand to recommend a safe and&#xD;
      tolerated dose of tinostamustinefor use in combination with 200mg pembrolizumab and 375mg/m2&#xD;
      rituximab Q3W in the main efficacy part of the study (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (main study) The primary objective of part 2 is to assess efficacy of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with R-tinostamustineas determined by the best overall response rate (ORR) in&#xD;
      subjects with r/r DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The combination of pembrolizumab and R-tinostamustinewill act synergistically and&#xD;
      show high anti-tumour efficacy in subjects with r/r DLBCL. R-EDO-S101 will increase&#xD;
      pembrolizumab-mediated anti-tumour immunity by (A) tumour de-bulking with improved access of&#xD;
      immune cells into the tumour and reduced burden of tumour sub-clones and (B) epigenetic&#xD;
      priming of PD-1 inhibition through the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) component of&#xD;
      tinostamustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives &amp; Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective: Safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
           R-tinostamustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Combination of pembrolizumab with R-tinostamustinewill be safe and well&#xD;
           tolerated in r/r DLBCL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: Anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab in combination with R-tinostamustineas&#xD;
           determined by CR rate, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
           overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Combination of pembrolizumab with R-tinostamustinewill lead to deep and long&#xD;
      remissions. Continuation of pembrolizumab treatment as maintenance after completion of&#xD;
      induction therapy will demonstrate conversion of partial to complete response in some cases&#xD;
      and prolonged stabilization of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective: Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in circulating cell-free tumour DNA&#xD;
           (ctDNA) throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: MRD assessment will enable better measurement of the depth of response in&#xD;
           order to assess the effect of pembrolizumab after completion of&#xD;
           R-tinostamustine/pembrolizumab induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: Dynamics of circulating immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood (PB)&#xD;
           throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Detailed assessment of lymphocyte-, monocyte- and myeloid subsets and their protein&#xD;
                expression from pre-treatment until disease progression will give insights into&#xD;
                immunomodulation by pembrolizumab, and identify suitable pharmacodynamic markers&#xD;
                and mechanisms of pembrolizumab resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of PB T-cell function by synapse formation capacity and T-cell&#xD;
                exhaustion will demonstrate restoration of T-cell defects by pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective: Detailed analyses of tumour microenvironment (TME) changes during treatment&#xD;
           and on progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses: Changes in the composition and function of tumour-associated immune- and&#xD;
           stromal cells will elucidate mechanisms of action and resistance of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective: Evaluation of tumour-derived biomarkers of response and resistance.&#xD;
           Hypotheses: Association of the molecular background of DLBCL (somatic mutations, mRNA&#xD;
           and protein expression, DNA methylation) with treatment response will help to identify&#xD;
           predictive biomarkers for future validation.&#xD;

    <description>Part 1 (safety run-in) aims to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tinostamustinein combination with pembrolizumab (200mg Q3W) and rituximab (375mg/m2 Q3W). The dose of tinostamustineestablished to be safe and tolerable in this combination will be used in part 2 of the trial (main efficacy part).&#xD;
The aim of part 2 is to detect signals of anti-tumour activity and to further assess the safety of this combination treatment in r/r DLBCL. The study has a strong focus on correlative research in order to identify mechanisms of response and resistance to pembrolizumab and the pembrolizumab/R-tinostamustinecombination.</description>
