  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a set of tests used to evaluate a patient's&#xD;
      medical, social, and functional status, and can identify impairments in these domains that&#xD;
      may not be noticed otherwise. Prior studies have shown that a CGA can accurately predict&#xD;
      which patients are more likely to have serious side effects from cancer treatment. However,&#xD;
      it is unknown whether interventions can be done to address the impairments found during a CGA&#xD;
      in order to reduce the risk of these side effects. This pilot study will test the feasibility&#xD;
      of targeted interventions for deficits identified during a CGA in patients 65 years or older&#xD;
      with bladder cancer that have not yet started treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer that have not yet started&#xD;
      systemic cancer treatment. The participants will complete a CGA and patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      (PRO) measures at baseline. Based on any impairments found during the CGA, participants will&#xD;
      be referred to specialists to help address these difficulties. Participants will complete the&#xD;
      CGA and PRO measures again at 3 months and 1 year after the initial assessment. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to see if patients with advanced bladder cancer are interested in referrals to&#xD;
      specialists to address their impairments, and whether participants attend those appointments.&#xD;
