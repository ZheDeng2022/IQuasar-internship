  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study looking at the safety of cancer peptides combined with adjuvant and&#xD;
      GM-CSF in subjects with estrogen receptor (ESR) positive breast cancer. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to determine the safety of of the peptide vaccine. The secondary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the immune response to the vaccine. The peptides used in this vaccine are derived&#xD;
      from the estrogen receptor and are combined with the adjuvant Montanide ISA and GM-CSF to&#xD;
      enhance their immune response. A peptide vaccine of these peptides may improve outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with endocrine resistant breast cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, resected, breast cancer with one of the&#xD;
             following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        pT3 or greater T stage with any N stage and M0 pTxN+M0 (i.e., N1,2 or 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA A0201+ and tumor is ER+&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed any standard chemotherapy recommended by their physician.&#xD;
             There must be at least 4 weeks from their last dose of chemotherapy (or surgery if no&#xD;
             chemotherapy was given) prior to the first dose of study vaccine. There should be no&#xD;
             more than 2 years from the time of completion of no maximum amount of time since a&#xD;
             person has completed any chemotherapy, surgery or HER2 targeted therapy. Ongoing&#xD;
             endocrine therapies are permitted as long as they have been administered for at least&#xD;
             3 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heme: WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, platelets ≥ 80,000/microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate, renal and hepatic function with serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin &lt;&#xD;
             1.5 mg/dL (except a bilirubin of &lt;2.0 will be permitted for patents with Gilbert's&#xD;
             syndrome), SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent that fulfills Institutional&#xD;
             Review Board's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy are&#xD;
             excluded. There must be at least 4 weeks between these prior therapy and study&#xD;
             treatment. Subjects must have recovered from all acute toxicities from prior&#xD;
             treatment. Peripheral neuropathy grade 1 due to prior therapy will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not have history of distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,&#xD;
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. A positive ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) test&#xD;
             without other evidence of autoimmune disease will not exclude a subject for this&#xD;
             study. A prior history of autoimmune hypothyroidism will not exclude a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease,&#xD;
             (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent (or within the last 5 years) second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, controlled carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or&#xD;
             controlled superficial bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: an urinary tract&#xD;
             infection, HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot) or viral&#xD;
             hepatitis (as determined by HBsAg and Hepatitis C serology). Subjects with HIV are&#xD;
             excluded based on immuno-suppression, which may render them unable to respond to the&#xD;
             vaccine; subjects with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that&#xD;
             hepatitis could be exacerbated by the injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on steroid therapy (or other immuno-suppressives, such as azathioprine or&#xD;
             cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Subjects&#xD;
             must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy (except that used as&#xD;
             pre-medication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced studies) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with allergies to any component of the vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with acute or chronic skin disorders that will interfere with peptide&#xD;
             injection into the skin of the extremities or subsequent assessment of potential skin&#xD;
             reactions will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Splenectomy&#xD;
