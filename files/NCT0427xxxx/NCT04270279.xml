  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial in&#xD;
      Chinese population with stable angina pectoris. The purpose is to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Xueshuanxinmaining tablet in the treatment of stable angina pectoris.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xueshuanxinmaining tablet is a Chinese patent medicine composed of Ligusticum chuanxiong,&#xD;
      Salvia miltiorrhiza, borneol and Toad puff, etc. It has been widely used in cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases in China. Clinical application suggested that Xueshuanxinmaining tablet was safe and&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. However, it still needs to be further&#xD;
      confirmed by high-quality, large sample randomized controlled trials. This randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Xueshuanxinmaining tablet in the treatment of stable angina pectoris.&#xD;
