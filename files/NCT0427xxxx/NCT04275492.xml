      The main purpose of In two kinds of fasting and postprandial Chinese healthy subjects with&#xD;
      Boehringer represent Ingelheim company production of hydrochloric acid Pramipexole zyban&#xD;
      (specification: 0.26 mg/piece, in Pramipexole, commodity name: Siforl ®) as the reference&#xD;
      preparation, study a single oral dose of macro crown biological pharmaceutical co., LTD.&#xD;
      Production of Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Sustained Release Tablets (specification:The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug were calculated after the time course of the drug in&#xD;
      vivo (0.375mg/ tablet, as measured by pramipexole hydrochloride), and the human relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of the two preparations were compared to evaluate their bioequivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose To evaluate the safety of fasting and postprandial oral test preparations&#xD;
      and reference preparations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a single-center, randomized, open, two-cycle, self-crossover, single-dose&#xD;
      administration design was used to evaluate the bioequivalence of the tested preparations and&#xD;
      reference preparations given to Chinese healthy subjects with single-dose, fasting and&#xD;
      post-meal administration of Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Sustained Release Tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was divided into two parts: fasting administration and high-fat post-meal&#xD;
      administration.The healthy subjects were randomly divided into two groups with the same&#xD;
      number of patients in each group. The washing period was 7±1 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, venous blood was collected at 18 time points (fasting and postprandial) within&#xD;
      1h (0h) before administration and at 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h, 4.0h, 5.0h, 6.0h, 7.0h, 8.0h, 9.0h,&#xD;
      10.0h, 11.0h, 12.0h, 16.0h, 36.0h, 48.0h, and 72.0h after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 healthy subjects were enrolled into the equivalence test, among which:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study on human bioequivalence of drug administration on an empty stomach: 30 healthy&#xD;
           subjects (male and female).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Human bioequivalence of high-fat post-meal administration: 30 healthy subjects (male and&#xD;
           female).&#xD;
