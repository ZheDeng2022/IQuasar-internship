  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papilloma virus (HPV) is responsible of the most common sexually transmitted infection.&#xD;
      It can cause severe cancer lesions, of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis and oropharynx. The&#xD;
      International Agency for Cancer Research of World Health Organization (WHO) classified a&#xD;
      dozen of HPV related high-risk cancer types, and recognized cervical cancer as the most&#xD;
      common HPV-related disease. HPV 16 and 18 are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the few symptoms of cervical cancer, women are often diagnosed with advanced state.&#xD;
      Current treatments imply cervical conisation or hysterectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      and or radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few pharmacological options are available against oncogenic papilloma viruses and&#xD;
      thus against recurrences The aim of this project is to develop relevant organoids models from&#xD;
      patient biopsies that will be used to identify biomarkers and evaluate in a closest&#xD;
      preclinical setting novel nucleic acids based therapeutic strategy for HPV-cervical-vaginal&#xD;
      dysplasia and cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators want to develop organotypic culture of primary-derived&#xD;
      biopsies, and combine them with organ-on-a-chip technology, to better characterize the HPV&#xD;
      infection and cancer progression, as well as to screen innovative treatments for cervical and&#xD;
      vaginal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will cover cervical dysplasia and cervical cancers HPV induced. The investigators&#xD;
      will perform cervical and or vaginal biopsies from patients with oncogenic HPV lesions. A&#xD;
      protocol validated to collect biopsies from precancerous cervico-vaginal lesions or cervical&#xD;
      cancer patients in CHRO (Orleans, France). The biopsies will be performed during a&#xD;
      consultation in the Hospital center of Orleans, or in the theatre room during a conisation or&#xD;
      an hysterectomy. The PRIMMO platform is the research platform of Regional hospital center of&#xD;
      Orleans (CHRO) dedicated to the promotion of translational research. It will be involved in&#xD;
      the collection, analysis and biobank storage setup of the project. Fresh samples will be&#xD;
      collected and bring directly to the lab for organoid cell culture development. Detection of&#xD;
      HPV in each biopsy will be carried out by the PRIMMO platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organoid development from patient biopsies will take place into the lab of the Biophysic&#xD;
      Molecular center in Orleans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organoids will be selected according to three criteria: their ability to grow until a&#xD;
      first passage, their doubling time and their ability to be frozen and resuscitated. Such&#xD;
      organoids maintain pathogen-host interaction and better model physiopathology of vaginal&#xD;
      cervical dysplasia CIN2-3 or cervical cancer and thus allow for the detection of biomarkers&#xD;
      for pre-cancerous lesions. In addition, organoids reduce the use of animal models and can be&#xD;
      used for drug screening, In a second step, the investigators propose to use mRNA to produce&#xD;
      in situ the nanobodies targeting E6 and E7, to inhibit viral replication and tumor growth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-epidemiological data will be collected for each patient, in the form of a table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study could be stopped in case of serious undesirable events. Safety evaluation As this&#xD;
      is a category 2 study, no particular vigilance linked to the research protocol will be&#xD;
      useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the monitoring and reporting of unexpected events resulting from participation in&#xD;
      the study will be declared to the &quot;materiovigilance site&quot; of the CHR of Orleans Given the&#xD;
      minimal risks associated with the study, an independent monitoring committee was not&#xD;
      considered necessary.&#xD;
