  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tCES) is a non-invasive and safe treatment, which uses a&#xD;
      low direct current or alternating current to change the excitability of the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
      The tCES has been applied in clinical trials related to rehabilitation research in recent&#xD;
      years, and the safety and effectiveness have also been established. However,the existing tCES&#xD;
      products effect on the whole brain networks and lack special waveforms. Therefore, we aim to&#xD;
      develop a wearable tCES with high definition and special waveforms in this study. This novel&#xD;
      stimulation system will result in more precise and focal stimulation of selected brain&#xD;
      regions with special waveforms to display better neuromodulation performance. We expect that&#xD;
      the novel high-definition tCES (HD-tCES) combined with the upper extremity rehabilitation can&#xD;
      shorten the duration of rehabilitative periods, improve stroke patients' activity of daily&#xD;
      living, reduce the care burden of patients' family, and subsequently decrease the cost of&#xD;
      health care insurance.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity scale (FMA-UE) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA-UE assesses motor functioning of upper extremity. Each movement is estimated by a 3-point scale (0-1-2). The total score of the FMA-UE is 66, and a higher score indicates that the patient has better movement ability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT assesses upper extremity motor ability through timed and functional tasks. The items are rated on a 6-point scale (0-1-2-3-4-5). The total score of the WMFT is 75, with higher scores indicating higher functioning levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The JTT assesses hand functions commonly used in activities of daily living. The subtests are scored according to time taken to complete the task. Total score is the sum of time taken for each subtest, with shorter times indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is commonly used in clinical practice for grading spasticity. The MAS is rated on a 6-point scale (0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4), and a higher score indicates that the patient has higher muscle tension. The muscles being assessed include shoulder abductor, elbow flexor, elbow extensor, wrist flexor, and finger flexor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Finger to Nose Test after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The Finger to Nose Test assesses coordination of upper-extremity movement. The number of complete nose-target movements during a 20-second period will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events [safety and tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after each intervention session (a total of 12 sessions, 3 sessions/week, lasting 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after each HD-tCES stimulation, the patient will be questioned about eventual side effect.</description>
