      cavity drainage, systematic use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and the optimal&#xD;
      duration of postoperative stay in the case of optimal patient with no preoperative incident&#xD;
      or postoperative complication. At the end of the survey a question was asked to surgeons&#xD;
      about the occurrence during their professional practice of an operative bile duct injury.&#xD;
&#xD;

      this form. This electronic form was distributed by email to all surgeons in the authors Mail&#xD;
      lists, those first contacted surgeons had the mission not only to participate in this survey&#xD;
      but also had the mission of distributing the electronic form to their surgeon colleagues. All&#xD;
      incomplete responses were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the survey, all data were captured and processed using the SPSS v20 software&#xD;
      (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), a χ 2 tests were used to compare some surgical practices in&#xD;
      different groups of surgeons, a (P &lt; 0.05) was considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>The variables measured were of two types:&#xD;
A - linked to the characteristics of the surgeon participating in the survey:&#xD;
Exercice place.&#xD;
Type of exercise structure.&#xD;
Grade of surgeon.&#xD;
Date of graduation.&#xD;
Weekly volume of surgery.&#xD;
Use of laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
B- Related to the surgeon's own practices when he performs this surgery:&#xD;

Number of clips placed for the cystic duct and the cystic artery.&#xD;
Rule of extraction of the gallbladder.&#xD;
Use of antibiotics postoperatively.&#xD;
Abdominal drainage.&#xD;
length of hospital stay after surgery.&#xD;
To find a correlation between the variables of Group A and B, a test, a χ 2 tests were used to compare some surgical practices in different groups of surgeons, a (P &lt; 0.05) was considered statistically significant.</description>
