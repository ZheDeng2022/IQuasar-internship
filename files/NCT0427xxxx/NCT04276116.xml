  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design is a cluster randomized trial in 2 parallel groups: an intervention&#xD;
      group with assessment of the pulmonary age and a control group without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population studied is patients aged 25 or more, smoking for more than a year, seen in&#xD;
      general practice consultation, for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress of the study will be composed of an inclusion visit (M0) with a pulmonary age&#xD;
      estimation for the intervention group and an measurement of the exhaled carbon monoxide for&#xD;
      both groups, then a follow-up visit 6 months after the inclusion (M6) with an exhaled carbon&#xD;
      monoxide measure for both groups, and a phone call at 12 months (M12) with a quality of life&#xD;
      survey for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the smoking cessation at 6 months, confirmed by the carbon monoxide&#xD;
      exhaled, at a scheduled consultation with the General practitioner (GP).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few scientific studies evaluate the pharmacological and non-pharmacological measurement of&#xD;
      pulmonary age for smoking cessation. Moreover, existing research studies provide&#xD;
      contradictory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design Cluster randomized controlled trial on the center (= medical practices)&#xD;
      in 2 parallel groups (intervention group (pulmonary age estimation) and control group (no&#xD;
      pulmonary age estimation)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      National multicentric research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      33 participating centers (= medical practices), located in Ile de France and Provence Alpes&#xD;
      Côte d'Azur (PACA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 referring physicians (=regional coordinators) were identified to energize the team of&#xD;
      investigators and facilitate inclusions. There are 3 in Ile de France and 1 in PACA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners who agree to participate in this study will be randomized according to&#xD;
      a computerized procedure and centralized in 2 groups (=randomization in a cluster on the&#xD;
      center (medical office)):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a group providing routine smoking cessation management (control group), which will not&#xD;
           receive any specific guidance on the means to be used in this management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a group providing routine smoking cessation management, accompanied by estimation and&#xD;
           communication to the patient of the pulmonary age, measured using a PulmoLife electronic&#xD;
           device. (Intervention Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will then receive smoking cessation assistance from their physician&#xD;
      according to the randomization arm in which the physician is assigned (usual versus usual&#xD;
      management + pulmonary age estimate and patient information). Patients will be called to the&#xD;
      doctor's office 6 months later to measure the expired CO and complete a questionnaire on&#xD;
      their tobacco consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PROCESS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate in the study by the general practitioner during a&#xD;
      consultation, regardless of the reason for the consultation (tobacco-related or not)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit (M0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will be verified. The general&#xD;
      practitioner will present the study to the patient in detail (an information note on the&#xD;
      study will have been given to him/her beforehand in the waiting room). If the patient agrees&#xD;
      to participate in the study, his or her informed and written consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected by the general practitioner will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  socio-demographic data: age, sex, family situation, level of education, occupation,&#xD;
           health insurance coverage (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall health and co-morbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking history: age of smoking onset, current number of cigarettes per day, average&#xD;
           number of cigarettes since smoking began&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of withdrawal attempts, the maximum duration of withdrawal, the methods used,&#xD;
           the date of the last attempt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nicotine dependence (short Fagerström test), motivation to stop (Prochaska)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chronic pathologies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other addictions: collection of cannabis consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory symptoms (GOLD-CNAM questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall health status (EQ-5D questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of expired CO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  set of spirometric data from Pulmolife (FEV1, pulmonary age) (only for the&#xD;
           &quot;intervention&quot; group) (= pulmonary age estimate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that whatever the group, the doctor will follow the patient according to&#xD;
      current recommendations and his usual practice of managing smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-month follow-up visit (+/- 15 days) (M6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take place in both groups, 6 months +/- 15 days after the patient's&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the doctor will collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current smoking status (over the last 15 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the measurement of expired CO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of withdrawals attempts since inclusion, the duration of the attempts, the&#xD;
           average number of cigarettes per day over the period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the withdrawal assistance methods used during the period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory symptoms (GOLD-CNAM questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall health status (EQ-5D questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intercurrent events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  set of spirometric data from Pulmolife (FEV1, pulmonary age) (only for the&#xD;
           &quot;intervention&quot; group) (= pulmonary age estimate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone contact at 12 months (+/- 15 days) (M12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this telephone contact (which will be made in the 2 groups of patients), will be&#xD;
      collected by the doctor:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global health status data (EQ-ED)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking status (over the last 15 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of withdrawals attempts since inclusion, the duration of the attempts, the&#xD;
           average number of cigarettes per day over the period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the withdrawal assistance methods used during the period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory symptoms (GOLD CNAM questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intercurrent events&#xD;
&#xD;
      This telephone contact will correspond to the end of the patient's participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of efficacy evaluation parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking cessation rate at 6 months from the intervention. Smoking cessation will be&#xD;
           confirmed by measuring the exhaled CO at a scheduled 6-month follow-up consultation with&#xD;
           the general practitioner&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistence of withdrawal at 12 months assessed by patient questionnaire: persistence of&#xD;
           smoking cessation yes/no&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking cessation rate at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characteristics of smoking cessation evaluated by questionnaire/patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking cessation yes/no, if no: reduction in tobacco consumption yes/no and number of&#xD;
           cigarettes smoked per day at M6 versus M0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older smoking cessation for patients who have quit smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of smoking cessation attempts within 6 months of the intervention and&#xD;
           pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures implemented, including the use of&#xD;
           alternative therapies (hypnosis, acupuncture, auriculotherapy, relaxation, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction of general practitioners measured by a satisfaction score on a Likert scale&#xD;
           from 1 to 10&#xD;
