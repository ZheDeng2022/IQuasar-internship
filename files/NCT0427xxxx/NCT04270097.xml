  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T2D is a global public health crisis and a threat to socioeconomic development of all&#xD;
      nations, particularly in developing countries. Countries in the Gulf region, including the&#xD;
      UAE, have some of the highest rates of T2D worldwide. The epidemic in the region has grown in&#xD;
      parallel with the worldwide rise in obesity, which is fuelled by rapid urbanization,&#xD;
      nutrition transition, and increasing sedentary lifestyles. Whether these unfavourable changes&#xD;
      in environmental risk factors can explain the increased risk of T2D in the region, or whether&#xD;
      the populations in the Gulf region are more genetically susceptible to disease is yet to be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, for the first time, the contribution of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic&#xD;
      factors towards the increased risk of T2D amongst the population of the UAE will be&#xD;
      investigated. This will be through, firstly, identifying environmental risk factors with&#xD;
      higher prevalence rates, and bigger effect sizes on T2D in the UAE in comparison to Europe.&#xD;
      Secondly, identifying genetic variants known to predict T2D in Europeans/other populations,&#xD;
      but with stronger association with T2D in Emiratis. Thirdly, identifying novel genetic&#xD;
      variants that are perhaps rare in Europeans/other populations, but confer increased risk for&#xD;
      T2D in the UAE. Lastly, candidate genes underlying T2D pathogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms&#xD;
      will be identified in Emiratis and Europeans. The end result is to identify the underlying&#xD;
      candidate markers and mechanisms involved in T2D pathogenesis, which can better explain&#xD;
      differences in magnitude of risk across populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of my research will be to investigate the contribution of environmental,&#xD;
      genetic, and epigenetic factors to the increased risk of T2D in the Emirati population&#xD;
      compared to Europeans. My specific aims will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a cohort of Emirati T2D cases and controls to enable investigation of genetic&#xD;
           and environmental risk factors for T2D in the UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the data collected to examine the contribution of adiposity, physical inactivity,&#xD;
           and dietary habits to the increased risk of T2D amongst the Emiratis compared to the&#xD;
           Europeans living in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate whether known and novel genetic variants account for the high risk of T2D in&#xD;
           Emiratis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate DNA methylation profiles of subjects with T2D and non-diabetic controls in&#xD;
           Emiratis and Europeans, and identify the differences in methylation profiles between the&#xD;
           two populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify candidate methylation regions that are associated with, and could account for&#xD;
           the higher risk of T2D amongst Emiratis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. ESTABLISH A COHORT OF EMIRATI T2D CASES AND CONTROLS TO ENABLE INVESTIGATION OF GENETIC&#xD;
      AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS FOR T2D IN THE UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study SUBJECTS: 600 Emirati adults with T2D, and 600 age-sex&#xD;
      matched control free from T2D, recruited from Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC)&#xD;
      based in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Recruitment started in April 2016. Participants include men and&#xD;
      women ≥18 years old. They are provided with a complete information letter about the study,&#xD;
      and are asked to sign a written consent to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Participants will undergo health examination, which will be conducted by nurses and&#xD;
      interviewers at the ICLDC. Examinations will include a brief medical history, anthropometric&#xD;
      measures including weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected after an 8-hour fast for biochemical analysis, which includes&#xD;
      measuring glucose, insulin, HDL and total cholesterol, and triglycerides levels. Diabetes&#xD;
      will be defined using 1999 WHO criteria. Obesity will be assessed by BMI, where subjects will&#xD;
      be classified as obese if BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and overweight if 25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be asked to fill a physical activity questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      their activity at work, transport, and recreational times during a typical week. A subset of&#xD;
      200 participants, 100 free from T2D and 100 with T2D, will be asked to wear Actigraph&#xD;
      activity monitors that will measure their physical activity levels for 7 days. These&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to fill out a food frequency questionnaire to assess their&#xD;
      dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: Data will be examined for completeness, consistency, and response rates and for&#xD;
      evidence of responder bias. I will carry out descriptive analyses to define the age and&#xD;
      sex-specific prevalence of conventional risk factors for T2D amongst Emiratis, and their&#xD;
      relationship with T2D in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION: This project was planned to start in March 2016; however, due to lack of&#xD;
      funding, and delays in college enrolment, I was not able to continue with my analyses. During&#xD;
      April 2016 - Feb 2017, I have completed recruiting 1000 Emirati subjects; 500 with T2D and&#xD;
      500 free from diabetes. I will now continue recruiting 200 more subjects for physical&#xD;
      activity monitoring and dietary habits data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS TO THE INCREASED RISK OF T2D IN THE&#xD;
      UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study SUBJECTS: The cohort of Emirati T2D cases and controls&#xD;
      collected (specific aim 1), as well as ~5,000 Europeans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: Assess differences in BMI, waist and hip circumference, physical activity levels,&#xD;
      and dietary intake among Emiratis and Europeans who are free from diabetes. This will allow&#xD;
      me to identify whether differences in the prevalence rates of T2D in Emirati and European&#xD;
      subjects reported in the literature is paralleled with different rates of environmental risk&#xD;
      factors. Furthermore, the strength of the association of environmental risk factors with T2D&#xD;
      will be assessed using logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR, Confidence Interval (CI) 95%) of&#xD;
      age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), physical inactivity, and dietary intake will be&#xD;
      calculated amongst Emiratis and compared to Europeans. This will assess whether environmental&#xD;
      risk factors can explain the difference in T2D magnitude of risk between the two populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. CARRY OUT GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY NOVEL AND KNOWN GENETIC LOCI&#xD;
      INFLUENCING, AND CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED RISK OF T2D IN THE UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. SUBJECTS: The cohort of Emirati T2D cases and controls&#xD;
      collected (specific aim 1), as well as ~5,000 Europeans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Whole blood samples will be collected from participants after an 8-hour fast for DNA&#xD;
      extraction and genotyping. DNA will be extracted using PureLinkTM Genomic DNA extraction kit&#xD;
      (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), following manufacturer's instructions. Genotyping will be&#xD;
      carried out on the Illumina Infinium II SNP genotyping array, which scales genotyping of up&#xD;
      to 500,000 SNP loci. Amplified and fragmented DNA samples will be applied to BeadChips, where&#xD;
      they anneal to locus-specific 50-mers (covalently linked to one of over 500,000 bead types).&#xD;
      One bead type corresponds to each allele per SNP locus. Allelic specificity is conferred by&#xD;
      enzymatic base extension, and subsequently identified by measuring beads' fluorescence&#xD;
      intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: Identify variants with higher allele frequencies among Emiratis compared to&#xD;
      Europeans. Allele frequencies will be compared between Emirati subjects with T2D and healthy&#xD;
      controls to identify known and novel genetic loci that are associated with T2D in the UAE.&#xD;
      The strength of association of genetic variants with T2D will be analysed with logistic&#xD;
      regression under an additive genetic model to estimate effect sizes (ORs, CI 95%). Effect&#xD;
      sizes will be compared to data from Europeans to assess whether identified genetic variants&#xD;
      can explain part of the increased risk of T2D among Emiratis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, I will test SNPs for association with fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin&#xD;
      levels, triglycerides levels, insulin sensitivity or β-cell function, under an additive&#xD;
      genetic model, and effect sizes will be compared to data from Europeans. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      combined effect of genetic loci influencing similar T2D- related phenotypic traits will be&#xD;
      tested across the two populations. This will be through evaluating the effect of carrying&#xD;
      increasing number of risk alleles on a T2D intermediate phenotype in Emiratis compared to&#xD;
      Europeans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION: Due to recruitment and funding constraints, GWA analyses will be carried out&#xD;
      in only 600 T2D cases and 600 controls free from diabetes. With this sample size, I will be&#xD;
      able to identify Emirati-specific genetic risk variants that have 10% minor allele frequency&#xD;
      and an effect size of 1.3, with 80% power. This fulfils our aim of identifying&#xD;
      Emirati-specific variants with possible clinical relevance. Table 1 summarizes the sample&#xD;
      size required for a range of minor allele frequencies and odds ratios in a case-control study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. INVESTIGATE DIFFERENCES IN DNA METHYLATION PROFILES BETWEEN EMIRATIS AND EUROPEANS, AND&#xD;
      IDENTIFY CANDIDATE METHYLATION REGIONS THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER RISK OF T2D AMONG&#xD;
      EMIRATIS AND UNDERLIE DISEASE PATHOGENESIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. SUBJECTS: A subset of the cohort collected (specific aim&#xD;
      1), including 100 Emirati T2D cases, 100 insulin resistant controls, and 100 insulin&#xD;
      sensitive controls. In addition to 100 European adults with T2D, 100 insulin resistant&#xD;
      controls, and 100 insulin sensitive controls. All subjects included will be age and sex&#xD;
      matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Whole blood samples will be collected from participants. DNA will be extracted from&#xD;
      isolated blood leukocytes for DNA methylation assays. Genomic DNA will be treated by&#xD;
      bisulphite conversion, and bisulphite converted DNA will be analysed using Illumina Infinium&#xD;
      Human Methylation 450K BeadChip Array technology. The BeadChip interrogates 485,577 cytosine&#xD;
      positions in the human genome; the majority are CpG (cytosine-guanine nucleotide pairs)&#xD;
      dinucleotides, with sites located within known gene regions, including promoter, gene body,&#xD;
      intergenic, and untranslated regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: For a given CpG site, methylation status is defined by a beta value, which is&#xD;
      calculated as the intensity of methylated channel divided by total intensity. Methylation for&#xD;
      genomic regions will be calculated as the mean beta for all probes located within the region.&#xD;
      Identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) will be performed using the probe&#xD;
      lasso method implemented in the R package ChAMP. DNA methylation profiles of Emiratis and&#xD;
      Europeans free from diabetes will be compared to identify differences in methylation profiles&#xD;
      across populations. DNA methylation profiles in Emiratis and Europeans with T2D and/or&#xD;
      insulin resistance will be compared to that of insulin sensitive controls to identify DMRs&#xD;
      associated with T2D and/or insulin resistance in each population. The strength of association&#xD;
      of DMRs with T2D and/or insulin resistance will be analysed with logistic regression to&#xD;
      estimate effect sizes (ORs, CI 95%). Effect sizes will be compared across the two populations&#xD;
      to assess whether identified DMRs can explain part of the increased risk of T2D among&#xD;
      Emiratis.&#xD;
