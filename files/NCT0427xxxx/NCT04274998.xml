  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to learn more about inflammation in the brain using&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging in people with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease/Mild Cognitive Impairment or healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject agrees to be in this study, she/ he will have two types of PET/CT scans on the&#xD;
      same day. The subject may have a screening visit before the PET/CT scan visit if the&#xD;
      investigator needs to confirm the subject is able to be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken before the scans. Additional blood samples will be taken during&#xD;
      the PET scans. Subjects must also agree to have an MRI scan for this research study if she/he&#xD;
      has not had a recent scan that the study doctor decides can be used for this study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>understanding the uptake of [18F]NOS in the human brain in AD/MCI and Healthy Controls and compare to same-day [11C]PBR28 uptake using PET/CT scan</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be comparison of whole brain GM binding between controls and the MCI/AD group. the investigator will compare groups with a t-test. the investigator will evaluate the correlation of whole brain GM binding of 11C-PBR28 and 18F-NOS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparing the patterns of [18F]NOS and [11C]PBR28 brain uptake with patterns of cerebral amyloidosis and neurodegeneration using PET/CT</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures for will include regional and voxel-wise comparisons between binding of the tracers. Correlation between regional 11C-PBR28 or 18F-NOS binding and either amyloid PET SUVR (calculated with cerebellar gray matter reference) or GM volumetric measurements will be evaluated using Pearson's r and rank sum correlation initially using false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected&lt;0.05 statistical thresholds.</description>

    <description>PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate neuroinflammation in the brain using the investigational radiotracer [11C]PBR28 followed by a second investigational radiotracer [18F]NOS. Each subject will have two positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan sessions performed on the same day, first with [11C]PBR28 followed by [18F]NOS.</description>
