      Overall Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the long-term management outcomes for faecal incontinence (FI); through the&#xD;
      implementation of new alternative treatment to complement existing treatment options, and&#xD;
      enable better utilization of limited healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture in the&#xD;
      treatment of faecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of TCM acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the patient satisfaction and uptake of TCM acupuncture as an alternative&#xD;
           management strategy for FI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate improvements in health-related quality of life with TCM-acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the cost-effectiveness of TCM acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy, in the form of acupuncture, is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for faecal incontinence.&#xD;

      Experimental design and procedure The study will run as a prospective, multi-centre,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial of patients with faecal incontinence of best medical therapy&#xD;
      versus TCM-Acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcome measures and assessments will be carried out to assess primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes at the commencement of trial, after 10 weeks of the intervention, then&#xD;
      again at 15 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure Patients will be recruited from Singapore General Hospitals' Colorectal&#xD;
      Surgery Department. SGH possess a fully staffed pelvic floor unit specialising in the&#xD;
      treatment of faecal incontinence. Eligible patients will be assessed and counselled by a&#xD;
      member of the colorectal surgical team. They will then attend for consenting and baseline&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinicians will inform the patient during the initial consultation about the different&#xD;
      treatments available for their condition as well as this study. As is normal clinical&#xD;
      practice, the clinicians will explain the risks and benefits of all the treatment options.&#xD;
      Each potential participant will be provided with a patient information sheet. Those who&#xD;
      consent to inclusion will then be contacted by a member of the research team. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken in the clinic environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Patients will be randomised into one of two groups, to receive acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment (INTERVENTION GROUP) or to have best medical therapy (BMT) (CONTROL GROUP). Both&#xD;
      patients in the INTERVENTION GROUP and CONTROL GROUP will continue their previous medication,&#xD;
      if any, throughout the duration of the study. This is to standardise the 'steady-state'&#xD;
      existing in this often elderly population, already subject to polypharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the INTERVENTION GROUP will undergo acupuncture therapy at the Singapore College&#xD;
      of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SC-TCM), performed by a team of TCM practitioners regularly&#xD;
      using acupuncture in the treatment of faecal incontinence and bowel conditions. This regimen&#xD;
      will comprise 3 sessions per week each lasting 1 hour, over a period of 10 weeks, for a total&#xD;
      of 30 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the CONTROL GROUP will undergo BMT as defined previously for the same period of&#xD;
      10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to maintain a simple bowel diary, and answer the FIQL and St Marks'&#xD;
      incontinence scores at weeks 0, 10, and 15 to record the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measurements. Anorectal Physiology will be offered to patients at 0 and 10 weeks, but for the&#xD;
      purposes of this study protocol, will be purely voluntary. We understand that this invasive&#xD;
      examination would be a significant undertaking and potential barrier to recruitment for many&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up procedure Patient follow-up will consist of three visits to the hospital following&#xD;
      the randomisation to either arm of the study. This will be at the 5 week period, 10 week&#xD;
      period and 15 week period of the study, where the primary and secondary outcomes measurements&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and allocation Participants will be randomised to one of the two study groups&#xD;
      in equal proportion using a blinded bag shuffling method. This will take place upon agreement&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of outcome Primary outcome: Bowel diary - Incontinence episodes per week Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: St Marks' incontinence score, Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) score,&#xD;
      Anorectal manometry scores (at week 0, and 10 weeks) - optional for participants. Analysis&#xD;
      plans and sample size sought The primary end-point of the study was defined as the difference&#xD;
      in weekly faecal incontinence episodes when comparing patients randomized to the INTERVENTION&#xD;
      and CONTROL arms. The secondary endpoint of the study was defined as the difference in St&#xD;
      Marks' score and FIQL when comparing patients randomized to the INTERVENTION and CONTROL&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size To detect a difference of 30% between the two arms, assuming that the proportion&#xD;
      of incontinence episodes in the conservative arm is 20%, a total sample size of 90 will be&#xD;
      required at alpha=0.05 with 80% power. Accounting for a drop-out rate of 10%, the total&#xD;
      sample size required is 100, to be recruited over 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Continuous data will be summarized as mean (SD) or median (IQR) as&#xD;
      appropriate and categorical/binary data as frequency (%). Statistical significance will be&#xD;
      set at 0.05. Intention to treat (ITT) analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis will be evaluated using a Chi-square test or a Fisher's exact test as&#xD;
      appropriate. Additionally, we will also model the outcome using a generalized linear model&#xD;
      with a logit link. The possible treatment effect modification of clinically important factors&#xD;
      (age, gender, ASA status) will be evaluated in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis to evaluate the St Marks' score will be assessed using a two-sample&#xD;
      t-test assuming that the score can be treated as a continuous measure. The difference in the&#xD;
      FIQL between the two arms will also be tested using the two-sample t-test.&#xD;
