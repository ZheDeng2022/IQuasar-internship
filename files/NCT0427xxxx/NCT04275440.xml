      The purpose of this study is to estimate the effects of caloric restriction and exercise on&#xD;
      body weight, cardiovascular metabolic markers, immune function, and intestinal flora among&#xD;
      college students, as well as the underlying mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, carbohydrate-centered food pattern has brought worrying negative effects&#xD;
      on human health, including increasing incidence of overweight, obesity, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases. Animal experiments based on rhesus monkey showed that caloric restriction could&#xD;
      prolong their healthy life years, while reports from population-based studies are quite&#xD;
      inconclusive. There are some studies reporting that caloric restriction did reduce the risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease in those with obesity, while some other cohort studies found that&#xD;
      not eating breakfast might increase the risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes and other&#xD;
      related diseases. In addition, a number of studies claimed that continuous caloric&#xD;
      restriction is associated with the depletion of peripheral immune cells, immune suppression&#xD;
      and reduced bone mineral density. In spite of those inconclusive results, on the whole,&#xD;
      fasting and caloric restriction in some way do improve the conditions of metabolism,&#xD;
      overweight and obesity. Previous studies mostly focused on middle-aged and elderly people,&#xD;
      while recent studies in mice show that energy limitation in elderly people could not stop the&#xD;
      aging process genetically or metabolically. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the&#xD;
      effects of caloric restriction and exercise on body weight, cardiovascular metabolic markers,&#xD;
      immune function, and intestinal flora among college students, as well as the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms. A pilot study containing around 40 participants will be conducted firstly to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of this intervention plan.&#xD;
