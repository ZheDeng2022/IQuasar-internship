      A drug repositioning effort provided evidence supporting the possible use of Etravirine, a&#xD;
      drug approved for the treatment of HIV infections in patients starting from 2 years of age,&#xD;
      as a treatment for FA. We found that Etravirine is able to increase Frataxin protein both in&#xD;
      vitro - in cells derived from FA patients - and in vivo - in the heart and skeletal muscle of&#xD;
      Frataxin-deficient YG8 mice. Because of these findings, and since Etravirine displays a&#xD;
      generally favorable safety profile, we plan to launch an open-label, phase 2 clinical trial&#xD;
      aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of Etravirine in FA patients. We aim at recruiting&#xD;
      30 FA patients. 15 will be treated with Etravirine for 4 months at 200 mcg/day and 15 will be&#xD;
      treated with Etravirine for 4 months at 400 mg/day. Efficacy primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      represented changes in peak VO2 as measured by incremental cycle ergometer exercise test.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include maximal workload, SARA score, cardiac measures, Frataxin&#xD;
      protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and molecular analysis of Frataxin mRNA&#xD;
      translation efficiency. Complete sets of data will be collected 4 months before the start of&#xD;
      the treatment (T -4), at the start (T0), after 2 months (T2), at the end of the treatment&#xD;
      (T4) and 4 months after the termination of the treatment (T8).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease presenting in childhood or&#xD;
      late adolescence for which no treatment is currently available. The disease is caused by the&#xD;
      defective synthesis of Frataxin, a mitochondrial protein synthesized by the FXN gene. Over&#xD;
      95% of patients carry a homozygous intronic GAA expansion that impairs FXN gene transcription&#xD;
      and translation. The persistence of an intact reading frame within the genome of most FRDA&#xD;
      patients opens the way to treatment attempts that target FXN gene transcription and mRNA&#xD;
      translation to increase endogenous Frataxin levels and balance the complex metabolic&#xD;
      consequences of Frataxin deficiency. The disease is characterized by a relentless progression&#xD;
      involving motor coordination (ataxia), heart function and structure (hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiopathy), exercise capacity (impaired bioenergetics with reduced aerobic capacity),&#xD;
      endocrine function (diabetes) visual and auditory function (optic atrophy and hearing loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By screening a library of 853 FDA-approved drugs, we found a few drugs that are capable to&#xD;
      upregulate Frataxin in vitro. Among them, we selected and focused on Etravirine for its&#xD;
      generally favorable safety profile. In Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) patients-derived cells, we&#xD;
      found that Etravirine upregulates mature Frataxin protein, enhances the activity of aconitase&#xD;
      and confers resistance to oxidative stress. Etravirine appears to upregulate Frataxin protein&#xD;
      by a mechanism of action involving the redistribution of frataxin mRNA on heavy polysomes and&#xD;
      consequent enhancement of Frataxin mRNA translation. Moreover, in collaboration with Dr. Mark&#xD;
      Pook, Brunel University, London, we obtained evidence that Etravirine is able to upregulate&#xD;
      Frataxin protein in the heart and in the skeletal muscle of YG8 mice dosed orally for 5 days&#xD;
      with Etravirine (unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etravirine is a diarylpyrimidine that acts as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitor. It was approved in 2008 by the FDA (tradename Intelence) for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients affected by HIV that are resistant to other drugs. In 2018 the label was extended to&#xD;
      include patients 2 years of age and older. The FDA label reports no contraindications.&#xD;
      Etravirine is administered orally in tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with Dr. Mark Pook, Brunel University, London, we tested whether Etravirine&#xD;
      is able to upregulate Frataxin protein in tissues of YG8 mice. Five YG8 mice were dosed for 5&#xD;
      days orally with Etravirine (10 mg/Kg) and five YG8 mice were dosed for 5 days orally with&#xD;
      vehicle. Four hrs after last dosing, all the mice were sacrificed and protein extracts&#xD;
      prepared from tissues. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting revealed that Frataxin protein was&#xD;
      significantly increased in the heart and in the skeletal muscle of Etravirine-dosed mice,&#xD;
      compared to vehicle-dosed mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its ability to upregulate Frataxin protein and rescue phenotypic defects in FA&#xD;
      patient-derived cells and because of its safety and approved use in children, Etravirine&#xD;
      represents an attractive potential therapeutic for FA. Aim of the study, therefore, will be&#xD;
      assessing the safety and efficacy of Etravirine in a small population of young FA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Plan Study design. The study will be a randomized open-label Phase 2 clinical&#xD;
      trial, to investigate the safety and efficacy of Etravirine in FA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. We aim at enrolling 30 FA patients, aged 10 to 40 years over a period of 6&#xD;
      months. Enrollment will be done by advertising the study through the patients' associations&#xD;
      and among FA patients currently followed at the Medea site (50 subjects at present time). The&#xD;
      patients will be screened and evaluated in the tertiary care hospital setting where Dr&#xD;
      Martinuzzi is active. Treatment will be carried on at home following the prescription given&#xD;
      to the patients at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention. Recruited subjects will be randomized 1:1 by a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence to either of the two dose regimens: Etravirine orally 200 mg/day (100&#xD;
      mg cpr x 2, morning and evening) for 4 months or Etravirine 400 mg/day (one 200 mg cpr x 2&#xD;
      morning and evening) for 4 months. Treatment will start only after the 4 months pre-treatment&#xD;
      period will be completed and after the T0 evaluation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria. Failure to comply with the study follow-up visits or with the treatment&#xD;
      protocol. Occurrence of a SUSAR (suspected unexpected severe adverse reaction) deemed related&#xD;
      to the drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules. The entire study will be interrupted: 1) When the third SUSAR occurs in&#xD;
      different patients. 2) On the occurrence of the same SUSAR in two different patients. 3) Upon&#xD;
      the occurrence of the first serious adverse event judged to be related to the investigational&#xD;
      drug, which has endangered a patient's life or caused permanent damage. 4) Upon the exclusion&#xD;
      of the third patient from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety. Hematochemical parameters (Blood cell count, glycaemia, BUN, Creatinine, AST,&#xD;
           ALT, yGT, ferritin, Troponine) will be acquired 4 months before the start of the&#xD;
           Etravirine treatment (T -4), at the start of the treatment (T0), after 2 months (T2), at&#xD;
           the end of the treatment (T4) and 4 months after the termination of the treatment (T8).&#xD;
           A physical evaluation including vital parameters assessment and skin inspection for&#xD;
           possible rash will be completed at enrollment and at each follow up visit. A detailed&#xD;
           questionnaire listing all known adverse events associated with Etravirine will be&#xD;
           distributed to all patients and reviewed at each follow up visit. Any additional AE will&#xD;
           be registered irrespective of its likely connection with the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy Primary endpoint. Primary endpoint of the study will be the change in peak&#xD;
           aerobic capacity (VO2 peak) achieved by participants during a standardized incremental&#xD;
           exercise test by cycle ergometer. Peak VO2 normalized by weight, is a very stable&#xD;
           objective measure of aerobic capacity. FA is associated with significant decrease&#xD;
           (50-60% less) aerobic fitness as measured by standardized exercise testing and its&#xD;
           measure has been employed as primary end point in FA intervention trials several times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical measures of the disease as quantitated by the Scale for the assessment and&#xD;
           Rating of Ataxia (SARA); SARA is the most sensitive functional composite measure of&#xD;
           performance developed specifically for ataxic disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Critical cardiac parameters (including interventricular septal wall thickness, left&#xD;
           ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction, Sokolow-Lyon index);&#xD;
           Heart is primarily affected in FA showing progressive mostly left ventricular&#xD;
           hypertrophic. Cardiomyopathy is the main determinant of survival in this population. The&#xD;
           ECG changes summarized by the Sokolow-Lyon index (∆%QRS-voltage) are reliable indicators&#xD;
           of ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography can detect and measure very precisely the&#xD;
           extent and severity of heart hypertrophic changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional exercise indicators: maximal workload (W/Kg) reached at exhaustion during the&#xD;
           incremental exercise test;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO-DAS 2.0 is an internationally validated widely applied disease non-specific measure&#xD;
           of disability developed by WHO within the framework of the biopsychosocial model of&#xD;
           functioning and disability. It asks the subject to score in terms of severity and&#xD;
           duration any difficulty experienced in the 30 previous days in 6 main life areas. The&#xD;
           interview format will be used and the results will be computed as normalized scores.&#xD;
           This measure has been validated only above age 16 and thus will be administered only to&#xD;
           subjects &gt;16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frataxin protein levels as measured in peripheral blood cells. Frataxin protein will be&#xD;
           quantitated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting in protein extracts from peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells. At the same time points, to assess the effect of Etravirine on&#xD;
           Frataxin mRNA translation, the distribution of Frataxin mRNA in the translationally&#xD;
           active heavy polysomal fraction, will be determined in extracts from peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation. Sample size was calculated considering the primary endpoint. VO2 at&#xD;
      peak in controls subjects shows a value &gt;16.2 with a test-retest variability of ± 4&#xD;
      ml/min/Kg. Workload at peak is expected to be &gt;3W/Kg in control subjects with a SD of ± 0.8.&#xD;
      This parameter is reduced by approximately 50% in FA patients with similar SD values.&#xD;
      Considering an alpha error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, the needed number of&#xD;
      participants is 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Both primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed using&#xD;
      multivariate linear mixed models modeling timepoints as a repeated within-subject factor.&#xD;
      Mixed models have the advantage of being able to account for heterogeneous distances between&#xD;
      timepoints, missing data as well as unequal variances and covariances. In order to account&#xD;
      for possible confounds due to inter-patient variability, all models will include sex, age at&#xD;
      onset, disease duration, years of education and number of GAA1 repeats within the smaller FXN&#xD;
      allele as covariates of no interest. When a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) overall effect&#xD;
      of time is found, pairwise comparisons between timepoints were will be performed and&#xD;
      corrected for multiple comparisons across pairs of timepoints using the Dunn-Šidák&#xD;
      correction.&#xD;
