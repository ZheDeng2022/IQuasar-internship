  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, Italian multi-center, retrospective cohort study with enrollment&#xD;
      visit on patients suffering from severe eosinophilic asthma who started benralizumab in the&#xD;
      Sampling Program or as per normal clinical practice in Italy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study design involving secondary data collection was chosen to&#xD;
      appropriately address the primary objective in a relatively short period of time after&#xD;
      enrollment phase initiation: in fact, since the Italian Sampling Program on benralizumab was&#xD;
      active since July 2018, clinical data on patients exposed to benralizumab are already&#xD;
      available. No treatments will be administered per protocol requirement, but instead according&#xD;
      to normal clinical practice; since benralizumab first administration occurs before inclusion&#xD;
      in the study (as per chosen study design), the decision to include the patient in the study&#xD;
      is clearly separated from the prescription of benralizumab, in accordance with the&#xD;
      observational nature of the study. In order to be eligible for the study, for each patient,&#xD;
      the index date shall be at least 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;

        The study will enroll patients with severe eosinophilic asthma treated with benralizumab.&#xD;
        Patients can be enrolled if they received benralizumab either within the sampling program&#xD;
        or as per routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participating sites will enroll patients in a consecutive manner when patients come for&#xD;
        their regular visit, in order to minimize the risk of selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A total of 200 patients are expected to be included in the study by around 20 sites,&#xD;
        corresponding to approximately 10 patients/site: it is estimated that the study will enroll&#xD;
        approximately 25 patients per month in the around 20 centers involved (approximately 1.3&#xD;
        patients/month/center). This target sample size is expected to be reached durin&#xD;
