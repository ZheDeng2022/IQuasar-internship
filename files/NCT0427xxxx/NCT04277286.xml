  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Transend&quot; is a program designed to promote the transition of young patients with endocrine&#xD;
      or metabolic diseases when they arrive in the adult sector at La Pitié-Salpétrière hospital.&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the rate of patients lost to follow-up at 24&#xD;
      months after the transfer of pediatrics between the Transend group and the (historical)&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence and early adulthood represent important periods for young people suffering from&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Several observational studies show needs not covered by care services at&#xD;
      this period and significant lost to follow-up rates. &quot;Transend&quot; is a program designed to&#xD;
      promote the transition of young patients with endocrine or metabolic diseases when they&#xD;
      arrive in the adult sector at La Pitié-Salpétrière hospital (Paris, France). Since September&#xD;
      1, 2016, approximately 500 patients benefited from it.&#xD;
