      This study will evaluate the effect of Annovera and tampon co-usage on the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of segesterone acetate (SA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE).&#xD;

      This is an open label, randomized, crossover PK study. Participants will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of two treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of two cycles of treatment - one&#xD;
      with tampon use and one without tampon use. Tampon use will occur on Days 2 to 5 of&#xD;
      contraceptive vaginal system (CVS) use and a new CVS will be used for each treatment cycle.&#xD;
      Before starting Annovera use, each subject will use a combined oral contraceptive (COC) for&#xD;
      one cycle.&#xD;

             menstrual cycles of 21 to 35 days in length and resumption of at least one cycle with&#xD;
             a cycle length consistent with her past cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the Investigator, able to comply with the protocol, eg, live within&#xD;
             the study site catchment area or within a reasonable distance from the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to use oral contraception for one month prior to the initial insertion of&#xD;
             Annovera.&#xD;

          6. Willing to abstain from tampon use except during the prescribed time of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing to abstain from sexual intercourse during tampon use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Signed informed consent prior to entry into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Upper age limit based on normal ovarian changes (ovarian reserve) prevalent in&#xD;
                  women with advancing age (&gt; 35 years of age) that may alter patterns of follicle&#xD;
                  development and/or confound interpretations of data regarding patterns of&#xD;
                  follicle development&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications for enrollment will be the same as those for use of CHCs and additional&#xD;

             diagnosed at screening with a chlamydia or gonococcus infection may be included in the&#xD;
             trial following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Investigators should&#xD;
             make a determination if participants are at high risk for reinfection, eg, multiple&#xD;
             sex partners, untreated partner, and whether such participants can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of pelvic inflammatory disease since the participant's last pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of toxic shock syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In accordance with the Bethesda system of classification: Women with a current (within&#xD;
             the last 20 months) abnormal Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear) suggestive of high-grade&#xD;
             pre-cancerous lesion (s), including high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.&#xD;

         13. History of venous thrombosis or embolism in a first-degree relative, &lt; 55 years of age&#xD;
             suggesting a familial defect in the blood coagulation system, which in the opinion of&#xD;

         20. Has a Type D personality type as assessed by the DS14 test (Standard Assessment of&#xD;
             Negative Affectivity, Social Inhibition and Type D Personality).&#xD;
