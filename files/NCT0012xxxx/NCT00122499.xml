      This study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 20-mg dose of tadalafil&#xD;
      administered &quot;on demand&quot; to patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) after external-beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy (EBRT) of prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer has become the most frequent malignancy in older men in Western countries.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is a common treatment modality for early stage prostate cancer. Because of the&#xD;
      high incidence of post-radiation erectile dysfunction (ED), up to 72% after external-beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy, this patient category represents a most difficult therapeutic challenge. Oral&#xD;
      drug therapy represents the first-line management option for patients with ED. The results of&#xD;
      the studies completed thus far with sildenafil show that a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor&#xD;
      is a safe and efficacious drug for the treatment of post-radiation ED. No studies have&#xD;
      investigated the efficacy of tadalafil in men complaining of ED after radiotherapy of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Because of the extended period of effectiveness, which may last up to 36&#xD;
      hours after intake, tadalafil allows freedom in the choice for time of sexual activity. Also&#xD;
      the absence of restrictions of tadalafil intake with food or alcohol should simplify its&#xD;
      administration. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study has been&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of &quot;on demand&quot; dosing of 20-mg of tadalafil or&#xD;
      placebo administered for 12 weeks to patients with ED after external-beam radiotherapy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heterosexual men, at least 18 years of age at Visit 1 and willing to participate in&#xD;
             the study. If a qualifying participant has more than one female sexual partner during&#xD;
             the study, the participant will not be excluded from the trial. However, the&#xD;
             participant will be required to respond to the questionnaires based on the&#xD;
             participant's sexual interactions with only one of these partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically proven prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Developed ED (defined as a consistent change in the quality of erection that adversely&#xD;
             affects the patient's satisfaction with sexual intercourse) subsequent to EBRT for&#xD;
             prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients willing to make on average 1 sexual intercourse attempt every week during the&#xD;
             study (including the 4-week run-in period without medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree not to use any other ED treatment for at least 4 weeks before receiving the&#xD;
             initial dose of study drug (ie, during the run-in period and during the treatment&#xD;
             phase of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been treated by EBRT at least 12 months before screening and were documented to&#xD;
             be potent before undergoing EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will not be randomized if they did not make at least 1 sexual intercourse&#xD;
             attempt during the run-in period. Also patients who are unable to appropriately&#xD;
             complete the questionnaires will not be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ED caused by other primary sexual disorders including premature ejaculation or ED&#xD;
             caused by untreated endocrine disease (eg, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, or&#xD;
             hypogonadism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of pelvic surgery (including radical prostatectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
