      This is an open-label nonrandomized multi-center study designed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      AP23573 in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of AP23573 in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer&#xD;
      when administered once daily for 5 consecutive days (QDx5) every two weeks at a dose of 12.5&#xD;
      mg/day.&#xD;

             corticosteroids at stable doses for ≥ 2 weeks prior to first planned dose of study&#xD;
             drug. Nasal, ophthalmic, and topical glucocorticoid preparations are allowed as well&#xD;
             as low dose maintenance steroid therapy for other conditions. Physiologic hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (e.g., thyroid supplementation for thyroid deficiency or oral&#xD;
             replacement glucocorticoid therapy for adrenal insufficiency) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate recovery from any prior surgical procedure or having undergone any major&#xD;
