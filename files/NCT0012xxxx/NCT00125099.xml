  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the HIV vaccine VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP will be&#xD;
      safe in individuals who started antiretroviral therapy during acute HIV-1 infection. The&#xD;
      study will also test whether the vaccine can increase the immune system function in these&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      rates associated with HIV and AIDS. However, many HIV-1 infected individuals are unable to&#xD;
      access HAART. It is therefore important to develop a safe and effective therapeutic vaccine&#xD;
      to improve immune control of viral replication and reduce the need for antiretroviral&#xD;
      medication. This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the HIV-1 DNA vaccine&#xD;
      VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP in treating HIV-1 infected individuals who initiated antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy during acute infection. This study will involve a supervised treatment interruption&#xD;
      (STI) in order to determine whether therapeutic vaccination results in improved immune&#xD;
      control of viral replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either the therapeutic&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo in addition to their regular HAART regimens. During the first part of the&#xD;
      study, participants will receive 4 vaccinations at Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 24. All individuals&#xD;
      completing the therapeutic vaccination phase (defined as completing at least 3 immunizations,&#xD;
      including the Week 24 immunization) will be given the opportunity to participate in the&#xD;
      second part of the study and undergo a supervised discontinuation of HAART. At Week 30, these&#xD;
      participants will discontinue all antiretroviral treatment and will be closely monitored.&#xD;
      Participants will restart HAART if they experience a significant decline in their CD4 count,&#xD;
      an increase in their viral loads, or if their physicians recommend they resume HAART. At Week&#xD;
      52, all other participants can restart HAART at the discretion of their primary physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      21 study visits will occur over a period of 52 weeks. After Week 52, monthly study visits&#xD;
      will occur through Week 72. Study visits will last approximately two hours and will include&#xD;
      physical exams and blood and urine collection.&#xD;
