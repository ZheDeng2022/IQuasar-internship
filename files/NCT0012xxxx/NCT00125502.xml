      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (CMV&#xD;
      gB/MF59) can safely prevent mothers from catching CMV infection between pregnancies. This&#xD;
      study includes 464 women, ages 14-40 years, who delivered a newborn infant within 12 months&#xD;
      prior to the study. Participants must live within the Birmingham metropolitan area or the&#xD;
      Tuscaloosa county area and they cannot have had CMV infection previously. CMV vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo (substance containing no medication) will be given at 3 study visits. Participants&#xD;
      fill out diary cards for 7 days after each vaccination. Blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected several times and pregnancy tests will be performed.&#xD;
      Participants who tested positive for CMV will have urine, vaginal swab, and saliva specimens&#xD;
      collected. Each participant will be followed for 3 years after the third dose of vaccine.&#xD;
      Infants born to participants in the study will be checked for CMV infection.&#xD;

      The objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study is to&#xD;
      determine whether a recombinant subunit vaccine comprised of cytomegalovirus (CMV) envelope&#xD;
      glycoprotein B (gB) with MF59 adjuvant can prevent maternal CMV infection between pregnancies&#xD;
      in a high risk population of women of childbearing age. This study will also permit&#xD;
      determination of whether the approach used is a feasible one for a large scale efficacy trial&#xD;
      with prevention of congenital CMV as the endpoint. CMV gB vaccine is comprised of a&#xD;
      recombinant CMV envelope glycoprotein produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The CMV&#xD;
      gB is combined with a novel adjuvant, MF59, a proprietary oil-in-water emulsion. Vaccines&#xD;
      will be administered at 0, 1, and 6 months by intramuscular injection in the left deltoid.&#xD;
      Placebo recipients will be given a normal saline solution. Study participants were recruited&#xD;
      from postpartum wards and from the community. Potential participants were screened for&#xD;
      antibody to CMV; those who were seronegative were invited to participate in the vaccine&#xD;
      study. Participants received their initial immunization 1.5 to 12 months postpartum. A total&#xD;
      of 464, seronegative women who were willing to participate and met enrollment inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: Group I participants received 20&#xD;
      micrograms of gB with MF59; Group II participants received placebo (normal saline). During&#xD;
      the immunization period local and systemic reactogenicity was assessed by a 7-day diary card&#xD;
      completed after each dose of vaccine. Adverse events are tabulated. Safety is assessed by&#xD;
      comparing the local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse event rates between vaccine and&#xD;
      placebo recipients. Study participants are screened for CMV infection every three months,&#xD;
      beginning three months after the first dose of vaccine, using a CMV IgG antibody assay with&#xD;
      preabsorption of sera with purified recombinant CMV gB (vaccine antigen). CMV infection will&#xD;
      be confirmed by either isolation of virus or detection of CMV DNA in body fluids. After the 3&#xD;
      dose vaccine schedule has been completed, participants are followed every 3 months. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the time to CMV infection. The rate of congenital CMV infection in&#xD;
      offspring of immunized mothers is a secondary endpoint. The rate of congenital CMV infection&#xD;
      will be compared between offspring of vaccine and placebo recipients. Each subject will be&#xD;
      followed for 3 years from the third dose of vaccine. Specific information will be collected&#xD;
      on the following pregnancy outcomes: pregnancy report, pregnancy follow-up, abnormal&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome-mother, and abnormal pregnancy outcome-infant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers, 14 to 40 years of age (inclusive), who have delivered a newborn infant within&#xD;
             the previous 12 months, reside within the Birmingham metropolitan area or the&#xD;
             Tuscaloosa county area, and sign an informed consent form following a detailed&#xD;
             explanation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative as determined by the AxsymÂ® System CMV IgG antibody&#xD;
             assay (Abbott Diagnostics) performed within 14 weeks prior to the first immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In good health as judged by medical history obtained by patient interview and physical&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to participate with 4 follow-up visits per year for 3 years after the third&#xD;
             dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers must be willing to use an effective means of contraception of their choice&#xD;
             from the first dose of vaccine up to 2 months after the third dose of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Methods that were considered effective for the purposes of this clinical trial included any&#xD;
        hormonal contraceptive, double barrier methods and abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known maternal immune disorder such as HIV infection, collagen vascular disease,&#xD;
             immune deficiency, or chronic disease requiring treatment with immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic disease such as diabetes, sickle cell disease, heart disease, fibromyalgia,&#xD;
             arthritis or asthma requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diagnosis of asthma or past asthma were allowed to enroll if they did not&#xD;
        currently take medication for asthma and were off asthma medication and free from asthma&#xD;
        symptoms for at least 2 years. Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension on&#xD;
        medication were allowed if their blood pressure was controlled within the normal range for&#xD;
        at least one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive rapid test for HIV antibody. All subjects were tested for HIV antibody using&#xD;
             a rapid serologic test at the time of enrollment beginning with protocol version 1.7.&#xD;
             Prior to that only subjects who had a history of a negative screening test for HIV&#xD;
             during their most recent pregnancy were included. Subjects given HIV rapid serologic&#xD;
             tests in this study were provided pre-test counseling before the test was performed&#xD;
             and post-test counseling when the subject was informed of the test results. This&#xD;
             counseling is provided by the study nurses according to CDC guidelines [Centers for&#xD;
             Disease Control and Prevention. Revised Guidelines for HIV Counseling, Testing and&#xD;
             Referral and Revised Recommendations for HIV Screening of Pregnant Women. Subjects who&#xD;
             are eligible for this study were considered very unlikely to be HIV positive because&#xD;
             almost all adults who are HIV positive are also CMV positive and almost all potential&#xD;
             enrollees will have received HIV screening during their recent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maternal sterilization procedure planned in the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maternal drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mothers who are nursing their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial of another investigational vaccine or drug, if they&#xD;
             have received the investigational drug or vaccine within 6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
             date for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of anaphylaxis or serious vaccine reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous receipt of CMV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
