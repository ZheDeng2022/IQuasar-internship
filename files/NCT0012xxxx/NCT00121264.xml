  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 17-AAG when given together&#xD;
      with sorafenib in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as 17-AAG, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sorafenib may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood&#xD;
      flow to the tumor. Giving 17-AAG together with sorafenib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To recommend a phase II dose for 17AAG (once weekly intravenously for 3 of 4 weeks), in&#xD;
      combination with BAY 43-9006 (twice daily orally), by determining the feasibility, safety,&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicities and the maximally tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the modulation of pharmacodynamic effects and to investigate the interaction&#xD;
      between the two mechanisms of action when used in combination by: Studying surrogate tissue&#xD;
      and tumor cell signaling by Western blotting. Evaluating tumor blood flow utilizing dynamic&#xD;
      contrast enhanced MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study any pharmacokinetic interactions between these two agents. III. To assess&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of 17-N-allylamino&#xD;
      17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days -14 to 28 in course 1 and on days 1-28 in&#xD;
      all subsequent courses. Patients also receive 17-AAG IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 5-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that which 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 60 days.&#xD;
