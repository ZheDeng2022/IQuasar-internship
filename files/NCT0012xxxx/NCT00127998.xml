    <textblock>
      Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) to current antimalarial drugs and the&#xD;
      continuing development of resistance to new antimalarial formulations is one of the major&#xD;
      obstacles to effective malaria control and case management. Efficient, comprehensive and&#xD;
      validated methods for monitoring drug resistance in advance of the development of resistance&#xD;
      to the antimalarial drugs that are in use are urgently needed. Molecular markers of genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms that give rise to resistant P. falciparum parasites and methods in population&#xD;
      genetics for evaluating the data can be valuable tools for monitoring drug resistance in the&#xD;
      field. This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospectively measure the in vivo response of P. falciparum malaria in Mali to several&#xD;
           different antimalarial drugs and drug combinations: chloroquine (CQ),&#xD;
           sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), amodiaquine (AQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in&#xD;
           combination with amodiaquine (SP/AQ), amodiaquine in combination with artesunate&#xD;
           (AQ/AS), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with artesunate (SP/AS), and&#xD;
           artemether-lumefantrine (Co-artem). In one site with preliminary data showing a high&#xD;
           rate of P. falciparum resistance to mefloquine (MQ), this drug will also be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the frequencies of molecular markers for antimalarial drug resistance, and&#xD;
           examine how those results relate to the efficacy of these drugs in treating clinical&#xD;
           malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure drug levels at 3 days and correlate with efficacy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine early clinical, parasitologic, and clinical predictors of late treatment&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use the knowledge gained in Aims 1-3 to develop a molecular tool for a countrywide&#xD;
           resistance surveillance system for antimalarial drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to current antimalarial drugs and the continuing&#xD;
      development of resistance to new antimalarial formulations is one of the major obstacles to&#xD;
      effective malaria control and case management. Parasite populations are highly resistant to&#xD;
      chloroquine on an almost worldwide basis (Central America and Haiti being the exceptions) and&#xD;
      resistance to the next line of treatment, SP, is widespread in Asia and large parts of East&#xD;
      Africa and South America. SP is also now recommended for use as intermittent preventative&#xD;
      treatment (IPT) in pregnancy, which adds to concerns about the development and spread of SP&#xD;
      resistance. More expensive combination drug therapy using artesunate and other antimalarials&#xD;
      in combination is increasingly being recommended in an effort to extend the useful life of&#xD;
      drugs and to slow the spread of antimalarial drug resistance. In all likelihood, resistance&#xD;
      will eventually emerge for any new single drug or combination formulation that we deploy in&#xD;
      the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, efficient, comprehensive and validated methods for monitoring drug&#xD;
      resistance in advance of the development of resistance to the antimalarial drugs that are in&#xD;
      use are urgently needed. Such methods would help malaria control and prevention programs in&#xD;
      guiding national treatment recommendations and policies. Integrating laboratory expertise,&#xD;
      analytic methods based on population genetics, and more traditional methods of surveillance&#xD;
      for anti-malarial drug resistance (e.g. in vivo drug efficacy studies) and networking with&#xD;
      national and international partners will result in a multidisciplinary, geographically&#xD;
      diverse team approach to assessing and monitoring drug resistant malaria, as well as&#xD;
      developing and validating molecular methods. This type of effort will greatly assist in&#xD;
      maximizing the useful life span of antimalarial drugs and in providing evidence-based&#xD;
      guidance for drug policy decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospectively measure the in vivo response of P. falciparum malaria in Mali to CQ, SP,&#xD;
           AQ, SP/AQ in combination, AQ/artesunate (AS) in combination, SP/AS, and&#xD;
           artemether-lumefantrine (Co-artem). In one site with preliminary data showing a high&#xD;
           rate of P. falciparum resistance to MQ, MQ will also be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure the frequencies of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), dihydropteroate synthetase&#xD;
           (dhps), P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum&#xD;
           multi-drug resistant (pfmdr 1) genotypes and establish their relationship with in vivo&#xD;
           resistance to SP (dhfr and dhps), CQ, AQ, SP/AQ, AQ/AS, SP/AS, and MQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure drug levels at 3 days and correlate with in vivo efficacy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine early clinical, parasitologic, and clinical predictors of late treatment&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use the knowledge gained in Aims 1-3 to develop a molecular tool for a countrywide&#xD;
           resistance surveillance system for SP, AQ, and MQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will entail two consecutive years of prospective 28 day in vivo drug efficacy&#xD;
      studies carried out during the rainy season in three different malaria transmission sites:&#xD;
      Koro (rural town with 71% of resistance to MQ at a lower dose of 15 mg/kg), Pongono (rural&#xD;
      town with little exposure to antimalarials) and Faladje (rural village with &gt; 30% of&#xD;
      chloroquine resistance). Children aged 6-59 months with clinical symptoms consistent with&#xD;
      malaria will be enrolled in the study after screening for fever (axillary temperature &gt;=37.5&#xD;
      C) and malaria asexual parasites identified by microscopic examination of thick blood films.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood spotted onto filter papers will be collected prior to treatment and during follow up.&#xD;
      These filter paper samples will be used for the molecular detection of drug&#xD;
      resistance-conferring gene polymorphisms as well as the HPLC detection and quantification of&#xD;
      the respective drugs and their relevant metabolites. In vivo data interpretation will be done&#xD;
      using the WHO 28-day protocol (WHO, 2003) and molecular markers will be used for the&#xD;
      determination of the genotype resistance index (GRI). Venous blood will be collected at&#xD;
      enrollment and at the time of in vivo failure to measure in vitro drug efficacy and&#xD;
      cryopreserve parasites to search for novel molecular markers to new antimalarial drugs.&#xD;
