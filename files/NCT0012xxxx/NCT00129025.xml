  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with localized prostate cancer choose radiotherapy for treatment. Recent&#xD;
      improvements in technology have lead to better outcomes with less side effects and better&#xD;
      disease control rates by allowing high doses of radiation to be delivered to the cancer with&#xD;
      lower doses to surrounding healthy tissues. Currently patients are required to attend daily&#xD;
      treatments over seven to eight weeks which can be costly and disruptive for patients,&#xD;
      especially those not living close to a cancer centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is recent research that suggests that the same or better outcomes might be achieved in&#xD;
      prostate cancer by delivering a smaller number of treatments, but with a higher dose of&#xD;
      radiation given on each visit, over a shorter time than the usual seven to eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators propose to treat patients with prostate cancer using 16&#xD;
      treatments over four weeks, thus reducing the number of visits to the cancer centre for&#xD;
      treatment by 50%.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the acute and late effects of high-dose short-course hypofractionated&#xD;
           radiotherapy of 55 Gy/16 fraction/4 weeks in the treatment of localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide clinical data for confirmation of current linear-quadratic radiobiological&#xD;
           model of fractionation sensitivity in the treatment of prostate cancer by external beam&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, 18,800 Canadians were expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, 2000 of whom&#xD;
      were in Alberta. Prostate cancer represents a significant workload in most Canadian cancer&#xD;
      centres. At the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI), approximately 400 patients underwent a radical&#xD;
      course of external beam radiotherapy in 2002. Typically, each course of radiation consisted&#xD;
      of 35 fractions given over 7 weeks. Assuming an ideal efficiency of patient turnover on a&#xD;
      given linear accelerator, 3000 machine hours would be required to treat 400 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, clinical trials are on-going to confirm that an increase in radiation dose given&#xD;
      over 39-44 fractions per patient will be more efficacious than the current standard of 35-39&#xD;
      fractions. Such an increase in radiation dose will require an increase in treatment capacity&#xD;
      by 10% without increasing the number of patients treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to increasing the number of fractions to deliver a greater total dose, the&#xD;
      radiation dose given in each fraction can be increased. Accordingly the total dose is&#xD;
      decreased to maintain acceptable toxicity. Such treatment schedule is referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;hypofractionation&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionation in prostate cancer was studied in the Phase III NCIC Clinical Trials Group&#xD;
      PR-5 study. The long term outcomes were reported at ASTRO in November of 2003. The results of&#xD;
      the PR-5 study, together with a similar Australian randomized trial reported in 2003,&#xD;
      strongly support the biological model of a high fractionation sensitivity of prostate cancer,&#xD;
      which can be exploited using hypofractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionation - Choice of Dose-Fractionation and Treatment Planning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionated radiotherapy schedules are designed based on the premise of biological&#xD;
      equivalent dose, modeled by the linear quadratic method. Possible schedules to achieve&#xD;
      equivalent results can be given over 10 to 30 fractions. In 2002 and 2003, investigators from&#xD;
      Toronto, Ontario and Cleveland, Ohio reported promising preliminary results based on 20 and&#xD;
      28 fractions per treatment course. This technique takes advantage of modern CT-based&#xD;
      treatment planning systems and technologies to precisely target the prostate with maximal&#xD;
      sparing of adjacent normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, investigators from TBCC conducted a dosimetry study to determine the equivalent&#xD;
      hypofractionated dose given over 16 fractions. The results, presented by this principal&#xD;
      investigator at the European Cancer Conference in September 2003 and at the Canadian&#xD;
      Association of Radiation Oncologists scientific meeting in October 2003, showed that a dose&#xD;
      of 55 Gy in 16 fractions given over four weeks is a biologically equivalent course of&#xD;
      treatment compared to current standard treatment over seven to eight weeks at the CCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis being tested in this study is that hypofractionated radiotherapy of 55 Gy/16&#xD;
      fractions/4 weeks will be well tolerated with acute and late toxicity comparable to&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy. The secondary objective is to determine the rate of biochemical&#xD;
      control and the need for complex treatment planning (IMRT) as opposed to 3D conformal&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer are eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Specifically, patients with clinical T1 or T2, Gleason score 6 and PSA &lt;20 and patients with&#xD;
      clinical T1-T2, Gleason score 7 and PS &lt;15 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy up to six months is allowed. Radiation dose prescribed is 55 Gy&#xD;
      in 16 fractions over four weeks, four fractions per week. CTV is the prostate +/- 0.5-1 cm of&#xD;
      seminal vesicles. PTV is the CTV plus 10 mm margin in all directions except posterior (5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure precise targeting using daily on-line imaging and correction of positioning prior&#xD;
      to treatment, fiducial markers will be inserted into the prostate under transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. Three inert gold markers (0.98 mm diameter x 5 mm length) will be&#xD;
      implanted into the prostate apex, mid-gland and base. The procedure will follow similar&#xD;
      guidelines as for a TRUS prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning guidelines are provided for 3D planning as well as IMRT. All patients are&#xD;
      planned by 3D conformal technique and if the dosimetry is unsatisfactory, IMRT will be used.&#xD;
      Failure to meet all dose-constraint criteria for normal tissues will exclude the patient from&#xD;
      the trial. Details of treatment planning are provided in the full study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the use of fiducial markers, isocentre placements (ie: targeting) correction will be&#xD;
      made to maintain a target error of no greater than 3 mm in the right-left and&#xD;
      superior-inferior directions, and no greater than 2 mm in the anterior-posterior directions.&#xD;
      All deviations will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcomes include acute and late GU/bladder and acute GI/rectum toxicity as well as&#xD;
      patient-assessed quality of life (Prostate Cancer Index). The percentage of patients&#xD;
      requiring IMRT treatment will be determined. The changes in rectal mucosa will be assessed by&#xD;
      endoscopy for a subset of patients who agree to undergo sigmoidoscopy at baseline, 18 months&#xD;
      and then 36 months after radiotherapy. Tumor control will be determined as PSA relapse free&#xD;
      survival, using the ASTRO consensus definition for PSA failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample six is one of convenience. Given the limitations imposed by the time required for&#xD;
      treatment planning and completing trials, the investigators estimate that one patient/month&#xD;
      can be accrued and treated at each of the three centres. They anticipate 72 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the trial over a two year period. This will allow estimation of the late toxicity&#xD;
      rate with reasonable precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate confidence interval (CI) width assuming minimal sample size (72), based on exact&#xD;
      binomial interval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gr 3, 4 toxicity rate 0.05: 0.1: 0.15: 0.2; 95% CI width 0.12: 0.16: 0.18: 0.20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential for increased toxicity due to the larger dose/fraction, the investigators&#xD;
      will implement early stopping rules for unacceptable acute toxicity. Although the late&#xD;
      toxicity is the endpoint of interest, acute toxicity will be used as a proxy due to the&#xD;
      length of time needed to determine late toxicities. Acute GI and GU toxicity have been&#xD;
      reported to be significant predictors of late toxicity by several investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stopping rules were determined following the method of Thall, Simon and Estey (JCO 1996)&#xD;
      (20). The investigators assume that the apriori distribution for the toxicity rate can be&#xD;
      described by Betal (1.3, 20) ie: mean toxicity rate = 0.05, 95% probability interval for&#xD;
      toxicity rate is between 0.00 an d0.10. The trial would be stopped if the posterior&#xD;
      distribution was such that :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pr (toxicity rate &gt; 0.10/data) &gt;=0.80 - that is, if it is very likely that the toxicity rate&#xD;
      &gt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Coordination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in three cancer centres, namely the Tom Baker Cancer Centre,&#xD;
      Calgary; the Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton; and the Saskatoon Cancer Centre, Saskatoon.&#xD;
      All patient related data will be collected in the individual institution and forwarded to the&#xD;
      TBCC, the coordinating centre. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity and serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      monitored and discussed among the co-investigators. Data entry and analysis will be performed&#xD;
      at TBCC with statistical support from the Division of Population Health and Information at&#xD;
      the centre.&#xD;
