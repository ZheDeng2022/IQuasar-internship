  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery with post operative radiotherapy (PORT) had been the mainstay of treatment for&#xD;
      advanced laryngeal-pharyngeal cancers (ALHC) until the eighth decade of the past century.&#xD;
      Total laryngectomy with post-operative radiotherapy (TL + PORT) used to result in permanent&#xD;
      tracheostomy and loss of speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early trials like the VA or European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer&#xD;
      (EORTC) trials compared surgery with post-operative radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      (ICT) and radiotherapy (RT). Subsequent attempts have been focused on the added benefit of&#xD;
      including concurrent chemotherapy. There is no randomized trial available in the literature&#xD;
      comparing concurrent chemoradiation with the standard treatment, i.e. surgery followed by&#xD;
      radiotherapy. However, most of the studies comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy reported better locoregional control rates and better survival rates with&#xD;
      surgery followed by post-operative chemotherapy. Further, the advances in primary voice&#xD;
      rehabilitation have substantially improved the quality of life after laryngectomy. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a strong case for comparing the results of concurrent chemo-radiation with surgery&#xD;
      and post-operative radiotherapy in a randomized clinical trial. This trial will answer the&#xD;
      question - &quot;whether we are saving voice at the cost of life&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to randomize 900 patients of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers&#xD;
      in surgery with PORT and a concomitant chemoradiation arm and compare the survival and&#xD;
      locoregional control rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TL + PORT has traditionally been the gold standard in management of ALHC. However, this&#xD;
      results in permanent tracheostomy and a possible loss of speech. In case of partial&#xD;
      laryngectomy and even in case of TL, there are various options of voice rehabilitation but&#xD;
      the successes of all these procedures are highly variable. In 1980s several authors reported&#xD;
      interesting possibility of LP with ICT. The first randomized study (RCT) came from VA group&#xD;
      who randomized patients to receive either 2 cycles of ICT + RT Vs surgery +PORT. Patients&#xD;
      with more than PR received a 3rd cycle followed by definitive RT. There were more local&#xD;
      recurrences and fewer distant metastases in the ICT arm. Of the 166 ICT patients, nearly&#xD;
      1/3rd required salvage TL with ultimate LP in 66% surviving patients. These results proved&#xD;
      that ICT and definitive RT can be effective in LP without compromising overall survival.&#xD;
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study randomly assigned&#xD;
      hypopharynx cancer patients to receive either immediate surgery with PORT (arm 1) or ICT.&#xD;
      Patients with a CR after 2 or 3 cycles of CT were treated there after by RT. Locoregional&#xD;
      failures occurred at approximately the same frequencies in both arms but there were fewer&#xD;
      distant failures in the ICT arm. The median survival was found to be similar in both arms&#xD;
      with LPR of 35% in the ICT arm. This study showed the feasibility of LP in patients with&#xD;
      cancer of the hypopharynx. A smaller trial from MSKCC15 reported 52% LPR and another European&#xD;
      RCT reported poorer survival in the CT arm with LPR of 20% only. The latter trial had a&#xD;
      smaller number of patients and imbalance in randomized groups (4 out of 5 stage IV patients&#xD;
      got randomized into CT arm) that could have flawed the outcome. The 3 RCTs (excluding MSKCC&#xD;
      trial) were compiled by MACH-NC to obtain a meta analysis that showed similar disease free&#xD;
      survival and a non significant trend of higher 6% survival in pooled surgery arm which was&#xD;
      counterbalanced by LPR of 58% in the pooled CT arm. Quality of life measures performed as&#xD;
      part of the VA study demonstrated that LP offers better speech, good communication skills,&#xD;
      lesser pain and depression compared to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In three arm study by RTOG (91-11), incidence of laryngectomy was 28% in induction (ICT)&#xD;
      chemotherapy arm, 16% in concomitant arm, and 31% in radiation(RT) alone arm. Following TL,&#xD;
      the incidence of major and minor complications ranged from 52% to 59% and did not differ&#xD;
      significantly among the 3 arms. Fistula was lowest in RT alone arm (15%) and highest in&#xD;
      concomitant arm (30%). Similar experience was reported from MSKCC with fistulas occurring in&#xD;
      39%, resulting in prolonged hospitalization. When compared with complication rates of surgery&#xD;
      in untreated patients, the complication rates following unsuccessful LP protocol is&#xD;
      significantly higher. In spite of higher morbidity, local-regional control is excellent for&#xD;
      this group of patients. In RTOG trial, local-regional control following SS was 74% for CT&#xD;
      arms and 90% for RT alone arm. At 24 months, the overall survival was equal in all arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessity of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy itself is debatable. The MACH -NC&#xD;
      reported 4% improvement in overall survival at 2 and 5 yrs with CT. So to prevent death of&#xD;
      400 patients at 5 years, 10,000 patients would have to undergo CT. In O'Sullivan'&#xD;
      questionnaire based study, apart from extent of disease the other significant variables that&#xD;
      influenced treatment recommendation were physicians specialty and their geographical area of&#xD;
      practice. Most LP protocols are often accompanied by increased toxicity and are generally&#xD;
      achieved in good performance status patients unlike majority of head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients. In VA trial, 77% patients had Karnofsky performance score (KPS) more than 80 and in&#xD;
      RTOG 91-11 trial, 2/3 patients had KPS 90 or more. In RTOG trial, the mucosal toxicity in&#xD;
      concurrent CT+RT arm was twice as much as the mucosal toxicity in other two arms. High grade&#xD;
      toxic effects occurred more when CT was added to RT but there was no significant difference&#xD;
      in rate of toxic effects between concurrent arm and ICT arm. Incidence of treatment&#xD;
      modification, treatment interruption and hospitalizations are higher (compared to RT alone)&#xD;
      when CT is administered concomitantly or during altered fractionation due to complications&#xD;
      such as mucositis, dysphagia, pain, desquamation etc. The indirect costs attributable to&#xD;
      non-surgical approaches e.g frequent expensive imagings, duration of treatment , duration of&#xD;
      recuperation, cost of chemotherapy drugs, enhanced need for supportive care, stringent follow&#xD;
      up and salvage surgery (in one third to half of the patients) may be more than the costs for&#xD;
      radical surgery. Careful monitoring of the conservatively treated patient is mandatory to&#xD;
      allow for early salvage of failures (in VA trial, induction CT arm had more local recurrences&#xD;
      and only 2% patients were lost to follow-up). Given the infirmity and poor compliance of head&#xD;
      and neck cancer patients such a stringent follow-up appears difficult (in VA trial patients&#xD;
      were followed up every month for 1st year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly 40-60% patients fail on LPP and predicting this failure before spares these patients&#xD;
      of unnecessary chemoradiation and its toxicities, trauma of recurrent disease and&#xD;
      complications of salvage surgery. Mutation of the p53 gene has been found to regulate cell&#xD;
      proliferation and chemosensitivity. LP is significantly higher in the group of patients whose&#xD;
      tumors over expressed p53 but it does not predict survival. A retrospective study nested&#xD;
      within the VA study reported that T stage, p53 over-expression and elevated proliferating&#xD;
      cell nuclear antigen index were independent predictors of successful LP . Success of RT&#xD;
      depends on killing all clonogenic cells that increases linearly with tumor volume (TV).&#xD;
      Lesions are classified as T3 or T4 despite a wide variation in TV if one were to perform&#xD;
      volumetric analysis for all. TV is one of the most precise and most relevant predictors of RT&#xD;
      outcome. This inverse relationship may be explained on the basis of hypoxia due to central&#xD;
      tumor necrosis that is detrimental for CT as well as RT. Cartilage invasion, soft tissue&#xD;
      extension, volume, extensive nodal involvement, pre epiglottic space invasion, paraglottic&#xD;
      space invasion and arytenoids infiltration are some of the radiological parameters that can&#xD;
      predict poor outcome to RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies show adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation to the emerging standard of care for&#xD;
      high risk tumors providing an estimated five year progression free survival benefit of 11% in&#xD;
      advanced stage III and IV tumors or even early stage tumors with extranodal spread, positive&#xD;
      resection margins, perineural involvement or vascular embolization. A similar study by RTOG&#xD;
      showed an estimated 10% improvement in two year locoregional control in high risk tumors with&#xD;
      multiple lymphnodal involvement, extranodal spread and positive resection margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To sum up, CT+RT has the advantages of potential radiosensitization by chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      cell cycle redistribution, overcoming radio-resistance within the field of RT, targeting&#xD;
      different subpopulation of cells leading to more kill, reduction or delay in distant&#xD;
      metastases. Its disadvantages are increased expense, enhanced toxicity and need of good&#xD;
      interdisciplinary integration. What needs to be appreciated is the fact that CT+RT has never&#xD;
      been evaluated against the standard treatment of TL + PORT. Although the quality of life has&#xD;
      been reported to be better after laryngeal preservation, speech rehabilitation has improved&#xD;
      steadily over past decade. Time seems to be ripe now to compare LP with CT+RT with TL+PORT&#xD;
      and speech rehabilitation with locoregional control and quality of life as endpoint.&#xD;
