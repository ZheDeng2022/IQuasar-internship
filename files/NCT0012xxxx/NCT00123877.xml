  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early Phase II multicenter trial is to determine the objective clinical&#xD;
      response to GPX-100, an anthracycline similar to doxorubicin, in up to 40 patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed metastatic breast cancer. GPX-100 is unique among anthracyclines because it is not&#xD;
      converted to doxorubicinol during metabolism in the body. This metabolite has been shown to&#xD;
      be a major cause of damage to the heart (cardiotoxicity) in laboratory studies. Eligible&#xD;
      patients who are enrolled in this study will receive GPX-100 as a single agent at the&#xD;
      beginning of as many as 8 three week long cycles of chemotherapy. Objective measurements of&#xD;
      tumor response will be made by computed tomography (CT) scans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design - Two-stage, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      dose administration of GPX-100 and limited dose-escalation and de-escalation. After&#xD;
      confirmation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and interim analysis of efficacy and safety&#xD;
      (Stage I), if necessary the study cohort will be enlarged to confirm the estimate of clinical&#xD;
      efficacy (Stage II) using the established MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size - 20 patients in Stage I and up to 20 patients in Stage II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage Form - IV solution of sterilized lyophilized powder in Sodium Chloride (NaCl) for&#xD;
      Injection, USP (0.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses - 140 mg/m2 GPX-100 with escalation to 170 mg/m2 and de-escalation to 105 mg/m2&#xD;
      depending upon clinical response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration - One IV infusion every 3 weeks for up to 8 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Parameters - Activity of GPX-100 will be evaluated in terms of measurable tumor&#xD;
      response and disease progression according to RECIST criteria. Blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      for determination of pharmacokinetic parameters and the presence of doxorubicinol following&#xD;
      the first dose of GPX-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Parameters - Dose tolerance and treatment toxicity, especially cardiotoxicity, of&#xD;
      GPX-100 will be evaluated. A baseline medical history including Karnofsky Performance Status&#xD;
      and a physical examination, hematology profile (CBC, differential, platelet count), chemistry&#xD;
      profile including electrolytes, serum calcium, liver and renal function tests, urinalysis,&#xD;
      chest and abdominal CT scans, and a bone scan will be done. Interval history with adverse&#xD;
      event (AE) assessment and performance status, physical examination, and hematology and&#xD;
      clinical chemistry profile will be repeated every 3 weeks during treatment. In addition,&#xD;
      hematology and chemistry profiles will be repeated weekly between treatment visits. Chest and&#xD;
      abdominal CTs and bone scans will be repeated at 6-week intervals as appropriate for tumor&#xD;
      assessment. An MRI of the brain will be performed at the baseline visit if clinically&#xD;
      indicated. Urinalysis will be repeated at six-week intervals during treatment. Cardiotoxicity&#xD;
      will be assessed with ECG and MUGA scans at baseline, every 6 weeks during treatment, and 6-8&#xD;
      weeks after the last dose of GPX-100. There will be continued follow-up at 6-8 week intervals&#xD;
      if indicated by changing cardiac function until normal or stable. Treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued if there is objective disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity. A&#xD;
      follow-up visit will occur 6-8 weeks after the last treatment visit for each patient, whether&#xD;
      the study was completed per protocol or the patient discontinues study treatment early for&#xD;
      any reason. The following evaluations will be performed at the follow-up visit: physical&#xD;
      examination, adverse event assessment, ECG, MUGA scan, hematology and clinical chemistry&#xD;
      profiles, and urinalysis. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at baseline and at the&#xD;
      follow-up visit, if necessary.&#xD;
