      Cough is the most common reason for an acute care doctor's visit in the United States. Cough&#xD;
      can affect sleep for both coughing children and their parents. The American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics does not endorse the use of dextromethorphan (DM), the most common&#xD;
      over-the-counter (OTC) cough medication because of a lack of efficacy data and some potential&#xD;
      for toxicity, particularly when taken in excess. In fact, DM has previously been shown to be&#xD;
      no better than a placebo for cough in children. Therefore, alternative, therapeutic agents&#xD;
      are needed. Honey anecdotally provides relief for symptoms due to upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection (URI). This study seeks to use a survey to evaluate whether a single dose of honey&#xD;
      and/or DM is better than no treatment at all for controlling nocturnal cough in children with&#xD;
      URI and the effect of the treatments on sleep quality for coughing children and their&#xD;
      parents. A single dose of honey or DM will be superior to no treatment for control of&#xD;
      nocturnal cough due to upper URI as rated by both parents and children and will improve the&#xD;
      sleep quality for those children and parents. Compared to DM, honey will be superior for&#xD;
      controlling nocturnal cough due to upper URI (also based on child and parental report).&#xD;

      Cough is one of the most common reasons for a doctor's visit in the United States and may be&#xD;
      the most bothersome symptom for children with colds. It is particularly annoying at night&#xD;
      because it can interrupt sleep for both coughing children and their parents. Dextromethorphan&#xD;
      (DM), the most common over-the-counter (OTC) &quot;cough medication,&quot; may not be as helpful for&#xD;
      these symptoms as previously believed. Because of this, treatments are needed to better&#xD;
      reduce the symptoms from a cold. Honey is a naturally occurring substance that may provide&#xD;
      relief for cold symptoms. Children are being offered the opportunity to take part in this&#xD;
      research because they have been diagnosed with a cold and have had difficulty sleeping due to&#xD;
      their cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to use a survey to see if a single dose of honey or DM is&#xD;
      better than no treatment at all for controlling nighttime cough in children, ages 2 to less&#xD;
      than 18 years with a cold and if the medicine or honey helps the quality of sleep for the&#xD;
      coughing children and their parents. DM has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) and is available over the counter. The form of honey used in this study may also be&#xD;
      purchased without a doctor's prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 125 male and female children from 2 to less than 18 years old will take part in this&#xD;
      study at the Hershey Medical Center.&#xD;
