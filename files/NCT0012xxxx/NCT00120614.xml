  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether beginning an enriched&#xD;
      educational/behavioral program for parents of premature infants, very early in the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay, and lasting until the child is 3 years old, has beneficial&#xD;
      results for both the parents and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital phase of the program gives parents an understanding of what to expect in the&#xD;
      NICU environment; physical characteristics and needs of their premature baby; and how and&#xD;
      when to best support their infant's development during this time. The information given&#xD;
      during the home phase of the program continues with information specific to the growth and&#xD;
      development and the effective parenting of an infant/toddler who has been born prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that this information will help decrease parents' stress, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression levels that can be related to giving birth to a premature infant. It is also&#xD;
      expected that it will strengthen the mother's and father's ability to parent their premature&#xD;
      child in a way that will help support their child's brain development and learning ability&#xD;
      and to also decrease negative behaviors as the child grows.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of premature and low birthweight (LBW) births continues to climb in the U.S.&#xD;
      despite increased efforts to prevent it. Interventions to enhance coping in parents of&#xD;
      infants in an attempt to improve both parent and child outcomes have not kept pace with the&#xD;
      rapid technological advances to sustain survival for these medically compromised infants.&#xD;
      Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate coping interventions for&#xD;
      parents of LBW premature infants in order to facilitate effective clinical practice&#xD;
      strategies that are empirically based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of a&#xD;
      theoretically-driven intervention program (COPE: Creating Opportunities for Parent&#xD;
      Empowerment) on the process and outcomes of mothers and fathers/significant others' (SOs)&#xD;
      coping with a LBW premature infant and infant developmental outcomes. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore how the coping process and outcomes of mothers and fathers/significant others&#xD;
           together contribute to the outcomes of LBW premature infants;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the cost-effectiveness of the COPE program; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore what factors moderate the effects of the intervention (e.g., family structure,&#xD;
           SES, birthweight, disability, and infant temperament).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized clinical trial, the investigators are testing the following hypotheses&#xD;
      separately for mothers and for fathers/significant others:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers/fathers who receive the COPE program will report less anxiety, depression, and&#xD;
           stress related to the NICU environment than mothers/fathers who receive the comparison&#xD;
           program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers/fathers who receive the COPE program will demonstrate a higher quality of&#xD;
           parenting during hospitalization than mothers/fathers who receive the comparison&#xD;
           program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers/fathers who receive the COPE program will report less anxiety and depression&#xD;
           following hospitalization than mothers/fathers who receive the comparison program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers/fathers who receive the COPE program will perceive their children as less&#xD;
           vulnerable than mothers/fathers who receive the comparison program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fathers who receive the COPE program will report greater involvement in their infants'&#xD;
           lives (average time spent with infant per week) than fathers who receive the comparison&#xD;
           program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants of mothers/fathers who receive the COPE program will have greater cognitive&#xD;
           development than infants of mothers/fathers in the comparison program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children of mothers/fathers in the COPE program will have less negative behaviors at 2&#xD;
           years corrected age than children of mothers/fathers in the comparison program;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed model to explain the effects of the COPE program on the process and&#xD;
           outcomes of parental coping and infant outcomes will be supported for mothers and for&#xD;
           fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following study questions will be answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do parental beliefs and coping outcomes of both mothers and fathers together&#xD;
           contribute to the outcomes of LBW premature infants?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there reciprocal effects between parent and child outcomes as well as parental&#xD;
           emotional and functional coping outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do infant cognitive development and parental coping outcomes change over time within&#xD;
           the subjects and between the experimental groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors moderate the effects of the intervention on child outcomes (e.g., family&#xD;
           structure, SES, birth-weight, disability, and infant temperament)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the incremental cost of the COPE intervention compared to the comparison group,&#xD;
           when the health care sector perspective is considered?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the incremental cost of the COPE intervention compared to the comparison group&#xD;
           intervention, when the societal perspective is considered?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How sensitive are the findings in these economic evaluations to the assumptions and&#xD;
           parameter estimates made in the analyses?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 years of life and the quality of early parent-child relations are principal&#xD;
      building blocks for adult cognitive and emotional functioning. However, investigators have&#xD;
      found that parents have impaired relationships with their premature infants, providing&#xD;
      heightened stimulation to the infants at inappropriate times in hopes of increasing&#xD;
      responsiveness to them. These dysfunctional patterns place parents at risk for negative&#xD;
      emotions and parenting outcomes and place children at risk for emotional, behavioral, and&#xD;
      developmental problems. Therefore, early interventions are critical to decrease the negative&#xD;
      effects of prematurity on parenting and parent-infant interactions. Early intervention may be&#xD;
      a critical key to future successful programs with parents and their premature infants because&#xD;
      it is recognized that, once a trajectory of parent-infant interaction is initiated, changes&#xD;
      are difficult to implement and even harder to sustain; this program has the potential to&#xD;
      benefit a significant number of LBW premature infants and their parents across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized block design with repeated measures is being used. Subjects at each of two study&#xD;
      sites are randomly assigned to the COPE or comparison group by 4-week periods of time. Using&#xD;
      random assignment at each site will allow for assessment of an interaction effect as part of&#xD;
      the data analytic strategy. Based on the average NICU stay in the pilot study (mean = 29.6&#xD;
      days), the decision to use 4-week blocks of time was made to decrease the likelihood of&#xD;
      parent to parent and staff to parent contamination which would be more likely with individual&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COPE program provides parents with: (a) information on the appearance and behavioral&#xD;
      characteristics of premature infants and information on how parents can participate in their&#xD;
      infant's care, meet their infant's needs, enhance the quality of interaction with their&#xD;
      infant, and facilitate their infant's development (parental role information); and (b)&#xD;
      activities that assist parents in implementing the experimental information. The content of&#xD;
      the COPE program is driven by the theoretical framework, developmental theory, the literature&#xD;
      review, interventions found to be effective in previous studies, and prior work by the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COPE program consists of 7 phases. Phase I (within 2 to 4 days after the infant's NICU&#xD;
      admission) consists of audiotaped information. A written copy of the information is also&#xD;
      provided for parents to read as they listen to the audiotape. Also, parents are given their&#xD;
      first set of parenting activities that consist of: (a) identifying the special&#xD;
      characteristics of their baby; and (b) keeping a record of milestones that their baby&#xD;
      achieves while in the NICU. Phase II (within 2 to 4 days after the first intervention)&#xD;
      consists of audiotaped and written information that reinforce the critical content of the&#xD;
      initial audiotape and provides supplemental information on: (a) premature infants' behaviors&#xD;
      and development; and (b) further suggestions regarding how parents can participate in their&#xD;
      infant's care and enhance their infant's development. Additional activities are introduced to&#xD;
      parents that consist of: (a) identifying the special characteristics of their baby at this&#xD;
      time; and (b) recognizing their baby's stress cues as well as cues that signal readiness for&#xD;
      communication. The parent activities are designed to: (a) supplement mothers and fathers'&#xD;
      existing parenting repertoire by providing them with parent activities specific to the&#xD;
      situation; (b) increase parents' confidence and certainty regarding how they can best meet&#xD;
      their infant's needs; and (c) enhance infant developmental outcomes. Phase III (1 to 4 days&#xD;
      prior to the infant's discharge to home) consists of developmentally appropriate information,&#xD;
      including specific details about infant states and the best times for mothers and fathers to&#xD;
      interact with their infant. The audiotape also contains parental role information regarding&#xD;
      how to smooth the transition from hospital to home as well as how to continue to foster a&#xD;
      positive mother/father-baby relationship. Parent activities during Phase III include: (a)&#xD;
      continuing to assist parents in recognizing their baby's cues; and (b) helping parents to&#xD;
      recognize strategies that help their baby when he or she is stressed. The Phase III&#xD;
      intervention was planned for this window of time because discharge to home is empirically&#xD;
      supported as a stressful transition for parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV (within 1 week after discharge) is delivered in the parents' home. Audiotaped&#xD;
      information at this time contains information specific to continued growth and development of&#xD;
      the infant and suggestions for fostering a positive parent-infant relationship. Further&#xD;
      parenting activities are given to mothers and fathers that outline specific things for them&#xD;
      to do with their infant to foster his or her cognitive development (e.g. age appropriate&#xD;
      games and songs). One of these activities is a book, The Little Engine that Could, for&#xD;
      parents to read to their infants. Emphasis is placed upon interacting when the infant is most&#xD;
      receptive to stimuli (e.g., while in the quiet alert state). Phase V (2 months corrected age)&#xD;
      is also delivered in the parents' home. Parents again receive audiotaped and written&#xD;
      information about appropriate upcoming developmental milestones and how they can enhance&#xD;
      their infant's development. Emphasis is placed on specific age-appropriate information about:&#xD;
      (a) their infant's developmental characteristics; (b) typical sleep, crying, and temperament&#xD;
      patterns; and (c) strategies to foster their infant's cognitive and social development. The&#xD;
      COPE information places emphasis on assessing their infants based on their corrected versus&#xD;
      chronological age. Parenting activities in this phase of the intervention include: (a) rattle&#xD;
      play; (b) playing &quot;peek-a-boo&quot;; (c) repeating an action; (d) tasting and touching to explore;&#xD;
      and (e) vocalizing to take a turn. At Phase VI (9 months corrected age) parents are provided&#xD;
      with audiotaped information that: (a) educates them regarding what to expect in their&#xD;
      infant's upcoming development; and (b) provides suggestions for enhancing their child's&#xD;
      development. Because mothers of LBW premature infants frequently continue to view their&#xD;
      children as &quot;fragile&quot; through the preschool years and engage in overprotective parenting,&#xD;
      this intervention focuses on the importance of letting toddlers engage in autonomy,&#xD;
      exploration, self-initiation, and self-assertion. The COPE information outlines parenting&#xD;
      strategies that foster positive attributes in the children in addition to teaching&#xD;
      age-appropriate limits. Parenting activities to enhance development in this phase include:&#xD;
      (a) learning the meaning of &quot;no&quot;; (b) learning about colors and sizes; (c) finger-painting;&#xD;
      (d) reading; and (e) identifying body parts. Phase VII (18 months corrected age) information&#xD;
      continues to emphasize the importance of allowing the child to develop autonomy,&#xD;
      self-initiation, and appropriate exploration. Detailed information about the adverse effects&#xD;
      of overprotective parenting is provided. Parents are given more information about how to&#xD;
      engage in appropriate limit setting and discipline as well as strategies to continue to&#xD;
      foster cognitive and social development with their toddler. The following parent-child&#xD;
      activities are provided: (a) playdough and paint-recipes for fun; (b) matching objects to&#xD;
      pictures; (c) learning to sort; (d) remembering where things belong; (e) learning to imitate&#xD;
      two word phrases; and (f) recognizing and naming pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison program also consists of a series of audiotapes delivered at the same times as&#xD;
      the 7 phases of the COPE program. Phases I and II audiotaped and written information contains&#xD;
      information about the hospital services. The Phase III audiotape contains discharge&#xD;
      information that is given to all parents. The audiotape provided during the Phase IV&#xD;
      intervention contains information regarding immunizations. Phases V to VII audiotaped and&#xD;
      written interventions focus on age appropriate child safety and nutrition issues.&#xD;
