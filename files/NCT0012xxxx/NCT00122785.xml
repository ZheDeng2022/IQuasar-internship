  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a single intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      dexamethasone decreased the duration of symptoms of acute bronchiolitis in young children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute bronchiolitis is an infection of the lower respiratory tract causing inflammation of&#xD;
      the small airways, leading to bronchiolar obstruction. Corticosteroids are frequently&#xD;
      prescribed as anti-inflammatory drugs. The usefulness of corticosteroids for this disease&#xD;
      remains controversial, despite many randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Recently, a&#xD;
      meta-analysis and systemic review showed significant improvement in clinical symptoms, length&#xD;
      of hospital stay and duration of symptoms in children with this disease after treatment with&#xD;
      various regimens of systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a long acting corticosteroid with biologic half-life ranging from 36-72&#xD;
      hours. A single dose of dexamethasone has been the standard recommendation for the treatment&#xD;
      of croup which has a similar pathophysiology without evidence of adverse effects.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is no previous report of this single dosage form of dexamethasone for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute bronchiolitis in young children.&#xD;
