      This study will classify types of hypertonia in patients with cerebral palsy and determine if&#xD;
      the classifications are reasonable in relation to the functional task of walking. Hypertonia&#xD;
      is an abnormal increase in muscle tension. It is a common symptom of cerebral palsy that can&#xD;
      lead to loss of function and deformity. This study may help scientists improve evaluation&#xD;
      criteria for hypertonia and, ultimately, treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cerebral palsy who are older than 6 years of age may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to walk in the lab while cameras record their movement. During this&#xD;
      test, subjects wear a t-shirt and shorts with their arms and legs wrapped with a soft,&#xD;
      rubber-like material. A piece of firm material is attached to the rubber sleeves and small&#xD;
      plastic reflective balls are attached to the firm material. Balls may also be attached to the&#xD;
      skin, using an adhesive. With the balls in place, the subject walks several times while&#xD;
      cameras record the positions of the balls. In addition, small metal electrodes attached to&#xD;
      the skin with an adhesive measure the electrical activity in the muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the walking test is completed, subjects' leg muscle strength is measured with a special&#xD;
      device while they perform three activities. First, they sit on a special chair with their leg&#xD;
      and foot placed in an apparatus that measures their strength, then lie on their back, then on&#xD;
      their stomach, and then stand on one foot holding a bar to balance during part of one&#xD;
      activity. During the activities, their reflexes are tested, they are asked to move their&#xD;
      legs, and their legs are moved for them.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) affects 0.25% of newborn babies in the U.S. alone each year. Hypertonia&#xD;
      (increased joint resistance to externally imposed motion) is a common symptom that limits&#xD;
      function in this patient population. It may originate in spasticity, dystonia or rigidity or&#xD;
      may be a combination of all these factors. Surgical, rehabilitation and pharmacotherapeutic&#xD;
      methods are used to improve functional outcome in patients with cerebral palsy. These&#xD;
      treatments are not always effective, and the amount of improvement is difficult to predict.&#xD;
      The choice of treatment is based on clinical tests that are not objective, especially in&#xD;
      children, and they do not allow for differentiation between various causes of increased joint&#xD;
      resistance. As a result, ineffective treatments are offered to patients with different types&#xD;
      of movement disorders. The complex torque devices used in research facilities to quantify the&#xD;
      resistance of a joint cannot be easily applied in clinical settings. In previous studies, a&#xD;
      portable measurement method was developed based on a hand-held force transducer, which&#xD;
      allowed for the quantification of biomechanical and bioelectrical characteristics of&#xD;
      resistance of a knee joint at different velocities. Using this method, we found different&#xD;
      types of hypertonia that had not been previously reported in patients with cerebral palsy. It&#xD;
      is not clear to what degree hypertonia restricts an ability to execute selected functional&#xD;
      tasks, due in part to the considerable variability in patients with CP. If this variability&#xD;
      could be decreased, the relationship between restricted ability and the different types of&#xD;
      hypertonia would be easier to determine. Strong arguments exist to consider different&#xD;
      pathophysiologies in these different types of hypertonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this non-invasive study is to sub-classify patients with CP based on the type of&#xD;
      knee hypertonia, and to determine if the classification is valid during the functional tasks&#xD;
      of walking. When validated, it can serve as a predictive model for the relationship between&#xD;
      the clinical evaluation at bedside and functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To classify hypertonia, the resistance of a knee joint at different velocities in knee&#xD;
      flexion and extension and the maximum activation of stretched and shortened muscles are&#xD;
      measured with a hand-held force transducer, an electrogoniometer, and surface electrodes in&#xD;
      100 patients with CP. The strength of velocity-dependent hypertonia during passive stretch&#xD;
      and position, and/or velocity thresholds will be calculated. The knee extension and flexion&#xD;
      muscles will be classified bilaterally as normal, or as one of the four types based on the&#xD;
      pattern of activation of stretched muscles. To determine the impact of other impairments on&#xD;
      the function, the maximum isometric knee flexion and extension strength and the monosynaptic&#xD;
      reflexes of the rectus femoris muscle will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the functional level, we will evaluate knee motion during walking. To determine the impact&#xD;
      of hypertonia on function, the Spearman R correlation will be used to analyze data in&#xD;
      patients within the same class. To determine if the classification holds during walking, the&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be calculated. The significance of differences will be&#xD;
      tested at the level of significance alpha less than or equal to 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that as a result of this study, better criteria for classifying patients into&#xD;
      predictable categories correlated to specific therapeutic responses will be established. In&#xD;
      the future, the improvement of differential diagnoses with quantitative methods will increase&#xD;
      the effectiveness of treatment by customizing the needs of each patient.&#xD;

&#xD;
        The patient must cease taking medications known to affect spasticity at least 48 hours&#xD;
        before the first investigation; however, if any antispasticity medication is longstanding&#xD;
