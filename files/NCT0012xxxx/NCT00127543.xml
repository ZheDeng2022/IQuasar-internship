  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if education about medicines directed toward children will&#xD;
      improve their knowledge. The investigators also want to know if this knowledge lasts over&#xD;
      time. Right now there are few medication instructional cards that are appropriate for&#xD;
      children. Most of the medication cards provide information for adults. Some studies have&#xD;
      shown that by teaching children directly, the children may take medicine at the right time&#xD;
      for the right reason, have fewer side effects and know more about their medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see if education about medication helps children&#xD;
      learn more about their medicine and if this knowledge lasts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2004, then Surgeon General Carmona stated that a health literate individual is more apt to&#xD;
      know the answer, when asked how to keep themselves well (AHRQ, 2004). There is a burgeoning&#xD;
      movement among medical professionals to address health literacy. Teaching health information&#xD;
      to children will empower them to actively participate in their current care and provide&#xD;
      self-management skills that will assist them to keep themselves well throughout their lives.&#xD;
      Currently, few medication administration instructional cards exist that are appropriate for&#xD;
      children. Providing medication information that the child might understand may result in&#xD;
      better administration compliance, fewer adverse effects and develop an individual that is&#xD;
      knowledgeable regarding medications and appropriate administration. The purpose if this&#xD;
      research is to develop medication administration cards, appropriate for children, which&#xD;
      provide information on the most commonly used drugs among the Hematology/Oncology population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this research is to develop medication informational cards for&#xD;
      medications frequently used within the Hematology/Oncology pediatric population, and evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of these cards, by means of a pre- and post-test.&#xD;
