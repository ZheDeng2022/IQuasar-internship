  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States (U.S.) there currently is no standard method of umbilical cord care,&#xD;
      resulting in varying practices within and across institutions. These differences may result&#xD;
      in an increase in morbidities for newborns such as the formation of umbilical granulomas and&#xD;
      increases in acute care utilization. This study will determine which of two common methods of&#xD;
      caring for newborn umbilical cords is superior - triple dye, followed by the application of&#xD;
      rubbing alcohol, or triple dye alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Infection of the umbilical cord of the newborn is a serious condition that can even lead to&#xD;
      infant death. It has been well documented that the sources of infection among infants in&#xD;
      hospitals is cross-contamination from other infants; S aureus is carried from infant to&#xD;
      infant by nursery caregivers. Current and accepted cord care practices include aseptic&#xD;
      techniques in cutting the umbilical cord, applying antimicrobial agents, hand washing, dry&#xD;
      cord care and rolling the diaper below the cord to enhance drying (Evens, et. al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been performed to identify the best cord care practice. Zupan, et. al&#xD;
      (2004) performed a meta-analysis of 21 studies that investigated cord care. Between all 21&#xD;
      studies many antimicrobial agents were used, including alcohol, triple dye, silver&#xD;
      sulfadiazine, zinc powder, chlorhexidine, and salicylic sugar powder, along with dry cord&#xD;
      care. It was identified that limited research has not shown a significant difference in&#xD;
      outcomes between antimicrobial agent use and simply keeping the cord clean and dry. In&#xD;
      high-income countries where mortality is low, important outcomes must include infections in&#xD;
      the first month of life, maternal satisfaction, and time to cord separation. At the current&#xD;
      time, there is no research that identifies the usefulness of applying colostrum, which has&#xD;
      bacteriostatic properties, to the umbilical cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective controlled trial was conducted by Golombek, S., et. al (2002) to compare only&#xD;
      cord separation times between infants treated with triple dye as compared to alcohol. Of the&#xD;
      634 patients enrolled, one infant in the triple dye group was diagnosed with omphalitis; and&#xD;
      one infant in the alcohol group was diagnosed with an ear infection. There was a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in cord separation time, with the alcohol group having a&#xD;
      shorter separation time by 3 days (alcohol group 10 days, versus triple dye group 13 days)&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.0001). Nursing staff reported more satisfaction with alcohol alone. Parents universally&#xD;
      expressed relief with cord separation in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Janssen, P., et al (2003) compared cord bacterial colonization and morbidity among newborns&#xD;
      whose cords were treated with triple dye and alcohol versus dry cord care. Seven hundred&#xD;
      sixty six infants were enrolled and randomized to a triple dye and alcohol group or a dry&#xD;
      cord care group. Study groups were similar in all respects. Significantly more mothers in the&#xD;
      dry care group stated that their infant's physician had mentioned concerns about infection to&#xD;
      them compared with none in the triple dye group. There were no differences in reported rates&#xD;
      of mothers contacting physicians in regard to concerns about infection. The most significant&#xD;
      difference of observations of community health nurses between the two groups was&#xD;
      periumbilical area exudates (p&lt; 0.001) and foul odor (p&lt;0.04) was more noticed in the dry&#xD;
      cord care group. Though only one infant in the entire study developed omphalitis, which was&#xD;
      in the dry cord care group, infants in the dry care group were significantly more likely to&#xD;
      be colonized by E. coli, coag-neg staph, S. aures, and group B strep. Topical antimicrobial&#xD;
      cord care may reduce bacterial colonization of the cord; there is no firm relationship&#xD;
      between colonization and infection. Parents have expressed apprehension about cleaning the&#xD;
      cord because of it's black appearance and brittle, rigid texture suggest that it will break&#xD;
      off or hurt the infant if touched. Though not reported in scientific literature, increasing&#xD;
      rates of breastfeeding may offer some protection to the newborn from infection. The study&#xD;
      suggests that omphalitis remains a clinical entity and that there is potential risk in&#xD;
      discontinuing bacteriocidal treatment of the umbilical cord stump. Cessation of bactericidal&#xD;
      care of the umbilical stump must be accompanied by vigilant attention and education of&#xD;
      parents to the signs and symptoms of omphalitis.&#xD;
