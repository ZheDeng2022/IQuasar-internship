  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States (US) and&#xD;
      Canada. Because of the high incidence and mortality of this disease, small improvements in&#xD;
      the management of this disease translates into large numbers of patients having improved&#xD;
      outcomes after treatment. Radiation therapy is widely used to treat patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer. However, the radiation dose to the tumor has been limited by the proximity of normal&#xD;
      structures to the tumor, such as the lung, the spinal cord and the esophagus. The normal&#xD;
      structures must not be exposed to excessive radiation doses. A new technique, called&#xD;
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy delivers radiation to tumors such that the normal structures&#xD;
      around the tumor are exposed to less radiation than previously achievable. This technique is&#xD;
      already used to treat head and neck cancers. This study will use this technique to deliver&#xD;
      more intensified radiation to the lung tumor after the patient receives two cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. A new imaging technique, called positron emission tomography (PET), has been&#xD;
      found to be more sensitive and specific at detecting the extent of the tumor in the lung than&#xD;
      the older imaging technique of computed tomography (CT). This study will use both the PET and&#xD;
      CT to target the radiation beams. Following treatment, the patients will be followed up to&#xD;
      assess the side effects of normal tissues and response of the tumor to the treatment.&#xD;

      Hypothesis and Objectives: The hypothesis that respiratory gated IMRT can escalate safely&#xD;
      radiation doses for NSCLC with induction chemotherapy will be tested. The intent of the study&#xD;
      is to determine the maximum tolerable dose of radiotherapy for NSCLC, using a novel treatment&#xD;
      planning technique with accelerated fractionation, given with state-of-the-art imaging&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of radiotherapy by assessing treatment toxicity&#xD;
           according to the acute RTOG grading scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the treatment toxicity of the combination regimen according to the chronic&#xD;
           RTOG grading scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life: to be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine progression-free survival with this regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify partial organ tolerance doses for lung, esophagus and heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schema and Methods: Eligible patients who have consented will receive two cycles of&#xD;
      cisplatin-vinorelbine chemotherapy. Thoracic radiotherapy will be given afterwards according&#xD;
      to the dose-escalating scale. Only one dose level will open at one time. Dose level 1: 84. Gy&#xD;
      in 35 fractions over 7 wks; Dose level 2: 79.5 Gy in 40 fractions over 6 wks; Dose level 3:&#xD;
      75. Gy in 40 fractions over 5 wks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically-proven, by biopsy or cytology, unresected NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with AJC Stage I-III if all detectable tumors can be encompassed by radiation&#xD;
           therapy fields&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with positive supraclavicular node (N3) or malignant pleural effusion are not&#xD;
           eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANC &gt; 1.5; Plt &gt; 100,000; Hct &gt; 30%; AST (SGOT) &lt; 1.5 ULN; serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable disease on the CT and PET images&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a FEV1 &gt; 1.0 L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy (V20) must be &lt; 30%; mean esophageal&#xD;
           dose must be &lt; 32 Gy; and the esophageal V 55 &lt; 28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a satisfactory IMRT plan prior to start of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: The frequency of patients developing unacceptable (grade 3 or higher)&#xD;
      toxicity according to the RTOG acute toxicity scale attributable to radiotherapy. Acute&#xD;
      radiotherapy toxicities are defined as those toxicities that occur within 90 days from the&#xD;
      start of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: In order to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy that can&#xD;
      be delivered using IMRT following induction chemotherapy, acceptable morbidity criteria must&#xD;
      be defined. Based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-10, the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT: defined as a grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity) rate for this study is&#xD;
      determined to be 40%. After 7 evaluable patients have been followed for a minimum of 90 days&#xD;
      from the start of radiation therapy, patients will be evaluated with respect to treatment&#xD;
      morbidity. If there are no acute dose limiting toxicities in the first 5 patients (0/5), then&#xD;
      the current dose will be deemed to be acceptable and will be escalated. If there is 1 acute&#xD;
      DLT observed in the first 5 patients (1/5) and no acute DLTs in the last two patients (0/2),&#xD;
      then the dose will be deemed to be acceptable and will be escalated. Otherwise the current&#xD;
      dose will be deemed to be too toxic and escalation will end. This design gives at least 90%&#xD;
      confidence that the true acute DLT rate at a given dose level is less than 40% and for any&#xD;
      given dose level, the probability of not escalating when the true toxicity rate is 40% or&#xD;
      higher is at least 88%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring and Stoppage Rules: An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life-threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is congenital anomaly/birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death&#xD;
           or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical&#xD;
           intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of SAEs is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete the Serious Adverse Event Report;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fax the Serious Adverse Event Report within 24 hours of the investigator's or designee's&#xD;
           knowledge of the event to the attention of: Dr. Wilson Roa (780) 432-8517 (tel);(780)&#xD;
           432-8380 (fax) and Dr. Don Yee (403) 944-2895 (tel);(403) 283-1651 (fax);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Accrual may be stopped immediately as indicated upon review and confirmation of the SAE&#xD;
           by the two PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Reporting: The projection rate of accrual was based on a previous preliminary&#xD;
      study. At this rate, it would take three months to complete accrual for each of the 3 dose&#xD;
      levels. A three-month waiting period is required prior to dose escalation to the next level.&#xD;
      Hence, an estimate of 7 months is conservatively allowed for each level, amounting to a total&#xD;
      of 21 months to complete accrual, treatments and waiting period for the primary endpoint. The&#xD;
      first manuscript on this study will be completed by the end of two years. Analysis for the&#xD;
      reporting treatment results will contain tabulation of all cases entered and any excluded&#xD;
      from analysis, with reasons for the exclusion. Respective institutional accrual and observed&#xD;
      endpoints of MTD, toxicity, progression-free survival and quality of life will be analyzed.&#xD;
