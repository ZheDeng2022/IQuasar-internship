  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of Migraid in terms of preventing&#xD;
      headaches in patients with migraine with typical aura. The secondary objectives were to&#xD;
      assess whether Migraid is able to achieve pain relief and/or relief of migraine associated&#xD;
      symptoms and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraid is to be used only once during the aura phase of a migraine attack for a duration of&#xD;
      60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference therapy: No treatment. This means that at random the patient will be allocated to&#xD;
      either of the two treatment orders; the first treatment order is to use the Migraid whenever&#xD;
      a migraine attack with an aura occurs. During the next migraine attack the Migraid will not&#xD;
      be used and vice versa for the other group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete diary cards to record details for each of the two migraine&#xD;
      attacks and the severity of the migraine headache at certain points in time: at t = 30&#xD;
      minutes, t = 60 minutes, t= 90 minutes, t =120 minutes, t =150 minutes, t =180 minutes and t&#xD;
      = 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, associated symptoms will be asked for. Rescue medication data including name, time&#xD;
      taken and amount will also be registered in the diary card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all primary and secondary variables of efficacy, the following definitions will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade or score: Pain level: Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      0: None - No pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild - A headache with no remarkable pain that does not hinder you in performing your&#xD;
           usual daily activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate - A headache with pain that hinders you in performing your usual daily&#xD;
           activities, but that does necessitate you to go to bed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe - A headache with pain that necessitates you to go to or stay in bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associated symptoms will be graded as either present or absent. These symptoms are&#xD;
      defined to conform to the following table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom: Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea: Sick to the stomach/feel like throwing up; Vomiting: Throwing up or puking;&#xD;
      Photophobia: Light bothers or hurts the eyes; Phonophobia: Noise bothers or hurts the ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A migraine attack is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      New onset of migraine pain, preceded by a pain-free period of at least 24-hours duration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients are male or female. N.B. When female patients are treated for migraine&#xD;
