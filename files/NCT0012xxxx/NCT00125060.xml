  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to investigate the ability of an experimental imaging method -&#xD;
      transesophageal magnetic resonance imaging (TEMRI), to detect the change in aortic&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque burden and morphology between patients on high dose cholesterol&#xD;
      lowering medications and patients on standard dose cholesterol lowering medications. This&#xD;
      study will use TEMRI to see how atherosclerosis (cholesterol build up) changes with&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering medications. This study will also investigate whether these&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering medications will change levels of blood tests, called inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, in patients' blood. People with atherosclerosis may join this study. This study will&#xD;
      also store blood samples for future studies of cardiac diseases; no gene testing will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;

      Using a new MRI coil developed by Hopkins researchers, the investigators are now able to&#xD;
      image aortic atherosclerotic plaques in exquisite detail. This coil is placed into the&#xD;
      esophagus via a small nasogastric tube and positioned next to the descending thoracic aorta.&#xD;
      Using this method of transesophageal MRI (TEMRI), the investigators are able not only to&#xD;
      measure the extent of aortic atherosclerosis and the size of individual plaques, but they can&#xD;
      now image in such detail as to obtain information about plaque composition. The extent of&#xD;
      aortic atherosclerosis has been correlated with cardiovascular events including heart attack&#xD;
      and stroke. The investigators now propose to use this new imaging technique to study the&#xD;
      effect of aggressive lipid lowering measures on patients with aortic atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They plan to randomize patients with documented vascular disease to high dose (simvastatin&#xD;
      80mg) versus low dose (simvastatin 20mg) cholesterol lowering medications. The investigators&#xD;
      expect to show a decrease in the extent of atherosclerosis, a change in plaque morphology and&#xD;
      composition, and perhaps a decrease in cardiovascular events in the aggressive care group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They also plan to measure serum markers of inflammation in these patients at baseline and&#xD;
      after therapy. C-reactive protein is the most studied of the markers that are independently&#xD;
      correlated with cardiovascular events. The investigators hope to show that TEMRI correlates&#xD;
      higher levels of C-reactive protein with more baseline atherosclerosis, and that treatment&#xD;
      with high dose statin therapy reduces levels of inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally they plan to store plasma collected on these patients to save for future studies of&#xD;
      cardiac markers, which could then be correlated with the effect of statin therapy and the&#xD;
      reduction in aortic atherosclerosis as documented by TEMRI.&#xD;
