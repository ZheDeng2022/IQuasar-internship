    <textblock>
      Currently in Canada, and at the Cross Cancer Institute, the treatment of many women with&#xD;
      breast cancer involves radiotherapy (RT). There is a complex process which takes place in&#xD;
      order to plan the radiation therapy before patients commence their treatment. In many&#xD;
      circumstances the investigators use computerized technology to assist in planning their&#xD;
      treatment. This allows more precision in delivering the treatment to the desired areas and&#xD;
      avoiding areas of normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the planning process is completed, the investigators then place marks with a marker pen&#xD;
      on the skin of the patient to outline the area where the radiation will be delivered. The&#xD;
      investigators confirm that the correct area is being treated with an x-ray taken on the&#xD;
      treatment unit while the patient is in the treatment position. This is called a port film or&#xD;
      verification film. The investigators then compare this to what they set up with the&#xD;
      computerized data. If all the information matches, the patient is then treated for the full&#xD;
      course of radiation, with the assumption that all treatments are given in the correct&#xD;
      position. No further routine checking is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard at some radiotherapy centers is that the patient treatment position is verified&#xD;
      weekly by a portal film. At the Cross Cancer Institute the investigators normally only do it&#xD;
      once at the beginning of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No information is available to confirm the necessity of doing more frequent verification&#xD;
      films, but in view of the very complex nature of the investigators' treatment delivery, it&#xD;
      may be necessary to confirm the accuracy of their treatment more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of a 4-5 week treatment the investigators know that some patients may lose&#xD;
      weight, some become more relaxed after a few days, and some have trouble with the movement in&#xD;
      their shoulders; all of these factors influence the positioning of the patient. Measurements&#xD;
      taken on the treatment unit often change during the course of a patient's treatment, but no&#xD;
      further verification is performed to ensure that the treated area is still what was initially&#xD;
      intended. It is important from a quality assurance standpoint to see if more frequent&#xD;
      checking of the radiation treatment set-up is indicated.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the verification film (port film) taken and accepted as correct at the&#xD;
      beginning of a course of radiotherapy is adequate to ensure accurate position of treatment&#xD;
      delivery for a 4-5 week course of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility of doing on line portal imaging for breast cancer radiotherapy&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To possibly identify a patient population that should be verified daily with on line&#xD;
           portal imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance is a very important aspect of radiotherapy delivery. There are many facets&#xD;
      of quality assurance but a basic concept is to ensure the radiation is delivered to the&#xD;
      correct target area. At the start of a course of radiotherapy treatment the standard at the&#xD;
      Cross Cancer Institute is to confirm the correct area is being treated. This is done by&#xD;
      taking an x-ray on the treatment unit with the patient in the treatment position (portal&#xD;
      image or verification film). This portal image is examined by the treating oncologist and&#xD;
      compared to the simulation film or a digitally reconstructed radiograph that was generated&#xD;
      when the patient was simulated (set up) for radiotherapy treatment. Some alterations may be&#xD;
      suggested by the oncologist but once a portal film is deemed to reflect the original set-up -&#xD;
      no more routine verifications are performed. It is assumed that the treatment set-up will be&#xD;
      accurate for the remainder or the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous changes may occur when a patient undergoes a 4-5 week course of RT. The patient may&#xD;
      relax after a few treatments, a patient can lose weight, surgical changes can settle, all&#xD;
      altering the original set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no data to determine how often a set up should be verified. Ideally it should be&#xD;
      checked daily prior to each treatment initiation. This can be done with on line portal&#xD;
      imaging however resources currently do not allow on line portal imaging for every patient. By&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of weekly portal images the investigators may be able to identify a&#xD;
      population of patients that would benefit from more frequent portal images or patients who&#xD;
      would benefit from daily on line portal images, allowing for appropriate resource allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently in Canada, and at the Cross Cancer Institute, the treatment of many women with&#xD;
      breast cancer involves radiotherapy. There is a complex process which takes place in order to&#xD;
      plan the radiation therapy before patients commence their treatment. In many circumstances&#xD;
      the investigators use computerized technology to assist in planning their treatment. This&#xD;
      allows more precision in delivering the treatment to the desired areas and avoiding areas of&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the planning process is completed, the investigators then place marks with a marker pen&#xD;
      on the skin of the patient to outline the area where the radiation will be delivered. The&#xD;
      investigators confirm that the correct area is being treated with an x-ray taken on the&#xD;
      treatment unit while in the treatment position. This is called a port film or verification&#xD;
      film. The investigators then compare this to what they set up with the computerized data. If&#xD;
      all the information matches, the patient is then treated for the full course of radiation,&#xD;
      with the assumption that all treatments are given in the correct position. No further&#xD;
      checking is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard at some radiotherapy centers is that the patient treatment position is verified&#xD;
      weekly by a portal film. At the Cross Cancer Institute the investigators only do it once at&#xD;
      the beginning of treatment.&#xD;

      films, but in view of the very complex nature of the investigators' treatment delivery, it&#xD;
      may be necessary to confirm the accuracy of their treatment more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of a 4-5 week treatment the investigators know that some patients may lose&#xD;
      weight, some become more relaxed after a few days, and some have trouble with the range of&#xD;
      movement in their shoulders; all of these factors influence the positioning of the patient.&#xD;
      Measurements taken on the treatment unit often change during the course of a patients&#xD;
      treatment, but no further verification is performed to ensure that the treated area is still&#xD;
      what was initially intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institute pilot project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT CRITERIA/SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any breast cancer patients receiving a course of radiotherapy to treat the breast, chest wall&#xD;
      and/or regional lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-hundred consecutive consenting patients will be analyzed prospectively. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified as per treatment area: breast only, breast plus regional nodes, chest wall only&#xD;
      and chest wall plus regional nodes. The treatment technique will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible and consenting will be sequentially selected to undergo the standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy planning process and initial verification films. In addition to the standard&#xD;
      initial verification films, all patients will have additional verification films taken&#xD;
      weekly. These will be reviewed by the treating radiation oncologist and a data form will be&#xD;
      completed. The treatment record will also be examined and any changes noted by the therapists&#xD;
      during the course of radiotherapy will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional amount of radiation is given to the patient. The amount of radiation required&#xD;
      to take the verification films is subtracted from the amount of radiation delivered at the&#xD;
      time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be compiled and compared to establish any relationship between target volume&#xD;
      (breast only, breast plus regional nodes, chest wall only and chest wall plus regional nodes)&#xD;
      or technique used to the acceptability rate and accuracy of the verification films.&#xD;
