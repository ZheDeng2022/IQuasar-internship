  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess whether a new technique called facilitated endoscopic&#xD;
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is or is not superior to conventional ERCP for&#xD;
      removing stones found in the bile duct at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ERCP is&#xD;
      an endoscopic procedure used to facilitate the radiological examination and subsequent&#xD;
      manipulation of the common bile duct (eg. opening it up, which is called sphincterotomy).&#xD;
      Both facilitated and conventional ERCP are performed as a separate procedure after the&#xD;
      initial gallbladder surgery. This is a comparative study of these two techniques in a&#xD;
      randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomised clinical trial is to enable surgeons to decide whether placement&#xD;
      of a plastic stent at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy will improve the success rate&#xD;
      and safety of subsequent ERCP and sphincterotomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic gallstone disease is common. In the year July 2001-2002, laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy was performed on 5,235 patients in NSW public hospitals. Up to 18% of&#xD;
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones may have concomitant common&#xD;
      bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis). Twenty-five percent of bile duct stones are&#xD;
      completely unsuspected. Therefore the optimal management of bile duct stones is a significant&#xD;
      issue for all general surgeons who perform this very common operation. Yet, the management of&#xD;
      these patients in the laparoscopic era remains contentious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the laparoscopic era cholecystectomy patients with bile duct stones were managed&#xD;
      surgically during open cholecystectomy (OC), with direct exploration of their common bile&#xD;
      duct (choledochotomy). However, open surgical bile duct exploration waned in popularity and&#xD;
      progressively stones were dealt with endoscopically, either pre or post cholecystectomy. As&#xD;
      laparoscopic technology advances, simultaneous clearance of the bile duct at the time of&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy is regaining popularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some surgeons elect to remove bile duct stones at the index operation through the cystic&#xD;
      duct. This approach has a success rate of between 75 and 90%. When there is failure to clear&#xD;
      the bile duct transcystically, some surgeons proceed to a choledochotomy to clear the duct,&#xD;
      while others close the cystic duct stump, leaving the stones in situ to be removed at a later&#xD;
      date by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincterotomy. The&#xD;
      argument in favour of immediate choledochotomy is that the duct may be cleared in one&#xD;
      sitting. The argument against it is that the morbidity of choledochotomy is considerable. The&#xD;
      argument for a subsequent ERCP is that the morbidity of choledochotomy is avoided. The&#xD;
      argument against subsequent ERCP is that there may be difficulty cannulating the common bile&#xD;
      duct and that ERCP with sphincterotomy is associated with a significant morbidity,&#xD;
      particularly pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach taken by the majority of surgeons in NSW when confronted by common&#xD;
      bile duct stones at laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to close the cystic duct stump in all&#xD;
      patients, without exploring the duct transcystically. Stones are left in situ, to be removed&#xD;
      at a later date endoscopically - by ERCP and sphincterotomy. The attendant risks of this&#xD;
      approach are mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another approach is to facilitate the performance of post-operative ERCP and sphincterotomy&#xD;
      by inserting a stent transcystically at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Facilitated&#xD;
      ERCP has recently been reported in a prospective consecutive series from Nepean Hospital.&#xD;
      Failure to access the common bile duct at first attempt was 1.2% in this series, which&#xD;
      compares favourably with duct access failure rates - reported in the literature - of 5-12%&#xD;
      without the facilitation of a stent. The incidence of pancreatitis, bleeding and duodenal&#xD;
      perforation after facilitated ERCP was 0%, 0% and 0.6%, respectively. Two cases (1.2%) of&#xD;
      cholangitis were also reported. Comparison to other series suggests that facilitated ERCP&#xD;
      offers real advantages over the conventional unfacilitated ERCP for bile duct stone removal,&#xD;
      which has a reported pancreatitis rate of 2-11% (and our own rate of 8%); a bleeding rate of&#xD;
      2-4 % and a duodenal perforation rate of 1-4%. The mortality rates of these ERCP techniques&#xD;
      cannot be compared at this preliminary stage because of insufficient numbers in the Nepean&#xD;
      series.&#xD;
