    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial conducted in Rakai District, Uganda, has enrolled 997 HIV&#xD;
      positive men and 500 men who declined to learn HIV results (regardless of HIV status). The&#xD;
      hypotheses are that male circumcision will be acceptable to and safe in both groups and will&#xD;
      reduce the rates of STD acquisition in both groups and of HIV acquisition in HIV-negative&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment was ended on Dec 12, 2006, following an interim Data Monitoring and Safety Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) review of a closed report. At that time the DSMB determined that futility with respect&#xD;
      to the female HIV outcome. There was an non-significantly higher rate of HIV acquisition in&#xD;
      women partners of HIV+ men in couples who had resumed sex prior to certified post-surgical&#xD;
      wound healing. The data indicated significant reductions (~50%) in GUD symptoms among&#xD;
      circumcised HIV+ men. The DSMB recommended: 1) that men and women should continue to be&#xD;
      followed in complete two year follow up on all, 2) that circumcision for remaining HIV+&#xD;
      intervention arm men and for control arm men who had completed their 2 year follow should&#xD;
      continue, contingent on a) revision of the study protocol to add additional post-surgical&#xD;
      visits to assess wound healing, b) protocol revision to further strengthen education for both&#xD;
      male and female partners on the need to postpone sex until certified wound healing, and c)&#xD;
      approval of the revised protocol by the IRBs in both the US and Uganda. 3) An additional&#xD;
      follow up visit for women be instituted at 18 months after enrollment. Protocol revision and&#xD;
      IRB approvals have been finalized in June, 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has also enrolled and is following 3,700 women sexual partners of men enrolled in&#xD;
      this study and in a complementary National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded study (U1&#xD;
      AI51171 which is separately registered). The hypotheses are that male circumcision will be&#xD;
      acceptable to and safe in women partners, and will reduce the women's acquisition of HIV and&#xD;
      STDs such as herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and human papillomavirus (HPV).&#xD;

      STUDY DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being carried out by the Rakai Health Sciences Program, a research collaboration&#xD;
      between the Uganda Virus Research Institute/Uganda Ministry of Health, Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Bloomberg School of Public Health and researchers from Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study, being conducted in Rakai District, Uganda, has enrolled 997 HIV+ and&#xD;
           following a detailed informed consent process, randomizing them to receive either&#xD;
           immediate (within several days or weeks) or delayed (two years) circumcision. The goals&#xD;
           are to assess the safety and acceptability of male circumcision among HIV+ men, and to&#xD;
           assess potential effects of male circumcision on the acquisition of STDs such as HSV-2.&#xD;
           Hypotheses are that male circumcision will be acceptable to and safe in HIV+ men, will&#xD;
           reduce the rate of acquisition of STDs, and will reduce the frequency of STD symptoms,&#xD;
           such as genital ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study has also enrolled 500 men who, regardless of their HIV status, decline to&#xD;
           receive their HIV results, despite encouragement to do so. Hypotheses are that&#xD;
           circumcision will be acceptable and safe in men who decline their HIV results, and will&#xD;
           reduce the rate of acquisition of HIV and STDs, and the frequency of STD symptoms such&#xD;
           as genital ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study has enrolled 3,700 female partners of the men in groups 1 and 2 above, as well&#xD;
           as of 5,000 HIV-negative men enrolled in a complementary NIH-funded study of male&#xD;
           circumcision for HIV prevention (U1 AI51171 which is being separately registered).&#xD;
           Following informed consent, the women partners are being followed annually to assess the&#xD;
           acceptability and safety of male circumcision in female partners, and potential effects&#xD;
           of male circumcision on HIV and STD acquisition. The hypotheses are that male&#xD;
           circumcision will be acceptable to and safe in women partners, and will reduce the&#xD;
           acquisition of HIV and STDs such as HSV-2 and HPV (human papilloma virus which causes&#xD;
           cervical cancer.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, the study is also following ~3,000 men and women in the ~50 communities where&#xD;
           the circumcision trials are taking place, in order to assess community attitudes towards&#xD;
           and knowledge of male circumcision, and to assess whether other preventive behaviors&#xD;
           (abstinence, monogamy, numbers of partners, condom use, etc...) change in the community&#xD;
           once circumcision becomes available. The hypothesis is that male circumcision will be&#xD;
           acceptable in the community and will not result in behavioral disinhibition (increased&#xD;
           rates of high risk behaviors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gates-funded study being registered here is complementary to a separate NIH-funded trial&#xD;
      of male circumcision in HIV-negative men who accept their HIV results, being carried out by&#xD;
      the Rakai Health Sciences Program study team. The latter study, which is enrolling 5000&#xD;
      HIV-negative men, is designed to answer whether male circumcision is acceptable and safe in&#xD;
      HIV-neg men, and whether the procedure reduces the acquisition of HIV and STDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complementary Gates-funded trial is designed to answer the following additional&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is male circumcision acceptable to and safe in HIV-infected men, and will it reduce the&#xD;
           rates of acquisition of STDs in these men?&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questions are of great importance for future circumcision programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will such programs need to screen out HIV+ men (if circumcision is shown to be unsafe in&#xD;
           such men, potentially as a result of delayed healing) or should future programs include&#xD;
           HIV+ men, if the procedure is safe in them, and has potential benefits such as reduced&#xD;
           STD acquisition, improved genital hygiene and reduced rates of STD symptomatology?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is male circumcision acceptable and safe in men who decline their HIV results, and will&#xD;
           it reduce rates of acquisition of HIV and STDS in these men?&#xD;
&#xD;
      From prior Rakai Program data, the researchers know that men who decline their HIV results&#xD;
      tend to have higher risk behaviors. Determining potential circumcision risks in these men&#xD;
      (such as, potentially delayed healing because of their higher risk behaviors) or benefits&#xD;
      (such as potentially, reduced rates of HIV and STD acquisition) is thus very important for&#xD;
      the design of any future large scale circumcision programs. From the public health viewpoint,&#xD;
      it will be important to know whether such programs should include or exclude men who decline&#xD;
      HIV results. (Please note: the Rakai Program strongly recommends and encourages the receipt&#xD;
      of HIV results, and provides the results confidentially and free of charge. The great&#xD;
      majority of Rakai Program research participants (85-90%) accept their HIV results, but a&#xD;
      minority continue to decline, although the latter group is getting smaller every year. In&#xD;
      addition, please also note that even if participants decline their HIV results, the Rakai&#xD;
      Program still provides them with detailed HIV prevention education and counseling.)&#xD;
      Enrollment of men who decline their HIV results is also congruent with Ugandan Ministry of&#xD;
      Health Policy, which encourages but does not force individuals and study participants to&#xD;
      receive their HIV results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of female partners is designed to answer important questions regarding potential&#xD;
      effects of male circumcision on women. Should male circumcision reduce HIV and STD&#xD;
      acquisition in women, this would represent an additional important public health benefit of&#xD;
      the procedure and would add to the cost effectiveness of male circumcision programs. However,&#xD;
      if the procedure is associated with increased HIV transmission (for example, due to increased&#xD;
      transmission before a circumcision surgical would is fully healed), it is crucial that such a&#xD;
      potential risk be identified rapidly within a trial, in order to prevent the risk within&#xD;
      trials and in any potential future circumcision programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment, men in the circumcision arm are followed post-operatively at weekly&#xD;
      intervals until wound healing is fully certified, , at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24&#xD;
      months. Men in the control arm are followed at 4-6 weeks and 6, 12 and 24 months. At baseline&#xD;
      and follow up, men respond to a detailed sociodemographic, behavioral and health&#xD;
      questionnaire, and provide biological samples (venous blood, urine, sub-preputial swabs&#xD;
      [prior to circumcision] and for circumcised men, foreskins are collected at time of surgery.)&#xD;
      Samples will allow assessment of multiple infections, including HIV, HSV-2, gonorrhea,&#xD;
      chlamydia and syphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women partners are followed annually, through the Rakai Community Cohort Study. Following&#xD;
      written informed consent, women are administered a detailed sociodemographic, behavioral and&#xD;
      health status questionnaire, and provide venous blood and self-administered vaginal swabs at&#xD;
      baseline and study follow up visits. The samples will allow assessment of multiple infections&#xD;
      and conditions, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, bacterial&#xD;
      vaginosis, HSV-2 and HPV. Women partners of HIV+ men receive additional visita at 6 and 18&#xD;
      months post enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community members (men not in the trials, and women who are not partners of men in the&#xD;
      trials) are followed annually through the Rakai Community Cohort Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Services offered by the Rakai Program to all study participants include HIV and STD&#xD;
      prevention education (information on behavioral risk factors and on abstinence, monogamy,&#xD;
      being faithful and condom use), free condoms, free HIV counseling and testing for individuals&#xD;
      and couples, free STD treatment, access to Rakai Program clinics for general health care,&#xD;
      access to Rakai clinics for free HIV antiretroviral (ARV) drug screening and services,&#xD;
      prophylaxis for opportunistic infections and nevirapine services for the prevention of&#xD;
      mother-to-child HIV transmission. Please note: residents in the 50 villages where the&#xD;
      circumcision trials are being conducted have access to Rakai clinics and ARV services whether&#xD;
      or not they consent to be in Rakai studies, in order to avoid undue pressure to participate.&#xD;
