  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a powerful central nervous system depressant. The number of&#xD;
      individuals seeking treatment for GHB abuse has been steadily increasing in the United&#xD;
      States. Currently, lorazepam and pentobarbital are two medications used to treat individuals&#xD;
      who experience GHB-withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study is to describe the signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of GHB withdrawal and to identify predictors of withdrawal severity. The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment with lorazepam versus&#xD;
      pentobarbital for GHB detoxification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GHB and GHB precursors such as 1,4-butanediol and gamma-butylrolactone (GBL) have become&#xD;
      popular drugs of abuse. In cases of severe withdrawal, delirium, confusion, hallucinations,&#xD;
      and agitation can occur. There has been a sharp rise in the number of GHB related emergency&#xD;
      room visits over the past few years, yet little is known about the effective treatment of GHB&#xD;
      withdrawal and dependence. The purpose of this study is to describe the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      GHB withdrawal, identify predictors of withdrawal severity, and evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment for GHB detoxification. There will be compensation for screening&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes two phases. The open-label Phase 1 will aim to determine the safety of&#xD;
      lorazepam for the treatment of mild GHB withdrawal. Participants who progress into moderate&#xD;
      or severe withdrawal will enter the controlled Phase 2. In Phase 2, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam or pentobarbital in order to determine which&#xD;
      drug is more effective in treating GHB withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 1 to 2 outpatient screening visits, followed by up to 15 days of&#xD;
      inpatient detoxification treatment and assessment. After hospital discharge from inpatient&#xD;
      treatment, measures of protracted GHB withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms will be obtained on&#xD;
      an outpatient weekly basis for 8 weeks. Repeat measures of cognitive functioning will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline, termination of treatment, and at 30, 60, and 90-day follow-up intervals&#xD;
      in order to assess long-term neurocognitive effects of GHB withdrawal and use.&#xD;
