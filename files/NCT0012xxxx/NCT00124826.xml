  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) affects 40% of acute stroke patients and has a major&#xD;
      adverse effect on survival and recovery. Increased production of lactic acid in brain tissue&#xD;
      that has a poor blood supply is postulated to be the mechanism by which high blood sugar may&#xD;
      worsen brain injury after stroke. Treatment with insulin infusions is proposed as a&#xD;
      neuroprotective strategy, and a clinical trial is ongoing to test this hypothesis. However,&#xD;
      the biological basis for insulin treatment has not been established, and there is uncertainty&#xD;
      about the duration of insulin infusion that may be required to limit damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a brain scanning technique that allows measurement&#xD;
      of brain lactic acid. When performed in conjunction with conventional MRI scanning, the&#xD;
      relationship of lactate accumulation to stroke expansion can be established. SELESTIAL is a&#xD;
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial of insulin infusions of 24 or 72 hours (h) duration in&#xD;
      acute stroke patients with hyperglycaemia, to establish whether insulin prevents lactate&#xD;
      accumulation over the initial 72h after stroke, how this relates to stroke evolution, and the&#xD;
      effect of treatment on stroke size and clinical outcomes at 1 week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycaemia is present in 40-60% of patients with acute ischaemic stroke and adversely&#xD;
      affects survival and outcome. This effect is independent of stroke severity or pathology, and&#xD;
      is most striking in patients without recognised diabetes, in whom the odds of death are&#xD;
      increased threefold, and the chance of poor functional outcome by 40%. Hyperglycaemia remains&#xD;
      a powerful independent predictor of outcome even in the face of thrombolytic drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse effect of hyperglycaemia is hypothesised to be consequent to increased provision&#xD;
      of substrate to hypoperfused tissue that is metabolising anaerobically, with resultant tissue&#xD;
      accumulation of neurotoxic lactic acid. In animal models of stroke, hyperglycaemia causes&#xD;
      increased tissue lactic acidosis and increased recruitment of ischaemic tissue in the&#xD;
      peri-infarct region into the final infarct. Infarct volumes are higher in hyperglycaemic&#xD;
      animals, and conversely, reducing blood glucose reduces infarct volume. Although clinical&#xD;
      observational studies suggest protocols that incorporate blood glucose monitoring and control&#xD;
      to be beneficial, and trials are ongoing to define the impact of routine treatment to&#xD;
      maintain euglycaemia, the basic pathophysiology of stroke in relation to blood glucose has&#xD;
      not been well defined in man. Preliminary studies confirm a relationship between blood&#xD;
      glucose and lactate concentration in hypoperfused brain tissue but it is unknown whether&#xD;
      brain lactate is reduced by control of blood glucose, and whether doing so will impact on&#xD;
      stroke evolution. It has also been found that infarct volume increases more in hyperglycaemic&#xD;
      patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI permits non-invasive and serial study of acute stroke pathophysiology. In addition to&#xD;
      brain structure, MRI can define tissue viability (cytotoxic oedema seen on diffusion-weighted&#xD;
      imaging, DWI), brain perfusion (bolus-tracking perfusion imaging, PI), vascular integrity (MR&#xD;
      angiography, MRA) and tissue metabolism (1H MR spectroscopy, MRS). In acute middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery (MCA) occlusion, evolution of cerebral damage has been defined with these techniques.&#xD;
      The volume of hypoperfused tissue on PI initially exceeds the DWI lesion, and, over time, the&#xD;
      DWI lesion expands to finally incorporate the majority of the PI lesion. The region of tissue&#xD;
      with normal DWI but abnormal PI is thought to correspond to the &quot;ischaemic penumbra&quot;, the&#xD;
      region where hypoperfusion causes electrical failure of neurones with progression to&#xD;
      infarction over time due to adverse metabolic and neurochemical events. The fate of the&#xD;
      penumbra may be determined by treatment - e.g. it is salvaged by thrombolysis - and it is&#xD;
      this penumbral region that is vulnerable to hyperglycaemia-related lactic acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose lowering with insulin is an inexpensive, and widely applicable treatment. However,&#xD;
      current clinical trials are compromised by uncertainty over the ability of treatment to&#xD;
      influence pathophysiology, and have necessarily relied upon a &quot;best guess&quot; for treatment&#xD;
      duration. Definition of the biological basis for insulin treatment by MRI criteria and&#xD;
      comparative data for different treatment durations would strengthen and inform any positive&#xD;
      effect from clinical trials, or prevent premature abandonment of this therapeutic modality&#xD;
      should trials be neutral.&#xD;
