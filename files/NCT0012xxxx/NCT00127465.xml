      Objective: To explore the hypothesis that different methods of selecting and printing&#xD;
      information for cancer patients could improve emotional support by affecting interaction with&#xD;
      others, and so lead to improved psychological wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomised trial with 8 groups (three factors, 2X2X2). Data collected at recruitment&#xD;
      and three month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 400 patients starting radiotherapy and their 'confidant' (the person in who&#xD;
      they confide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Printed booklets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Half had 'general' CancerBACUP information for that cancer; half had 'personal'&#xD;
           information from the medical record plus selected general information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Half chose information by 'interacting' with the computer; half had a larger volume of&#xD;
           material in booklets that were produced 'automatically'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Half had additional 'anxiety management advice'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Patients' views; use of booklet with others; change in reported social support;&#xD;
      change in anxiety and depression.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on a randomised trial the researchers aimed to model use of leaflets in the home&#xD;
           as a function of three factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. whether patients chose the information themselves or if it was chosen for them;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. whether it included personal information from their own medical record or not;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. whether it included anxiety management advice or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researchers aimed to model patient and confidant's anxiety at three months as a&#xD;
           function of these three factors and patients' use of leaflets in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Beatson Oncology Centre (BOC). Patients thought to be eligible were to be&#xD;
      identified from outpatient appointment diaries over fifteen months. Medical records were to&#xD;
      be checked for all those initially identified to ensure that patients have breast,&#xD;
      gynaecological, prostate or bladder or testicular, or selected cancers of the head or neck.&#xD;
      Patients excluded were to be those:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receiving palliative treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with no knowledge or understanding of their diagnosis (very few),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with visual or mental handicap,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with severe pain or symptoms causing distress,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical or nursing students,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  taking part in other trials with possibly confounding interventions, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  those not giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The researchers aimed to recruit 400 patients. This was to give 80% power to&#xD;
      find a difference between 40% and 27% who have improved anxiety between (eg) 200 in&#xD;
      personalised group and 200 in general group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Eligible patients were to be sent a letter explaining the study and advising&#xD;
      them that a researcher will approach them in a visit to the BOC soon after, to seek&#xD;
      participation in the study. Patients were not to be recruited at their bad news consultation&#xD;
      but as soon as possible thereafter and at any point in their course of contact and treatment&#xD;
      at the Beatson. At recruitment the researcher was to further explain the study and seek&#xD;
      written consent. If the patient consented the researcher was to arrange a time for the&#xD;
      intervention and give the patient a questionnaire to take home to complete themselves and a&#xD;
      questionnaire for their 'confidant'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data: Patients were to be asked to bring the completed questionnaire with them to&#xD;
      the intervention consultation about one week later. The questionnaire included the following&#xD;
      sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. previous computer and information use, perceived knowledge, significant others in&#xD;
           providing emotional support, family and living arrangements,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a Miller Coping Style questionnaire,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Helgeson's measures of social support and negative interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of this questionnaire should have taken about half an hour at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidants: The researchers aimed to recruit 400 'confidants', one for each patient (but&#xD;
      estimated that it were more likely to recruit (say) 60% of 400. Patients were to be asked if&#xD;
      they were prepared to pass on the baseline questionnaire to a person selected by them as the&#xD;
      person they are most likely to use to seek emotional support. This may be a husband, wife,&#xD;
      partner, but may also be a daughter, son, or friend. The confidant questionnaire has&#xD;
      sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. demographics and relationship to patient, newspaper read, frequency of discussion with&#xD;
           patient, perceived knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HADS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Miller coping style.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers did not know what proportion of patients would be prepared to pass on the&#xD;
      questionnaire or what response rate would be received from confidants. Rees in her work with&#xD;
      daughters of women with breast cancer found that 93% of patients passed the questionnaires on&#xD;
      and 77% of daughters responded. If we got an overall 60% response (ie 240 before and after&#xD;
      questionnaires) this would give us 80% power to find a difference between 40% and 23% who had&#xD;
      improved anxiety between (eg) 120 in personalised group vs 120 in general group. The&#xD;
      confidant population would be less than the patient population. Patients will not be excluded&#xD;
      if there is no corresponding 'confidant'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation for the three factors: After recruitment the RA was to randomise for each of&#xD;
      the three binary factors (2X2X2 factorial design):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Interactive v Automatic;&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Medical Record v General;&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Anxiety reducing advice v no advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were to randomised to the eight sub-groups in blocks of 32 and separately by breast&#xD;
      vs rest. The eight (2X2X2) subgroups, each receive different styles of leaflet. These are&#xD;
      detailed further below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data: Collected from case notes was to be severity, length of onset of cancer,&#xD;
      treatments so far (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), date of birth, gender, address,&#xD;
      deprivation category from postcode for all patients, and a problem and treatment list for&#xD;
      patients in the 'medical record' groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The delay between recruitment and intervention was to allow patients time to&#xD;
      think about their participation and withdraw if desired. At the intervention, patients were&#xD;
      to produce a report about their cancer. Patients in the 'automatic group' would not need to&#xD;
      use the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interactive vs automatic. Those in the 'interactive' groups were to choose from menus,&#xD;
           see information on the screen, and press an 'add to report' button on information&#xD;
           screens for that information which they want to include in their report. Patients'&#xD;
           choices were to be recorded by the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those in the medical records group were to have personal information included based on&#xD;
           their medical record. They were to either have information automatically selected and&#xD;
           formatted by the computer, or to see it on screen and choose what they want to include.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lastly, half the patients were to have an additional section offering advice for the&#xD;
           reduction of anxiety. This section was written based on previous work in cognitive&#xD;
           behavioural therapy for anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reports were to include colour photos (for example of treatment rooms, staff), and&#xD;
      diagrams (for example, anatomical) of good quality printing etc. The patient were to be given&#xD;
      the report to take away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three month follow-up: At three months patients were to be sent a follow-up questionnaire&#xD;
      with the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. questions about their satisfaction with the information received, their use of their&#xD;
           reports, their interactions with their family and friends, and the influence of the&#xD;
           reports on these interactions, their perceived knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HADS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Helgeson's social support questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant others will be sent a questionnaire which has sections on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. questions about their satisfaction with the information they have received,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HADS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in anxiety (for patient or confidant) between intervention and 3 month follow-up&#xD;
           (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in social support (for patient) between intervention and 3 months (Helgeson)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction with information score at 3 month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confidant satisfaction with information score at 3 month follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether patient had read report, shown it or discussed it with the named confidant,&#xD;
           other family members or friends and whether the discussion was aided by use of the&#xD;
           report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What patients liked and disliked about the reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amongst the interactive group, choices made between presentation styles and how well&#xD;
           these would correspond to automatic computer choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and staff time, and hence costs, needed for routine delivery of each&#xD;
           intervention will be modelled on a variety of assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The researchers were to produce a CONSORT patient flow diagram and compare losses&#xD;
      to follow-up by the three interventions (A,B,C). Analysis of outcomes was to be for those&#xD;
      patients completing both intervention and follow-up. The researchers will focus on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of outcomes 1-4 by interventions A, B, and C while controlling for age,&#xD;
           gender, cancer site, time since diagnosis, severity, coping style, using analysis of&#xD;
           variance (factorial design) and multiple logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of outcomes 5 and 6 by interventions A,B, and C (qualitative).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modelling of anxiety (outcomes 1-2) on use of report at home (outcome 4), perceived&#xD;
           social support, and interventions A,B,C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequencies of choices (outcome 7) and comparison with automatic selection, both&#xD;
           statistically and through qualitative description of the differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of patient and NHS costs (outcome 8) will be made between the methods used in&#xD;
           this trial and other methods of providing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of anxiety change in patient and significant other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses will be on those completing follow-up. No substitution of data will be carried&#xD;
           out for those randomised but not completing follow-up. The researchers will thus be able&#xD;
           to make provisional conclusions on how the different types of information provision&#xD;
           influence interaction, anxiety and patient satisfaction, and on the correlation between&#xD;
           the use of information with family, and anxiety; The researchers will have information&#xD;
           on patient selection to inform the better development of automatic systems, and costs to&#xD;
           inform practical deployment.&#xD;
