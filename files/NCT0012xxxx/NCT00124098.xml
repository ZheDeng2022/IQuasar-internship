      The purpose of this study is to assess if Aranesp® administered once every 4 weeks to chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease subjects is safe and efficacious in maintaining haemoglobin levels greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 100 g/L.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and not expected to initiate dialysis for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance greater than 15 and less than 40 mL/min as estimated by the&#xD;
             Cockroft-Gault equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Clearance = (140-age in years) x body weight in kg/serum creatinine&#xD;
                  (mg/dL) x 72.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For women, the value will be multiplied by 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving stable every other week subcutaneous doses of Aranesp®.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A stable dose is defined as less than or equal to 25% change in Aranesp® dose over the&#xD;
             6-week period immediately prior to enrollment and with no more than&#xD;
&#xD;
             1 missed dose over this period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least two haemoglobin values within the target range of 100 to 130 g/L obtained at&#xD;
             least 1 week apart and within 5 weeks of the baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a haemoglobin of 100 to 130 g/L at eligibility/baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum ferritin greater than or equal to 100 mg/L or transferrin saturation greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 19.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels must be above the lower limit of the normal range&#xD;
             of the local laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before any study specific procedure is performed, the subject must provide informed&#xD;
             consent for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipating, scheduled for, or a prior recipient of a kidney transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure greater than 160/100 mmHg during the&#xD;
             eligibility/baseline period on 2 separate measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of severe hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone level greater&#xD;
             than 1500 pg/mL or biopsy-proven bone marrow fibrosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 12 weeks before enrollment (excluding vascular access surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active chronic inflammatory process&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving antibiotic therapy for systemic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT or AST greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal range&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known positive HIV antibody or positive hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of current malignancy and/or receiving systemic&#xD;
             chemotherapy/radiotherapy with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Red blood cell transfusions within 8 weeks before eligibility visit or active bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic hematologic disease (e.g., sickle cell anaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes,&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy, myeloma, haemolytic anaemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or any other disorder which may impact (in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator) the ability to give informed consent for participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All subjects must practice adequate contraception in the judgment of the Investigator,&#xD;

          -  Previous entry in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an investigational agent other than Aranesp® or device within 30 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of study drug or scheduled to receive an investigational agent&#xD;
             other than those specified by this protocol during the course of this study&#xD;
