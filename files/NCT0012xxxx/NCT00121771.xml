  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal and human studies have shown that the prime-boost immunization strategy using malaria&#xD;
      antigens expressed in plasmid or viral vectors induces strong cellular immune responses. An&#xD;
      immunization regimen with the malaria vaccines DNA ME-TRAP followed by MVA ME-TRAP induced&#xD;
      strong T cell responses in adults in the United Kingdom (UK) and in the Gambia but did not&#xD;
      provide significant clinical protection against infection. The investigators assessed two new&#xD;
      vaccines which utilize a similar immunization strategy but a different malaria antigen, a&#xD;
      circumsporozoite (CS) protein. The entire CS protein was expressed either in a modified&#xD;
      vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) CS, or an attenuated fowlpox virus strain (FP9) CS.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim was the assessment of safety and reactogenicity of these vaccines in Gambian&#xD;
      adults. The secondary aim was the assessment of immunogenicity and comparison with UK adults&#xD;
      given the same vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in the town of Farafenni, about 200km east of the capital city,&#xD;
      Banjul. In this area, malaria is highly seasonal with an entomological inoculation rate&#xD;
      between 10-50 bites per year. This study was carried out from January to June, when the&#xD;
      incidence of malaria is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involved 32 healthy Gambian adults aged 18-45 years. Volunteers were subjected to a&#xD;
      thorough physical and medical examination. Exclusion criteria included a low PCV (&lt; 30%);&#xD;
      raised plasma creatinine or ALT levels; and HIV positivity, as determined by ELISA assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After prior consultations with community leaders, public meetings were held to inform the&#xD;
      community of the planned study. Volunteers aged 18-45 years were then invited to take part in&#xD;
      the study after written informed consent was obtained in the presence of the principal&#xD;
      investigator. Prior to the start of the screening exercise, the investigators checked the age&#xD;
      and identity of each volunteer and conducted pre-HIV test counselling. Screening involved a&#xD;
      thorough physical examination, blood sampling for haematological (full blood count, packed&#xD;
      cell volume [PCV]), renal (plasma creatinine) and hepatic (alanine aminotransferase) tests&#xD;
      and HIV 1 and 2 testing by ELISA. All eligible volunteers were issued unique study numbers&#xD;
      and photo identification cards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial part of the study was designed to determine the dose and safety of the individual&#xD;
      vaccines using an open-label dose escalation method. Study volunteers were randomly allocated&#xD;
      to two groups of four that received 5 x 10^7 pfu id of either FP9 CS or MVA CS. When a good&#xD;
      safety profile was evident one week after this dose, another set of four volunteers per group&#xD;
      received a higher dose (1 x 10^8 pfu id) of FP9 CS or MVA CS. After the investigators had&#xD;
      achieved a satisfactory safety profile with a higher dose of both vaccines given alone, they&#xD;
      proceeded to administer the vaccines in combination using the heterologous prime-boost&#xD;
      regime. The vaccines were administered at 4-week intervals. Eight volunteers received FP9 CS&#xD;
      at week 0 followed by MVA CS at week 4 (FM group). Another set of 8 volunteers received FP9&#xD;
      CS at weeks 0 and 4, followed by MVA CS at week 8 (FFM). Following vaccination, volunteers&#xD;
      were observed for 1 hour and given a course of antipyretic (paracetamol) to take if required.&#xD;
      A physician and a study nurse could be contacted by the volunteers at anytime during the&#xD;
      course of the study. In addition, home visits were made by field workers on days 1, 2, 7 and&#xD;
      28, after each vaccination, to record adverse events using a standard questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined by the requirement to make a preliminary evaluation of inter-group&#xD;
      and inter-individual variability, to avoid excessive risk and to allow for a realistic&#xD;
      workload. Statistical significance may not be reached in this study with low power, but a&#xD;
      non-significant finding would provide justification for the need for a study with greater&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      An international DSMB was established to monitor the conduct of the trial and to approve the&#xD;
      analytical plan. The trial was conducted in line with the ICH Good Clinical Practices&#xD;
      guidelines and with the Medical Research Council (MRC) rules and regulations for the conduct&#xD;
      of clinical trials.&#xD;
