  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to test candidate pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccines, using a&#xD;
      well-established sporozoite challenge model, in a field setting with group sizes of tens&#xD;
      rather than hundreds of volunteers would greatly facilitate identification of the most&#xD;
      promising vaccine candidates. The investigators assessed the suitability and acceptability of&#xD;
      this method in a field trial in semi-immune volunteers exposed to natural infection during&#xD;
      the high malaria transmission season.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was to determine if the very sensitive PCR technique,&#xD;
      capable of detecting malaria parasites at low densities could be used as an economical method&#xD;
      of undertaking preliminary field evaluation of pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines. A secondary&#xD;
      objective was to determine if the intensive blood sampling that this method requires would be&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted from June to October 2004 when the incidence of malaria in The&#xD;
      Gambia is highest. Volunteers were recruited from 9 villages east of Farafenni, a town which&#xD;
      is 200km east of the capital city, Banjul. Malaria is highly seasonal in this area with an&#xD;
      entomological inoculation rate between 10 and 50 infectious bites per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers aged between 15-45 years were screened at two centres for their&#xD;
      eligibility to take part in the study. Screening involved a thorough physical examination as&#xD;
      well as blood sampling tests for haematological (full blood count, packed cell volume [PCV]),&#xD;
      renal (plasma creatinine level) and hepatic (alanine amino transferase) tests and for HIV 1&#xD;
      and 2 tests by ELISA. A glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency test was carried&#xD;
      out because of the risk involved with administering the study drugs Primaquine and Lapdap to&#xD;
      volunteers who are G6PD deficient. Exclusion criteria included a PCV &lt; 30%, raised plasma&#xD;
      creatinine (&gt; 130 micromoles/litre) or ALT levels (&gt; 42 IU/litre), G6PD deficiency,&#xD;
      simultaneous participation in another clinical trial, blood transfusion in the month prior to&#xD;
      vaccination, previous experimental malaria vaccination, administration of another vaccine&#xD;
      within 2 weeks of vaccination, allergy to any previous vaccination or to&#xD;
      sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine, history of splenectomy and any treatment with immunosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible volunteers were enrolled into the study after written, informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained. All eligible volunteers were issued a unique number and a photo identification&#xD;
      card. Volunteers were randomly allocated into three groups to receive either two 5 x10^7 pfu&#xD;
      doses of FP9 ME-TRAP followed by a single dose of 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA ME-TRAP (malaria vaccine&#xD;
      group) or 3 doses of rabies vaccine (Fansidar and rabies groups). All vaccines were give 4&#xD;
      weeks apart and were administered intradermally. Following vaccination, all volunteers were&#xD;
      observed for 1 hr and given a course of anti-pyretic (paracetamol) to take if required. In&#xD;
      addition, home visits were made by field workers on days 1, 2, 7 and 28 after each&#xD;
      vaccination to record adverse events using a standard diary card. All volunteers received a&#xD;
      single dose of Primaquine (30mg) 7 days before the final dose of vaccination as radical cure&#xD;
      for gametocytes and a 3-day course of the short acting anti-malaria drugs, Lapdap and&#xD;
      Artesunate in combination starting on the day of final vaccination to clear any asexual forms&#xD;
      of the parasite before the follow-up period. Additionally, volunteers in the Fansidar group&#xD;
      received the long acting anti-malarial drug and were expected to remain PCR negative&#xD;
      throughout the follow-up period. Volunteers were followed up intensively for 28 days starting&#xD;
      7days after the last vaccination. The period of follow-up was timed to correspond with the&#xD;
      period of high malaria transmission. Follow-up was by daily finger-pricks to obtain 0.5mls of&#xD;
      blood in a microtainer for PCR analysis and a duplicate blood film for estimation of malaria&#xD;
      parasites. Laboratory staff that conducted immunoassays and PCR analysis were blind to the&#xD;
      group allocation of volunteers until after approval of the analysis plan by the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on practical and statistical considerations the researchers proposed to enroll 40&#xD;
      volunteers per group (a total of 120). Allowing for a steady rate of drop-out during follow&#xD;
      up amounting to total of 20% of subjects by the end of the trial, the trial has at least 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a difference in time to infection between the malaria vaccine and rabies&#xD;
      groups, if the vaccine efficacy is at least 60%, and at least 70% of the control group&#xD;
      volunteers develop detected parasitaemia during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DSMB was set up to oversee the conduct of the trial and approve the analytical plan before&#xD;
      unblinding the laboratory staff. The trial was conducted according to ICH Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice guidelines and was guided by the Medical Research Council regulations for the&#xD;
      conduct of clinical trials.&#xD;
