    <textblock>
      The clinical outcome after external beam irradiation for prostate cancer is disappointing in&#xD;
      the advanced tumor stages. There are indications that an increase in radiation dose to the&#xD;
      tumor will improve outcome significantly, especially to the biologically active tumour parts&#xD;
      within the cancer area. Until recently no imaging equipment was available to define both the&#xD;
      anatomic and biologically active tumor parts. Now, at the Center for Biological Imaging and&#xD;
      Adaptive Radiotherapy, equipment is at hand that will be able to visualise the areas&#xD;
      mentioned above. When combining the data of these imaging modalities it might be possible to&#xD;
      create an optimised irradiation plan. This study is a planning study in which, on 15&#xD;
      patients, the different anatomical and biological imaging data per patient will be evaluated,&#xD;
      matched and finally a theoretical improved irradiation treatment plan will be made. This&#xD;
      research complies with the current opinion on radiation development. Progress in functional&#xD;
      imaging is likely to provide the tools required for individualised risk-adapted radiotherapy.&#xD;

      Proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the possibilities to improve Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and Gross Tumour&#xD;
      Volume (GTV) delineation by using the latest biological imaging modalities on 15 patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer. Our ultimate goal is to set new GTV and CTV definitions and redefine&#xD;
      the choice of irradiation margins in Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy (IMRT) for prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Furthermore, try to translate the functional imaging data into a Tomotherapy IMRT&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment results after standard dose external beam irradiation of locally advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer are insufficient. According to RTOG-8531, RTOG-8610 and EORTC series on T1 to T4&#xD;
      tumours, 5-year overall survival ranges 60 - 73% and 5-year disease free survival ranges 15 -&#xD;
      67%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local control can be enhanced by adjuvant androgen suppression, the 5-year disease free&#xD;
      survival increases significantly to 36 - 89%. Unfortunately, androgen suppression&#xD;
      significantly deteriorates quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the irradiation dose also improves local control. However, local toxicity,&#xD;
      especially rectal and bladder complications, restrict the dose which can be given with&#xD;
      conformal external beam irradiation with population based uncertainty margins. Setup&#xD;
      inaccuracy and organ movement determine the irradiation margins needed. Modern position&#xD;
      verification techniques, e.g. using fiducial markers in the prostate in combination with&#xD;
      megavoltage imaging techniques, allow a reduction of the margins and offer the possibility&#xD;
      for dose escalation in the prostate. Studies of IMRT have utilised these sophisticated&#xD;
      position verification techniques and this approach appears feasible. A further reduction of&#xD;
      the margins, and thus a possible further increasing of the irradiation dose, can be expected&#xD;
      from improving the delineation of the prostate contour. Imaging can be performed to delineate&#xD;
      anatomic structures or biological processes within the intraprostatic malignant lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT is commonly used for anatomy delineation, based on early studies. Although the image&#xD;
      quality has improved gradually, unfortunately, CT still severely overestimates the prostate&#xD;
      volume. Furthermore, Teh et al found in 712 prostatectomy patients large mean differences&#xD;
      between CT-based estimates of the GTV and PTV and Pathological Prostate Volume (PPV). Rasch&#xD;
      et al found an average ratio between CT and MRI volumes of 1.4. Also the MRI technique&#xD;
      improved and now produces a much better imaging quality, e.g. by increasing Tesla, by using&#xD;
      the present phased array coils and by using thinner slice thickness. The accuracy of&#xD;
      detecting extracapsular extension in prostate carcinoma with endorectal and phased-array coil&#xD;
      MR imaging reaches 77% for experienced readers. Concluding, MRI is superior to CT in GTV&#xD;
      contouring, but MRI alone (using combined T1 SE and T2 TSE) may not be sufficient for&#xD;
      visualisation of the GTV. It is expected that biological imaging will improve GTV delineation&#xD;
      further. Within the GTV a Biological Target Volume (BTV) will become visible, which may&#xD;
      further improve the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In biological imaging the use of the different imaging techniques have yet to be explored.&#xD;
      Currently, there are two topics of importance. The first topic is perfusion. In prostate&#xD;
      cancer, the degree of vascularisation appears to correlate with aggressive behaviour and risk&#xD;
      of metastasis. In prostate cancer approximately two times as many microvessels exist in the&#xD;
      malignant tissue compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, in benign tissues the capillaries&#xD;
      are restricted for the most part to the periglandular stroma immediately adjacent to the&#xD;
      epithelium, whereas the distribution in carcinoma appears to be more random. Differences in&#xD;
      perfusion have been shown to correlate with active prostate cancer areas. Dynamic&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced MRI is able to show the microvessel density (MVD) in the prostate. Second&#xD;
      is the metabolic activity in prostate cancer. The ratios of choline and creatine (normal&#xD;
      value 0.22 +/- 0.13 ppm) reveals metabolic active prostate cancer tissue. Increased choline&#xD;
      and/or a reduced citrate indicate prostate cancer. The ratio of choline and creatine-to&#xD;
      citrate is related to the Gleason score of the tumour. Concluding, MRI and MRS allow combined&#xD;
      structural and metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer location, aggressiveness and stage.&#xD;
      The same could be performed using combined CT and PET. Sutinen et al found a clear evidence&#xD;
      for detecting areas with [11C] choline in prostate cancer using PET. To our knowledge no data&#xD;
      exist comparing [11C] choline PET and MRS in prostate cancer. The technology for biological&#xD;
      imaging remains in evolution, and continued advances in accuracy and can be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, given the current inadequacies in the state of art of defining GTV and CTV in&#xD;
      prostate cancer, we propose a study on prostate visualisation using the latest anatomical and&#xD;
      biological (metabolic) imaging modalities. Combining the information of different imaging&#xD;
      techniques by introducing a BTV and through image fusion is likely to improve CTV and GTV&#xD;
      delineation. This will allow us to redefine the choice of margins. Finally, this will result&#xD;
      in an improved IMRT plan, where dose painting and dose escalation of the GTV is the ultimate&#xD;
      goal. This complies with the current opinion on radiation development. Progress in functional&#xD;
      imaging is likely to provide the tools required for individualised risk-adapted radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By introducing a BTV within the GTV a non-uniform CTV delineation can be used and thus&#xD;
      margins can be minimised. This allows further escalation of the dose. Setup inaccuracy and&#xD;
      organ movement further determine the irradiation margins needed. Therefore, controlling day&#xD;
      to day position variability together with the delivery of optimised conformal irradiation&#xD;
      will be the next goals to set. Helical Tomotherapy is a novel approach to the delivery of&#xD;
      radiation for cancer treatment, which will be able to do both. It relies on a 6 MV linear&#xD;
      accelerator for treatment purposes and a 3.5 MV-CT scan for imaging purposes. Both are&#xD;
      mounted on a ring gantry that rotates around the patient as he advances through the ring. A&#xD;
      64-leaf collimator defines the radiation fan beam. In a theoretical study Helical Tomotherapy&#xD;
      plans required minimal operator interaction and resulted in excellent sparing of normal&#xD;
      structures in prostate IMRT. Therefore, in this study we also propose to fuse the anatomic an&#xD;
      biologic imaging data with a Tomotherapy MV-CT and make a inverse IMRT Tomotherapy plan. This&#xD;
      planning exercise will precede a feasibility study on functional imaging and individualised&#xD;
      day to day adapted radiotherapy by Tomotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be possible, using biological (MRS) imaging data and anatomical (CT and MRI)&#xD;
           imaging data, to define a BTV within the GTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By introducing a BTV within the GTV a non-uniform CTV delineation can be used and&#xD;
           margins can be minimised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be possible to translate the fused anatomic and biologic imaging data into a&#xD;
           clinically sufficient Tomotherapy IMRT plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are to receive external beam irradiation for prostate cancer (Stage T1-4 N0/x&#xD;
      M0), preferably not treated with anti-androgens and without metal hip prosthesis will be&#xD;
      approached to participate in this pilot study. The study will be performed on 15 patients who&#xD;
      will receive imaging additionally to the irradiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before start of treatment patients will receive a 3T MRI (T1 SE and T2 TSE), an MRS&#xD;
      determining the choline creatine levels in the prostate. Furthermore, an MV-CT will be made&#xD;
      as a prelude to future position verification studies. All images (CT, MRI and MRS) will be&#xD;
      matched. These combined data will be used to determine an optimal Tomotherapy IMRT plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated according to the current department protocol. This study is only an&#xD;
      imaging / treatment planning study. No changes in treatment will be made based on the&#xD;
      obtained imaging data set. The risk for the patients will be negligible. From the MV-CT&#xD;
      approximately 1 cGy. The MRI will be performed without contrast (so no dynamic gadolinium&#xD;
      enhanced MRI to evaluate perfusion distribution) to limit the patient burden and risk.&#xD;
      Regarding the total irradiation dose of 7200 till 8200 cGy to the patient this additional&#xD;
      risk is negligible. The current waiting time for the patient to start with radiotherapy is&#xD;
      approximately 5 to 6 weeks. In this waiting time the imaging studies will be performed, so&#xD;
      participation to the study will not result in any treatment delay for the patient. The MV-CT&#xD;
      scan will take approximately 30 minutes to perform and the combined MRI/MRS approximately 1&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton facilitates all necessary imaging techniques: a 3T&#xD;
      MRI, MRS and a Helical Tomotherapy Unit (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not necessary to determine specificity and accuracy of the imaging modalities. The&#xD;
      imaging here is only meant to assist in determining the metabolic and anatomic tumour areas&#xD;
      in the prostate. Missing a tumour part is not a problem yet because the whole prostate is&#xD;
      being treated to the minimal required dose. Overdosage on prostate tissue is not a clinical&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
