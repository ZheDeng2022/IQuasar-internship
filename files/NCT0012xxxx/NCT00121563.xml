      This study will evaluate the role of thalidomide, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha&#xD;
      modulator, on severe inflammation and relief of pain following extraction of wisdom teeth.&#xD;
      TNFs are substances that affect the pathways of pain. This study involves an experimental&#xD;
      group in which patients will be given thalidomide or a placebo (an inactive substance); a&#xD;
      negative control group receiving the medication diazepam or a placebo; and a positive control&#xD;
      group receiving diazepam or ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are males ages 16 to 35, who are not allergic to aspirin or other nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (known as NSAIDs), sulfites, or certain anesthetics, and who in good&#xD;
      health may be eligible for this study. Females are not eligible, owing to the risks that&#xD;
      thalidomide presents to unborn children. To minimize the risk of fetal malformations, male&#xD;
      patients who participate must use a condom during sexual intercourse for 4 weeks following&#xD;
      the study and must not donate blood for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medications used in the study will be given 1 hour before surgery. Then after the wisdom&#xD;
      teeth are removed, a small piece of tubing will be placed into both sides of the patient's&#xD;
      mouth where the teeth were removed. Every 20 minutes, for the next 6 hours, the researchers&#xD;
      will collect inflammatory fluid from the tubing, to measure for changes in anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      action. If they request pain relievers, patients will receive the medication ketorolac&#xD;
      (Toradol), used for short-term treatment of moderately severe acute pain. Side effects of&#xD;
      thalidomide include fatigue, dizziness, and rash. The use of ibuprofen and ketorolac may&#xD;
      include the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. Diazepam can cause involuntary&#xD;
      muscle movements and drowsiness, as well as dizziness lasting for up to 24 hours after it has&#xD;
      been used as sedation. Patients will be instructed not to try to walk alone or to try to&#xD;
      drive a vehicle during that period. Other risks related to participation in this study&#xD;
      include those usually experienced with removal of wisdom teeth-that is, pain and swelling,&#xD;
      bruising from insertion of the sedative into a vein (if needed), possible infection at the&#xD;
      extraction site, prolonged bleeding, and numbness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits from participating are having wisdom teeth removed at no cost as well as close&#xD;
      monitoring before and after surgery. Results from the study may help people in the future by&#xD;
      improving the management of pain following surgery.&#xD;

      The proposed investigation is a randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled&#xD;
      clinical study to evaluate the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)&#xD;
      modulator, thalidomide, in acute inflammation and analgesia. The analgesic effect of&#xD;
      thalidomide, a putative TNF-alpha modulator, will be evaluated using a model of tissue&#xD;
      injury, the oral surgery model. Briefly, healthy males referred for third molar extraction&#xD;
      will undergo the surgical extraction of third molars using standard surgical methods. At the&#xD;
      completion of the surgical procedure, a microdialysis probe will be placed under the&#xD;
      mucogingival flap previously elevated for the surgical procedure and subjects will be&#xD;
      observed for pain over the course of six hours following surgery. Thalidomide or control will&#xD;
      be administered one hour prior to surgery. Tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators will be measured at time intervals postoperatively concomitant with&#xD;
      pain measurements. Pain will be assessed postoperatively over the course of six hours.&#xD;
      Demonstration of amelioration of pain is the primary outcome measure; changes in levels of&#xD;
      tissue mediators will be taken as evidence of an acute anti-inflammatory effect of&#xD;
      thalidomide. Based on our previous work with the fusion protein etanercept (TNFR:fc) which&#xD;
      specifically binds TNF-alpha and prevents its interaction with cellular receptors, similar&#xD;
      changes in the inflammatory cascade and clinical endpoints of inflammation may provide&#xD;
      insight into the activity of thalidomide on acute inflammation and its clinical sequela,&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
