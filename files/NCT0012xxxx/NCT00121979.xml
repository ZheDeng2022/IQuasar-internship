  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Racivir ® (RCV) is an experimental drug which means it is not approved for use by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but it can be used in research studies like this&#xD;
      one. RCV (Racivir®) is part of a class of drugs known as &quot;Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase&#xD;
      Inhibitors&quot; (NRTIs), which are intended to block a further increase in the amount of HIV&#xD;
      virus in the body. Laboratory research suggests that RCV (Racivir®) may be effective in&#xD;
      patients who have developed resistance to other NRTIs, particularly 3TC (lamivudine,&#xD;
      Epivir®). However, a study of RCV (Racivir®) has not been done with patients who have&#xD;
      previously been treated with other HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy -- taking&#xD;
      multiple HIV drugs at once) medications including 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RCV (Racivir®) when&#xD;
      used together with other HIV drugs in people who have previously been treated with 3TC&#xD;
      (lamivudine, Epivir®) and are failing with their current HAART treatments. This study will&#xD;
      include a total of 60 HIV infected, HAART-experienced subjects currently receiving 3TC&#xD;
      (lamivudine, Epivir®) as part of their HAART therapy. The study will take place at&#xD;
      approximately 11 study sites in the US and Latin America.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into four periods: a 'Screening' period which can last up to 30 days in&#xD;
      duration, a 'Blinded Treatment' period which can last up to 4 weeks in duration, a&#xD;
      'Follow-up' period which is 28 days in duration, and an 'Open-label Treatment' period that&#xD;
      some subjects will be given the option to participate in and which can last up to 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible subjects decide to participate in this research study, they will be randomized,&#xD;
      which is like picking chances from a hat, to get RCV (Racivir®) alone, 3TC (lamivudine,&#xD;
      Epivir®) alone, or RCV and 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) in combination. This is a &quot;double-blind&#xD;
      study&quot;. This means that neither the subject nor the study doctor and study staff will know if&#xD;
      subjects are receiving RCV (Racivir®), 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®), or RCV (Racivir®) and 3TC&#xD;
      (lamivudine, Epivir®). This needs to be done to make sure the researchers obtain the&#xD;
      information needed to see if RCV (Racivir®) is safe and as effective as 3TC (lamivudine,&#xD;
      Epivir®). In case of an emergency, the study doctor will be able to find out immediately what&#xD;
      study drug subjects were receiving. With this exception, by signing the consent form subjects&#xD;
      agree that they will not be able to find out what medications they are taking, because this&#xD;
      is a &quot;double-blind&quot; study, it is necessary to use placebo tablets. A placebo is a tablet that&#xD;
      does not contain any active drug, but is made to look just like the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given three bottles of study medication. They will be asked to take one&#xD;
      tablet from each bottle once a day by mouth, in addition to their current HAART drugs, not&#xD;
      including 3TC. The 3TC in their current HAART regimen must be discontinued prior to beginning&#xD;
      the study medication. It is important that subjects follow all directions when taking the&#xD;
      study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the first 14 days of the blinded treatment period, subjects will be given&#xD;
      the option to continue on their current randomized therapy, including their current study&#xD;
      medication, for an additional 1-2 weeks. On Day 15, a blood sample will be collected to&#xD;
      determine the amount of HIV virus in the blood. Once the results from that blood sample are&#xD;
      available, subjects will be told the amount of how much HIV virus changed in the blood during&#xD;
      the first 14 days of treatment. Subjects will also be told if they were receiving RCV&#xD;
      (Racivir®) alone, 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) alone, or a combination of RCV (Racivir®) and 3TC&#xD;
      (lamivudine, Epivir®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects were receiving RCV (Racivir®), to continue in the open-label treatment period,&#xD;
      the amount of virus in the blood must drop by at least 2/3 during the first 14 days of the&#xD;
      blinded treatment period. For example, if subjects enter the study with 10,000 copies of the&#xD;
      HIV virus per milliliter (ml) of blood, then to continue in the open-label period, the virus&#xD;
      level must drop to 3,162 copies or less, per ml of blood. Open-label means that participating&#xD;
      subjects and the study doctor or study staff will know what treatment subjects were&#xD;
      receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the virus drops by at least 2/3, subjects will be given the option to enter an open-label&#xD;
      treatment period. During the open-label period, subjects will receive 600 mg RCV (Racivir®)&#xD;
      once daily along with their regular HAART medications. Before entering the open-label period,&#xD;
      the study doctor may decide to change the subject's other ARV medications. Participating&#xD;
      subjects will be financially responsible for all medications, other than RCV (Racivir®), that&#xD;
      the study doctor may prescribe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment is &quot;unblinded&quot;, subjects may learn that they were not receiving any RCV&#xD;
      (Racivir®) during the blinded treatment period. Subjects may voluntarily decide to add 600 mg&#xD;
      RCV (Racivir®) once daily to the other HAART medications. The study doctor may decide to&#xD;
      change the subject's HAART medications at this time. After 2 weeks of RCV (Racivir®) based&#xD;
      treatment, subjects will be asked to return to the study doctor's office to have blood drawn&#xD;
      to determine the amount of HIV virus in the blood. Subjects may continue on RCV (Racivir®)&#xD;
      for up to an additional 2 weeks until the results from the blood test are available. If the&#xD;
      viral load does not decline by at least 2/3, subjects will be withdrawn from the open-label&#xD;
      portion of the study. Subjects will be asked to return to the study doctor's office for a&#xD;
      final follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the last dose of RCV (Racivir®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The open-label treatment period will last no longer than 20 weeks. During this study,&#xD;
      subjects can receive up to 24 weeks of RCV (Racivir®) therapy. After subjects receive the&#xD;
      last dose of study medication, they will enter the follow-up period for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participating subject or the study doctor decides to withdraw from the study early,&#xD;
      subjects will need to return to the study doctor's office to have a follow-up visit&#xD;
      approximately 28 days after the last dose of RCV (Racivir®).&#xD;
