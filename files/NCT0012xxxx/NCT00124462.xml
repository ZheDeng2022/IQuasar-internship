  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this 3-year project is to determine whether the provision of&#xD;
      realignment therapy in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) relieves knee pain and&#xD;
      improves function. The researchers will test the hypothesis that compared to control&#xD;
      treatment, the use of realignment therapy (valgus knee brace + motion control shoes +&#xD;
      orthosis) is effective in medial knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To undertake a 30 week randomized crossover clinical trial in patients with medial knee&#xD;
           osteoarthritis to determine whether provision of realignment therapy leads to lower pain&#xD;
           scores and improved function during the time of this treatment than during the use of a&#xD;
           placebo treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform an open label follow-up study to track use and effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
           This project will be co-funded by DonJoy Orthopedic, a knee bracing company.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a double blind, randomized crossover trial of a realignment therapy for patients&#xD;
      with medial knee osteoarthritis with the primary outcome being knee pain and function as&#xD;
      assessed by the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (VAS Version). Because of the possibility that the&#xD;
      therapy may provide proprioceptive input and improve symptoms on that basis, we will test two&#xD;
      different treatments: 1. CONTROL TREATMENT A) a neutral brace that does not have any&#xD;
      varus/valgus angulation, control foot orthotic and shoes with flexible midsole and 2. ACTIVE&#xD;
      TREATMENT B) an valgus brace, customized functional orthotic for neutral foot position and&#xD;
      motion control footwear. A run-in design will be used to maximize the likelihood of&#xD;
      recruiting subjects who will remain in the trial. Subjects will be randomized to treatment A&#xD;
      or B for 12 weeks. We will then remove the realignment therapy of treatment period 1, and&#xD;
      they will have no realignment therapy for 6 weeks, after which they will receive the other&#xD;
      treatment. For each subject, the trial will last 34 weeks. Study evaluation will take place&#xD;
      at the Boston University Medical Center GCRC. The trial will be followed by a 6-month&#xD;
      open-label follow up. Trial Schedule. We plan a study lasting a total of 30 weeks from the&#xD;
      time of randomization for all subjects. There will be 4 weeks pre-randomization for run-in; a&#xD;
      phone call at -4weeks and a visit at -2 weeks. The schedule of visits is shown in the&#xD;
      protocol as is the timeline. Intervention The active treatment brace will be the DonJoy OA&#xD;
      valgus brace. The active treatment orthosis will consist of a customized functional orthosis&#xD;
      to achieve neutral foot position. The active treatment shoewear will be a motion control shoe&#xD;
      with an appropriate (based upon foot posture examination) density midsole and heel counter.&#xD;
      The control treatment brace will consist of an identical brace with a loosened screw at the&#xD;
      hinge allowing varus-valgus laxity. The control treatment orthosis will be flat 1/8&quot; thick&#xD;
      inserts of an identical material to the active treatment arm. The control treatment shoe will&#xD;
      be identical in appearance with a low density midsole to limit motion control. Treatment&#xD;
      shoes will be worn on both feet during each treatment period. Recruitment One key element&#xD;
      ensuring success in recruitment for the proposed clinical trial for osteoarthritis is&#xD;
      experience with and history of success in recruitment for previous studies. We have&#xD;
      successfully recruited targeted number of subjects for 2 recent OA clinical trials and a&#xD;
      natural history study of OA all of which have more subjects than are targeted here. We are&#xD;
      currently completing an NIH-funded heel wedge study which uses a similar design and study&#xD;
      population to the one being employed here and both the clinical trial experience obtained,&#xD;
      and the continuing recruitment for that study will facilitate recruitment for this trial. The&#xD;
      efficacy of a clinical trial is maximized if subjects comply with assigned treatment and come&#xD;
      to scheduled visits. One way to increase the likelihood of subject compliance with a trial is&#xD;
      to perform a run-in test, a period of observation prior to randomization during which&#xD;
      subjects get experience with major components of the study protocol. Those subjects who have&#xD;
      trouble complying with the protocol are excluded before being randomized. Despite the&#xD;
      exclusion of potential subjects, trial run-ins have been shown to enhance a trial's&#xD;
      statistical power by limiting its results to those who were especially likely to actually&#xD;
      receive treatment. A recent test of a run-in in an osteoarthritis trial reported that roughly&#xD;
      10% failed a 4-week run-in and that the exclusion of these subjects from the trial increased&#xD;
      efficiency and lowered the number of subjects needed and was highly beneficial. We propose a&#xD;
      run in period in which there will be a screening phone call, a visit two weeks later&#xD;
      (prerandomization visit), with the randomization visit 2 weeks after the initial visit. This&#xD;
      will be a placebo run-in with administration of the control shoe and orthotic for this 2-week&#xD;
      period. The run in serves several purposes in addition to the efficiency and adherence&#xD;
      reasons noted above. It permits us to obtain radiographs, assess and custom manufacture knee&#xD;
      brace, orthotics and shoewear, and review them prior to randomization. It also allows us to&#xD;
      assess pain status twice so as to get an average of knee pain scores prior to the trial. One&#xD;
      concern of a run-in is that it may limit generalizability by excluding some subjects who fail&#xD;
      the run-in test. In this trial we will be assessing efficacy so we need to maximize internal&#xD;
      validity. Moreover losing subjects in crossover trial is a major concern and we would like to&#xD;
      minimize this. We will preserve allocation concealment by having the randomization codes held&#xD;
      by the Data Coordinating Center at Boston University, School of Public Health that is&#xD;
      external to the Clinical Epidemiology and Research Training Unit. We will stratify patients&#xD;
      into those with end stage (Kellgren &amp; Lawrence Grade 4-specifically bone on bone in the&#xD;
      weight bearing knee film in the medial compartment) versus those with disease that is&#xD;
      moderate or mild yet still affecting the medial joint. We will then perform blocked&#xD;
      stratified randomization ensuring that we randomize roughly equal numbers of patients with&#xD;
      severe disease and those with mild to moderate diseases into each of the two treatment arms.&#xD;
      We will incorporate a blocked randomization scheme so as to permit roughly equal numbers of&#xD;
      subjects to be randomized to each treatment within each of the strata of interest. Blinding&#xD;
      We will attempt to conduct a blinded trial. Ideally, a blinded trial presents identical&#xD;
      appearing treatments to the patients, and obviously, we cannot accomplish this. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      our description of the treatments to the patients will be that we will be comparing two types&#xD;
      of treatment for their knee arthritis without specifying which therapy constitutes active&#xD;
      treatment. The physician responsible for observations during the study visits will also be&#xD;
      blind to subject interventions during each phase. Outcomes to be assessed -Primary Outcome&#xD;
      -WOMAC Pain and Function Subscales (Most symptomatic treated Knee) -Secondary Outcomes WOMAC&#xD;
      Stiffness Subscale Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Patient Global Assessment&#xD;
      Overall Knee Pain V.A.S. (Knee specific) SF36 Analgesic Use (Medication log) Blinded knee&#xD;

      chair stand) Gait analysis (see further description below) Knee malalignment (Measured from&#xD;
      long limb films) Proprioception (Ability to reproduce passive positioning of the knee). Open&#xD;
      Label Follow-up At the end of their participation in the trial, subjects will be allowed to&#xD;
      keep the therapy they used. We will ask them which therapy helped them most, and we will&#xD;
      strongly encourage continued use. We will continue to follow these subjects for an additional&#xD;
      6 months. We will schedule open label study follow-up visits at 2, 4 and 6 months during&#xD;
      which subjects' realignment therapy will be re-examined. Replacements will be provided if&#xD;
      necessary. We will also administer the WOMAC at these visits to asses whether treatment&#xD;
      effects remain. At these visits, subjects will be queried about adherence; whether they&#xD;
      continue to use the realignment therapy, how many days per week (from an adherence diary)&#xD;
      they have worn them. This data will enable an assessment of long term adherence, and also&#xD;
      enable us to ascertain if response is contingent on adherence. During all phases of the study&#xD;
      participation, subjects will receive educational materials that have been approved by the IRB&#xD;
      either during their visits or via the mail. These are intended to keep subjects engaged and&#xD;
      thereby help with retention in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trial participants must meet American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for&#xD;
             osteoarthritis with knee pain, aching or stiffness on most of the past 30 days and&#xD;
             evidence on radiograph of a definite osteophyte. In addition, because the researchers&#xD;
             are interested in recruiting persons with medial knee osteoarthritis, participants&#xD;
             will need to have evidence of disease in this compartment on their radiographs, and&#xD;
             not have lateral compartment or patellofemoral compartment disease. Medial disease is&#xD;
             based on definitions used in the researcher's previous publications as definite&#xD;
             radiographic OA + at least grade 1 medial narrowing (0-3 scale) using an atlas from&#xD;
             the Osteoarthritis Research Society International.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with clinical evidence of patellofemoral disease or knee pathology (other&#xD;
             than medial compartment OA) likely to be causing their knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who usually use an ambulation aid to walk such as a cane, crutch, walker&#xD;
             or wheel chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amputation of foot or previous major trauma to foot that would raise concerns about&#xD;
             whether an insert might worsen foot pain. Persons with foot lesions such as sores or&#xD;
             ulcers in which redistributing load in the foot might be dangerous, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known neuropathy from diabetes or for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past history of deep venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain emanating more from back or hip than from knee as determined by screening&#xD;
             questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low pain score on WOMAC, a widely used and well validated questionnaire to assess knee&#xD;
             symptoms. To evaluate response, the researchers will require that patients have a&#xD;
             minimal score of at least 4 out of 10 on at least 2 of 5 questions, or a total of&#xD;
             greater than 15 out of 50 for the WOMAC pain scale in the eligible knee at&#xD;
             pre-randomization phone call and visit, and at randomization visit. This will allow us&#xD;
             to detect response to treatment if response occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planning to move from area within 9 months of study screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic comorbid disease limits walking more than knee pain (per screening&#xD;
             questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving corticosteroid injections in the month prior to starting the trial. No other&#xD;
             treatments will trigger exclusion, although for patients who have been on glucosamine&#xD;
             +/or chondroitin +/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) the researchers will&#xD;
             require that they must have taken these treatments for at least 2 months prior to&#xD;
             onset of trial and to commit to not start a new treatment throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral total knee replacements (TKR) or plan for TKR in next 6 months for affected&#xD;
             knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known other causes of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus (SLE), gout, psoriatic arthritis, pseudogout.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to pass 4 week run-in test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers in a pre-contemplative state (persons who would not consider realignment&#xD;
             therapy as a therapeutic option for their knee OA).&#xD;
