      This study will evaluate patients with abnormal immune function that results in recurrent or&#xD;
      unusual infections or chronic inflammation. This may include inherited conditions, such as&#xD;
      X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and&#xD;
      leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), or conditions resulting from outside factors, such as&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The information from this study will be used to establish&#xD;
      the pattern and pace of change of the disease and to help develop new treatments. The period&#xD;
      of observation and study following enrollment in this study may be for up to one year. In&#xD;
      addition these studies may provide the medical information needed to determine eligibility&#xD;
      for enrollment in other clinical study protocols and more prolonged follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of any age with abnormal immune function who have recurrent or unusual infections,&#xD;
      whose blood tests show evidence of immune dysfunction, or who have GVHD, XSCID, CGD or LAD&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Patients' parents, siblings, grandparents, children, aunts,&#xD;
      uncles and first cousins of any age also may be included. Healthy normal volunteers between&#xD;
      18 and 85 years of age are recruited as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers undergo a physical examination and provide blood, saliva, and urine samples&#xD;
      for immune function studies. Patients' family members provide a medical history, have a&#xD;
      physical examination, and give blood and urine samples, and possibly a saliva sample. The&#xD;
      samples are used for genetic and routine laboratory studies. Investigators may request tissue&#xD;
      samples, such as biopsy specimens, previously removed for medical reasons to be sent to NIH&#xD;
      for study. Patients undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood and urine tests, including analysis for genes involved in immune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Buccal smear (in some patients) for genetic studies. This involves scraping the lining&#xD;
           of the mouth near the cheek.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Specialized tests to evaluate specific conditions in patients who have an immune&#xD;
           disorder that might affect lung function, gum infections or eye problems. These may&#xD;
           include chest x-ray, CT scan, breathing function test, dental, eye, and hearing&#xD;
           examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow-up visits of patients with immune problems may occur at 6 months and at one year&#xD;
           after the first visit (or more frequently if medically required) to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history update&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow-up on abnormal test results and medical treatments initiated at NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection of blood, saliva, urine, or wound drainage samples for repeat immune&#xD;
                function studies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tissue study of specimens removed for medical reasons at other institutions besides&#xD;
                NIH&#xD;

      This protocol is designed for the screening and baseline assessment of and collection of&#xD;
      research sample from patients with abnormalities of immune function as manifested by&#xD;
      recurrent or unusual infections, recurrent or chronic inflammation, or previous laboratory&#xD;
      evidence of immune dysfunction. Abnormalities of immune function may be inherited or may be&#xD;
      iatrogenic such as that following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or other treatments&#xD;
      resulting in prolonged immune dysfunction. Blood and/or bone marrow cells may also be used to&#xD;
      investigate the utility of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) for immune cell derivation&#xD;
      and targeted gene correction. This is not a protocol to study or screen for human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus infection, though patients with HIV infection who may have other&#xD;
      causes for immune dysfunction are not excluded. First or second degree genetically related&#xD;
      family members (limited to mother, father, siblings, grandparents, children, aunts, uncles&#xD;
      and first cousins of an affected patient) may also be screened for clinical, in vitro and&#xD;
      genetic correlates of immune abnormalities. Healthy Volunteers will be enrolled as a source&#xD;
      of control blood samples for research testing, not to include genetic testing. Screening and&#xD;
      baseline assessment under the auspices of this study may be limited to two visits over one&#xD;
      year period, unless the patient has been determined by initial evaluation to require further&#xD;
      study at NIH or are ongoing long-term safety assessments as required by their participation&#xD;
      on a gene therapy or transplant protocol. Patients with documented immune dysfunction may&#xD;
      receive limited medically indicated treatment if that medically indicated treatment is&#xD;
      related to the abnormality of immune function under study, with such treatment limited to the&#xD;
      period of the one year baseline assessment indicated in this protocol. When screening and&#xD;
      assessment is complete, patients will be offered an opportunity to participate in another&#xD;
      study, or if there are no active studies appropriate for the patient, other options will be&#xD;
      suggested to the primary or referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will allow detailed investigation of patients with abnormalities of immune&#xD;
      function with up to one year of observation with the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the degree, scope and cause of immune dysfunction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the pace and pattern of change in the disease process;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the extent of organ involvement and damage from immune dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This screening and baseline assessment is necessary to discover new causes of immune&#xD;
      abnormalities, to delineate epidemiology of immune deficiencies, to develop new diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic tools, and to determine a patient's eligibility for other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung MRI as a CT supplement in Infection Surveillance in Immunodeficiencies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine use of computed tomography (CT) has increased substantially since its&#xD;
      introduction into medicine, which, in turn, has also increased the amount of radiation to&#xD;
      which individuals are exposed. This increased radiation is not without risk and is&#xD;
      particularly problematic in our primary immunodeficiency disease population, who require&#xD;
      serial imaging with chest CTs to manage pneumonia. Standard medical practice in this patient&#xD;
      population is to diagnose infection by obtaining a diagnostic CT and then repeating the CT&#xD;
      every three to four weeks until the lesion has resolved in order to guide the treatment&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the radiation dose at our institution has been reduced by a factor of four in the&#xD;
      last several years as a result of peak kilovoltage (kVp) reduction dose modulation and&#xD;
      iterative reconstruction; cumulative radiation exposure carries an increased lifetime risk&#xD;
      for cancer and reducing exposure should be in keeping with the mandate, As Low As Reasonably&#xD;
      Achievable (ALARA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which does not expose the patient to any ionizing&#xD;
      radiation, has shown promise in detecting the obvious infiltrates secondary to cross&#xD;
      sectional ability and increasing resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, lung MRI had not been considered as a potential substitute for CT because of poor&#xD;
      signal- to- noise ratio (SNR) due to the low density of protons in lung parenchyma, the short&#xD;
      T2* relaxation time in the lungs secondary to air-tissue based susceptibility, and the&#xD;
      challenge of imaging over long scan times resulting in respiratory, vascular and cardiac&#xD;
      motion artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the recent development of MRI scanning techniques that provide an ultra short echo&#xD;
      time (UTE) along with oversampling of k-space center appear to overcome the above mentioned&#xD;
      drawbacks of MRI for imaging the lung/ chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this protocol, we will use optimized versions of the MRI UTE pulse sequence on our 3T&#xD;
      clinical scanners to perform breath-hold (BH) coronal and BH and free-breathing axial images.&#xD;
      Our goal is to comprehensively evaluate the lung without additional radiation with a&#xD;
      clinically reasonable scan time of &lt;30 minutes, especially with a proportionally high&#xD;
      percentage of young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled under 05-I-0213 with primary immune deficiencies may be considered for&#xD;
      participation in the sub study to evaluate the feasibility of novel MRI techniques compared&#xD;
      with standard CT imaging for pathology surveillance if they are undergoing medically&#xD;
      indicated CT imaging for the diagnosis or monitoring of infection.&#xD;
