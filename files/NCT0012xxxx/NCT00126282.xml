  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the efficacy of the medication D-Cycloserine in the reduction of&#xD;
      obsessions and compulsions in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). All study&#xD;
      participants will receive Exposure and Response Prevention, a common form of behavior therapy&#xD;
      for individuals with OCD. Half (50%) of the participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      placebo condition and the other half (50%) will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      D-Cycloserine. Because all participants will receive 10 sessions of behavior therapy, all&#xD;
      participants are expected to improve from this treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of Behavior Therapy (Exposure and Response Prevention; ERP) for OCD.&#xD;
      Specifically, it involves exposure to anxiety-provoking situations and response-prevention of&#xD;
      any rituals. ERP has shown to be effective for many individuals with OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments and treatment sessions are at no cost to the patients. 50% of the patients&#xD;
      will randomly be assigned to the D-Cycloserine (DCS) condition, and 50% of the patients will&#xD;
      be assigned to a placebo condition. D-Cycloserine is FDA-approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      Tuberculosis. However, recent research in other anxiety disorders has shown that&#xD;
      D-Cycloserine plus Behavior Therapy is more effective than Behavior Therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment study has two active conditions. That is, all patients will receive Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy and we do expect that everybody will improve from this treatment. However, it may be&#xD;
      that those patients in the DCS condition will improve somewhat more than those in the placebo&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be structured with homework and repeated assessments every 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Assessments are extremely important as they guide the treatment and provide the study&#xD;
      investigators necessary information about the treatment. The treatment consists of 10&#xD;
      sessions (twice a week) plus post-treatment and follow-up assessments at 1 and 6 months.&#xD;
