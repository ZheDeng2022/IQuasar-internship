      High amounts of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) can cause development of kidney stones&#xD;
      in children. Treatment for these children includes plenty of fluids, a low-salt diet and&#xD;
      medications such as potassium citrate. A major advantage of potassium citrate, as compared to&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide, is its lack of side effects. One problem the researchers and others have&#xD;
      observed is that some children continue to form kidney stones despite correction of&#xD;
      hypercalciuria with potassium citrate. One possible explanation is that in some individuals&#xD;
      potassium citrate therapy results in an excessive elevation of urine pH, a situation that may&#xD;
      predispose to calcium phosphate stone formation. In this study, the researchers will study&#xD;
      the effects of potassium citrate on urine chemistries and acid-base balance in three groups&#xD;
      of children aged 5-17 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children who are hypercalciuric stone formers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  healthy children without a history of hypercalciuria or kidney stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular attention will be paid to try to identify those who develop a very high urine pH&#xD;
      (&gt;8) and the factors leading to this metabolic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will try to learn whether it is the child's characteristics, the disease&#xD;
      manifestations, the dose of the drug, or a combination of the above which may be the cause of&#xD;
      the development of very alkaline urine. Based on the results, the researchers hope to be able&#xD;
      to better &quot;tailor&quot; the individual treatment for each child with kidney stones.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypercalciuria is a common clinical pediatric problem that in some children is associated&#xD;
      with renal stones. Most renal stones (80%) are formed by calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate&#xD;
      phases (apatite), and brushite (calcium monohydrogen phosphate). Hypercalciuria can be either&#xD;
      primary (accounts for the vast majority of children with calcium stones) or secondary.&#xD;
      Treatment for children with calcium stones involves non-pharmacological and pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions. Non-pharmacological interventions include high fluid intake, low sodium, and&#xD;
      potassium enhanced diet, with RDA calcium and protein. Historically, the specific treatment&#xD;
      for hypercalciuric stone formers has included thiazides, which reduce calciuria, lower the&#xD;
      urinary saturation of calcium oxalate and phosphate, and restore normal intestinal calcium&#xD;
      absorption. However thiazides induce hypokalemia and hypocitraturia, and the latter&#xD;
      attenuates the beneficial effects of the drug on stone formation. Currently, the drug of&#xD;
      choice replacing thiazides in treating idiopathic hypercalciuria is potassium citrate.&#xD;
      Potassium citrate is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and after being&#xD;
      excreted in the urine, it inhibits the crystallization of stone forming calcium salts by&#xD;
      binding the calcium ion, thus decreasing its urinary saturation and inhibiting the nucleation&#xD;
      and crystal growth of calcium oxalate; therefore, potassium citrate is an effective stone&#xD;
      inhibitor agent. A major advantage of potassium citrate is its lack of side effects. One of&#xD;
      the problems seen in clinical practice is that some children with primary hypercalciuria,&#xD;
      even after the calciuria is treated successfully with potassium citrate, continue to develop&#xD;
      stones. It has been suggested that an elevation in urine pH, seen in some patients treated&#xD;
      with potassium citrate, may result in an alkaline urinary milieu which promotes calcium&#xD;
      phosphate stone formation. In this study, the researchers plan to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      potassium citrate on urine chemistries and acid-base balance in children who are&#xD;
      hypercalciuric stone formers. The researchers will try to identify whether the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of potassium citrate supplementation on lowering urine calcium and increasing citrate&#xD;
      might be offset by too high urine pH (&gt;8) which could promote the formation of calcium&#xD;
      phosphate stones. Three groups of subjects aged 5-17 years will be studied: group 1 -&#xD;
      idiopathic hypercalciuric stone formers; group 2 - idiopathic hypercalciuric non-stone&#xD;
      formers; and group 3 - normocalciuric subjects. Three visits will be scheduled for each&#xD;
      participant, and the subjects will receive two doses of potassium citrate. Urine chemistries&#xD;
      and acid-base parameters will be measured. The researchers will try to learn whether it is&#xD;
      the child's characteristics, the disease manifestations, the dose of the drug, or a&#xD;
      combination of the above which may be the cause of the development of very alkaline urine.&#xD;
      Based on the study results, the researchers hope to be able to better &quot;tailor&quot; the individual&#xD;
      treatment for each child with kidney stones due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.&#xD;
