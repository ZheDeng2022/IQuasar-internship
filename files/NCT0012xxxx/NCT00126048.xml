  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are the most common type of cholesterol-lowering drugs used in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Recent research suggests that they may also have anti-inflammatory properties, in particular&#xD;
      by inhibition of an important inflammatory cell called a T lymphocyte. Asthma is&#xD;
      characterised by chronic inflammation in the airways, which is thought to be regulated by the&#xD;
      activity of T lymphocytes. The investigators have found the anti-inflammatory activity of a&#xD;
      statin drug in an experimental model of allergic asthma and they have recently shown the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of a statin, atorvastatin, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These&#xD;
      findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of statin-sensitive pathways in allergic&#xD;
      airways disease. The investigators plan to perform a &quot;proof of concept&quot; study to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of statin therapy in asthma. This randomised controlled trial will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that statins improve asthma control of patients with chronic asthma. The study&#xD;
      will be a 22-week randomised controlled trial comparing the effect on asthma control of oral&#xD;
      atorvastatin with that of a matched placebo. Each treatment will be administered for 8 weeks&#xD;
      separated by a 6-week washout period. A total of 52 allergic asthmatic patients will be&#xD;
      recruited to ensure that 44 patients complete the study. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      effect of statin therapy on lung function, symptom scores, exacerbation rates, as well as on&#xD;
      the measurement of airway inflammation in sputum and in the blood. This study will determine&#xD;
      the benefit of atorvastatin as an add-on therapy in asthma and establish if statins might&#xD;
      have a role in asthma management.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a 24-week randomised double blind crossover study comparing the effect on&#xD;
      asthma control of oral atorvastatin therapy (40 mg daily) with that of a matched placebo.&#xD;
      Each treatment will be administered for 8 weeks separated by a 6-week washout period and a&#xD;
      2-week run-in period prior to randomisation. Randomisation will be performed in sequential&#xD;
      blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed on 9 visits (13 occasions, as some visits are performed over 2&#xD;
      days): -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General medical history &amp; physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete asthma control questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry and reversibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sampling (35 ml) for IgE serology, lipids, liver function tests, creatinine kinase&#xD;
           and immunological tests (including sVCAM-1, Sicam-1, Spcam, E-selectin, CRP, MCP-1,&#xD;
           IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility check&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Issue diary card and peak flow meter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjustment of asthma medication to BTS guidelines if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Baseline clinical measurements-2weeks after visit 1(or 4 weeks if any change made to&#xD;
      baseline asthma medication [randomisation visit]):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete asthma control questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ATS score to assess severity of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry and reversibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induced sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled NO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway responsiveness to methacholine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomise patient if all criteria met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Issue diary card&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3-9 at 2, 4, 8, 14, 16, 18 &amp; 22 weeks after randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit the peak expiratory flow (PEF) diary will be retained and spirometry&#xD;
      performed. Patients will record morning and evening PEF measurements and daily symptoms&#xD;
      throughout the study. Airway responsiveness to methacholine, asthma control score, asthma&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire, induced sputum, exhaled NO and blood samples for immunological&#xD;
      tests, lipids and liver functions will be performed at visits 5, 6 and 9. Pregnancy tests&#xD;
      will be performed in all women of child-bearing age at visits 2 and 6 and subjects will be&#xD;
      informed about adequate contraception during and for one month after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject is found to have elevated lipids at baseline, the study would be continued and&#xD;
      the person referred to the appropriate specialist for further management after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject has an exacerbation during the wash-out phase of the study, visit 6 will be&#xD;
      delayed until the patient has been stable for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-asthma drug treatment: Patients will be asked to continue on their usual anti-asthma&#xD;
      drug therapy throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diary card recordings: asthma symptoms, PEF recordings and inhaled beta2-agonist use. PEF&#xD;
      measurements will be undertaken by patients at home using a mini-Wright peak flow meter&#xD;
      (Clement Clarke, Harlow, UK). The best of three measurements will be recorded twice daily&#xD;
      (pre-treatment) in the diary. Peak flow variability will be calculated from the difference&#xD;
      between the highest and lowest daily reading divided by the mean PEF reading multiplied by&#xD;
      100 (amplitude % mean). The average of 3 of the last 7 days PEF measurements before each&#xD;
      visit will be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbations of asthma: Mild exacerbation defined as one of the following for 2 consecutive&#xD;
      days: a drop in peak flow &gt; 20% below baseline value, use of more than 3 additional puffs of&#xD;
      reliever bronchodilator over 24 hours (excluding prophylactic puffs for exercise) as compared&#xD;
      with baseline value or night awakening due to asthma. A severe exacerbation will be defined&#xD;
      as any worsening of asthma control considered by the investigator or general practitioner&#xD;
      (GP) to require a short course of oral corticosteroids/hospitalisation or decrease in morning&#xD;
      peak flow to more than 30% below the baseline value on 2 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other indices of disease severity relating to asthma: Emergency/'out of hours' visit of&#xD;
      patients to the GP; GP visit to patient at home; GP or investigator prescribing extra&#xD;
      treatment; Accident and emergency (A &amp; E) department hospital attendance; hospital admission&#xD;
      and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry (FEV1, FVC), reversibility testing: Baseline pre-bronchodilator spirometric&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded from the best of three attempts using a dry wedge spirometer&#xD;
      (Vitalograph, Buckingham, UK) with measurements not varying by more than 5% or 0.2ml.&#xD;
      Spirometric measurements will be made before and after nebulised salbutamol (2.5mg).&#xD;
      Measurements will be performed at the same time of day (am or pm) for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total and specific IgE: Total serum IgE and IgE to common allergens (house dust mites, grass&#xD;
      pollen and cat dander) will be measured by enzyme immunoassay (Unicap System, Pharmacia UK&#xD;
      Ltd, Milton Keynes, UK). Total IgE &gt; 120 IU/L and specific IgE &gt;0.35 IU/L are considered&#xD;
      positive. Atopy will be defined as the presence of positive specific IgE to common allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway responsiveness: Bronchial challenge testing with methacholine will be undertaken using&#xD;
      Cockcroft's technique with concentrations of methacholine from 0.03 to 16 mg. A value of&#xD;
      methacholine hyperreactivity &gt; 16 mg/ml will be read as 16 mg/ml. Bronchial hyper-reactivity&#xD;
      is defined as a PC20 FEV1 of &lt; 8 mg/ml. Methacholine challenge testing will only be performed&#xD;
      in subjects who have a baseline FEV1 of greater than 60% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced sputum: An ultrasonic nebuliser is filled with 3% saline and subjects inhale the&#xD;
      nebulised solution for 7 minutes following pre-treatment with inhaled salbutamol. After this,&#xD;
      the nebuliser is filled with 4% saline and the nebulised solution is inhaled for 7 minutes.&#xD;
      Finally, the nebuliser is filled with 5% saline and the nebulised solution is inhaled for 7&#xD;
      minutes. At 5-minute intervals the inhalation is stopped to allow expectoration into a&#xD;
      polypropylene container. The sample is kept on ice until processed for cell counts and ultra&#xD;
      centrifugation to harvest the soluble phase of sputum. Cell counts will be performed and the&#xD;
      supernatant stored for analysis of inflammatory mediators. The test will not be performed on&#xD;
      subjects with an FEV1 &lt; 1 L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of exhaled NO: Exhaled NO will be measured on a chemiluminescence analyser&#xD;
      (LR2149, Logan Research Ltd., Rochester, Kent). The methods used to measure exhaled NO will&#xD;
      comply with the ATS guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergen-driven lymphocyte proliferative response in the blood: Peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (106 cells/ml) will be cultured with autologous plasma for 3 days (mitogen or&#xD;
      anti-CD3/28) or 7 days (recombinant Der p1 allergen) in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C/5%&#xD;
      CO2. Proliferation will be measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine (0.5uCi) for 16hr&#xD;
      before harvest onto glass fibre filters and counting in a beta counter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other immunological tests in blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luminex methodology for cytokine release &amp; FACS technology for co-stimulator molecule&#xD;
      expression will be employed to estimate altered cellular immune function in whole blood&#xD;
      cultures over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of lipids in blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol will be measured at screening and visits 5, 6&#xD;
      and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum biochemistry safety checks: Blood for renal function (urea and electrolytes) and liver&#xD;
      function tests (LFT's) will be performed before and after each treatment period and&#xD;
      creatinine kinase will be performed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations: A sample size of 44 will have 90% power to detect a difference in means&#xD;
      of 20L/min in peak expiratory flow [PEF] (primary endpoint), assuming a standard deviation of&#xD;
      differences of 40L/min, using a paired t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. A&#xD;
      total of 52 patients will be recruited to ensure that 44 patients complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis: The primary analysis is a comparison between treatments of&#xD;
      morning PEF. Secondary endpoints include: symptom scores, exacerbation rates, spirometry,&#xD;
      airway responsiveness to methacholine, sputum cell counts, eNO and immunological tests in&#xD;
      blood. The main analyses will be carried out by Normal Linear Models that include parameters&#xD;
      for patient, period and treatment. Some variables may be unsuitable for this, in which case&#xD;
      the within-patient treatment differences will be calculated and then analysed by either&#xD;
      t-tests or Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate.&#xD;
