  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many opioid-dependent individuals are also dependent on cocaine. Methadone is a widely used&#xD;
      and effective method for treating opioid dependence. However, it is not effective in treating&#xD;
      other drugs of abuse. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of another&#xD;
      drug, tiagabine, for treating cocaine dependence in opioid-dependent individuals already&#xD;
      receiving methadone treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For over 30 years, methadone has been used to treat opioid addiction. Since methadone is&#xD;
      effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms, it is used as a method of detoxification for&#xD;
      opiate addicts. However, methadone is not effective in treating other drugs of abuse, such as&#xD;
      cocaine. Tiagabine is a drug that enhances levels of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), a&#xD;
      chemical found in the brain and spinal cord. The objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of tiagabine in modifying cocaine-using behavior and reducing opiate withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms among newly admitted methadone-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will involve 120 participants&#xD;
      who are both cocaine- and opioid- dependent. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either tiagabine or placebo, while concurrently receiving methadone treatment.&#xD;
      Baseline cocaine use will be determined during the first two weeks of treatment. The study&#xD;
      will include three overlapping phases. The first phase will include a one-week fixed&#xD;
      methadone induction (Week 1), as well as flexible methadone stabilization (Weeks 2-13). Phase&#xD;
      two will consist of a 12-week treatment period (Weeks 2-13). This will consist of tiagabine&#xD;
      induction and stabilization. Phase three will include a 4-week taper, detoxification, or&#xD;
      transfer period (Weeks 14-17). After completion of treatment, a 3-month follow-up visit will&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
