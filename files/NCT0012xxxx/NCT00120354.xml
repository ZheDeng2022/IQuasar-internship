      This study will evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of lamivudine therapy and the&#xD;
      possibility of stopping therapy in patients whose hepatitis B is chronic, that is, long&#xD;
      lasting, and which has responded to treatment. Chronic hepatitis B, caused by a virus, is a&#xD;
      common form of liver disease affecting about 1 million Americans and about 5 percent of the&#xD;
      world's population. Health effects include a continuous state of being infectious and the&#xD;
      risk of transmitting hepatitis to other people, symptoms of liver disease, and development of&#xD;
      cirrhosis-that is, severe damage to the liver-and liver cancer. Lamivudine is a medication&#xD;
      that blocks hepatitis B effectively but does not make it disappear completely. Scientists&#xD;
      believe that the immune system must also be active to rid the body of the last traces of&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 and older who have chronic hepatitis B and are being treated with lamivudine&#xD;
      may be eligible to participate in this study. They will undergo a medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination and will be given lamivudine in 100 mg tablets to be taken as one&#xD;
      tablet, once each day. Patients will be asked to return to the outpatient clinic every 3&#xD;
      months, when they will undergo a brief interview and measurement of vital signs-such as blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse, and body weight. During the visits, they will fill out questionnaires about&#xD;
      any symptoms or side effects they have, and they will be seen by a doctor and have a brief&#xD;
      medical history and examination. There will be a collection of blood for complete blood&#xD;
      counts, liver enzymes, and hepatitis B virus. Extra blood tests may be done to analyze&#xD;
      patients' immune reactions to hepatitis B. Patients will also receive refills of their&#xD;
      lamivudine tablets. They will continue to be treated with lamivudine as long as it seems to&#xD;
      control the hepatitis infection and liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At intervals of about 1 year, patients will have ultrasound examinations, lasting about 1&#xD;
      hour, of the liver and abdomen. Then at intervals of about 5 years, patients will undergo&#xD;
      liver biopsies, which require a hospital stay of 2 to 3 days. A liver biopsy is done by&#xD;
      passing a needle through the skin into the liver to obtain a piece of liver about 2 inches&#xD;
      long and 1/16-inch in diameter. A small amount of bleeding probably occurs with most liver&#xD;
      biopsies. Internal bleeding is a risk, which may require that the patient stay in the&#xD;
      hospital a few days longer, for rest, observation and pain medicine. The biopsy provides&#xD;
      information that proves whether lamivudine is controlling the liver disease and preventing it&#xD;
      from worsening or progressing to cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of lamivudine include fatigue, muscle aches, fever and chills, sore throat,&#xD;
      nausea, stomach pain or cramps, and diarrhea. Serious side effects are rare, occurring in&#xD;
      less than 1% of people taking lamivudine. They include inflammation of the pancreas, nerve&#xD;
      damage, and buildup of lactic acid in the blood. About 25% of patients experience a temporary&#xD;
      worsening, or flare, of hepatitis during the first few months of treatment. If flares are&#xD;
      severe, it is important for researchers to determine whether they are caused by resistance to&#xD;
      lamivudine or by the immune system acting against the hepatitis B virus or another liver&#xD;
      condition. A flare of hepatitis can also occur when lamivudine is stopped, that is, a&#xD;
      withdrawal. In such situations, testing for hepatitis B virus levels and other liver&#xD;
      conditions is important. It may lead to other treatments or stopping lamivudine and taking&#xD;
      another medication instead. While patients are participating in the study, they will have a&#xD;
      careful evaluation of their hepatitis and general condition. They may have an improvement in&#xD;
      their disease as a result of long-term lamivudine therapy.&#xD;

      The major aims of this study are to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lamivudine&#xD;
      therapy and the possibility of stopping therapy in a cohort of patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B who have a maintained response to treatment. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue&#xD;
      with potent activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is approved for use in the United&#xD;
      States and is used extensively throughout the world to treat HBV and HIV infection.&#xD;
      Lamivudine is well tolerated and adverse events are rare. Its major shortcoming is the&#xD;
      development of antiviral resistance after prolonged therapy which results in loss of&#xD;
      effectiveness, marked by rise in viral levels and return of disease activity. Some patients,&#xD;
      however, have a maintained response to lamivudine therapy and in these individuals treatment&#xD;
      is continued indefinitely or until hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is lost and therapy&#xD;
      can be permanently stopped. This protocol will allow for the long-term treatment and&#xD;
      evaluation of these patients. Patients will be maintained on lamivudine at a dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      daily and seen every three months for interim medical history and serum testing for&#xD;
      aminotransferase levels and hepatitis B markers, with liver biopsies done every 5 years.&#xD;
      Lamivudine will be stopped if HBsAg is lost. The protocol also includes an option to attempt&#xD;
      withdrawal of therapy under controlled conditions focusing on inducing immune reactivity to&#xD;
      HBV and clearance of HBsAg. Patients will stop lamivudine for short periods (1 week, and&#xD;
      later for 2, 4 and 8 weeks) and be monitored during and for 12 weeks afterwards for&#xD;
      aminotransferase levels, HBV DNA levels and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to HBV antigens.&#xD;
      Patients who demonstrate significant worsening of hepatitis will not undergo further attempts&#xD;
      at withdrawal. The endpoint to successful therapy is defined as loss of hepatitis B surface&#xD;
      antigen (HBsAg) and development of antibody (anti-HBs).&#xD;
