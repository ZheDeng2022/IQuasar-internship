  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present prospective, randomized, double-blind, double dummy controlled&#xD;
      multicenter pilot study is to investigate whether abciximab, compared with aspirin, is able&#xD;
      to reduce the rate of recurrent ischemic strokes before and during carotid endarterectomy&#xD;
      [CEA] (primary endpoints); and the degree of carotid stenosis, number of microembolic signal&#xD;
      (MES) counts, number of ischemic infarcts at diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and amount of&#xD;
      intraluminal thrombus at pathological examination (secondary endpoints) in patients with&#xD;
      ischemic stroke due to a &gt;50% carotid stenosis who will undergo CEA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized trials have shown that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial for&#xD;
      stroke prevention in symptomatic severe or moderate stenoses of the carotid artery. Medical&#xD;
      treatment and timing of CEA after a recent stroke due to carotid narrowing, however, remain&#xD;
      controversial. Prospective, placebo-controlled acute stroke trials did either not screen for&#xD;
      or excluded carotid stenoses. The early experience with CEA resulted in a generally accepted&#xD;
      policy to delay surgery for 4 to 6 weeks for fear of clinical deterioration associated with&#xD;
      conversion of a bland to a hemorrhagic infarction. Subsequent studies suggest that&#xD;
      endarterectomy need not necessarily be postponed in patients with nondisabling strokes, which&#xD;
      was not confirmed by Giordano. Furthermore, not all patients recover fast enough to allow&#xD;
      early carotid surgery for a nondisabling stroke. The risk of a recurrent stroke while waiting&#xD;
      4 to 6 weeks for CEA was 9.5% in 74 prospectively studied patients and 21% in a retrospective&#xD;
      series of 19 patients. Similarly, 4.9% of the 103 medically treated patients with stroke and&#xD;
      severe carotid stenosis had recurrent ipsilateral strokes within 30 days after entry in the&#xD;
      NASCET trial. Analogous to coronary artery disease, carotid stenoses are assumed to become&#xD;
      symptomatic from plaque fissure leading to exposure of its contents to the blood, platelet&#xD;
      activation and thrombosis that may cause cerebral or ocular emboli and further narrows the&#xD;
      vessel lumen. Therefore, the administration of a drug, which reduces the amount of carotid&#xD;
      thrombosis and thus stabilizes the plaque would be expected to reduce the risk of recurrent&#xD;
      stroke and progression of carotid stenosis to occlusion, and allow to postpone CEA.&#xD;
      Furthermore, also intraoperative ischemic strokes due to cerebral emboli arising from a&#xD;
      friable plaque during dissection and cross-clamping of the carotid artery may decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective percutaneous coronary revascularization trials using balloon angioplasty,&#xD;
      stenting and atherectomy in patients with ischemic heart disease have shown that the addition&#xD;
      of abciximab, a blocker of platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors, during intervention&#xD;
      reduced the rates of thrombotic complications, particularly myocardial infarction, and death&#xD;
      within 30 days. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurred in 0.0-0.1% of 2535&#xD;
      patients treated with abciximab, medium-dose aspirin, low-dose heparin and endovascular&#xD;
      procedures. Endovascular coronary interventions disrupt or dissect the arterial wall, which&#xD;
      leads to exposure of plaque contents and components of the vascular wall to the blood,&#xD;
      resulting in platelet activation and thrombosis. Interestingly, also abciximab given 18 to 24&#xD;
      hours prior to intervention reduced the rate of thrombotic events suggesting some&#xD;
      stabilization of the coronary plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent prospective, placebo-controlled safety and pilot efficacy trial of abciximab in 74&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke treated within 24 hours from symptoms onset found that&#xD;
      abciximab caused no symptomatic ICH and showed a trend toward a higher rate of patients with&#xD;
      minimal residual disability. Thus, abciximab may be an attractive therapy option to prevent&#xD;
      stroke recurrence in patients with embolic carotid territory stroke due to carotid stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of microembolic signals (MES) detected in the middle cerebral artery (MCA)&#xD;
      downstream to a symptomatic carotid stenosis by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) has&#xD;
      been shown to predict the stroke risk, and is dramatically reduced in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke not caused by carotid artery disease during the administration of the GP&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban. These data suggest that the monitoring of MES in the MCA distal&#xD;
      to a symptomatic carotid stenosis before and after the administration of abciximab may be a&#xD;
      useful surrogate marker to assess the efficacy of this drug to prevent MES and stroke in&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) has a high&#xD;
      sensitivity for detecting acute brain ischemia, and recent DWI studies have assessed the&#xD;
      incidence of asymptomatic ischemic brain lesions in patients who underwent CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present prospective, randomized, double-blind, double dummy controlled&#xD;
      multicenter pilot study is to investigate whether abciximab compared with aspirin is able to&#xD;
      reduce the rate of recurrent ischemic strokes before and during CEA (primary endpoints), and&#xD;
      the degree of carotid stenosis, number of MES counts, number of ischemic infarcts at DWI and&#xD;
      amount of intraluminal thrombus at pathological examination (secondary endpoints) in patients&#xD;
      with ischemic stroke due to a &gt;50% carotid stenosis who will undergo CEA.&#xD;
