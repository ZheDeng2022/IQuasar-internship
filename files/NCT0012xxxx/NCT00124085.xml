  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a health services demonstration project that evaluates three methods of health care&#xD;
      delivery for the management of individuals with symptoms of asthma. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of a telephonic asthma disease management process, with and without a home&#xD;
      intervention program, on preventing asthma-related morbidity through patient/family asthma&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' central thesis is that comprehensive clinical disease management protocols&#xD;
      for the management of asthma will improve clinical outcomes; reduce fiscal resource&#xD;
      consumption; and improve both patient satisfaction and patient quality of life. Additionally,&#xD;
      individualized, in-home patient education and environmental assessment, when added to the&#xD;
      telephonic protocol, will further improve these measures. However, incremental improvement&#xD;
      will vary according to the population's access to care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial addresses the real-world concerns of asthma management through a disease&#xD;
      management approach that will assist both the patient and the primary care physician by&#xD;
      providing education, additional outpatient resources and additional access to health care&#xD;
      personnel. This approach will stress empowering the patient to participate in his or her own&#xD;
      health care at a higher level, which, in the case of asthma, is critical to wellness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cooperative network of San Antonio medical centers, civilian and military, with a&#xD;
      collective mission to care for military beneficiaries and the underserved patients of South&#xD;
      Texas, this trial will evaluate the clinical benefits, as well as the cost savings, of a&#xD;
      chronic disease management intervention in asthma. This study will fill a conspicuous gap in&#xD;
      the medical literature by addressing the effectiveness of disease management through a large,&#xD;
      decentralized, randomized, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISEASE MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will use asthma disease management protocols and educational materials developed&#xD;
      by the National Jewish Medical and Research Center. The program will be fully available in&#xD;
      both English and Spanish, allowing a direct test of its impact on the State's vulnerable&#xD;
      Hispanic population. Based on the principles of comprehensive disease management, National&#xD;
      Jewish Medical and Research Center has developed a disease management program for asthma&#xD;
      (DMP: Asthma) which addresses continuity of care by integrating traditional treatment methods&#xD;
      with a program that focuses on creating a stronger partnership between the patient and the&#xD;
      healthcare team, as well as greater patient empowerment. The primary program goal is&#xD;
      empowering patients with the tools and resources they need for better self management of&#xD;
      their prescribed treatment regimens and control of their environment. The program&#xD;
      incorporates practice guidelines outlined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&#xD;
      (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOME VISIT INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the demonstration will evaluate the addition of a home-based disease management&#xD;
      protocol focusing on patient education, to test for incremental improvement. Patients will be&#xD;
      taught about their disease (symptoms, treatment, appropriate action plans), as well as about&#xD;
      the healthcare system (how and when to access it). Based on the principles of comprehensive&#xD;
      disease management and the unique needs of South Texas residents, the South Texas Asthma&#xD;
      Management Program (STAMP) is designed for a diverse, mobile, underserved patient population.&#xD;
      The protocol delivers up-front home-based education and environmental assessment, with&#xD;
      follow-up visits focused on reinforcement of the earlier messages. The program ensures access&#xD;
      to a primary care provider for patients who lack this critical member of the healthcare team.&#xD;
      It also provides multiple resources for social services and guidance in appropriately&#xD;
      accessing the healthcare system. The goal of the program is to equip patients, who have&#xD;
      barriers to access due to a number of factors (lack of phone, language, remote location,&#xD;
      etc), to navigate the healthcare system and effectively receive the care they need.&#xD;
