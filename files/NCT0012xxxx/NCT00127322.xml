  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with heart failure either die or are admitted to the hospital in the first few&#xD;
      months after the condition is diagnosed. The reasons for this are currently unclear- but may&#xD;
      be due to worsening heart failure or other medical conditions such as angina, heart attack or&#xD;
      sudden electrical problems of the heart. The investigators propose to recruit and follow-up&#xD;
      450 people, with a new diagnosis of heart failure for a minimum of six months in a&#xD;
      multi-centre observational study at two hospital sites: The Hillingdon (Uxbridge) and The&#xD;
      Conquest (Hastings) hospitals. The total study duration will be two years. People will be&#xD;
      recruited after a diagnosis of heart failure is made and the study will assess reasons for&#xD;
      death or admission to hospital and the psychological impact of the condition on both patients&#xD;
      and their carers. This is an observational study and no change will be made to patients'&#xD;
      conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The high mortality and hospitalisation rate in the early period after diagnosis of heart&#xD;
           failure is related to progressive pump failure; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The high mortality in the early period after the diagnosis of heart failure is related&#xD;
           to co-morbid events- principally major coronary events such as myocardial infarction or&#xD;
           acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research should help to identify ways of improving the outlook for people with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed heart failure. The analysis of the data generated by this study will be supervised&#xD;
      by a statistician. Clinical and demographic data will be described using mean + standard&#xD;
      deviation, for continuous variables, and absolute numbers and percentages for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Group differences will be examined by t-tests for continuous variables and&#xD;
      Chi-square (x2) test for categorical variables. Survival will be reported in terms of&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves with differences analysed by Cox proportional hazards.&#xD;
