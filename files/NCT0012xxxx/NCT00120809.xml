  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is particularly harmful during pregnancy causing anemia in the mother and low birth&#xD;
      weight which, in turn, increases infant mortality. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      now recommends that all pregnant women who live in malaria endemic areas of Africa should&#xD;
      receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) at monthly intervals during the second and third&#xD;
      trimesters of pregnancy. Malaria is especially severe during first pregnancies and the value&#xD;
      of intermittent preventative treatment with SP during first pregnancies has been clearly&#xD;
      shown. However, it is less certain whether multigravidae, who are at less risk, also benefit&#xD;
      from intermittent preventative treatment with SP. To investigate this, a trial has been&#xD;
      conducted in Gambian multigravidae who were given intermittent preventative treatment with SP&#xD;
      or placebo during the second and third trimesters. The prevalence of anemia six weeks after&#xD;
      delivery, low birth weight and poor outcome of pregnancy in women in each group were studied.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to determine whether intermittent preventative treatment&#xD;
      (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) reduced the prevalence of anemia and low birth&#xD;
      weight in Gambian multigravidae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out in 14 mother and child health (MCH) clinics situated on the north&#xD;
      and south banks of the River Gambia near to the town of Farafenni in the centre of the&#xD;
      country. In this area, malaria is highly seasonal with an entomological inoculation rate of&#xD;
      10 -50 infectious bites per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who attended one of the study clinics during the trial period and who were&#xD;
      multigravidae were asked if they wished to join the study. If this was the case, an initial&#xD;
      screening questionnaire was administered to assess their suitability to do so. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria were - a pregnancy of more than 15 weeks gestation, a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration&#xD;
      of more than 7 g/dL, absence of a history of sensitivity to sulfonamides and absence of any&#xD;
      chronic underlying illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a woman met the eligibility criteria, informed written consent was sought and, if this was&#xD;
      given, the woman was formally recruited to the study and allocated a trial number and&#xD;
      randomised to receive either SP or placebo. Randomisation was done in blocks of 12; each&#xD;
      field worker was assigned a number of blocks to ensure balanced recruitment between centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were allocated to receive SP (pyrimethamine 25 mg + sulfadoxine 500 mg)(Cosmos&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Nairobi) or matching placebo. An initial dose of SP or placebo (three&#xD;
      tablets) was given at the time of enrolment into the trial and at all subsequent visits to&#xD;
      the antenatal clinic up to a maximum of four treatments. All women were given iron and folic&#xD;
      acid supplements as recommended by the Ministry of Health guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were visited at home twice per week by a project field worker to assess their health&#xD;
      and to encourage them to attend the ante-natal clinic at monthly intervals. Women with a high&#xD;
      risk of obstetric complications were encouraged to deliver in hospital but most women&#xD;
      delivered at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a delivery occurred in hospital or a health center a finger prick blood sample was&#xD;
      obtained and the birth weight was measured. In the case of women who delivered at home, the&#xD;
      weight of the new born baby was measured within 5 days of delivery and a finger prick blood&#xD;
      sample obtained for measurement of Hb concentration and preparation of blood films.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were visited at home six weeks after delivery when an additional blood sample was&#xD;
      obtained and one year later to investigate the health of their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin concentration was measured using a Hemocue (Hemocue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). Thick&#xD;
      blood films were stained with Giemsa and examined for malaria parasites. Each slide was read&#xD;
      by two microscopists. If discrepant results were obtained, the slide was read by a third&#xD;
      microscopist and the majority view accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial end-points&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary trial end-points were hemoglobin concentration at, or shortly after, birth and&#xD;
      birthweight or weight of the baby shortly after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a 20% reduction in the estimated risk of severe anemia (Hb &lt;7 g/dl) among&#xD;
      multigravidae, estimated to be 30% in the control group, with 80 % power at the 5% level of&#xD;
      significance and allowing for a 30% loss to follow-up it was calculated that a study with&#xD;
      1115 women in each arm was required. To show a reduction in the proportion of low birthweight&#xD;
      babies from the expected 18% in the control group to 12% in the SP group with 80% power it&#xD;
      was estimated that 2 x 1538 women would be needed. Thus, the target sample size was 3,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data were double entered and verified. Prior to the breaking of the code the data base&#xD;
      was locked and a copy given to the chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was done using S-plus and STATA. An analytical plan was prepared and&#xD;
      approved by the DSMB before the code was broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial oversight&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was monitored by a DSMB. It was conducted in line with the requirements of Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice.&#xD;
