      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a specialised nuclear medicine procedure that uses&#xD;
      positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to measure biological activity. The most&#xD;
      common of these radiolabeled tracers is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which is used to&#xD;
      determine abnormal glucose metabolism in tumours and other sites. It has general applications&#xD;
      in all areas where abnormal glucose metabolism may be present including in circumstances such&#xD;
      as differentiating the tumour from scar tissue; evaluating the presence of the tumour in&#xD;
      light of rising tumour markers and normal morphological imaging techniques; and assessing&#xD;
      response to therapy where other techniques are deemed to be unhelpful. The Cross Cancer&#xD;
      Institute has recently been funded to establish a PET centre, and this study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness, value and safety of PET scanning in a number of uncommon cancers in the&#xD;
      Canadian health care environment.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a specialised nuclear medicine procedure that uses&#xD;
      positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to measure biological activity. The most&#xD;
      common of these radiolabeled tracers is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which is used to&#xD;
      determine abnormal glucose metabolism in tumours and other sites. It has general applications&#xD;
      in all areas where abnormal glucose metabolism may be present including in circumstances such&#xD;
      as differentiating the tumour from scar tissue; evaluating the presence of the tumour in&#xD;
      light of rising tumour markers and normal morphological imaging techniques; and assessing&#xD;
      response to therapy where other techniques are deemed to be unhelpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cross Cancer Institute has recently been funded to establish a PET centre that will&#xD;
      establish a research programme to prove the effectiveness of PET scanning in the Canadian&#xD;
      health care environment and validate the data that have been developed in other jurisdictions&#xD;
      in specific oncologic indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective - The objective of the clinical trial is to establish the general utility&#xD;
      and value of 18F-FDG PET imaging in patients with known or suspected myeloma, sarcoma,&#xD;
      testicular cancer (seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors), endometrial cancer,&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, pancreatic, adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma and gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives - The secondary objective of the clinical trial is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      safety by documentation of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase II, diagnostic imaging, open label, single site,&#xD;
      clinical trial in patients with defined oncologic disease. The patient population will&#xD;
      consist of patients with suspected or known infrequently occurring cancers, which are not&#xD;
      covered by Protocol DX-FDG-001. This population includes patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      myeloma, sarcoma, testicular cancer (seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors),&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, transitional cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      bladder, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma and gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive a single IV injection of 18F-FDG. Imaging will be conducted 60&#xD;
      minutes after an average injection of 200 - 300 MBq of 18F-FDG in hydrated, fasted patients.&#xD;
      Images will be collected for 40 to 60 minutes in 5 - 7 body positions (total counts 5 to 15&#xD;
      million) using either the C-PET, Allegro or Gemini PET scanners located in Nuclear Medicine.&#xD;
      Standard transaxial images will be reconstructed from the collected data and can be&#xD;
      re-oriented into coronal or sagittal slices as required. The images will then be examined by&#xD;
      an experienced nuclear medicine physician with regard to normal physiological uptake of&#xD;
      18F-FDG. The location and intensity of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake will be noted and correlated&#xD;
      with clinical findings, and conventional imaging techniques, as available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enrol approximately 220 subjects, with an approximate maximum of 20 subjects&#xD;
      per specific tumour type (myeloma, sarcoma, testicular cancer [seminomatous and&#xD;
      non-seminomatous germ cell tumors], endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer,&#xD;
      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      mesothelioma and gastric cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each group, the investigators will calculate the positive predictive value (true positive&#xD;
      outcomes/true positive outcomes + false positive outcomes) of the 18F-FDG scan. They also&#xD;
      intend to evaluate the percentage of patients in which the 18F-FDG outcome affected patient&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluability of Study Subject Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects receiving 18F -FDG will be evaluated for safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects to be Studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 220 patients overall; approximately 20 in each cancer type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria for Selection of Study Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male or female. If female of child-bearing potential and outside of the window of 10&#xD;
           days since the last menstrual period, a negative serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Known or suspected primary or metastatic tumours of myeloma, sarcoma, testicular cancer&#xD;
           (seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors), endometrial cancer, ovarian&#xD;
           cancer, cervical cancer, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, renal cell&#xD;
           carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma and gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age greater than or equal to 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Able and willing to follow instructions and comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provide written informed consent prior to participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Karnofsky Performance Scale score 60 - 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Having had surgery or radiotherapy within 10 days of the planned imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nursing or pregnant females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age less than 15 years.&#xD;
