  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of mammography and increased awareness of breast cancer has resulted in detection&#xD;
      of smaller tumors, the majority of which would not have had metastasized to the axillary&#xD;
      lymph nodes. The sentinel node (SN) is presumably the first echelon node in the axillary&#xD;
      basin to become involved with metastatic breast cancer cells. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in&#xD;
      operable breast cancer has gained popularity since it promises to avoid treatment of the&#xD;
      axilla when the nodes are negative for metastasis. Advances in technology (radio-guided SNB)&#xD;
      is associated with a risk of false negative SN reporting in 4-12%. The consequence of leaving&#xD;
      behind untreated positive non-sentinel nodes in the axilla is a potential risk for axillary&#xD;
      recurrence. Axillary sampling is a simple and inexpensive procedure in which level I nodes&#xD;
      are removed by a blind dissection. The investigators critically analyzed the efficacy of both&#xD;
      the procedures separately in consecutive pilot studies i.e., targeted SNB versus blind&#xD;
      axillary sampling. The current study is planned as a prospective comparison study where a&#xD;
      patient undergoes both the procedures in the same surgical intervention and thus provides an&#xD;
      immediate comparison of the two techniques with respect to their effectiveness.&#xD;

      Axillary node dissection in operable breast cancer provides an accurate way of staging the&#xD;
      disease. With increased popularity of screening and earlier diagnosis, most women do not&#xD;
      harbor axillary metastases, in which case, axillary lymph node dissection could be avoided.&#xD;
      Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) gained rapid popularity because the technique could predict the&#xD;
      presence of metastases in downstream lymph nodes, so that surgery and its associated&#xD;
      morbidity could be safely avoided. SNB can be performed with injection of isosulphan blue&#xD;
      subdermally and peritumorally alone or in combination with radio-guidance with technetium-99&#xD;
      labeled colloid injection. Radio-guided SNB is superior to the blue dye in identifying the&#xD;
      SN, and a combined technique is still better. However, it failed to accomplish its objective&#xD;
      in a proportion of cases where the sentinel node could not be identified even with expensive&#xD;
      gadgetry like gamma probes. An overview of sentinel node studies showed that the node was&#xD;
      found in only 85-90% of patients and the overall sensitivity in correctly predicting the&#xD;
      negative axilla by sentinel node biopsy was only 94%. There was a false negative rate of 6.2%&#xD;
      wherein the sentinel node was reported negative in presence of metastasis to non-sentinel&#xD;
      nodes in axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary sampling was a forerunner to the targeted sentinel node biopsy. The main objective&#xD;
      of axillary sampling at that time was to detect a positive axilla. More recently it is being&#xD;
      tested as an accurate predictor of axillary status for absence of metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a definite learning curve in SNB with higher non-detection rates and false negative&#xD;
      rate in the earlier phases of the study compared to the later part. This learning curve is&#xD;
      absent in axillary sampling, which requires no specialized training or expensive equipment&#xD;
      and has a 100% detection rate. The mean number of sentinel nodes that were identified, as&#xD;
      reported in various SNB studies, was 2.13 (with a range of mean numbers of SN dissected being&#xD;
      1.3-3.1). The actual range of number of sentinel nodes dissected was 1 - 8, which is quite&#xD;
      comparable to the average 4 -5 nodes that are required to be sampled for accurately&#xD;
      predicting the axilla. Badwe and Mittra have concluded that sentinel node biopsy is expensive&#xD;
      and is driven by lure for technology and fashion, and has little advantage over axillary node&#xD;
      sampling in predicting a negative axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a validation study of lower axillary sampling versus total axillary clearance&#xD;
      reported by Steele et al in 1985 with a sensitivity of 100% and an accuracy of 99.5%. The&#xD;
      more recent validation study of 5-node axillary sampling compared to level I-II dissection&#xD;
      was reported from Stockholm on 416 operable breast cancer patients. The noteworthy finding&#xD;
      was that in this study node sampling had a 100% yield, 97.3% sensitivity and a negative&#xD;
      predictive value of 98.5% with a false negative rate of 2.7% in predicting the axilla. The&#xD;
      comparative figures for SNB in the world overview are 94% sensitivity, 97% negative&#xD;
      predictive value and a false negative rate of 6.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies of SNB and axillary sampling at TMH Sentinel node biopsy by Isosulphan&#xD;
      blue injection was performed as a validation pilot study at the Breast unit in TMH between&#xD;
      April 1999 to November 2000 in 100 women with clinically node negative operable breast&#xD;
      cancer. SN was found in 77% cases with a false negative rate of 16.6% and sensitivity of&#xD;
      76.1%. The procedure had a negative predictive value of 90.4% cases in predicting the rest of&#xD;
      the axilla. The number of sentinel nodes dissected was 1-6 with an average of 1.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary sampling was subsequently performed as a pilot study between May 2001 to August 2002&#xD;
      in 97 women with a similar clinical stage as above. Nodes were found in all patients (100%)&#xD;
      in level I with a false negative reporting in 11% cases, sensitivity of 88.9%, negative&#xD;
      predictive value of 100% and an average of 4 nodes dissected (range from 1-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing countries with limited resources, it may not be feasible for every institution&#xD;
      to acquire a gamma probe. Axillary sampling may thus be a comparably cheaper and practical&#xD;
      alternative to SNB. Axillary sampling and sentinel node biopsy should, however, be compared&#xD;
      with respect to the resultant morbidity and false negative rates before adopting either&#xD;
      method as standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nottingham group have recently published the results of a prospective study to find out&#xD;
      the value of adding SNB to 4-node axillary sampling (4NAS) within the same patient. Two&#xD;
      hundred patients were accrued and 4NAS was found to have a lower false negative rate compared&#xD;
      to SNB. We propose to compare the two procedures in a clinical trial with a comparison of&#xD;
      respective false negative rates and sensitivity as the immediate end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will be recruited in the study after obtaining an informed consent and&#xD;
      centrally registered at the Clinical Research Secretariat at the Tata Memorial Hospital,&#xD;
      Mumbai.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiolabeled Tc-99 colloid or phytate (500 Mbq) will be injected into the primary tumor 2&#xD;
      hours before surgery. A localized scintiscan will then be performed to confirm the&#xD;
      radiolabeling of the sentinel node before surgery and for documentation. Isosulphan blue dye&#xD;
      will be injected subdermal (0.5ml) over the tumor and intraparenchymal (3-4ml) towards the&#xD;
      axilla 10-15mins before incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary sampling will be performed first. A 2 cm incision will be made in the middle third&#xD;
      of the proposed axillary clearance incision below the axillary hairline. All axillary fat and&#xD;
      tissue in an area of 2cm diameter will be dissected out. The anterior limit of dissection is&#xD;
      the posterior border of pectoralis major, the posterior limit of dissection is the anterior&#xD;
      border of latissimus dorsi muscle, upper limit of dissection is the intercostobrachial nerve,&#xD;
      and base is serratus anterior muscle on lateral chest wall. In those cases that undergo a&#xD;
      mastectomy, the tissue in the axillary tail will be identified first and then removed as&#xD;
      specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of sampling procedure, the remaining axillary tissue will be checked for any&#xD;
      other node showing a blue discoloration or radioactivity and the same will be documented as&#xD;
      found outside of axillary sampling. Axillary clearance will then be separately completed in&#xD;
      all patients by standard technique after extending the incision without waiting for the&#xD;
      frozen section report.&#xD;
