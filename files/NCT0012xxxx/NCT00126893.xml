&#xD;
               1. Subjects &gt; 70 years of age with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Subjects with newly diagnosed AML who do not experience a CR after at least 2&#xD;
                  cycles of induction chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects with AML who do not experience a second or greater complete remission&#xD;
                  after 1 but no more than 2 cycles of re-induction chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects with recurrence of AML after a remission duration of less than three&#xD;
