  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine has been cited as the primary drug threat in the United States. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if cocaethylene, used as a prototype drug, is a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment for cocaine dependence.&#xD;

      Currently, there are no medications available to specifically treat cocaine addiction.&#xD;
      Cocaethylene is an active metabolite of cocaine and has a similar chemical structure to&#xD;
      cocaine. The purpose of this study is to determine whether substitution therapy with&#xD;
      cocaethylene is a safe and effective treatment for cocaine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will occur in 3 parts. In Part 1, the individual&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of an intravenous dose of cocaethylene will be determined in order to&#xD;
      estimate individualized cocaethylene infusion rates and pharmacokinetic parameters. This will&#xD;
      provide important information on how cocaethylene is processed by the body. In Part 2, an&#xD;
      infusion of cocaethylene, producing a venous plasma concentration of 200 ng/ml, will be&#xD;
      administered over an 8-hour period. Clinical monitoring and blood sampling will occur in&#xD;
      order to determine the safety profile of cocaethylene. During Part 3, the ability of&#xD;
      cocaethylene to modify the acute effects of intravenous cocaine will be determined.&#xD;
      Cocaethylene will be administered in plasma concentrations of 0 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, or 200 ng/ml&#xD;
      over an 8-hour period. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a challenge&#xD;
      intravenous dose of cocaine (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) or placebo at the 4-hour mark of&#xD;
      cocaethylene infusion. Following the initial 8-hour period, cocaethylene infusion will be&#xD;
      continued for an additional 5 hours. Behavioral and physiological measures will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the study sessions at predetermined times to evaluate whether tolerance to&#xD;
      cocaethylene develops. These measures will also help to determine whether cocaethylene&#xD;
      modifies or produces tolerance to the effects of an acute dose of cocaine.&#xD;
