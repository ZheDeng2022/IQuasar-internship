    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal failure have a markedly higher mortality because of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in comparison with the normal population. Disorders in the calcium&#xD;
      metabolism, such as calcification of the vessel walls, occur very frequently. There are&#xD;
      indications that calcium channel blockers are capable of lowering the cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to carry out a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      multicenter study in order to find out if the calcium channel blocker amlodipine is able to&#xD;
      reduce the mortality of patients with end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation will be carried out after suitable explanation and written informed consent&#xD;
      in 356 patients aged between 18 and 90 years with end-stage renal failure and chronic&#xD;
      haemodialysis treatment. The patients will be randomized to either treatment with amlodipine&#xD;
      10 mg/day or placebo. The occurrence of events will be documented and evaluated prospectively&#xD;
      over a period of 30 months.&#xD;

        3. Summary of the ADAM Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with end-stage renal failure have a markedly higher mortality because of&#xD;
           cardiovascular events in comparison with the normal population. Disorders in the calcium&#xD;
           metabolism, such as calcification of the vessel walls, occur very frequently. There are&#xD;
           indications that calcium channel blockers are capable of lowering the cardiovascular&#xD;
           mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure. It is intended to carry out a&#xD;
           prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in order to&#xD;
           find out if the calcium channel blocker amlodipine is able to reduce the mortality of&#xD;
           patients with end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigation will be carried out after suitable explanation and written informed&#xD;
           consent in 356 patients aged between 18 and 90 years with end-stage renal failure and&#xD;
           chronic haemodialysis treatment. The patients will be randomized to either treatment&#xD;
           with amlodipine 10 mg/day or placebo. The occurrence of events will be documented and&#xD;
           evaluated prospectively over a period of 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sponsor:&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is no sponsor for this study. The study was initiated by the study directors&#xD;
           themselves. The Pfizer company (Karlsruhe) is supporting the project financially and&#xD;
           materially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Trial Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is planned to carry out the study in the Berlin/Brandenburg area and in North Rhine&#xD;
           Westphalia. The doctors responsible in the respective Trial Centers will be notified to&#xD;
           the Ethics Committee immediately after enrolment. At present there are no enrolled Trial&#xD;
           Centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ethics Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present Trial Protocol has been presented to the Ethics Committee of the Free&#xD;
           University of Berlin (chairman: Prof. Dr. med. D. Ganten) for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Other Ethics Committees:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This Trial Protocol has so far not been presented to any other institutions for&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Classification of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a Phase IV study. The study will be carried out with a licensed medicament&#xD;
           (amlodipine) with a licensed indication (hypertension). This is a clinical study in&#xD;
           patients who are legally competent and who are capable of understanding the nature,&#xD;
           importance and scope of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Legal Basis German Medicines Act&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Justification and Aim of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study is to show that the administration of the calcium antagonist&#xD;
           amlodipine significantly reduces mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Amlodipine reduces the mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current Status of Research and Basis for the Performance of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The life expectancy of patients with end-stage renal failure is nowadays still less than&#xD;
           10 years. The annual mortality rate of patients with end-stage renal failure is almost&#xD;
           25%. Death of patients with end-stage renal failure is frequently the consequence of&#xD;
           cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular events in patients with dialysis-dependent renal&#xD;
           failure are particularly frequently seen because the traditional risk factors, such as&#xD;
           diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking, are frequently present in this&#xD;
           group. In addition, there are also numerous risk factors associated with the renal&#xD;
           failure, such as increased oxidative stress, inflammatory vascular changes, excess salt&#xD;
           and water load. Important cofactors for the increased mortality in dialysis patients are&#xD;
           an inadequate removal of the &quot;uremia toxins&quot; or a uremia-induced malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients with end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure, increased calcification of&#xD;
           the coronary vessels, of the cardiac valves and other myocardial tissue, as well as an&#xD;
           increase in the calcium x phosphate product is frequently seen. An association is also&#xD;
           seen with an increased mortality. Block and colleagues were able to show that the&#xD;
           relative mortality risk in patients with an increased calcium x phosphate product is&#xD;
           increased and that increased cardiovascular causes of death could be seen. An increased&#xD;
           calcium x phosphate product potentiates the calcification of arterial vascular walls and&#xD;
           thus produces reduced elasticity. Using electron beam computer tomography it could be&#xD;
           shown that calcification in the region of the coronary vessels was observed much more&#xD;
           frequently in patients with end-stage renal failure than in healthy control persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the general population it has been shown that calcium channel blockers are very good&#xD;
           vasodilators and antihypertensive drugs. In the general population calcium antagonists&#xD;
           of the types long-acting dihydropyridines, verapamil or diltiazem are used&#xD;
           preferentially for the treatment of elderly patients or patients with isolated systolic&#xD;
           hypertension. However, patients with end-stage renal failure also profit from the&#xD;
           administration of calcium channel blockers, as these reduce the blood pressure, reduce&#xD;
           the uremia toxin-induced calcinosis of the vessels and produce a reduced influx of&#xD;
           calcium into the vessel walls. Calcium channel blockers inhibit macrophage&#xD;
           proliferation. Calcium channel blockers can also reduce raised calcium levels in&#xD;
           B-lymphocytes of patients with end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a preliminary retrospective investigation, the study directors investigated the&#xD;
           effects of the administration of calcium antagonists on mortality. 188 patients with&#xD;
           end-stage renal failure and chronic regular haemodialysis were observed for 30 months&#xD;
           from July 1998. Parameters such as age, sex, laboratory values, clinical data and&#xD;
           dialysis dose were recorded. Up to December 2000 51 patients had died (27%). The&#xD;
           investigation showed advanced age and low body-mass index to be causes of increased&#xD;
           mortality. In contrast, the availability of calcium channel blockers was favorable.&#xD;
           After statistical analysis of the data using a Cox risk-regression model it was found&#xD;
           that the patients taking the calcium channel blockers showed a significantly lower&#xD;
           mortality (relative risk 0.22 [95% confidence interval 0.17-0.67] p &lt; 0.001). This&#xD;
           preliminary investigation thus shows that the use of calcium channel blockers&#xD;
           significantly lowers mortality in patients with end-stage dialysis-dependent renal&#xD;
           failure who have an increased mortality due to cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2 Ethical Aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with end-stage renal failure and existing, or a history of known, arterial&#xD;
           hypertension have a clearly increased mortality because of cardiovascular events in&#xD;
           comparison with a normal population. So far there are no medicaments that have been&#xD;
           demonstrated in studies to reduce the mortality of patients with dialysis-dependent&#xD;
           renal failure. In a preliminary study there were indications that calcium channel&#xD;
           blockers, and in particular amlodipine, lead to a reduction of cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigation will be carried out after appropriate explanation has been given and&#xD;
           written informed consent has been obtained from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Provisions for Monitoring of the Study by the Ethics Committee:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The applicants, Prof. Dr. med. M. Tepel and Dr. med. M. van der Giet, are prepared to&#xD;
           enable authorized members of the Ethics Committee to observe the trial at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3 Study Timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Justification of the Timetable: Every patient will be observed for a period of 30&#xD;
           months. Patients with end-stage renal failure of non-diabetic origin have a five-year&#xD;
           survival expectation of about 35 - 40%, whereas patients with end-stage renal failure of&#xD;
           diabetic origin have a five-year survival rate of about 20% (United States Renal Data&#xD;
           System: Annual Data Report 2000. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2000; 36 Suppl. 2, p. 127). It is&#xD;
           therefore to be assumed that within 30 months about 35 - 40% of the examined patients&#xD;
           will die. This period should be sufficient to observe any possible positive effects of&#xD;
           amlodipine on mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The medicinal preparation is licensed for long-term therapy, so that negative effects&#xD;
           due to the medicament are not to be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. General Planning:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with two groups will&#xD;
           be carried out in order to show reduction of the mortality in patients with end-stage&#xD;
           renal failure. The study will be carried out over a period of 30 months. A check will be&#xD;
           made every six months to see if an event has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and who are prepared to participate in&#xD;
           the study will be randomly assigned at the first issue of the study medicament to one of&#xD;
           the groups. The patient will receive either amlodipine 10 mg or placebo. Both&#xD;
           medicaments will be given as a single daily dose in the form of tablets in the morning.&#xD;
           The study medication will not be changed during the course of the study, insofar as no&#xD;
           side-effects are observed. Patients who are already taking a calcium channel blocker,&#xD;
           and in whom a withdrawal phase is possible according to the opinion of their physician,&#xD;
           will first undergo a wash-out phase of 4 weeks before starting with the double-blind&#xD;
           treatment. During the study, the administration of all other necessary medicaments for&#xD;
           the patient, apart from the administration of calcium channel blockers, is permitted. A&#xD;
           check will be carried out at intervals of 6 months to see whether an event has occurred.&#xD;
           Each patient will be observed for a period of 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Course of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 1 (initial examination): First of all the patient will be informed about the&#xD;
           study. If the patient consents to participate, a short clinical history and physical&#xD;
           examination will be carried out. Then the criteria of inclusion and exclusion will be&#xD;
           checked. The blood pressure, pulse rate and body mass index will be determined.&#xD;
           Subsequently the patient will be asked about previous diseases, with specific&#xD;
           questioning about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke&#xD;
           (including transitory ischaemic attacks [TIA] and prolonged reversible ischaemic&#xD;
           neurological deficit [PRIND]) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The patient&#xD;
           will be enrolled in the study if he/she fulfils the inclusion criteria and there are no&#xD;
           exclusion criteria. Should the patient be taking a calcium channel blocker at the time&#xD;
           of enrolment in the study, this will be withdrawn insofar as the attending physician&#xD;
           considers that this is possible. Other existing medication will be retained. The&#xD;
           interval between Visit 1 and Visit 2 is one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 2 (start of study, month 0): The patient's current medication will be recorded&#xD;
           (with particular reference to the following concomitant medication: ACE inhibitors,&#xD;
           AngII blockers, statins, erythropoietin, beta-blockers). Questions will be asked about&#xD;
           newly developed diseases with special attention to the occurrence of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
           coronary heart disease, stroke (including transitory ischaemic attacks [TIA] and&#xD;
           prolonged reversible ischaemic neurological deficit [PRIND]) and peripheral arterial&#xD;
           occlusive disease. The blood pressure, pulse rate and body mass index will be recorded.&#xD;
           Study medication for 28 weeks will be issued. The patient will be informed about taking&#xD;
           the medicament. Laboratory values will be recorded in the course of the routine&#xD;
           monitoring of the patients (abbreviated and extensive routine laboratory examinations:&#xD;
           hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, calcium, calcium x phosphate product, urea,&#xD;
           serum creatinine, total protein, parathyroid hormone, cholesterol, triglycerides and&#xD;
           ferritin). The patient will be asked about current symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visits 3 - 6 (follow-up observation, months 6, 12, 18 and 24): The current medication of&#xD;
           the patient will be recorded (with especial emphasis on the following concomitant&#xD;
           medications: ACE inhibitors, AngII blockers, statins, erythropoietin, beta-blockers).&#xD;
           Questions will be asked about newly developed diseases with special attention to the&#xD;
           occurrence of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke (including transitory&#xD;
           ischaemic attacks [TIA] and prolonged reversible ischaemic neurological deficits&#xD;
           [PRIND]) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The blood pressure, pulse rate and&#xD;
           body mass index will be recorded. The study medication will be counted. New supplies of&#xD;
           study medication for 28 weeks will be issued. Questions will be asked about&#xD;
           side-effects. The patient will be asked about current symptoms. Laboratory values will&#xD;
           be recorded in the course of the routine monitoring of the patient (abbreviated routine&#xD;
           laboratory: hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, calcium, calcium x phosphate&#xD;
           product, urea, serum creatinine, total protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit 7 (study closure, month 30): The current medication of the patient will be&#xD;
           recorded (with especial emphasis on the following concomitant medications: ACE&#xD;
           inhibitors, AngII blockers, statins, erythropoietin, beta-blockers). Questions will be&#xD;
           asked about newly developed diseases with special attention to the occurrence of&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke (including transitory ischaemic&#xD;
           attacks [TIA] and prolonged reversible ischaemic neurological deficits [PRIND]) and&#xD;
           peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The blood pressure, pulse rate and body mass&#xD;
           index will be recorded. The study medication will be counted. Questions will be asked&#xD;
           about side-effects. The patient will be asked about current symptoms. Laboratory values&#xD;
           will be recorded in the course of the routine monitoring of the patients (abbreviated&#xD;
           and extensive routine laboratory: hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, calcium,&#xD;
           calcium x phosphate product, urea, serum creatinine, total protein, parathyroid hormone,&#xD;
           cholesterol, triglycerides and ferritin).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completing the study, the data will be recorded after unblinding and evaluated&#xD;
           (duration about 2 months) and prepared for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Checks on the Observation of the Protocol: The study directors will employ a monitor for&#xD;
           the duration of the study who will visit all the centers at intervals of six months and&#xD;
           check observation of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Study Medication (trial preparation, blinding, concomitant medication):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Amlodipine 10 mg will be used as the trial preparation Amlodipine is a calcium&#xD;
           antagonist that has already been the licensed within the European Union for the&#xD;
           indications: essential hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris (angina on effort).&#xD;
           Placebo will be used as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3.1 Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All members of the study team and all personnel who are involved in the course of the&#xD;
           study will work under blind conditions throughout the entire period of the trial. The&#xD;
           study directors and investigators will be provided with the randomization code in sealed&#xD;
           envelopes. The placebo and active drug do not differ in form, color, odor or weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3.2 Actions and Unblinding for Side-Effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding is essential in order to maintain the integrity of the study. Should, however,&#xD;
           an emergency develop in which knowledge of the substance administered is necessary, then&#xD;
           the blinding can be broken by the attending physician. If unblinding takes place, the&#xD;
           responsible study directors must be contacted. All cases of unblinding will be recorded&#xD;
           in the study record sheets. The study directors may be contacted in emergencies at any&#xD;
           time by the telephone hotline (+ 49-30 8445 2305). Reports on serious adverse events&#xD;
           should be made within 24 hours. These reports of serious adverse events must be sent to&#xD;
           the study directors (Prof. Dr. med. M. Tepel or Dr. med. van der Giet, Freie Universität&#xD;
           Berlin, Universitätsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik IV, Hindenburgdamm&#xD;
           30, 12200 Berlin, Tel/Fax: +49-30 8445 2305). Other side-effects will be recorded by the&#xD;
           attending physician, documented and registered at the control visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3.3 Concomitant Medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients may take all the medicines that their attending physicians consider to be&#xD;
           necessary throughout the course of the study. Exception: the administration of a calcium&#xD;
           channel blocker during the study is not permissible. The medication will be recorded in&#xD;
           detail at the regular monitoring visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Primary Parameters: The primary parameter will be the survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Secondary Parameters: No secondary parameters will be investigated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Methods for Recording Efficacy and Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be encouraged to maintain their diet and regular physical exercise&#xD;
           throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be followed up at intervals of 6 months. At these visits, side-effects&#xD;
           and changes in vital status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the medicament is issued for the first time, all patients will be observed for 2&#xD;
           hours after taking it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Compliance: The study medication and the concomitant medicaments will be checked at&#xD;
           6 month intervals. If necessary, the patients will be reminded of the necessity to take&#xD;
           the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Data Management: All data for the study will be entered in the Clinical Record Forms&#xD;
           and submitted for central analysis of the data (study directors). One copy of the&#xD;
           Clinical Record Form will be retained by the attending physician. The study directors&#xD;
           will ensure that the data are analyzed and statistically evaluated. Current Data&#xD;
           Protection Regulations will be observed. The data will be analyzed in an anonymised&#xD;
           form. The patient must consent to the data being recorded in the context of the clinical&#xD;
           trial, being analyzed and being submitted at the request of the pertinent supervisory&#xD;
           authorities. Each patient will be assigned a number on enrolment in the study and his&#xD;
           /her initials will be recorded. Unequivocal patient identification will be possible via&#xD;
           a patient identification list consisting of the patient number, initials, date of birth,&#xD;
           name and first name. All data will be archived for a period of 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 Statistical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This 30-month-long, double-blind, placebo-control study is intended to show that the&#xD;
           administration of calcium antagonists reduces the mortality of patients undergoing&#xD;
           regular haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           H0: the mortality rates are the same; HA: the mortality rates are different.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The log-rank test will be used to test for possible statistically significant&#xD;
           differences (probability p = 0.05, two-tailed test).&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is not intended to carry out any interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Estimation of Number of Cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size is calculated by comparison of two survival curves (Computer-Programm:&#xD;
           &quot;n-Query&quot;: Log-rank-Test of survival in two groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The size of the sample is calculated on the basis of alpha = 0.05, power 80%, two-tailed&#xD;
           test for a difference of 14% between amlodipine and placebo with a sample size of 163&#xD;
           per group (log-rank test or survival in two groups, followed for fixed time, constant&#xD;
           hazard ratio). Expected mortality rate: placebo 40% and amlodipine 26% .&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is assumed that 30 patients will drop out of the study from the two groups together&#xD;
           (e.g. change of dialysis center).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, 356 patients (178 patients amlodipine versus 178 patients placebo) are to be&#xD;
           investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Financing of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be supported financially and materially by the Pfizer company&#xD;
           (Karlsruhe). The company will provide the medication/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. Miscellaneous:&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Insurance and Liability:&#xD;
&#xD;
           An application for patient insurance has been made to the Gerling company and will be&#xD;
           accordingly submitted.&#xD;
