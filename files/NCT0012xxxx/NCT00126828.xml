  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have limited stage small cell lung cancer are presently treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Despite this aggressive treatment the vast majority&#xD;
      of patients will have their cancer recur after treatment. A recurrence is not curable at this&#xD;
      time, therefore efforts to reduce recurrence rates are desirable. Due to the sensitivity of&#xD;
      surrounding structures in the chest to radiation, it has not been possible to give doses that&#xD;
      can cure most tumours. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy is a special form of&#xD;
      radiation therapy that allows doctors to reduce the amount of radiation dose to normal&#xD;
      tissues and therefore reduce toxicity and in turn, let them safely increase the dose to&#xD;
      tumours. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of&#xD;
      three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be a more effective treatment.&#xD;
      If the treatment is found to be safe for the first group of patients, then the total&#xD;
      radiation dose will be increased for the next group of patients who are treated on this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Radiotherapy represents one of the primary treatment modalities for patients with limited&#xD;
      stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). With contemporary concurrent radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, approximately 20% of patients survive 5 years. While distant metastases are&#xD;
      common, local (intrathoracic) failures are common as well, occurring in 40% of treated&#xD;
      patients. Reducing local failure rates may lead to improved survival for these patients.&#xD;
      There appears a growing body of data, which suggests a radiation dose response relationship&#xD;
      for SCLC. However, the close proximity of critical normal structures, such as the spinal cord&#xD;
      and esophagus, to the primary tumour limits the prescription dose in conventional&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Three Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) offers the possibility of&#xD;
      reducing normal tissue irradiation and hence reducing the treatment toxicity while&#xD;
      maintaining the dose of radiation to the tumour. Another strategy is accelerated&#xD;
      fractionation, which shortens the treatment time by allowing less opportunity for tumour cell&#xD;
      repopulation. The use of 3DCRT with larger radiation fraction size should maintain&#xD;
      satisfactory treatment related toxicity while permitting the potential gains of accelerated&#xD;
      fractionation and dose escalation. In this study, patients with limited stage SCLC who are&#xD;
      eligible will be treated with a large field (low dose) radiotherapy followed by accelerated&#xD;
      3DCRT given concurrently with standard Cisplatin Etoposide chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the maximum tolerable dose of radiotherapy for SCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess treatment toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess quality of life and retention of pulmonary function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess progression-free survival on this regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schema: Eligible patients will receive 4 cycles of Cisplatin Etoposide chemotherapy. Thoracic&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be given concurrently starting with cycle #2 of chemotherapy. Only one dose&#xD;
      level will be open at a time. Four dose levels are planned all delivered in 25 fractions once&#xD;
      daily over 5 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 50 Gy (2 Gy per fraction),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 58 Gy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 62 Gy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 65 Gy. Patients, who achieve a complete response at the end of chemotherapy and thoracic&#xD;
           radiotherapy, will receive prophylactic cranial irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and Follow-up: Patients will be assessed and evaluated at least weekly during&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Following treatment, patients will be seen 1 month after the completion of&#xD;
      treatment, then every 3 months until 2 years, then every 6 months. Chest x-rays will be&#xD;
      performed at each follow-up. CT scan of chest and pulmonary function tests will be performed&#xD;
      every 6 months for the first 2 years, then yearly.&#xD;
