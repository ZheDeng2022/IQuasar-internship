      Study Design: This ia a Phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients with chemotherapy naive epithelial ovarian cancer; or fallopian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal and papillary serous mullerian tumors will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin and Taxol (paclitaxel) will be administered concurrently with bevacizumab after&#xD;
      surgery for 6-8 cycles every 21 (q21) days. Bevacizumab will be omitted in the first cycle,&#xD;
      immediately post-operatively. This will be followed by one year of bevacizumab q21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Outcomes include toxicity, response rate, and progression free survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is diagnosed in approximately 26,000 American women each year, and is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers. Difficult to detect, the disease typically&#xD;
      presents only when advanced. Ovarian cancer is among the most sensitive of solid tumors to&#xD;
      chemotherapy. However, the majority of patients with ovarian cancer who achieve a complete&#xD;
      remission with first line platinum-based chemotherapy will ultimately develop recurrent&#xD;
      disease. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the standard first line combination&#xD;
      in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with advanced ovarian cancer, carboplatin plus paclitaxel results in less&#xD;
      toxicity, is easier to administer, and is not inferior, when compared with cisplatin plus&#xD;
      paclitaxel. The randomized trial, GOG-158 finally confirmed the adoption of this standard&#xD;
      with an improved toxicity profile of the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel, a doublet&#xD;
      that had been previously demonstrated to have a substantially better progression free and&#xD;
      overall survival advantage compared with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide in advanced-stage&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer. Although in nonrandomized trials, carboplatin and paclitaxel was a&#xD;
      less toxic and highly active combination regimen, there remained concern regarding its&#xD;
      efficacy in patients with good prognosis completely resected advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel European, multicentre, randomised trials, between January, 1996, and March, 2002,&#xD;
      802 patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer relapsing after 6 months of being&#xD;
      treatment-free were enrolled from 119 hospitals in five countries (ICON III). Patients were&#xD;
      randomly assigned paclitaxel plus platinum chemotherapy or conventional platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Survival curves demonstrated a difference in favor of paclitaxel plus platinum&#xD;
      (hazard ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.69-0.97], p=0.02), corresponding to an absolute difference in&#xD;
      2-year survival of 7% between the paclitaxel and conventional treatment groups (57 vs 50%&#xD;
      [95% CI for difference 1-12]), and median survival of 5 months (29 vs 24 months [1-11]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the hypothesis of targeting angiogenesis to treat cancer was first described in 1971 by&#xD;
      Judah Folkman, there has been intense research into the development of antiangiogenic cancer&#xD;
      therapies. Tumors are dependent on their development of a vascular supply. Recent work has&#xD;
      shown that, if cells are already transformed, angiogenesis can be initiated with a tumor mass&#xD;
      comprising as few as 100-300 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF actions are mediated through binding to two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGF-R-1 (Flt-1)&#xD;
      and VEGF-R- 2 (KDR; whose murine form is known as Flk-1). Activation of these receptors by&#xD;
      VEGF triggers the phosphorylation of a multitude of proteins that are active in signal&#xD;
      transduction cascades. VEGF gene expression is upregulated by a wide range of stimuli&#xD;
      including hypoxia, nitric oxide, estrogen, a variety of growth factors (e.g., FGF-4, PDGF,&#xD;
      TNF, TGF-b, EGF, IL-6, IL-1b, #76) and common genetic events associated with the malignant&#xD;
      phenotype (loss of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and activation of oncogenes such as&#xD;
      ras, v-src and HER2/neu). Beside major angiogenic properties, VEGF is a potent mitogen for&#xD;
      vascular endothelium, inhibits endothelial apoptosis and mobilizes bone marrow-derived&#xD;
      endothelial cell precursors. VEGF also mediates the secretion of enzymes involved in the&#xD;
      degradation of extracellular matrix, modulates migration, increases vascular permeability,&#xD;
      upregulates hexose transport and induces monocyte migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancers secrete large amounts of VEGF in vitro and in vivo, and VEGF appears to play&#xD;
      a crucial role in angiogenesis and tumor induced immunosuppression in ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients. Indeed, VEGF has been confirmed as an independent prognostic indicator by&#xD;
      multivariate analysis of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis is crucial in the development of ovarian cancer. VEGF is closely linked to&#xD;
      normal ovarian function and is required for the development of the corpus luteum and the&#xD;
      maturation of the endometrium. Elevated VEGF expression occurs in all stages of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. In fact, VEGF levels appear to be&#xD;
      prognostically important. In addition to its role in ovarian-cancer-associated angiogenesis,&#xD;
      VEGF overexpression is directly associated with the production of ascitic fluid, a feature&#xD;
      probably related to its ability to induce endothelial hyperpermeability. In studies&#xD;
      monitoring VEGF after tumor resection, VEGF appears to be a valid tumor marker, following a&#xD;
      dramatic decline after surgery, the levels rise at recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent murine antibody of bevacizumab, A.4.6.1, demonstrated promising antitumor activity&#xD;
      in a subcutaneous SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer xenograft model. Interestingly, in the&#xD;
      intraperitoneal model of the same cell line, A.4.6.1 produced only partial inhibition of&#xD;
      tumor growth, but was associated with almost complete inhibition of ascites production. These&#xD;
      data provided the rationale for evaluation of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer. A Gynecologic&#xD;
      Oncology Group (GOG) phase II study of bevacizumab monotherapy is ongoing, and a second trial&#xD;
      will examine the combination of bevacizumab with daily, low-dose, oral cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      using metronomic dosing in the hope that 'less is more'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (rHumAb VEGF; Genentech, Inc., CA), a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      directed to VEGF, and neutralizes the biological properties of human VEGF. Bevacizumab,&#xD;
      derived from the murine antibody A.4.6.1, comprises 93% human IgG frameworks and 7%&#xD;
      murine-derived antigen-binding regions, the humanization providing a longer half-life and&#xD;
      less immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preclinical data, a phase I/II program with bevacizumab was initiated. The initial&#xD;
      phase I trial enrolled 25 patients in a dose-escalation fashion (0.1-10.0 mg/kg on days 0,&#xD;
      28, 35, and 42). No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was seen that was directly attributable to therapy.&#xD;
      There were three episodes of tumor-related bleeding, including a hemorrhage in a previously&#xD;
      undetected cerebral metastasis. Grade 1 and 2 toxicities, possibly or probably related to&#xD;
      treatment, included asthenia, headache, and nausea. There were no complete or partial&#xD;
      responses seen, although one patient with renal cell carcinoma achieved a mixed response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material use in this study is NOT commercially available Avastinâ„¢ (Genentech, Inc.; South&#xD;
      San Francisco, CA), and may differ from that product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in colorectal cancer and Genentech&#xD;
      chose this as the disease for their registration studies. At ASCO 2003 Hurwitz et al reported&#xD;
      the results of their phase III study of standard bolus irinotecan/5-FU/LV (IFL) plus&#xD;
      bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). An impressive median survival advantage (20.3 months vs. 15.6 months&#xD;
      [p=0.00003]) was reported in 925 patients receiving first line therapy with irinotecan,&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Only grade 3&#xD;
      hypertension (11%), easily managed with oral medications, was clearly increased in this Phase&#xD;
      III study. Gastrointestinal perforation, although rare, was possibly seen more frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, this was the first phase III validation of an antiangiogenic approach for the&#xD;
      treatment of human cancer. Several further, large phase III trials of bevacizumab in&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer are under way. These include a first-line study of standard&#xD;
      5-FU/LV with or without bevacizumab in patients who are not appropriate for irinotecan&#xD;
      therapy. A further phase III study will assess the FOLFOX regimen with or without bevacizumab&#xD;
      in the second-line setting for patients who have failed previous irinotecan plus 5-FU&#xD;
      treatment. These results will help to define the benefit of anti-VEGF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies are awaited, notably ECOG 4599 a randomized comparison of Taxol and carboplatin&#xD;
      with and without bevacizumab, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer has completed&#xD;
      accrual with over 600 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three reasons to investigate protracted exposure to bevacizumab. Firstly, the&#xD;
      agent, while inducing apoptosis, is considered a cytotoxic and protracted exposure is thought&#xD;
      to be necessary to maintain tumor dormancy. Secondly, the studies in colorectal cancer&#xD;
      treated patients until tumor progression. Lastly, there is an evolving paradigm in the&#xD;
      treatment of ovarian cancer. It is now widely accepted that continual rather than&#xD;
      intermittent palliative chemotherapy translates into a better quality of life. The&#xD;
      Gynecologic Oncology Group have recently reported a provocative randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      that confirmed a significant and large improvement in progression free survival (GOG 178),&#xD;
      considered the most important end point in the patients with advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the preclinical studies of ovarian cancer, the ovarian cancer model presented&#xD;
      a compelling argument for prolonged bevacizumab administration. Having inoculated the human&#xD;
      ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV-3 within the peritoneal cavity of immunodeficient mice,&#xD;
      tumor engrafted in 7 to 10 days. The function-blocking VEGF antibody, A4.6.1 significantly&#xD;
      inhibited subcutaneous SKOV-3 tumor growth approximately 20 fold compared with controls (P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05), and similarly in the intraperitoneal model. Importantly, within 2 to 3 weeks of&#xD;
      cessation of A4.6.1 treatment, effectively treated mice developed severe ascites, became&#xD;
      cachectic, and had to be killed, and subsequent tumor burden in these animals varied from&#xD;
      moderate to high. It should be clarified that the murine study utilized A4.6.1 the murine&#xD;
      precursor of bevacizumab, but that the results can be extrapolated to the actions of&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
