      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a non-ionizing electromagnetic method to align the&#xD;
      prostate treatment site for radiation therapy and to monitor its position throughout&#xD;
      radiation therapy delivery. The clinical study involves using an investigational device, the&#xD;
      Calypso® 4D Localization System, and requires permanent implantation of three small sensors&#xD;
      called Beacon® transponders in the prostate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal for prostate radiation therapy is to give a high dose of radiation to the prostate&#xD;
      and a minimal dose to the healthy tissue around the prostate. It is well known that the&#xD;
      prostate moves slightly within the pelvis and that its position varies a few millimeters from&#xD;
      day to day. There are several methods used to position the body and the prostate accurately&#xD;
      at the beginning of each radiation therapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the standard methods is to permanently implant small markers (gold spheres or&#xD;
      cylinders) in the prostate and use x-rays in the radiation therapy treatment room to&#xD;
      determine whether the markers are in the correct position. If the markers are in the correct&#xD;
      position, then the assumption is that the prostate also is in the correct position. If the&#xD;
      markers are not in the correct position on the x-ray, then the table that the patient lies on&#xD;
      can be shifted so that the markers are in the right place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the Beacon® transponder will be used in place of the standard gold marker.&#xD;
      During the radiation therapy visits, the patient position in the treatment room will be&#xD;
      corrected using the Beacon transponder with an investigational system, called the Calypso® 4D&#xD;
      Localization System. The Calypso system consists of a flat panel, placed over the pelvis and&#xD;
      connected to a computer, which monitors the position of the Beacon transponders within the&#xD;
      prostate. During five radiation therapy appointments and one extra visit, the position of the&#xD;
      markers in the prostate will be confirmed with x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Beacon transponder is a small glass cylinder that contains a tiny electrical circuit. The&#xD;
      glass vial is completely sealed and separates the internal components (i.e., the electrical&#xD;
      circuit) from the rest of the body. The glass vial is approximately one-third of one inch&#xD;
      long and one-tenth of one inch in diameter. Three Beacon transponders will be implanted in&#xD;
      the prostate. They will be permanently implanted.&#xD;
