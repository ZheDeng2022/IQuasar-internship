  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen (a male sex hormone) deprivation is the standard therapy for metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer and results in regression or control of disease in 80-85% of patients. This hormone&#xD;
      therapy results in a progression-free survival of 12-18 months and overall survival of 24-30&#xD;
      months. However, all patients ultimately develop hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).&#xD;
      Management of HRPC patients is a significant challenge for both patient and physician.&#xD;
      Neither past nor current chemotherapy regimens have shown curative potential in patients with&#xD;
      HRPC. Thus new treatment strategies are a high priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major focus of new treatment strategies is to enlist the aid of the immune system,&#xD;
      particularly the development of prostate cancer vaccines. There has been a number of studies&#xD;
      using dendritic cell based vaccines and the treatment has been well tolerated. Specific&#xD;
      T-cell immune responses have been observed and occasional evidence for tumor regression. A&#xD;
      reduction in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been observed as well. Lengthening the&#xD;
      time-to-progression and delays in the onset of bone pain have been observed in subsets of&#xD;
      patients with HRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial preclinical observations suggesting that a granulocyte-macrophage&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene transduced allogeneic (GVAX) prostate cancer vaccine&#xD;
      may be efficacious in poorly immunogenic cancers were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunologic effects of vaccinations&#xD;
      with Allogeneic Prostate GVAX® (CG1940 &amp; CG8711) in patients made lymphopenic by treatment&#xD;
      with chemotherapy and infused with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).&#xD;
      Clinical observations and laboratory measurements will be monitored to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      toxicity and immune responses. Additionally, the effects of treatment on serum PSA levels and&#xD;
      tumor response will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Other investigators have focused on tumor cell-based vaccine strategies using either&#xD;
      allogeneic or autologous tumor cells. Vaccines derived from allogeneic melanoma tumor cell&#xD;
      lines are associated with no clinically significant toxicity when given alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most tumor cell line vaccines are lethally irradiated, but not genetically modified. However,&#xD;
      a newer generation of tumor vaccines that have been genetically modified to enhance&#xD;
      tumor-associated antigen presentation to patient T cells have reached early clinical trials.&#xD;
      Based on extensive preclinical studies and clinical allogeneic prostate cancer vaccine data,&#xD;
      a strong impression exists that ex vivo GM-CSF gene transfer may make human prostate cancer&#xD;
      cell lines more potent in inducing clinically relevant antitumor immune responses in men with&#xD;
      micrometastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early clinical studies of irradiated GM-CSF-secreting autologous cancer cell vaccine&#xD;
      treatment of advanced kidney cancer and advanced melanoma, immune responses elicited by&#xD;
      vaccination appeared dependent on both the vaccine cell dose administered and the level of&#xD;
      GM-CSF secretion by the vaccine cells. A significant fraction of the nearly 50,000 men each&#xD;
      year who suffer from life-threatening prostate cancer will not be candidates for autologous&#xD;
      tumor vaccine treatments simply because an insufficient number of autologous prostatic&#xD;
      carcinoma cells will be available after surgery. These men may benefit from an allogeneic&#xD;
      GM-CSF-gene-transduced prostate cancer vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, autologous prostate cancer cells may be the best source of prostate cancer&#xD;
      antigens for eliciting therapeutically useful immune responses. However, evidence has&#xD;
      accumulated to suggest that allogeneic prostatic carcinoma cells might also serve as useful&#xD;
      sources of prostate cancer antigens for prostate cancer vaccine construction. One theoretical&#xD;
      concern about the use of allogeneic prostate cancer cells to prime antigen specific T-cell&#xD;
      immunity is whether cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) restricted to the HLA molecules of the&#xD;
      patient's tumors can be primed by vaccine cells expressing different (allogeneic) HLA&#xD;
      molecules. Recent work has shown that the GM-CSF gene transduced tumor cells do not directly&#xD;
      prime MHC class I restricted CTLs but are broken down by the recipient's antigen-presenting&#xD;
      cells, which process and present these antigens on their HLA molecules to prime T cells. In&#xD;
      fact, tumor cells that do not express any MHC class I molecules are nevertheless capable of&#xD;
      generating systemic antitumor immunity that is comparable to their MHC class I positive&#xD;
      counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I and II studies of the allogeneic prostate cancer vaccine have been performed in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic prostate cancer. One is a Phase I trial of CG1940 alone and one is a&#xD;
      phase I/II trial of CG1940 and CG8711 using the AAV GM-CSF vaccine cells. These trials are&#xD;
      currently in progress to evaluate safety and time to progression by PSA and bone scan. In&#xD;
      these trials the vaccines are administered at dose levels of 5 x 10^7, 1 x 10^8, 2 x 10^8, or&#xD;
      3 x 10^8 cells every 2 or 4 weeks for 3 to 12 vaccinations and a 5 x 10^8 cell prime&#xD;
      vaccination followed by a 3 x 10^8 cell boost vaccination every 2 weeks for a total of 13&#xD;
      vaccinations. Preliminary analysis of the 12 patients enrolled in the phase I trial shows one&#xD;
      patient with stable disease. Eighty patients have been enrolled in the phase II trial.&#xD;
      Sixty-five of these patients in the phase II trial have been followed for a median of 4&#xD;
      months. One of these patients had a partial PSA response, and 10 maintained stable PSAs.&#xD;
      Follow-up bone scans were obtained in 33 patients. One patient showed improvement in&#xD;
      metastatic lesions on his bone scan, and 12 patients maintained stable disease on bone scans.&#xD;
      ICTP was assayed at Treatment 1, Treatment 4, and at the First Follow-Up Visit in fifteen&#xD;
      patients. The ICTP level decreased in five patients (33%) of whom two had undetectable levels&#xD;
      after vaccine treatment. This normalization of osteoclast activity suggests a novel mechanism&#xD;
      of immunotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of November 29, 2004, 188 patients have received the prostate GVAX vaccine. In summary,&#xD;
      these phase I and II trials showed that CG1940 and CG8711 has an excellent safety profile. As&#xD;
      of January 24, 2005, a phase III trial of prostate GVAX is open at more than 40 medical&#xD;
      centers in the USA.&#xD;
