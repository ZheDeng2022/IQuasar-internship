  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease, specifically from atherosclerosis, is the major cause of mortality in&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in developed countries. Coronary artery disease and stroke&#xD;
      contribute to long-term morbidity in surviving patients. Atherosclerosis in SLE is&#xD;
      multifactorial, with immune/inflammatory endothelial damage, traditional cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, and prothrombotic factors all playing important roles. Multiple groups have shown&#xD;
      that hyperlipidemia is predictive of later atherosclerosis in SLE. In the general population,&#xD;
      statins have become the drug of choice in preventing atherosclerotic events, through two&#xD;
      mechanisms: lipid lowering that helps to prevent progression, and stabilization of plaques to&#xD;
      prevent rupture. In the Lupus Atherosclerosis Prevention Trial we will determine if&#xD;
      atorvastatin reduces the progression of atherosclerosis on helical computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      and carotid duplex. Recent work has confirmed that statins have an immunomodulatory role.&#xD;
      This study will also determine whether statins improve clinical lupus activity or lupus&#xD;
      serologies (anti-dsDNA and complement).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE, confirmed by a faculty rheumatologist at&#xD;
             Johns Hopkins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SLE patients with a known atherosclerotic event, such as angina, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, or stroke, with an abnormal lipid profile for which a statin would be&#xD;
             standard of care, are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients (or patients planning to become pregnant in the next two years) are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have known chronic liver disease, have unexplained elevation of their&#xD;
             liver enzymes greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal , or an elevated CPK&#xD;
             greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal value for the patient's racial&#xD;
             group, are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dl or LDL greater than 190 in the&#xD;
             absence of 2 risk factors (and who are unwilling to participate in a formal&#xD;
             nutritional/lifestyle modification program that we recommend for them) are excluded.&#xD;
