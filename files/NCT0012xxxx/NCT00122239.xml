  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine, for the first time, the independent contribution of a patient's own&#xD;
      genetic makeup to the development of post-radiation complications, permitting the future&#xD;
      development of predictive tests to avoid radiation injury. To do this, the investigators will&#xD;
      examine gene markers in a series of breast, prostate, brain and lung cancer survivors who&#xD;
      have received conformal radiotherapy between 1996 and 2003 at the Cross Cancer Institute and&#xD;
      Tom Baker Cancer Centre.&#xD;

      Major innovations in radiotherapy (RT) delivery (3D conformal RT, intensity modulated RT) now&#xD;
      permit RT dose escalation to be tested as a means of improving disease control in many tumour&#xD;
      sites. With delivery innovations, life-threatening toxicity occurs rarely, but significant&#xD;
      clinical toxicity is common. In previous work the investigators have studied a cohort of 98&#xD;
      prostate patients who received dose-escalated 3D-CRT and have obtained evidence of genetic&#xD;
      and dosimetric factors underlying rectal/bladder toxicity. They posit that the late radiation&#xD;
      toxicity disease state has significant genetic determinants in other malignancies. These&#xD;
      determinants are neither understood nor accounted for in selection of treatment, and the&#xD;
      investigators propose to study additional well-characterized cohorts, who are clinically well&#xD;
      from a disease control perspective, given that comprehensive dosimetric and outcome&#xD;
      information is available on all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a thorough understanding of the molecular processes underlying tissue responses to&#xD;
      radiation damage, the investigators propose a genomic analysis. Their working hypothesis is&#xD;
      that normal organ toxicity will be associated with patient genetics as measured by single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a select group of genes. The criteria for selecting SNPs&#xD;
      will be based on a candidate gene approach, choosing genes implicated or demonstrated in DNA&#xD;
      repair pathways and radiation-induced tissue damage/tissue homeostasis. Analysis of these&#xD;
      data will use both statistically based bioinformatics approaches.&#xD;
