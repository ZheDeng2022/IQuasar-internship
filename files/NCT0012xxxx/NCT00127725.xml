  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the tibial shaft (diaphysis) are some of the most common long bone fractures.&#xD;
      They most frequently occur in males less than 40 years of age. Despite advancements in the&#xD;
      surgical management of these fractures, the precarious blood supply and lack of soft-tissue&#xD;
      cover of the shaft of the tibia make these fractures vulnerable to non-union and infection.&#xD;
      These complications often require multiple procedures, extended time off of work, and can&#xD;
      result in ongoing poor mobility. This is reflected in the surgical revision rate that the&#xD;
      scientific literature has recorded as being between 20 and 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to be a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment for non-unions of the tibia. These are fractures in which the bone has failed to&#xD;
      unite and the healing process has ceased. The PEMF is delivered via a device such as the EBI&#xD;
      Bone Healing SystemÂ®, which straps onto the limb overlying the fracture. It is lightweight&#xD;
      and portable using a rechargeable battery for power. It is compatible with internal and&#xD;
      external fixation and may also be worn over a plaster or fibreglass cast. It is usually kept&#xD;
      in place for ten hours per day and used for a period of three months or until the fracture&#xD;
      unites. In animal models, PEMF stimulation has been demonstrated to improve the time to&#xD;
      fracture healing in acute fractures. There have been no demonstrated side effects of the&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that PEMF stimulation during the first twelve weeks after fracture,&#xD;
      in addition to normal surgical care, will increase the union rate for these fractures and&#xD;
      thereby significantly reduce the surgical revision rate within the first twelve months&#xD;
      following fracture.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled study whose objective is to determine whether PEMF&#xD;
      stimulation as an adjunct therapy has a clinically significant effect on the morbidity&#xD;
      associated with tibial shaft fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a two-armed study. The active treatment arm involves participants with acute tibial&#xD;
      shaft fractures who have been randomized to receive a PEMF stimulation device to be worn over&#xD;
      the fracture site for 10 hours per day during the first twelve weeks after injury. The&#xD;
      control arm involves participants with acute tibial shaft fractures who have been randomized&#xD;
      to receive a placebo device to be worn over the fracture site for 10 hours per day during the&#xD;
      first twelve weeks after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the use of a PEMF stimulation device as adjunct therapy for acute&#xD;
           tibial shaft fractures reduces the surgical revision rate in the 12 months after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revision surgery for the purposes of this study is defined as any surgery on the injured leg&#xD;
      (between the knee joint and ankle joint) more than 14 days after the accident, except&#xD;
      operations designed to provide initial skin coverage or skin closure, or the removal of an&#xD;
      external fixateur as an isolated procedure. Revision surgery will be classified as minor or&#xD;
      major. Minor revision will be defined as dynamisation of an intramedullary nail through the&#xD;
      percutaneous removal of a static locking screw. Major revision surgery will include all other&#xD;
      revision surgery as defined above. Major revision surgery will be sub-classified as&#xD;
      procedures involving either bone grafting, and/or revision of fixation, and/or for the&#xD;
      treatment of established infection, or amputation, and the rates will be compared across&#xD;
      treatment and placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the use of a PEMF stimulation device as adjunct therapy for acute&#xD;
           tibial shaft fractures increases the radiological and clinical union rates at 12, 26 and&#xD;
           52 weeks after injury. A fracture will be deemed to have radiologically united at these&#xD;
           times if by independent observation, two orthopaedic consultants agree that three bony&#xD;
           cortices are bridged by bony callus on an anteroposterior and lateral plain X-ray at&#xD;
           these times. If the two reviewers disagree, a third opinion will be sought which will be&#xD;
           final. A fracture will be deemed to have clinically united if it is deemed stable under&#xD;
           clinical examination by the treating orthopaedic surgeon at these times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the use of a PEMF stimulation device as adjunct therapy for acute&#xD;
           tibial shaft fractures increases the patients' general health score, as measured by the&#xD;
           SF-36 general health survey; and function of the injured limb, as measured by the Lower&#xD;
           Extremity Functional Scale at 12, 26 and 52 weeks after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That there will be significantly lower rates of surgical revision within 12 months of&#xD;
           injury in those participants who received active PEMF stimulation for the first 12 weeks&#xD;
           after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That there will be increased union rates at 12, 26 and 52 weeks after fracture among&#xD;
           participants who received active stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the average score on a general health survey and region specific health survey will&#xD;
           be higher among participants who received active stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adults (18 years and over) with diaphyseal fractures of the tibia who present to a&#xD;
      recruiting hospital during the study period will be eligible to enrol into the study. The AO&#xD;
      classification 42 will be used to define tibial shaft fractures. Any fracture that extends&#xD;
      into the articular surface will be excluded. From an analysis of previous Liverpool patients&#xD;
      and the literature, the investigators expect that this population will be 75% - 85% male with&#xD;
      an average age of 30-35 years old. There will be no upper limit to ages. If a participant has&#xD;
      sustained bilateral tibial shaft fractures, each will be enrolled separately, left before&#xD;
      right.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be approached by a senior member of their treating team, either&#xD;
      registrar or consultant, and given an information sheet to read and have the opportunity to&#xD;
      have any questions answered. They will then be asked to sign a consent form if they would&#xD;
      like to participate in the study. Interpreters will be used during this process for&#xD;
      non-english speaking patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 14-day window period post injury in which the device must be applied for the&#xD;
      patient to enter the study. If there is any reason why the device cannot be applied by this&#xD;
      time, the patient will be excluded from the study. The most commonly encountered reason the&#xD;
      investigators expect for this will be a patient who remains in an Intensive Care Unit over 14&#xD;
      days, where electrically sensitive equipment is being used for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pacemakers or defibrillators will be excluded, as PEMF stimulation may affect&#xD;
      some types of these devices. Patients with pathological fractures due to malignant tumours&#xD;
      will be excluded. Pregnant patients will be excluded, as the device is yet to be studied in&#xD;
      pregnancy. Patients without the cognitive ability to consent are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruiting hospitals are Liverpool Hospital, St. George Hospital, Westmead Hospital,&#xD;
      Nepean Hospital and Wollongong Hospital. Approval has been granted for the study to commence&#xD;
      through each hospital's Human Research Ethics Committee. Recruitment of patients will&#xD;
      commence on Monday August 14, 2005, at each of these hospitals. Recruitment will end after&#xD;
      the target of 340 participants has been enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire on enrolment to determine&#xD;
      potential risk factors for non-union. These data will be that of age, smoking, general&#xD;
      medical conditions and medications used. The participants' current occupation will also be&#xD;
      sought as this may effect the time taken for return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating doctor will be asked to complete a questionnaire on other risk factors. This&#xD;
      will include details of the mechanism of injury, whether the injury was open or closed (and&#xD;
      the Gustillo grade of an open injury), other injuries the participant has sustained, and the&#xD;
      treatment received for their injuries, as well as the patients' insurance status. The&#xD;
      definitive treatment for the tibia fracture will be classified as either external fixation&#xD;
      with casts (plater of paris or fibreglass), intramedullary nailing, internal fixation with&#xD;
      plates and screws, or external fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copies of the initial X-rays will be collected. The fractures will be classified into the&#xD;
      nine fracture patterns as defined under the AO classification system by a panel of three&#xD;
      orthopaedic consultants experienced in trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the consent form has been signed and the baseline data collected, the participants will&#xD;
      be assigned to either active or inactive arms by the NH&amp;MRC Clinical Trials Centre (CTC)&#xD;
      located at Sydney University. Devices will come from a pool of seventy devices, which have&#xD;
      been supplied by BiometÃ Australia and are commercially known as the EBI Bone Healing&#xD;
      SystemÂ®. Thirty-five of these devices will be active and thirty-five inactive, and they will&#xD;
      be randomly numbered from 1 to 70 by the CTC. The CTC will have the code for active and&#xD;
      inactive devices and will conduct the randomisation process using the statistical technique&#xD;
      of minimisation, a dynamic allocation process designed to balance known risk factors across&#xD;
      treatment arms. The two factors that will be minimised for are the recruiting hospital and&#xD;
      whether the injury was closed or open. A device will then be randomly assigned from the&#xD;
      available pool of either active or inactive devices, and this assigned device will then be&#xD;
      fitted to the patient. The researchers, company representatives, surgeons and patients will&#xD;
      all remain blinded to active/inactive arms until all the data have been collected and&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment in the study will not affect any other aspect of the participants' care. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo the normal surgical intervention and follow up for their tibial&#xD;
      shaft fracture and any other injuries as recommended by their treating surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a participant has been assigned with a device number, sales representatives of BiometÃ&#xD;
      Australia will fit them with it within three working days, in either the hospital ward or the&#xD;
      participant's home. Participants will receive instructions on how to use the device, and be&#xD;
      required to wear the device for ten hours per day for a period of twelve weeks. The devices&#xD;
      are manufactured to record the amount of time in which they have been used and thereby&#xD;
      measure compliance. Non-compliance will be defined as average use of less than six hours per&#xD;
      day. Participants will also be asked at twelve weeks about their average use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After twelve weeks the research team or company representatives will collect the devices,&#xD;
      replace the straps, clean and check them before they re-enter the pool of devices for&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at 12, 26, and 52 weeks from both participants and their treating&#xD;
      surgeons. Participants will receive a survey in the mail, and then be contacted over the&#xD;
      phone to attain their answers. On each occasion they will be asked whether they have had any&#xD;
      further procedures on their leg, and if so at which hospital and by whom. At three months&#xD;
      they will also be asked about their average use of the device, whether they are seeing their&#xD;
      surgeon in private rooms or a hospital clinic and of their insurance status. That is, are&#xD;
      they being treated under medicare, private health insurance, workers compensation, or third&#xD;
      party insurance. They will be asked if they have managed to return to work, and to complete&#xD;
      the Lower Extremity Functional Score as well as the Short Form-36 (a general health survey).&#xD;
      The phone questionnaire is expected to take 15-30 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their surgeons will also be contacted at 12, 26 and 52 weeks to determine if there has been&#xD;
      any further surgery or other complications, and to gain their opinion on fracture union.&#xD;
      Copies of their routine pre-operative and twelve week X-rays will be collected for review.&#xD;
      Preoperative X-rays will be classified according to the AO classification system into the 9&#xD;
      sub classifications of tibial shaft fractures by a panel of three orthopaedic surgeons. Two&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons experienced in trauma, who will remain blinded to the treatment arm of&#xD;
      the patients, will assess the twelve-week X-rays to determine if union has occurred. Fracture&#xD;
      union rates at twelve weeks will be quantified. Fracture union will be defined as mature&#xD;
      callus bridging in three of four cortices over the fracture site on two radiographic views.&#xD;
      If there is disagreement amongst the two surgeons, the X-rays shall be reviewed by a third&#xD;
      surgeon whose opinion shall be final. For fractures that have failed to unite at twelve&#xD;
      weeks, their surgeons will be contacted to determine union rate at six months and their plain&#xD;
      X-rays will be collected and reviewed. If they have undergone any surgery, their medical&#xD;
      records and operation reports will be examined to determine the reason for the surgery and&#xD;
      the exact operation undergone. This is to ascertain surgical revision rate and union rate at&#xD;
      12, 26 and 52 weeks post injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If shown to be effective, this device may become a common adjunct to the management of tibia&#xD;
      fractures and significantly decrease the rate of revision surgery and increase the rate of&#xD;
      union seen with these fractures. It may also be considered for use in other long bone&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
