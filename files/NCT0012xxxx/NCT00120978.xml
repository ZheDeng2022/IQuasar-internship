    <textblock>
      Large population-based studies suggest that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) are 2 to 3 times at risk for cardiovascular mortality, which accounts for a&#xD;
      large proportion of the total number of deaths. How COPD increases the risk of poor&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes is largely unknown. However, there is growing evidence that&#xD;
      persistent low-grade systemic inflammation is present in COPD and that this may contribute to&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease among COPD patients.&#xD;
      Inflammation and more specifically, C-reactive protein (CRP), has been linked with all stages&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis, including plaque genesis, rupture and subsequent thrombo-fibrosis of&#xD;
      vulnerable vessels. Recently, our group has demonstrated in a relatively small study that&#xD;
      short-term inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy can repress serum CRP levels in stable COPD&#xD;
      patients. Conversely, withdrawal of ICS leads to a marked increase in serum CRP levels.&#xD;
      Although very promising, these data cannot be considered definitive because the study was&#xD;
      small in size and scope (N=41 patients). Additionally, this study did not address the&#xD;
      potential effects of combination therapy with ICS and long-acting β2 agonists (LABA). This is&#xD;
      an important short-coming because combination therapy of ICS and LABA have been shown to&#xD;
      produce improved clinical outcomes over ICS monotherapy and is commonly used by clinicians in&#xD;
      the treatment of moderate to severe COPD. We hypothesize that inhaled fluticasone (Flovent®)&#xD;
      reduces systemic inflammation and that combination therapy (Advair®) is more effective than&#xD;
      steroids alone in reducing systemic inflammation in COPD. In this proposal, we will implement&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial to determine whether ICS by themselves or in combination with&#xD;
      LABAs can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduce CRP levels in stable COPD patients and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reduce other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which have been linked with cardiovascular&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant&#xD;
           protein-1 (MCP-1)&#xD;

      What is the problem to be addressed? Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Indeed, ischemic heart disease is one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of mortality and hospitalization among patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      COPD. For every 10% decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality increases by ~28%, and nonfatal coronary event increases by ~20% in mild to&#xD;
      moderate COPD. How COPD increases the risk of poor cardiovascular outcomes is largely&#xD;
      unknown. However, there is growing evidence that persistent low-grade systemic inflammation&#xD;
      is present in COPD and that this may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease among COPD patients. Circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      which has been strongly linked with poor cardiovascular outcomes in the general population,&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to be elevated in COPD. Moreover, an elevated level of CRP has been&#xD;
      associated with myocardial injury in COPD. Reduction in the level of CRP, on the other hand,&#xD;
      has been shown to be associated with improved outcomes in various populations. Other&#xD;
      cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which&#xD;
      are potent regulators of CRP, have also been associated with cardiovascular events. If this&#xD;
      linkage between systemic inflammation and atherosclerosis holds true for COPD, then systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and/or its markers may provide a new and very important therapeutic target for&#xD;
      COPD management. Corticosteroids (CS) can reduce CRP and other circulating inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine levels in acute pro-inflammatory states. They can also down-regulate certain&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and cytokine expression in the airways of COPD patients and attenuate&#xD;
      airway hyperresponsiveness related to COPD. More importantly, in large clinical studies, they&#xD;
      have been shown to reduce clinical exacerbations, improve health status and may even reduce&#xD;
      mortality in COPD. The mechanism by which such improvement occurs is not known. Recently, our&#xD;
      group has demonstrated in a relatively small study that short-term inhaled corticosteroid&#xD;
      (ICS) therapy can repress serum CRP levels in stable COPD patients. Conversely, withdrawal of&#xD;
      ICS leads to a marked increase in serum CRP levels. Although very promising, these data&#xD;
      cannot be considered definitive because the study was small in size and scope (N=41&#xD;
      patients). Additionally, this study did not address the potential effects of combination&#xD;
      therapy with ICS and long-acting β2 agonists (LABA).This is an important short-coming because&#xD;
      combination therapy has been shown to produce improved clinical outcomes over ICS monotherapy&#xD;
      and is commonly used by clinicians in the treatment of moderate to severe COPD. In-vitro&#xD;
      studies suggest that steroids and LABAs may &quot;synergistically&quot; down-regulate inflammation in&#xD;
      COPD. Whether this occurs in-vivo remains largely unknown and untested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the proposed trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be a double blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study comparing the&#xD;
      effects of Advair, Flovent and placebo on serum CRP in COPD. All study participants will&#xD;
      first undergo a run-in phase during which all will be treated with Flovent 500 mcg bid. This&#xD;
      will be followed by a withdrawal phase wherein all participants will be FREE of any ICS or&#xD;
      LABAs for 4 weeks. After the withdrawal phase, the participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (using a computer generated algorithm) to one of three arms: placebo; Flovent; or Advair&#xD;
      Run-In Phase (4 weeks): The use of ICS, theophyllines, and leukotriene modifiers, LABA will&#xD;
      be prohibited and subjects will be maintained on Flovent 500 mcg bid. Regular use of&#xD;
      tiotropium and as needed use of short-acting β2 (salbutamol) and/or anti-cholinergic&#xD;
      (Atrovent) will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this phase needed? Management of COPD is variable. Because of the controversy&#xD;
      surrounding the use of ICS and LABAs, some patients at enrollment will be taking these&#xD;
      medications, while others will not. This phase is to ensure uniformity of therapy (and in&#xD;
      particular to the use of ICS in the same dose) for all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Phase (4 weeks): Flovent will be discontinued and participants will also not be&#xD;
      taking any other ICS, theophyllines, LABAs or leukotriene modifiers during this period.&#xD;
      Regular use of tiotropium and as needed use of short-acting β2 (salbutamol) and/or&#xD;
      anti-cholinergic (Atrovent) will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this phase needed? There are two principal reasons why this phase is needed. One way&#xD;
      of &quot;proving&quot; that ICS modifies serum CRP levels is to demonstrate that withdrawal of ICS&#xD;
      increases CRP levels and their re-introduction of ICS suppresses CRP levels. The Second&#xD;
      reason is that in the researchers' pilot study it was found that serum CRP levels were&#xD;
      highest when patients were off ICS for 4 weeks. To achieve the necessary statistical power&#xD;
      for this study, a reasonably high serum CRP signal is desirable at the beginning of the&#xD;
      randomization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Treatment Phase (4 weeks): Subjects will be randomized to one of 3 arms, placebo,&#xD;
      Advair, or Flovent. Rescue medications (anti-cholinergics and short-acting β2) will be&#xD;
      allowed. Participants will not be taking any other inhaled corticosteroids, theophyllines,&#xD;
      leukotriene modifiers or LABAs during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this phase only 4 weeks? Exacerbations and infections can elevate CRP levels by 2 to&#xD;
      10 fold. The rate of normalization of CRP levels after these episodes is variable; complete&#xD;
      normalization may not take place for several weeks after the resolution of the infective or&#xD;
      exacerbation episode. To reduce the risk that the study participants will experience&#xD;
      clinically apparent infections or exacerbations, we have made this phase of the study&#xD;
      relatively short (4 weeks). The short treatment period will also reduce the effects of non or&#xD;
      suboptimal compliance of treatment medications on CRP levels. We believe that 4 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy will be sufficient to demonstrate the suppressive effects of Flovent and Advair,&#xD;
      given the fact that in the pilot study, an effect of Flovent on CRP after only 2 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy was observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the proposed practical arrangements for allocating participants to trial groups?&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized (1:2:2) to placebo, Advair, or Flovent. Patients will first be&#xD;
      stratified based on study site to minimize the potential impact of variation in patient care&#xD;
      across the study sites on the endpoint of interest. We have hired an external statistician&#xD;
      (Ms. Lieling Wu) who will prepare computer-generated randomization lists blocked by study&#xD;
      site using permuted blocks of six. The lists will be inputted into a randomization computer.&#xD;
      When a site coordinator has identified an eligible, consented patient, he/she will contact&#xD;
      the central co-ordinating site at St. Paul's Hospital (SPH) for a randomization number. The&#xD;
      randomization computer will then issue a study identification number to the study coordinator&#xD;
      and to GlaxoSmithKline (Mississauga) for delivery of the appropriate treatment package (that&#xD;
      contains one Flovent canister and one &quot;unknown&quot; puffer) to the appropriate study site within&#xD;
      two business days. The open-labeled Flovent will be used for the &quot;run-in&quot; phase, while the&#xD;
      &quot;unknown&quot; puffer (either placebo, Flovent or Advair) will be dispensed at the start of the&#xD;
      &quot;active treatment phase.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the proposed methods for protecting against other sources of bias ? All research&#xD;
      personnel will all be blinded to the treatment group except for the study biostatistician,&#xD;
      who will be responsible for the randomization computer. Only he will have access to the&#xD;
      master file, which can link patient identifiers to the randomization number. This computer&#xD;
      will be locked away in a secure space at the James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre in SPH and will have&#xD;
      a password protection that only he (or his designate) can access. The study medications and&#xD;
      placebo will be packaged and delivered identically as a diskus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the proposed duration of treatment period? 4 weeks of run-in; 4 weeks of withdrawal&#xD;
      phase and 4 weeks of active treatment phase (i.e RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the frequency and duration of followup? Participants will be seen at enrollment,&#xD;
      after the completion of each phase of the study and with exacerbations or infections (as&#xD;
      defined above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the proposed primary and secondary outcome measures?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: The difference in CRP from start of the active treatment phase to the end of the&#xD;
      trial between the 3 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: measurements of MCP-1 and IL-6; St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ,76&#xD;
      scores; FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the outcome measures be measured at follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Collection: During every visit, study personnel will take two 10 ml collection of blood&#xD;
      from participants through venipuncture (using standard techniques). Samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged and the serum component will be aliquoted into special tubes (provided by the&#xD;
      coordinating site) that contain anti-proteases. They will then be shipped (Fedexed) in&#xD;
      regular ice immediately to the Study Coordinating Center (to arrive within 24 hours of blood&#xD;
      collection) where they will be frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -70ºC freezers until&#xD;
      analysis. To avoid delays, no samples will be taken on a Friday or a day preceding holidays.&#xD;
      A high-sensitive solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure serum CRP&#xD;
      will be used. The investigators have measured over 4,000 serum samples from the Lung Health&#xD;
      Study with this technique. In comparison with nephelometry, another commonly used technique,&#xD;
      CRP levels with high-sensitivity ELISA is excellent. The coefficient of variation for CRP in&#xD;
      the researchers' laboratory is ~5%. IL-6 and MCP-1 will also be measured using&#xD;
      high-sensitivity ELISA assays. The researchers' laboratory has also experience performing&#xD;
      these assays using serums collected from COPD patients. The investigators have previously&#xD;
      shown that the coefficient of variation for the IL-6 assay to be 4.7% (median; interquartile&#xD;
      range, 1.8% to 11.2%) and the MCP-1 assay to be 3.2% (median; interquartile range, 1.5% to&#xD;
      5.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry: Spirometry will be performed in accordance with guidelines from the American&#xD;
      Thoracic Society during each visit. At the first visit, pre and post-bronchodilator&#xD;
      measurements will be done. For follow-up visits, only pre-bronchodilator values will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Status Measurements: During each visit, study participants will complete the SGRQ in&#xD;
      person. The SGRQ was chosen because it has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha&#xD;
      coefficient ≥ 0.76), reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of ~85% of responses&#xD;
      measured 6 months apart), and is an independent predictor of future risk of exacerbations and&#xD;
      mortality in COPD. Clinically relevant thresholds for SGRQ are considered to be score changes&#xD;
      of ≥ 4.0 units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the proposed sample size? In the pilot study (described above), it was found that&#xD;
      after 2 weeks, compared with the placebo group, those assigned to fluticasone experienced a&#xD;
      significant decrease in CRP levels from baseline, after adjustments for baseline FEV1, age,&#xD;
      and sex of participating patients (57.1% decrease relative to placebo; p=0.042). The&#xD;
      (geometric) mean of CRP for this cohort was 4.9 mg/L (95% CI, 3.3 to 7.1). Sample sizes of&#xD;
      200 participants combined in Flovent and Advair group (100 in each) and 50 in the placebo&#xD;
      group will be needed.&#xD;
