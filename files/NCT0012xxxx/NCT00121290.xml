  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of SJG-136 in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of SJG-136 in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug and its metabolites in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with clinical effects of this drug in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes once daily on days 1-3. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic&#xD;
             or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or&#xD;
             are no longer effective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Time interval must be at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, 6&#xD;
             weeks if the last regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy to &lt; 25% of hematopoietic bone marrow is allowed&#xD;

             symptoms are considered clinically insignificant or irrelevant to this study),&#xD;
