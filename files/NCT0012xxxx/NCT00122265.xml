      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in males, and radiotherapy is a commonly chosen&#xD;
      treatment option for patients with localized disease. Technical innovations such as&#xD;
      three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy permit&#xD;
      radiation dose escalation and possibly better disease outcomes, but escalated doses may be&#xD;
      accompanied by long-term complications. This study will examine, for the first time, the&#xD;
      independent contribution of a patient's own genetic makeup to the development of&#xD;
      post-radiation complications, permitting the future development of predictive tests to avoid&#xD;
      radiation injury. To do this, the investigators will examine gene markers and blood proteins&#xD;
      in a series of approximately 100 prostate cancer survivors who have received&#xD;
      three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy between 1996 and 2000 at the Cross Cancer Institute.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: Major innovations in radiotherapy (RT) delivery (3D conformal RT, intensity&#xD;
      modulated RT) now permit RT dose escalation to be tested as a means of improving control of&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer. With delivery innovations, severe toxicity occurs rarely, but&#xD;
      significant bladder and rectal toxicity is common. The investigators have studied a cohort of&#xD;
      98 patients who received dose-escalated 3D-CRT and have obtained evidence of dosimetric&#xD;
      factors underlying rectal toxicity. They posit that the late radiation toxicity disease state&#xD;
      has significant genetic determinants. These determinants are neither understood nor accounted&#xD;
      for in selection of treatment, and the investigators propose to study the above&#xD;
      well-characterized cohort, who are clinically well from a disease control perspective, given&#xD;
      that comprehensive dosimetric and outcome information is available on all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Comprehensive analysis of the genomic, proteomic, and dosimetric characteristics&#xD;
      of patients with prostate cancer will provide a novel understanding of the genetic&#xD;
      predisposition of cellular and tissue responses to irradiation which result in the clinical&#xD;
      occurrence of significant chronic rectal and bladder injury after 3D-CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH: For a thorough understanding of the molecular processes underlying tissue responses&#xD;
      to radiation damage, the investigators propose a genomic analysis. Their working hypothesis&#xD;
      is that rectal and bladder toxicity will be correlated to patient genetics as measured by&#xD;
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a select group of genes. The criteria for selecting&#xD;
      SNPs will be based on evidence for the various genes implicated or demonstrated in DNA repair&#xD;
      pathways and radiation-induced tissue damage. In addition, since radiation injury can be&#xD;
      considered a phenotypic tissue response to RT in genetically predisposed individuals, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the protein profile &quot;signature&quot; in sera from patients who have&#xD;
      suffered significant toxicity. Analysis of these data will be unique in that the&#xD;
      investigators will use both statistically based bioinformatics approaches, and biophysical&#xD;
      modeling. This proposal represents the most comprehensive exploration to date of the concept&#xD;
      of a molecular &quot;signature&quot; of normal tissue radiation injury of which the applicants are&#xD;
      aware.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a database of SNPs among long-term prostate cancer survivors who have been&#xD;
           treated with 3D-CRT, and for whom detailed toxicity, quality of life and dosimetric&#xD;
           information are available;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility of using bioinformatics approaches with this database to&#xD;
           examine the possibility that specific SNPs, in the context of known dosimetric factors,&#xD;
           can predict occurrence of late rectal or bladder toxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a proteomic analysis of serum samples from a cohort of 25 patients&#xD;
           experiencing higher levels of ongoing late toxicity and 50 patients with no ongoing late&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To utilize biophysical approaches to modelling clinical complication data, using the&#xD;
           concept of generalized mean biological effective dose (GMBED) and the critical volume&#xD;
           model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY: This proposal will be the first comprehensive retrospective analysis of genomic,&#xD;
      proteomic and dosimetric determinants of late radiation injury in prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators have assembled a broad array of expertise from the CCI PolyomX program (the&#xD;
      only high throughput SNP facility in western Canada), the NCI/FDA Clinical Proteomics Program&#xD;
      at Bethesda, MD, and the unique biophysical modeling capability of CBIAR researchers to reach&#xD;
      these goals.&#xD;
