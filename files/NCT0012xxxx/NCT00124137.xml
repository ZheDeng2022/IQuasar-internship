    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare patients who are suffering from heart failure and who&#xD;
      are fluid overloaded to determine if ultrafiltration (UF) can remove more of the extra fluid&#xD;
      as measured by weight loss while in the hospital and improve the patient's breathing.&#xD;

      Congestive heart failure is an important public health issue. It remains the leading cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization in Medicare beneficiaries. Ninety percent of all hospitalizations for CHF are&#xD;
      due to fluid overload. Most of the expense related to the management of heart failure is due&#xD;
      to hospital-based care; interventions that reduce the amount of time patients spend in the&#xD;
      hospital may greatly decrease the cost associated with caring for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital stay for patients admitted for acute decompensated congestive heart failure (adCHF)&#xD;
      is largely dictated by how quickly the signs and symptoms of congestion can be relieved and&#xD;
      whether ACE inhibitors can be started safely. Diuretics are usually effective in relieving&#xD;
      congestion, but achieving adequate diuresis often requires a process of trial and error. Some&#xD;
      patients are simply refractory to oral or intravenous diuretics. Diuretics stimulate adverse&#xD;
      neurohormonal systems and can cause progressive azotemia. Bayliss (1977) showed that there is&#xD;
      a significant increase in renin and aldosterone levels as a response to diuretic treatment&#xD;
      rather than as a result of the heart failure itself. Gottlieb (2002) showed that loop&#xD;
      diuretics diminish glomerular filtration rate in patients with heart failure. In addition, as&#xD;
      more diuretics are given, serum electrolyte imbalances often occur, requiring additional&#xD;
      monitoring of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UF has been used as a therapeutic method to remove excessive fluid in patients for over 30&#xD;
      years. UF removes excess water without causing a significant clinical change in the&#xD;
      electrolyte composition of the blood or causes adverse affects on the kidneys and&#xD;
      neurohormonal system. Studies have shown that UF increases urine output, increases&#xD;
      responsiveness to standard oral therapies and decreases readmission rate. While the&#xD;
      usefulness of UF in this patient population has great potential, this form of therapy is not&#xD;
      usually performed due to the need for invasive venous access and increased expense i.e. high&#xD;
      flow dialysis machines. CHF Solutions has developed the Aquadex System that has FDA market&#xD;
      clearance for UF. The advantage of the Aquadex System is its simplicity and the fact that it&#xD;
      can be administered by means of peripheral catheters or with a central venous access. Early&#xD;
      prospective series and subsequent clinical experience involving adCHF patients have shown&#xD;
      that 4 to 8 liters can easily be withdrawn in a short amount of time using the peripheral&#xD;
      access approach with the Aquadex System. Volume removal was not associated with disruption of&#xD;
      electrolyte balance, worsening of renal distress or impact on blood pressure or heart rate of&#xD;
      clinical significance. The Aquadex System is a predictable, safe, and effective way to ensure&#xD;
      adequate volume removal that may result in shorter hospital stays, better symptom relief and&#xD;
      more efficient dosing of medications for the treatment of adCHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Aquadex System can improve the acute&#xD;
      management of patients with adCHF and maintain this improvement over a period of time&#xD;
      compared to IV diuretics. Ultrafiltration in this patient population may decrease length of&#xD;
      hospital stay and reduce hospital readmissions for heart failure leading to a significant&#xD;
      reduction in costs for the treatment of these patients.&#xD;
