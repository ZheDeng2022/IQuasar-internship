      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a specialised nuclear medicine procedure that uses&#xD;
      positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to measure biological activity. The most&#xD;
      common of these radiolabeled tracers is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which is used to&#xD;
      determine abnormal glucose metabolism in tumours and other sites. It has general applications&#xD;
      in all areas where abnormal glucose metabolism may be present including in circumstances such&#xD;
      as differentiating the tumour from scar tissue; evaluating the presence of the tumour in&#xD;
      light of rising tumour markers and normal morphological imaging techniques; and assessing&#xD;
      response to therapy where other techniques are deemed to be unhelpful. The Cross Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (CCI) has recently been funded to establish a PET centre, and this study will prove&#xD;
      the effectiveness of PET scanning in the Canadian health care environment and validate the&#xD;
      data that have been developed in other jurisdictions in specific oncologic indications.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a specialised Nuclear Medicine procedure that uses&#xD;
      positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to measure biological activity. The commonest&#xD;
      of these radiolabeled tracers is 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which is used to determine&#xD;
      abnormal glucose metabolism in tumours and other sites. It has general applications in all&#xD;
      areas where abnormal glucose metabolism may be present including circumstances such as&#xD;
      differentiating tumour from scar tissue, evaluating the presence of tumour in the light of&#xD;
      rising tumour markers and normal morphological imaging techniques and assessing response to&#xD;
      therapy where other techniques are deemed to be unhelpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cross Cancer Institute has recently been funded to establish a PET centre that will&#xD;
      establish a research programme to prove the effectiveness of PET scanning in the Canadian&#xD;
      health care environment and validate the data that have been developed in other jurisdictions&#xD;
      in specific oncologic indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives - The objectives of the clinical trial are to (a) demonstrate the safety&#xD;
      of 18F-FDG synthesised from cyclotron produced radiofluoride in the Coincidence Technologies&#xD;
      automated synthesis unit (ASU) in the Edmonton PET Centre facility and (b) confirm the&#xD;
      diagnostic effectiveness of 18F-FDG in subjects with known or suspected oncologic disease and&#xD;
      to compare this with values published in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives - The secondary objectives of the clinical trial are to confirm the&#xD;
      general utility and value of 18F-FDG imaging of abnormal glucose metabolism in oncologic&#xD;
      applications, particularly with respect to Canadian practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical trial will be a combined Phase I/II, Phase III, extended Phase III&#xD;
      (Phase I/II,III,exIII), diagnostic imaging, controlled, open label, single site, clinical&#xD;
      trial in a broad cross-section of CCI patients, including patients with Hodgkin and&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancers,&#xD;
      PRUNK, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, NSCLC, SCLC, neuroendocrine tumours, and patients&#xD;
      with CNS tumours where conventional imaging methods have failed to yield a diagnostic answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will usually receive a single IV injection of 18F-FDG. Imaging will be conducted&#xD;
      30 to 60 minutes after an average injection of 200 - 300 MBq of 18F-FDG in hydrated, fasted&#xD;
      patients. Images will be collected for 40 to 60 minutes in 5 - 7 body positions (total counts&#xD;
      5 to 15 million). For the Phase I/II study, images will be interpreted by a single&#xD;
      experienced Nuclear Medicine physician with regard to normal physiological uptake of 18F-FDG.&#xD;
      For the Phase III study, images will be interpreted independently by two experienced Nuclear&#xD;
      Medicine physicians with regard to normal physiological uptake of 18F-FDG. The location and&#xD;
      intensity of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake will be noted and correlated with clinical findings,&#xD;
      surgical or biopsy results or with conventional imaging techniques, as available. The image&#xD;
      review will be supplemented with access to clinical and conventional imaging data in the&#xD;
      Phase I/II study. In the Phase III study all images will be reviewed independently by one&#xD;
      physician blinded to all clinical data except the primary diagnosis and by one physician with&#xD;
      access to all relevant clinical information. In the extended Phase III protocol the images&#xD;
      will be interpreted by a single physician with access to relevant clinical information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I/II stage will enroll 20 subjects without regard for tumour type. The Phase III&#xD;
      stage will enroll approximately 300 subjects and the extended Phase III stage will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 3000 subjects with the approximate distribution by tumour type as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour Type Phase III:Extended Phase III&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain 10:100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal 33:330&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast 21:210&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung (NSCLC &amp; SCLC) 130:1300&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's) 22:220&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Head &amp; Neck 16:160&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroendocrine 10:100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid 29:290&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanoma 15:150&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRUNK 14:140&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cancer subgroup in the Phase III stage, where disease status confirmation is&#xD;
      available, the sensitivity (true positive outcomes/true positive outcomes + false negative&#xD;
      outcomes) and positive predictive value (true positive outcomes/true positive outcomes +&#xD;
      false positive outcomes) will be calculated on a per patient basis. The general criteria for&#xD;
      assessment of comparability is that the study group sensitivity percent and positive&#xD;
      predictive value percent values have a difference of not less than 15 percent from the&#xD;
      appropriately matched literature values. For subgroups with significant patient numbers&#xD;
      statistical analysis of comparability will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluability of Study Subject Data All subjects enrolled in the Phase I/II stage&#xD;
      of the trial will be evaluated for safety. All subjects enrolled in the Phase III and&#xD;
      extended Phase III study will be evaluated for safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects to be Studied Phase I/II stage: ~ 20 Phase III stage: ~ 300 Extended Phase&#xD;
      III stage: ~ 3000 Some variation in the patient numbers studied is anticipated in the Phase&#xD;
      III and extended Phase III depending on local conditions and timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
