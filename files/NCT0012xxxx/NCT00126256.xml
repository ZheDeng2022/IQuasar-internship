  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is based on systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Several effective drugs are currently available and can be administered either sequentially&#xD;
      or in combination. Most patients receive 2 or 3 lines of chemotherapy. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized trial is to evaluate the potential benefit of a bitherapy with 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU) and oxaliplatin as first line chemotherapy compared with a sequential chemotherapy&#xD;
      with 5-FU alone as first line chemotherapy followed by the combination of 5-FU with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin in case of progressive disease, in terms of progression-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of oxaliplatin and irinotecan to 5-FU improves tumor response rate and&#xD;
      progression-free survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer compared with 5-FU&#xD;
      alone, but increases toxicity. It is not clear whether such combination therapies&#xD;
      (5-FU+oxaliplatin or 5-FU+irinotecan) should be systematically used as first line treatment&#xD;
      or as second line treatment after 5-FU failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: open-label, multicentric, randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The main objective of this multiline strategy trial was to compare two 5-FU based&#xD;
      regimens with or without the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU in the first line setting in&#xD;
      terms of progression-free survival after two lines of chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: first line, 2-hour infusion 400 mg/m² leucovorin (LV) followed by 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      400 mg/m² and 46-hours 2,400 mg/m² every 2 weeks (LV5FU2), second line, LV5FU2 + oxaliplatin&#xD;
      100 mg/m² as a 2-hour perfusion on day 1 (FOLFOX6), third line, LV5FU2 + irinotecan 180 mg/m²&#xD;
      (FOLFIRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm: first line, FOLFOX6, second line, FOLFIRI, third line, 5-FU 250 mg/m²/day&#xD;
      in continuous perfusion 7 out of 8 weeks or capecitabine 2,500 mg/m² per oral 14 out of 21&#xD;
      days or inclusion in a phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unresectable metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bidimensionally measurable disease (WHO criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO performance status of 2 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate hematologic, renal function and liver functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No previous chemotherapy other than previous adjuvant chemotherapy or concomitant&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of the primary&#xD;
           tumor completed at least 6 months before inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed written inform consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C-30) filled out&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No possible regular follow-up for psychological, social or geographical reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active coronary heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central nervous system metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past history of second malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous chemotherapy with irinotecan or oxaliplatin based regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed centrally using a minimization technique, stratifying patients&#xD;
      according to centre, previous adjuvant treatment, WHO performance status, and number of&#xD;
      metastatic sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-free survival after two lines of chemotherapy, defined as the time duration from&#xD;
      randomization until progression after two lines of chemotherapy or death whatever the cause&#xD;
      in the absence of progression or last-follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival, secondary surgery, response rate, progression-free survival after the first&#xD;
      and the third line of chemotherapy, safety, quality of life and costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessments is performed every 8 weeks, quality of live assessment every 8 weeks until&#xD;
      progression after 2 lines of chemotherapy or for one year if no progression. After the end of&#xD;
      the planned treatment, patients are followed up until death or the cut-off date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      570 patients, 285 per arm will be needed to detect a difference in median of progression-free&#xD;
      survival after two lines of chemotherapy of 3 months from 10 months in the control arm to 13&#xD;
      months in the experimental arm, for a type I error of 5% and a power of 80% (bilateral log&#xD;
      rank test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be performed according to the intent-to treat principle. An interim&#xD;
      analysis is planned after the inclusion of 400 patients with 3 months follow-up or the&#xD;
      occurrence of 250 events and reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated duration of the trial: accrual period, 3 years, minimum follow-up, one year&#xD;
