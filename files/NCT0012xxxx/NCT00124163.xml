  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) colonography has gained widespread multi-disciplinary interest as an&#xD;
      evolving noninvasive colorectal screening examination, with the potential of improved patient&#xD;
      compliance. The investigator's prior work demonstrated that the bowel preparation was the&#xD;
      least tolerable aspect of colorectal evaluation when compared to the CT colonography and&#xD;
      optical colonoscopy procedures. Stool tagging could provide a more gentle and efficient bowel&#xD;
      preparation, with fewer false positives due to retained stool-mimicking polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that image quality and patient preference will vary with stool&#xD;
      tagging concentration and dosing schedule. The researchers propose to evaluate specific stool&#xD;
      tagging protocols with the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Perform a randomized trial of three specific stool tagging protocols using barium and&#xD;
      iodine at CT colonography in a well-characterized cohort of patients undergoing colorectal&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Analyze the CT colonography and optical colonoscopy data to assess differences across&#xD;
      stool tagging protocols for the outcome measures of patient preference, image quality in the&#xD;
      presence of tagging, and diagnostic reader performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use specific variations in stool tagging techniques to determine the&#xD;
      best image quality of CT data (e.g., homogenous tagging of fluid and stool), and highest&#xD;
      patient acceptability, as well as evaluate the adequacy of preparation for same-day&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Diagnostic reader performance will focus on the accuracy for detecting all&#xD;
      neoplastic lesions including colon cancers, adenomatous polyps, sessile adenomas and flat&#xD;
      adenomas. Most importantly, these results will help inform the design of a larger trial of an&#xD;
      optimized CT colonography technique in a community setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CT Colonography, a rapidly evolving technique, offers a noninvasive and efficient colorectal&#xD;
      screening examination, with the potential to improve patient compliance. However, currently&#xD;
      it requires the bowel preparation, one of the largest barriers to colonoscopy screening. A&#xD;
      promising new tool in CT Colonography is stool tagging, which has the potential to decrease&#xD;
      the amount of catharsis required by patients during the bowel preparation, while decreasing&#xD;
      the number of false positives due to the reader mistaking residual stool for polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that image quality and patient compliance differ depending upon the&#xD;
      tagging agent and dosing schedule. Our strategy is to vary key components of recently&#xD;
      reported barium and iodine protocols to further optimize them and to compare our results with&#xD;
      existing and currently aggregating data in collaboration with other investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following aims will implement this strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Perform a randomized control trial of specific stool tagging protocols at CT&#xD;
      Colonography in a well characterized cohort of patients undergoing colorectal evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1A - Recruit a prospective cohort of 60 subjects, randomize them equally to three&#xD;
      different stool tagging protocols, and sequentially perform CT Colonography and optical&#xD;
      colonoscopy on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1B - Assess image quality of CT Colonography and optical colonoscopy data by the method&#xD;
      of bowel preparation in the first five subjects of each arm and implement specific changes,&#xD;
      if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Analyze the CT Colonography and optical colonoscopy data to assess differences across&#xD;
      study arms for the outcome measures of patient preference, image quality of tagged stool, and&#xD;
      diagnostic reader performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2A: Assess patient expectations regarding the bowel preparations, CT Colonography and&#xD;
      colonoscopy before the procedures and their preferences after the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2B: Evaluate image quality, in the presence of tagged stool and fluid, of both the CT&#xD;
      data and the colonoscopy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2C: Perform a multi-observer reader evaluation of diagnostic performance of CT&#xD;
      Colonography and colonoscopy, compared to the enhanced reference standard of colonoscopy&#xD;
      aided by segmental unblinding of CT results, to assess sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      colorectal polyp detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion, the three specific variations in stool tagging techniques will be compared&#xD;
      on homogenous density of tagging and patient acceptability to determine which protocol&#xD;
      optimizes the trade-off. Diagnostic performance of CT and colonoscopy will be compared to the&#xD;
      enhanced reference standard of colonoscopy aided by the segmental unblinding of CT results.&#xD;
      Most significantly, these results may help determine an optimal tagging protocol to use for&#xD;
      larger trials of CT Colonography implementation in community settings.&#xD;
