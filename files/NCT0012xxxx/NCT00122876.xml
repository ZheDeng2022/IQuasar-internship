      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Litx™ treatment is safe and effective&#xD;
      in treating inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Litx™ is an integrated treatment system comprising an intravenously administered&#xD;
      photosensitizing agent, Talaporfin Sodium (LS11), that is activated by non-coherent light&#xD;
      generated inside the tumor by an implanted light emitting diode (LED) array light source.&#xD;

      Subjects that provide Informed Consent and satisfy the Eligibility Criteria will undergo CT&#xD;
      or Ultrasound guided percutaneous placement of a single, two, three, or four Light Sources&#xD;
      depending on their tumor characteristics. No more than four Light Sources will be used at a&#xD;
      single treatment session. The Light Sources may be used in a single lesion or in multiple&#xD;
      lesions. Depending on lesion size, one or more Light Sources may be used to treat a single&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ultrasound or CT confirmation of the Light Sources, patients will receive an&#xD;
      intravenous dose of LS11 at 1 mg/kg. 15 minutes to 1 hour following completion of LS11&#xD;
      administration, delivery of 200 J/cm light energy at 20 mW/cm will begin. Upon completion of&#xD;
      light treatment, the Light Sources will then be manually removed and the patients will be&#xD;
      observed for acute complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment-related adverse events at every scheduled clinical&#xD;
      visit. Restaging by contrast enhanced spiral CT and tumor evaluation, using the RECIST&#xD;
      criteria, are performed at Week 4 and Week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may receive a second Litx™ treatment at Week 4 or Week 8, as recommended by the&#xD;
      study investigator. Subjects who receive the second Litx™ treatment will be evaluated for&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events at every scheduled clinical visit. Restaging by contrast&#xD;
      enhanced spiral CT and tumor evaluation, using the RECIST criteria, are performed. The active&#xD;
      phase of the protocol ends 8 weeks after the last treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the active phase of the protocol, subjects will be monitored for&#xD;
      survival for one year (at 6, 9 and 12 month time points) from the date of study entry or&#xD;
      until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), established by any one of the&#xD;
             following criteria in a clinical setting suggestive of HCC: (i) Two different imaging&#xD;
             techniques that suggests HCC; (ii) Combination of one imaging technique that suggests&#xD;
             HCC and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level &gt;400 ng/mL; (iii) Histological evidence of&#xD;
             HCC;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with at least 1 but no more than 3 lesions in the liver may be considered for&#xD;
             enrollment in the study;&#xD;

             other locally ablative technology may be eligible, but at least 4 weeks must have&#xD;
             elapsed since the completion of any prior therapy and the subject must have recovered&#xD;
             from acute side effects;&#xD;
