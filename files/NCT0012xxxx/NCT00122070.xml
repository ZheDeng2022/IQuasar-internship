      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to quantitatively examine the efficacy of Seroquel (active&#xD;
      ingredient quetiapine fumarate) in subjects with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). A&#xD;
      secondary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of utilizing quetiapine in&#xD;
      patients with Borderline Personality Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator initiated, 6-week, non-placebo controlled, non-randomized, open-label, single&#xD;
      drug, single-center, medication trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers (n = 15) diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder using the Structured&#xD;
      Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with Borderline Personality Disorder are washed out of all other medications. The&#xD;
      subjects are then given the study drug at a dose within the drug's known therapeutic range.&#xD;

      Study Design: A six week, open-label, flexible dosing study using quetiapine. Subjects who&#xD;
      qualify at Screening will then proceed to the baseline visit. If all inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are met, subjects will be administered quetiapine at the baseline visit. Enrollment&#xD;
      will be 15 subjects. Enrollment is expected to last for a 6 month period.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Antipsychotic agents other than quetiapine will not be allowed during the study period.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients on anticonvulsants, lithium and benzodiazepines will be allowed to enter the study&#xD;
      if they have been on the same dose of these agents for three months prior to the baseline&#xD;
      visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      How Will the Study Be Analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Studies: Studies will be done at baseline and will screen for liver disease,&#xD;
      kidney disease, electrolyte imbalance, thyroid or parathyroid dysfunction, respiratory&#xD;
      acidosis or alkalosis, anemia, adequate blood cell and platelet count, pregnancy, and&#xD;
      presence of illegal drugs. Any subjects with significant laboratory abnormalities will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events: Subjects will be screened for the following side effects of quetiapine which&#xD;
      are dizziness (10%), postural hypotension (7%), dry mouth (7%), and dyspepsia (6%),&#xD;
      tachycardia (7%) and somnolence (18%). Patients will be also be monitored for other rare&#xD;
      events including seizures, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).&#xD;
      Other less common side effects (&gt; 1%) include headache (19% vs placebo 17%), asthenia (3% vs&#xD;
      2%), abdominal pain (3% vs 1%), back pain (2% vs 1%), fever (2% vs 1%), constipation (9% vs&#xD;
      5%),w eight gain (2% vs 0%), rash (4% vs 3%), rhinitis (3% vs 1%), and ear pain (1% vs 0%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be reported and statistically analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients who begin and complete the study (maximum n = 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who dropout of the study or are terminated with reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients who had personality disorders in addition to Borderline Personality&#xD;
           Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final average dose of quetiapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total score and percentage change of each scale and subscale utilized in the study&#xD;
           and whether there was a statistically significant increase or reduction during the&#xD;
           period of quetiapine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement Disorder side effects as assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale&#xD;
           and the Simpson-Angus Scale and whether there was a statistically significant increase&#xD;
           or reduction during the period of quetiapine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number and percentage of adverse events that occurred during the period of&#xD;
           quetiapine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number and percentage of any abnormal laboratory results that occurred during the&#xD;
           period of quetiapine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of data collection, the data will be analyzed to determine appropriate&#xD;
      parametric analyses. As the N for this study will be 15, a T-test analysis may be applicable&#xD;
      if the data permit. We anticipate a preliminary demonstration of treatment effect. Individual&#xD;
      weekly scores will serve as dependent variables which lend themselves to a one-way analysis&#xD;
      to demonstrate difference between baseline and 6 weeks of active treatment. If our data&#xD;
      permit, a two-way T-test will also be employed to demonstrate statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in treatment effect. As our data will likely require the utilization of multiple&#xD;
      two-way analyses, our data will be Bonferroni corrected in order to adjust for the&#xD;
      possibility of false positive (type II) errors. Other parametric analyses will be employed as&#xD;
      the data warrant.&#xD;
