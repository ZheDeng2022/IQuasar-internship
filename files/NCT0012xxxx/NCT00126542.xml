  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with erlotinib works in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may&#xD;
      also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Erlotinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      bevacizumab together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the median&#xD;
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral&#xD;
      erlotinib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity due to 1 of the study drugs may continue&#xD;
      treatment with the remaining study drug alone in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
