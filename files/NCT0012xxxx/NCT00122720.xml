  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating whether randomization to perioperative darbepoetin alfa treatment&#xD;
      improves the rehabilitation following surgery for colonic and rectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major surgery elicits a metabolic stress response that is followed by a loss of body mass,&#xD;
      fatigue, and an impaired physical performance including a reduced work capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform ordinary daily activities many elderly people exert close to their maximum&#xD;
      physical capacity, and even a small reduction of performance capacity may cause significant&#xD;
      impairment in physical and social activity. Postoperative decline in strength and work&#xD;
      capacity may thus cause previously independent living persons to become dependent upon&#xD;
      assistance from others. Hence, it is important to avoid the postoperative reduction of&#xD;
      physical performance and to minimize postoperative fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that Erythropoietin treatment reduces the need for blood transfusions in&#xD;
      patients undergoing planned colonic surgery. However, the effect of Erythropoietin treatment&#xD;
      upon postoperative rehabilitation has not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the main hypothesis in this study is that perioperative treatment with Darbepoetin&#xD;
      Alfa would improve the physical capacity in aspects by reducing postoperative fatigue and&#xD;
      improve work capacity, balance and quality of life compared to placebo treatment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the researchers expect Darbepoetin treated patients to have fewer perioperative&#xD;
      complications and less need for blood transfusions.&#xD;
