      This study will determine if the type of gesture, increased quantity of an image, and the&#xD;
      number of times a face is shown repeating a gesture bring about activation in the &quot;mirror&#xD;
      neurons.&quot; Researchers aim to learn about which areas of the brain are necessary to perform&#xD;
      certain cognitive tasks-that is, relating to a person's thinking or remembering-especially&#xD;
      visual and motor tasks. Because one way humans learn is by imitation, a mechanism is required&#xD;
      to transfer the behavior the person adopts from others through observation. This type of&#xD;
      learning could be based on a mechanism similar to that provided by mirror neurons. From&#xD;
      previous studies it has been learned that the observation of hands and mouths has brought&#xD;
      about the most effective ways of activating the mirror neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 21 to 55 who are in good health, are right handed, are not pregnant, and are&#xD;
      native speakers of English may be eligible for this study. There will be about 24&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Before the scan, they will&#xD;
      complete a safety questionnaire about the presence of any metal in their bodies. Patients are&#xD;
      at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have pacemakers, dental implants or other&#xD;
      devices. Female patients will undergo a pregnancy test. The technique MRI uses includes a&#xD;
      strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. During the&#xD;
      initial MRI scan, patients will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel&#xD;
      of the scanner. They will be in the scanner for about an hour. During the procedure, they may&#xD;
      be asked to lie as still as possible for up to 20 minutes at a time. As the scanner takes&#xD;
      pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds. Each participant will wear earplugs&#xD;
      to reduce this noise. They will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during&#xD;
      the scan, and they may ask to be removed from the machine at any time. The functional MRI&#xD;
      (fMRI) scan will involve taking pictures of the brain while patients are performing tasks.&#xD;
      All the tasks will be explained, and patients will have the chance to practice them before&#xD;
      entering the scanner. During the fMRI, patients will view short film segments of people&#xD;
      making gestures. Before and after the scan, patients will be asked to complete several short&#xD;
      questionnaires. The testing sessions will take a total of about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive compensation for their time and inconvenience, with a maximum&#xD;
      payment of $200. This study will not have a direct benefit for participants.&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose of the protocol is to determine the effects of the social content of&#xD;
      gestures on brain activation patterns. We will localize the extent and areas of brain&#xD;
      activation by using functional MRI during observation of gesture varied by type of gesture,&#xD;
      number of images shown at a time, and number of times a subject is exposed to a face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Healthy, normal adult volunteers will participate in a gesture observation&#xD;
      experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The experiment we are conducting will employ an event-related design to determine&#xD;
      whether increasing the social content of the gesture spreads activation from traditional&#xD;
      sensorimotor regions engaged in mirror movement activity to regions in the prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (PFC) concerned with processing social behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The data collected will consist of accuracy measures of cognitive&#xD;
      performance, fMRI images, and post-questionnaire results. The results gained from this&#xD;
      protocol will provide evidence for a social effect of gesturing.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all the studies, subjects will consist of healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed&#xD;
        volunteers, as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Subjects will range in age&#xD;
        from 21 to 55 years old and they will be included regardless of race or gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded as mentioned above, as&#xD;
        will non-neurologically normal volunteers. Subjects younger than 21 and older than 55 will&#xD;
        be excluded. A urine pregnancy test will be employed with all women of childbearing age.&#xD;
        The results must be negative in order to proceed with the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any of the following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted&#xD;
        cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body, e.g. metal&#xD;
        shavings; permanent eyeliner; insulin pump; or irremovable body piercing will be excluded&#xD;
        from the study due to the possible dangerous effects of the magnet upon metal objects in&#xD;
        the body. Subjects taking central nervous system active medications will be excluded.&#xD;
