      This study will determine how the brain controls movements by sending messages to the spinal&#xD;
      cord and muscles. Researchers want to know if strengthening a hand muscle will increase the&#xD;
      strength of the same muscle in the other hand, and if these changes happen in the brain or&#xD;
      spine, or both. Plasticity in this study refers to the capacity for continuous changes of the&#xD;
      neural pathways in the brain and nervous system. Researchers have seen cases in which using a&#xD;
      muscle extensively (force production) in one muscle group has increased the strength of the&#xD;
      same muscle group on the opposite side of the body (force transfer). This situation happens&#xD;
      without the unused muscle becoming larger-suggesting that the practice causes changes in some&#xD;
      parts of the brain or spine. It is vital for scientists to know how this effect works, so&#xD;
      that they can create new rehabilitation methods for people who cannot move or who have&#xD;
      difficulty moving one side of their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 60 who are in good health and who do not have a history of major&#xD;
      conditions affecting the bones, joints or nervous system may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a medical examination. There will be 1 or 2 testing sessions, 20&#xD;
      training sessions, and 1 or 2 final testing sessions, with patients being asked to come to&#xD;
      the laboratory for as few as 4 times (about 10 hours total) or for up to 25 visits (about 20&#xD;
      hours total). The investigator will indicate which of six different groups that a patient is&#xD;
      selected for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During testing sessions, the strength of the pointer and little fingers in each hand will be&#xD;
      determined through the use of very brief electrical pulses. There also will be transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) and 1 Hz TMS. The researchers will place one or two wire coils on&#xD;
      the patient's scalp and make marks on the scalp which will be removed at the end of the&#xD;
      session. During the TMS, a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a&#xD;
      magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click sound and feel a&#xD;
      snapping sensation on the skin. They may also feel and see small twitches in the hand&#xD;
      muscles, and the fingers or wrist may move. There will be a total of about 300 magnetic&#xD;
      stimuli, at a rate of 10 pulses per minute. Patients will also have an electromyogram (EMG),&#xD;
      a procedure recording electrical activity in the muscles that are activated by electrical or&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation. Metal electrodes will be attached to the skin over the muscle. During&#xD;
      the EMG, patients will be asked to tense certain muscles slightly. Depending on the group a&#xD;
      patient is assigned to, he or she may be asked to use the right index finger by using&#xD;
      voluntary muscle movement, electrical stimulation, his or her imagination, electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of a different hand muscle, or voluntary movements immediately followed by&#xD;
      repetitive TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of group assignment, there will be five blocks of 10 repetitions of finger&#xD;
      exercise per session, 200 per week, and 1,000 throughout the whole study. During the study&#xD;
      sessions, patients will be able to talk and move around. They can take a break and leave the&#xD;
      room if needed. In most cases, the session will take less than 2 hours. There also will be a&#xD;
      control group whose members will not be training their fingers but who will participate only&#xD;
      in the testing sessions. TMS is a safe procedure; however, strong contractions of scalp&#xD;
      muscles have been known to cause headaches. Also, because of the distracting noise of the&#xD;
      TMS, patients will be fitted with earplugs to wear during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation for research-related discomfort and inconvenience will be made to participants,&#xD;
      with a maximum of $500 to $600, depending on assignment to groups. This study will not have a&#xD;
      direct benefit for participants. However, researchers hope to gain information that will help&#xD;
      them better understand how the two sides of the brain control movement and how they affect&#xD;
      each other regarding movement control.&#xD;

      Strength training of a limb muscle on one side of the body produces functionally and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful increases in motor output of the same muscle on the opposite side of&#xD;
      the body. Such adaptations occur without muscle hypertrophy, implying a role for the&#xD;
      ipsilateral motor cortex and the spinal cord in force transfer. The goal of this project is&#xD;
      to determine the interhemispheric and spinal mechanisms of force transfer in healthy young&#xD;
      adults. We hypothesize that the effects of unilateral practice on interhemispheric inhibition&#xD;
      (IHI) and on the excitability of the contralateral corticospinal projections are linked, and&#xD;
      these effects are graded according to the nature of muscle activation. In a series of&#xD;
      experiments on healthy adults age 18 to 60, we will characterize the motor cortical&#xD;
      inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms of interhemispheric practice-induced transfer of muscle&#xD;
      force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a longitudinal design that will include three exercise groups. In 20 sessions&#xD;
      over 4 weeks, subjects will strengthen their first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle of the&#xD;
      dominant hand either with voluntary, electrically stimulated, or imagined contractions. The&#xD;
      design also includes three control groups, a sham-stimulated group, a repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (1HzTMS) group, and a no-intervention group. Before and after the&#xD;
      training programs, we will determine the changes in the outcome measures, including voluntary&#xD;
      and electrical stimulation evoked force of the trained and the untrained FDI. Measures of&#xD;
      excitability of the involved and uninvolved motor cortex, assessed with TMS, and measures of&#xD;
      spinal cord excitability, assessed with peripheral nerve stimulation, are the additional&#xD;
      outcome measures. The results of these studies will substantially increase our understanding&#xD;
      of central nervous system (CNS) control of voluntary movement in health and disease.&#xD;
