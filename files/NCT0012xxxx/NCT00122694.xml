      The purpose of this study is to determine whether carbon monoxide is effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of stable COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is characterised by a chronic pulmonary inflammation and a shifted oxidant/antioxidant&#xD;
      balance. The main cause of this inflammation is smoking. After smoking cessation, this&#xD;
      inflammation and shifted oxidant/antioxidant balance continues. This causes an increased&#xD;
      deterioration of lung function compared to healthy persons of matching age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing inflammation appears to be relatively insensitive to corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there is no therapy for this inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies show&#xD;
      that carbon monoxide has, besides an antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory properties. The&#xD;
      aim of this trial is to study whether the inflammation can be reduced by inhalation of carbon&#xD;
      monoxide.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women, age &gt; 40 years. Women must be post-menopausal (i.e. at least one year&#xD;
             must have passed after the last menstruation), surgically sterile or using acceptable&#xD;
             contraceptives, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of COPD according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS);&#xD;
             a disease state characterised by the presence of chronic airway obstruction due to&#xD;
             chronic bronchitis (cough/sputum on most days a week for 3 months a year for at least&#xD;
             two successive years); or emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 &gt; 0.7 litres&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 70% (equation retrieval system [ERS] equations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A smoking history of &gt; 10 pack years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completely stopped smoking &gt; 1 year ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the last 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In a stable phase of COPD, as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any study related procedures&#xD;
             (including withdrawal of concomitant medication) are conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with immune-modulating agents for any other disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of asthma; former diagnosis of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) &lt; 8.0 kPa&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant other pulmonary disease or disorder (e.g. alpha1-antitrypsin&#xD;
             deficiency, bronchiectasies), as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other significant disease or disorder (like cardiovascular,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic&#xD;
             [including diagnosed diabetes], malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment),&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because&#xD;
             of participation in the study; or may influence the results of the study, or the&#xD;
             patient's ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to blow reproducable lung function measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using medicine with anti-oxidant character like n-acetyl-cysteine.&#xD;
