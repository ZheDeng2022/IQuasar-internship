    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis, or thinning of the bones is a common disorder which can cause significant&#xD;
      morbidity in terms of pain and fracture. One of the causes of osteoporosis is a low or absent&#xD;
      testosterone level. Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in males with an&#xD;
      increasing incidence. The mainstay of advanced prostate cancer treatment is hormonal&#xD;
      manipulation (surgery or medications) in order to lower testosterone levels as testosterone&#xD;
      stimulates cancer cells. Despite the known links both between osteoporosis, low testosterone,&#xD;
      and prostate cancer, little data is available on how common osteoporosis is among men with&#xD;
      advanced prostate cancer treated with hormonal manipulation. Since prostate cancer affects so&#xD;
      many men and the indications for early hormonal manipulation are expanding, it is important&#xD;
      to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis in these males.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION - Osteoporosis is a common disorder with many predisposing factors including&#xD;
      hypogonadism from a variety of causes. Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy&#xD;
      in men. The standard treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer is hormonal manipulation&#xD;
      in order to decrease testosterone levels which renders a man hypogonadal. There is an&#xD;
      increasing body of literature that suggests men with prostate cancer treated with hormonal&#xD;
      manipulation develop osteoporosis and associated complications more commonly than aged&#xD;
      matched controls. With the increasing incidence of prostate cancer and the increasing&#xD;
      indications with hormonal therapy use in advanced prostate cancer, osteoporosis in these men&#xD;
      is a major health concern.Hormonal manipulation in order to obtain castrate levels of&#xD;
      testosterone can be achieved with bilateral orchiectomy, Luteinizing Hormone Releasing&#xD;
      Hormone agonists (LHRHA) and steroidal antiandrogens combined with mini doses of estrogen&#xD;
      based therapy. Nonsteroidal antiandrogens are also used in the management of advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer however, on their own, are not enough to suppress testosterone. The data on&#xD;
      exactly how common and severe a problem osteoporosis is in men treated with different forms&#xD;
      of hormonal manipulation is sparse and because of the lack of data, there is currently no&#xD;
      accepted standard of care in the investigation and management of osteoporosis in these men.&#xD;
      The researchers propose to start with a pilot study to first determine the prevalence of&#xD;
      osteoporosis in 6 different populations of men with advanced prostate cancer, (1) newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, (2) treated with orchiectomy, (3) treated with an LHRHA, (4) treated with&#xD;
      steroidal antiandrogen therapy, (5) treated with nonsteroidal antiandrogen based therapy, (6)&#xD;
      treated with complete androgen blockade (LHRHA plus a nonsteroidal antiandrogen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES - To determine, in the above populations, the bone mineral density as measured by&#xD;
      Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) of the lumbar spine, proximal hip (total hip, femoral&#xD;
      neck and trochanter), and non-dominant distal radius, to document biochemical markers of bone&#xD;
      turnover, to document vertebral fractures and body height, to document other aspects of body&#xD;
      composition including adipose tissue and muscle mass as measured by whole body composition&#xD;
      densitometry, and to document other potential confounding factors predisposing prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients to osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN - This primarily will be a descriptive, exploratory study describing the&#xD;
      prevalence of osteoporosis in each of the 6 groups defined above. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      osteoporosis will be based on bone densitometry studies. There are accepted densitometric&#xD;
      criteria for the assessment of normal and abnormal bone mass. The criteria were largely&#xD;
      developed in postmenopausal Caucasian women but reference values are also available for&#xD;
      Caucasian, Black and Hispanic men. Normal bone density is described as a T-score less than&#xD;
      -1. T-scores between -1 and -2.5 are indicative of osteopenia, and T-scores of less than -2.5&#xD;
      are indicative of osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis (T value less than 2.5) in&#xD;
      each of the groups will be reported. Information on biochemical markers of bone turnover,&#xD;
      vertebral fractures, and other risk factors will also be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT SELECTION - Patients with biopsy proven advanced prostate cancer, no known prior&#xD;
      clinical or radiographic history of osteoporosis, minimum of 1 year of hormonal therapy in&#xD;
      arms 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and an ability and willingness to give informed consent. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria - Patients with known bone disorders other than metastatic disease such as&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, and documented osteomalacia as&#xD;
      well as osteoporosis, patients who have received a bisphosphonate, systemic fluoride,&#xD;
      pharmacological doses of calcium (less than 1500 mg/day) or Vitamin D (less than 1000&#xD;
      IU/day), or calcitonin, patients with known abnormal thyroid function, and patients with&#xD;
      marked renal impairment (creatinine less than 2.0 X normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS - This will be an outpatient study. All patients will initially be&#xD;
      assessed by a research nurse and/or physician at the Cross Cancer Institute with a prostate&#xD;
      cancer specific history, blood and urine tests. Patients will be referred to a single&#xD;
      endocrinologist for a more detailed osteoporosis history and physical exam. On the same day,&#xD;
      they will have a densitometry study, whole body composition study, and plain radiographs&#xD;
      taken. Patients will then be seen at the Cross Cancer Institute to discuss their results.&#xD;
      Should a diagnosis of osteoporosis be made, a letter indicating this will be sent to the&#xD;
      patient's family physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS - The primary endpoint will be bone mineral density. Osteoporosis will be diagnosed&#xD;
      if the T value is less than -2.5. The secondary endpoints will be - biochemical markers of&#xD;
      bone turnover, vertebral fractures, vertebral body height, body composition of fat, body&#xD;
      composition of adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS - The data will be entered into a computerized database. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      will be tabulated for all 5 arms being studied with respect to demographic variables,&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, and test results.&#xD;
