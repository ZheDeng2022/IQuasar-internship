  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) present in cirrhotic patients induces severe&#xD;
      circulatory dysfunction, which results in renal failure in up to 30% of the patients. Renal&#xD;
      failure is an important prognostic marker, representing the major predictive factor of&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that plasma volume expansion with albumin associated with&#xD;
      cefotaxime in patients with SBP is more efficient to prevent renal failure than cefotaxime&#xD;
      treatment alone. The in-hospital and three-month mortality rates, furthermore, were&#xD;
      significantly lower in the group treated with albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known if other bacterial infections unrelated to SBP represent a risk factor for&#xD;
      the development of renal failure among cirrhotic patients. The researcher's group has&#xD;
      recently performed a study to evaluate the incidence, characteristics and outcome, of renal&#xD;
      failure in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections unrelated to SBP associated with&#xD;
      the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (Terra, unpublished results). Among a total of&#xD;
      106 patients, 29 (27%) presented renal failure during the course of infection. Renal failure&#xD;
      was characterized by intense renal vasoconstriction (intrarenal resistive index of 0.83 +/-&#xD;
      0.09, measured by Doppler ultrasound), reduction of mean arterial pressure and an important&#xD;
      activation of endogenous vasoconstriction systems. The three-month survival probability of&#xD;
      patients with infection and renal failure was 34 %, much lower than that of patients with&#xD;
      infection but not presenting renal failure (87%, p&lt;0.0001). These results suggest that the&#xD;
      development of renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections different&#xD;
      from SBP, associated with signs of a systemic inflammatory response, is very frequent and&#xD;
      results in a very poor prognosis. Taken as a whole, these data strongly indicate the need to&#xD;
      consider these patients as candidates for liver transplantation and to plan strategies for&#xD;
      its prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project, therefore, is to evaluate if the plasma volume expansion with&#xD;
      albumin, associated with conventional antibiotic therapy, can prevent the development of&#xD;
      renal failure and increase survival rates in cirrhotic patients with bacterial infections&#xD;
      unrelated to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that the administration of cefotaxime (first choice treatment for&#xD;
      SBP) associated with plasma volume expansion with albumin in patients with SBP, was more&#xD;
      efficient to prevent renal failure than cefotaxime treatment alone (10% vs. 33%,&#xD;
      respectively). The in-hospital and three-month mortality rates, furthermore, were&#xD;
      significantly lower in the group treated with albumin (10% vs. 29% and 22% vs. 41%,&#xD;
      respectively). There was a significant increase in the plasma renin activity in the group&#xD;
      treated with cefotaxime alone as compared to the group receiving cefotaxime associated with&#xD;
      the expansion with albumin. A direct relationship between plasma renin activity levels and&#xD;
      the development of renal failure was also observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous information the main objective of this study is to evaluate if the&#xD;
      plasma volume expansion with albumin associated to conventional antibiotics therapy, can&#xD;
      prevent the development of renal failure and increase survival rates in cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      with bacterial infections unrelated to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. If that proves to&#xD;
      be the case, albumin should be administered as first choice treatment associated with&#xD;
      antibiotics to all the cirrhotic patients with bacterial infection and systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other parameters to be investigated include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the treatment effects over the renal vascular territory, estimated by&#xD;
           Doppler ultrasonography of the intrarenal arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the relationship between the development of renal failure and the activity&#xD;
           of endogenous vasoactive systems: plasma renin activity, plasma concentration of&#xD;
           aldosterone, noradrenaline, atrial natriuretic factor and nitrites. Evaluation of the&#xD;
           relationship between the development of renal failure and the concentration of&#xD;
           inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, interleukin-1,&#xD;
           interleukin-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of heart function and its relationship with the development of renal failure.&#xD;
