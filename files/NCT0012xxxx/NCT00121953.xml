  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of rosiglitazone versus placebo on soluble&#xD;
      proinflammatory markers in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this proposal is to assess modulation of immune mechanisms in&#xD;
      endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common ailment affecting approximately five million&#xD;
      reproductive-aged American women. We will test the efficacy of a novel immunomodulatory drug&#xD;
      (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, PPAR-gamma, agonist), rosiglitazone, to&#xD;
      reduce peritoneal fluid cytokine concentrations in women with endometriosis compared with&#xD;
      placebo controls (randomized controlled trial). Based on prior studies done by the&#xD;
      investigator highlighting the major role of cytokines and the immune system in the genesis or&#xD;
      propagation of endometriosis, these experiments could lead to improved translational&#xD;
      treatment strategies and a better understanding of endometriosis. Acting through PPAR-gamma,&#xD;
      TZDs inhibit proinflammatory cytokines as well as NF-kB, an important nuclear transcription&#xD;
      factor for the production of many cytokines. Accordingly, since human endometrial epithelial&#xD;
      and stromal cells contain PPAR-gamma, we felt it would be useful to evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      a PPAR-gamma ligand, rosiglitazone, on the concentration of specific peritoneal fluid&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: After the pre-trial screening, eligible subjects with presumed endometriosis and&#xD;
      age 18-45 will be consented and randomly assigned to receive either placebo (control) or&#xD;
      rosiglitazone, Avandia®, 4 mg daily for 2 weeks. Peritoneal fluid will be collected at the&#xD;
      time of surgery and the volume measured. All patients enrolled in the study will have their&#xD;
      surgery during the follicular phase of the cycle in order to minimize differences in volume&#xD;
      and cytokine concentration due to the cyclical changes. The primary measure will be the&#xD;
      peritoneal fluid concentration comparisons of the two groups assessing six different&#xD;
      cytokines: interleukin-1 beta, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy women ages 18 - 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular menstrual cycles (24-35 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pelvic pain ≥3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior (&lt;3 months) use of hormonal therapy (&lt;6 mos for depoprovera users)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endometriosis diagnosed from surgical specimen by routine hematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
             staining and histological evaluation (within the past 4 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major psychiatric conditions or the abuse of alcohol or drugs which would make it&#xD;
             difficult for the subject to complete study procedures.&#xD;

             infection, or history of high-risk activities (e.g., intravenous [IV] drug abuse)&#xD;
             which would increase risk to laboratory personnel. Of note, no testing for hepatitis&#xD;
             or HIV will be performed as part of this study and all tissues will be handled and&#xD;
             discarded as if they were potentially infected.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women with other causes of chronic pelvic pain including infectious, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             musculoskeletal, neurologic or psychiatric.&#xD;
