  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the medication metoclopramide can improve red blood counts&#xD;
      in people who have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS is thought to affect blood stem cells,&#xD;
      which can result in low levels of red blood cells-that is, anemia-as well as low white blood&#xD;
      cell and platelet counts. Patients with MDS are at risk for infection, spontaneous bleeding,&#xD;
      and possible progression to leukemia, a cancer of bone marrow. Although bone marrow can&#xD;
      produce some blood cells, this production can be decreased in patients with MDS. The&#xD;
      definitive way to treat MDS is stem cell transplantation, but serious complications and a&#xD;
      high risk of death make it unsuitable for patients older than age 60 or those who do not have&#xD;
      a matched sibling donor. However, scientists have noted improvement in anemia by using&#xD;
      metoclopramide, an inexpensive, commonly used medication that does not have many negative&#xD;
      side effects. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of that medicine for&#xD;
      patients with MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 72 whose MDS would require low-intensity treatment-for example, with&#xD;
      growth factor and transfusions-and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. There will be about 60 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests include a complete physical examination and medical history, during which&#xD;
      patients will provide a list of current medications or supplements they are taking. There&#xD;
      will be a collection of about 4 tablespoons of blood for analysis of blood counts as well as&#xD;
      liver and kidney function. Patients may also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&#xD;
      of their brain, but the procedure is optional. During the MRI, they will lie on a table that&#xD;
      will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. The MRI takes about 20 to 30 minutes, and&#xD;
      patients will be asked to lie as still as possible. There will also be a bone marrow biopsy,&#xD;
      if patients have not had one done within 4 weeks of the start of this study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will take a 10 mg dose of metoclopramide by mouth, three times a day, for 20 weeks.&#xD;
      They will be given a 4-week supply, which will be renewed monthly at each treatment visit. It&#xD;
      is essential that patients be seen at NIH during the first, third, and fifth months of the&#xD;
      study. Visits made in the meantime, at the second and fourth months, may be done at the&#xD;
      office of their doctors who have referred them for the study, or at NIH. During the treatment&#xD;
      visits, patients will be asked to update their medical history, health conditions, and use of&#xD;
      medications or herbal supplements. There will also be a collection of about 1 tablespoon of&#xD;
      blood for laboratory tests. Patients will be asked to make a similar follow-up visit 1 month&#xD;
      after they stop taking metoclopramide, so that the response to treatment can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of metoclopramide may cause some people to feel dizzy, lightheaded, tired, or less&#xD;
      alert than they are normally. For the first 24 to 48 hours, patients should be cautious when&#xD;
      driving, using machinery, or performing hazardous activities. This medicine will add to the&#xD;
      effects of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants-such as medicines for&#xD;
      allergies and colds, tranquilizers, and prescription pain relievers. Patients need to check&#xD;
      with the research team before taking any of those types of medicines, as well as herbal&#xD;
      supplements, while using metoclopramide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. For some, the drug may&#xD;
      improve red blood cell counts and decrease the need for red cell transfusions. Knowledge&#xD;
      gained in the study may help people in the future.&#xD;

      Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) present with low red blood cells, white blood&#xD;
      cells and platelets, alone or in combination. The only definitive treatment is stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Unfortunately, treatment-related mortality precludes the application of this&#xD;
      procedure for most patients older than 60 years and those lacking a suitable matched sibling&#xD;
      donor. A proportion of patients have been shown to respond to a wide variety of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine (CSA) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG).&#xD;
      However, nonresponse and relapse continue to be problematic. Therefore, most patients with&#xD;
      MDS receive supportive treatment with transfusions and growth factors, such as erythropoietin&#xD;
      (EPO) and G-CSF, to improve blood counts. However, growth factors are not always effective in&#xD;
      improving cytopenias and iron overload is an inevitable long-term complication of red blood&#xD;
      cell transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Abkowitz et al described clinically significant improvement in anemia in 3 of 9&#xD;
      patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) using metoclopramide, an inexpensive, commonly&#xD;
      used medication with rare side effects. We hypothesize that therapy with metoclopramide might&#xD;
      also benefit patients with other causes of refractory anemia, such as individuals with anemia&#xD;
      due to MDS. We therefore propose this Phase II clinical trial to evaluate metoclopramide in&#xD;
      the treatment of anemia in patients with MDS.&#xD;
