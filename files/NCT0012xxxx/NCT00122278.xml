    <textblock>
      Migraines are a specific type of headache that frequently recur and are very painful.&#xD;
      Although there are many medications that are effective against migraines, none of these&#xD;
      medications cure 100% of migraines. Another problem with migraines is that although many&#xD;
      times they get better after intravenous (IV) treatment in the emergency room (ER), about 1/3&#xD;
      of the time migraines recur the next day. The purpose of this research project is to see if&#xD;
      adding a medication called dexamethasone to standard ER therapy will help patients get better&#xD;
      quicker and stay pain-free more often than if they receive placebo.&#xD;

      Parenteral Corticosteroids as Adjuvant Therapy for Migraine Headaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Overview/Aims: Five million Americans present to emergency departments (ED) annually with&#xD;
      headaches [1]. The majority of these patients have migraine headaches [2,3]. Parenteral&#xD;
      medications of proven benefit for acute migraines include the triptans [4], dopamine-receptor&#xD;
      antagonists [5-11], non-steroidals [12], and dihydroergotamine [13]. Although these distinct&#xD;
      classes of medication are often effective for the treatment of acute migraines, their use is&#xD;
      complicated by treatment failures [4,9,14], recurrence of headache [15,16], and side effects&#xD;
      [17], all of which are of concern for patients with migraines [18]. The ideal medication,&#xD;
      which would rapidly alleviate migraine pain without any recurrence of pain or side effects,&#xD;
      has not yet been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of corticosteroids in acute migraines is ill-defined. Although used in patients with&#xD;
      intractable migraines, this class of medication is not widely used in typical migraine&#xD;
      attacks. However, limited clinical data suggest that corticosteroids decrease the rate of&#xD;
      recurrent headaches [19-21] and might decrease the pain of an acute attack [22]. Further&#xD;
      research is needed to define the role of corticosteroids in the ED treatment of acute&#xD;
      migraine headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: The specific aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of ten milligrams&#xD;
      of parenteral dexamethasone as adjuvant therapy for the emergency department treatment of&#xD;
      migraine headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Twenty four hours after medication administration, a greater percentage&#xD;
      of migraine subjects who received dexamethasone will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sustained pain-free headache relief; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no headache-related functional impairment when compared to subjects who receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will also receive the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Two hours after medication administration, a greater percentage of&#xD;
      migraine subjects who received dexamethasone will be headache pain-free, when compared to&#xD;
      subjects who receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite standard treatment, a large percentage of emergency migraineurs continue to suffer&#xD;
      from headaches after ED discharge. Recurrent or persistent headaches rated as moderate or&#xD;
      severe in intensity occurred in 14-43% of subjects 24 hours after discharge in ED-based&#xD;
      migraine clinical trials [20,23,24]. In a Canadian population, 45% of headache patients&#xD;
      reported headache-related functional impairment within 24 hours of ED discharge [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some reports indicate that corticosteroids decrease the rate and intensity of recurrent&#xD;
      migraine headaches [19-21]. However, the investigators could not find any corticosteroid&#xD;
      clinical trials using recommended measures and outcomes [25] in a migraine population. To the&#xD;
      best of their knowledge, no controlled clinical trial has tested the efficacy of&#xD;
      corticosteroids as primary migraine-abortive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pathogenesis of migraine headaches is incompletely understood, a sterile&#xD;
      neurogenic inflammation is felt to be key to the pain generating pathway that occurs in acute&#xD;
      migraines [15]. Corticosteroids theoretically mitigate this inflammation and decrease the&#xD;
      pain and duration of acute migraine attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of intravenous dexamethasone has been well-tolerated in migraineurs [20]. If this&#xD;
      medication proves to have efficacy for migraines, then this would represent a substantial&#xD;
      contribution to headache medicine, an effective tool in the armamentarium of emergency&#xD;
      physicians, and a cheap and safe method to decrease the pain and suffering of ED migraine&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C1. Overview: This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical research&#xD;
      trial testing the efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate as adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      for acute migraine headaches. All subjects will receive standard-of-care migraine-abortive&#xD;
      medication for their migraines. In addition, they will receive either ten milligrams of&#xD;
      intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate or a comparable amount of placebo. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed by telephone 24 hours after medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2. Study Sites: Study sites will include the emergency departments of Montefiore Medical&#xD;
      Center, Jacobi Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, St. Luke's Medical Center,&#xD;
      Bellevue Medical Center, and Kings County Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C3. Selection of Participants: The attending emergency physician will refer all adult&#xD;
      patients who present with a chief complaint of headache during the regular hours of the data&#xD;
      collectors. Under the supervision of the site investigators, the data collectors will inform&#xD;
      patients about the study and ask for their consent to participate in this study as human&#xD;
      subjects. The data collectors will include in this study any patient who has a migraine&#xD;
      headache as defined by the International Headache Society (IHS-2003 1.1 migraine without&#xD;
      aura; 1.2 migraine with aura). Patients will also be included if they have an IHS probable&#xD;
      migraine (IHS-2003 1.6.1 &amp; 1.6.2) [26] that has lasted between 72 and 168 hours. In other&#xD;
      words, patients will also be included if their headache meets all IHS migraine criteria&#xD;
      except that the duration of the headache has been between 73 and 168 hours. These probable&#xD;
      migraine patients will be included because they represent a substantial subset of ED primary&#xD;
      headache patients (Friedman, et. al., unpublished data) and because the majority of patients&#xD;
      with a disabling probable migraine and a history of similar headaches will respond to&#xD;
      migraine-specific medication [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if the emergency physician intends to perform a lumbar puncture in&#xD;
      the ED because lumbar puncture has an independent association with 24 hour headache pain&#xD;
      scores. Patients will be excluded for persistent objective focal neurologic deficits, as&#xD;
      determined by the attending physician, for fear of mistaking a stroke for a complicated&#xD;
      migraine, or for signs and symptoms concerning for other causes of malignant secondary&#xD;
      headache such as meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, carotid dissection, or intracranial&#xD;
      mass. Patients will also be excluded for temperatures greater than 100.3 degrees, pregnancy&#xD;
      or lactation, or allergy or intolerance to any of the study medications. Patients can only&#xD;
      enroll once. Patients over the age of 64 will be excluded, for fear of increased risk of&#xD;
      adverse reactions to study medications and increased risk of secondary headaches. Patients&#xD;
      who do not meet enrollment criteria will have basic demographic and headache variables&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C4. Randomization and Blinding: Randomization is to be done by the research pharmacist at&#xD;
      Montefiore Medical Center in blocks of six using computer generated random number tables&#xD;
      available online. The randomization will be stratified by study site. In an order determined&#xD;
      by the random number tables, the pharmacist will insert medication into vials and place these&#xD;
      vials into sequentially numbered brown paper research bags. The research bags will be&#xD;
      distributed by express courier in batches of six to the investigators at each site. The&#xD;
      research bags will be stored at each site in a locked location accessible to the data&#xD;
      collectors. When a subject has been identified, the contents of each research bag will be&#xD;
      administered by a clinical nurse. Assignment will be known only by the research pharmacist.&#xD;
      However, the assignment will accompany each research bag, sealed in a small manila envelope,&#xD;
      in case a medical emergency mandates that the assignment be revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5. Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5a. Categorical Scale: As a primary measure, this trial will use the four point descriptive&#xD;
      scale recommended for use in migraine research [25]. On this scale, subjects are asked to&#xD;
      characterize their migraine pain as &quot;none, mild, moderate or severe&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5b. Disability Scale: A descriptive categorical scale will be used to characterize the&#xD;
      subject's headache-related disability. On this scale, subjects describe their disability as&#xD;
      &quot;1) none; 2) mildly impaired (having a little bit of difficulty doing what I usually do); 3)&#xD;
      moderately impaired (having a great deal of difficulty doing what I usually do and can only&#xD;
      do very minor activities); or 4) severely impaired (requiring bed rest)&quot; [25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5c. Numerical Rating Scale for Pain: An 11-point verbal numerical rating scale for pain will&#xD;
      be a secondary measurement tool for this trial. On this scale, subjects are asked to describe&#xD;
      their pain as a number between zero and ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst&#xD;
      pain imaginable. This scale has been shown to perform comparably to a visual analog scale,&#xD;
      while being easier to administer [28].&#xD;
&#xD;
      C6.Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the percentage of subjects who achieve and maintain&#xD;
      a &quot;headache pain free&quot; state. Persistent &quot;headache pain free&quot; is the recommended outcome for&#xD;
      migraine clinical research [25]. Subjects will be considered to have fulfilled the primary&#xD;
      outcome if they achieve a pain free state in the ED and maintain this throughout the 24 hour&#xD;
      period after receiving study medication. The alternate primary outcome will be the number of&#xD;
      subjects who report no headache-related disability for the period of time after ED discharge.&#xD;
      The major secondary outcome will be the percentage of subjects who report a &quot;headache&#xD;
      pain-free&quot; status two hours after medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary outcomes include rates of sustained headache relief (moderate or severe pain&#xD;
      becoming and maintaining a level of mild or none), two-hour NRS change&#xD;
      (NRSbaseline-NRS2hours), 24 hour NRS change (NRSbaseline-NRS24hours), need for rescue&#xD;
      medication before two hours, need for analgesic medication after discharge from the ED,&#xD;
      associated symptoms (specifically: weakness, drowsiness, dizziness), unscheduled visits to a&#xD;
      medical provider within 24 hours of medication administration, and the percentage of patients&#xD;
      who answer affirmatively to the question &quot;Do you want to receive the same medication the next&#xD;
      time you come to the ED?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      C7. Data Collection, Data Entry, and Back-Up: Data entry and follow-up of subjects will be&#xD;
      accomplished by taking advantage of the research infrastructure in place at the Department of&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Five full-time research&#xD;
      assistants and one research clerk are funded by the department. The research assistants are&#xD;
      medical technician level, full-time employees who have extensive clinical research experience&#xD;
      and have passed required research ethics courses. These research assistants staff the&#xD;
      Montefiore ED during all operational hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial data collection process will be performed by the data collectors at each&#xD;
      individual site. These data collectors will be different in each ED, depending on the&#xD;
      resources at the individual ED. At Montefiore and Jacobi, the data collectors are salaried,&#xD;
      trained, technician level employees, who have passed required research ethics courses. The&#xD;
      data collectors will be trained for this particular study by the principal investigator and&#xD;
      site investigators. Their training will include mock patient encounters. The data collectors&#xD;
      will use a standardized data collection instrument to collect baseline information, pain&#xD;
      scores, and side effects in the ED. After the ED data have been obtained, the data collection&#xD;
      instrument will be photocopied and faxed to a dedicated research clerk in the Department of&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The receiving fax machine is a&#xD;
      private fax machine secured in an office behind two locked doors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research clerk will be responsible for obtaining the 24 hour follow-up information. At a&#xD;
      time pre-arranged with the subject prior to the subject's discharge from the ED, the research&#xD;
      clerk will call the subject and obtain 24 hour follow-up information by reading questions off&#xD;
      of the data collection instrument. Twenty-four hour follow-up to be done during non-business&#xD;
      hours will be performed by Montefiore's research assistants, who cover the ED 24 hours a day,&#xD;
      seven days every week. These research assistants will retrieve the faxed data collection&#xD;
      instruments, obtain the follow-up information, and then return the data collection&#xD;
      instruments to the research clerk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research clerk will enter all data into SPSS data entry V.11. Completed data collection&#xD;
      instruments will be sent to a second research clerk who will enter the data a second time&#xD;
      into the same SPSS program. After every ten subjects have been entered, data will be backed&#xD;
      up and stored on three different computers on two distinct campuses. Prior to all analyses,&#xD;
      the two data sets will be compared. Discrepancies will be corrected using the initial data&#xD;
      collection instrument as the source. The original version of each data collection instrument&#xD;
      will be kept in a locked cabinet at its original site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C8. Medications: In addition to study medication or placebo, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      standard migraine abortive therapy. The optimal migraine-abortive/analgesic medication for ED&#xD;
      patients with acute migraine headaches has not yet been defined, so the investigators have&#xD;
      chosen intravenous metoclopramide, an effective, safe, widely-available, and economical&#xD;
      dopamine receptor antagonist, as the migraine treatment for this trial. Parenteral&#xD;
      dopamine-antagonists are recommended for use in the ED29 and are used more commonly than&#xD;
      triptans in the ED setting [1,16]. Metoclopramide has been shown to be at least as effective&#xD;
      as subcutaneous sumatriptan at reducing pain [7,8] with comparable two hour activity&#xD;
      limitations [30]. The investigators will use 20 milligrams of intravenous metoclopramide, a&#xD;
      moderate dose when compared to their previous work [23,30]. In addition to metoclopramide,&#xD;
      each subject will also receive 25mg of diphenhydramine to prevent akathisia and other&#xD;
      extra-pyramidal reactions to the metoclopramide [31]. This combination of metoclopramide and&#xD;
      diphenhydramine is commonly used in the ED setting and does not cause significant drowsiness&#xD;
      or impairment of activities in migraineurs at two hours [30]. The investigators view the&#xD;
      potential anti-migraine effect of diphenhydramine [32] as added benefit for their subjects.&#xD;
      Metoclopramide, diphenhydramine, and the study medication will be placed into a 50cc bag of&#xD;
      normal saline and administered as a slow intravenous drip over twenty minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who require rescue medication for persistent headache will receive another 20mg of&#xD;
      intravenous metoclopramide. This additional dose of metoclopramide is part of an ED-based&#xD;
      protocol that has demonstrated a high rate of pain relief and patient satisfaction with a&#xD;
      minimum of side effects [23,30].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who require more pain medication will receive a combination of ibuprofen and oral&#xD;
      opiates at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be discharged from the ED with two 400mg tablets of ibuprofen to be taken&#xD;
      as needed for recurrence of headache. Ibuprofen is an effective migraine treatment [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      C9. Interim Analysis, Stopping Rules and Sample Size Calculation: An interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to detect an overwhelming superiority of the intervention. A data monitoring&#xD;
      committee will convene after 126 subjects have been enrolled. The committee will look for a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in the primary outcome or a discrepancy in the rate of&#xD;
      adverse effects (measured by rate of hospitalization for presumed adverse reaction to&#xD;
      medication). The medications used in this study are well-known to the medical community and&#xD;
      commonly used. Neither the disease nor the medications cause mortality or significant&#xD;
      permanent disability. Therefore, although the investigators will monitor the adverse effects&#xD;
      that occur during this trial, they do not anticipate that this will have a significant effect&#xD;
      on the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many different approaches to calculation of significance criteria that can be used&#xD;
      in interim analyses, and thus might be used to terminate a trial before the complete data are&#xD;
      collected. The investigators have chosen an intermediate approach, based on the&#xD;
      O'Brien-Fleming procedure [33] and set the interim test criterion at 0.01, and the final test&#xD;
      criterion at 0.04. Using a criterion for significance of 0.04 and a 2-tailed test, this study&#xD;
      will require 100 subjects in each group, for a total of 200 subjects, to have power of 80% to&#xD;
      yield a statistically significant result. This computation assumes that the difference in&#xD;
      persistent headache pain-free proportions is 0.20, specifically, 0.30 versus 0.50 (the rate&#xD;
      of persistent headache pain-free 24 hours after ED discharge in a previous similarly-dosed&#xD;
      metoclopramide trial was 30% [30]). The clinical effect being sought is comparable to a&#xD;
      number needed to treat of five, the largest number needed to treat believed important to&#xD;
      discover for this self-limited disease process. The interim analysis will have adequate power&#xD;
      (0.80) to discover a statistically significant difference (alpha=0.01) if the difference&#xD;
      between the two groups is 30% (.60 versus .30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C10. Co-Variates: The following variables will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C10a. Cutaneous Allodynia: Cutaneous allodynia is felt to be a marker of more intractable&#xD;
      migraines [34] and can be tested for by lightly rubbing a 4 x 4 piece of gauze on the face of&#xD;
      the subject [35]. The data collectors will assess each subject for cutaneous allodynia prior&#xD;
      to the administration of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C10b. Duration of Headache: Although likely to be collinear with allodynia, this co-variate&#xD;
      might be associated with intractable 24 hour headaches [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      C10c. Pre-Medication: In previous work, although 25% of the investigators' population took no&#xD;
      analgesic medication prior to presentation to the ED, this co-variate did not confound the&#xD;
      association between study medication and persistent pain-free [30]. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      investigators will record all migraine-relevant medications used by their subjects prior to&#xD;
      ED presentation, group these by class, and determine if this co-variate has a relationship&#xD;
      with the primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11d. Aura: The investigators know of no documented association between aura and&#xD;
      corticosteroids, but this subject has been inadequately explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11e. Prophylactic Medications: In previous work [30], only a small minority of ED&#xD;
      migraineurs were on prophylactic medication. However, these patients represent a sub-set of&#xD;
      migraineurs with more severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11f. Chronic Migraines: Only a small minority of ED migraineurs can be classified as chronic&#xD;
      (Friedman, unpublished data). However, these patients represent a sub-set of migraineurs at&#xD;
      high risk of recurrent 24 hour headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11g. Medication-Rebound Headaches: This diagnosis has been inadequately explored in the ED&#xD;
      setting and consists of complicated headache patients. The investigators will not exclude&#xD;
      these patients from this study because they are likely to benefit from this intervention&#xD;
      [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11h. Site: To account for site-specific differences from influencing the results, subjects&#xD;
      from each site will be randomized in blocks of six to prevent unequal representation of a&#xD;
      particular site in either arm. This will prevent any one site from overly influencing the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11i. Race/Ethnicity: This will be based on subject's report. The significance of this&#xD;
      co-variate for this study is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11j. Age: This will be recorded. The significance of this co-variate for this study is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C12k.Gender: This will be recorded. The significance of this co-variate for this study is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C12. Analysis: The data will be analyzed in an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; manner. Once a patient is&#xD;
      randomized and receives the dexamethasone, their pain scores will be included in the 24-hour&#xD;
      analysis regardless of whether or not they received rescue medication or completed the&#xD;
      protocol. However, lost-to-follow-up subjects will be excluded from the primary analysis (a&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis will be conducted in which lost-to-follow-up subjects are assumed to&#xD;
      have a poor outcome). Study enrollment will continue until the pre-determined number of&#xD;
      subjects have completed the primary endpoint. Chi-square analysis will be used to compare&#xD;
      rates. Students t-tests will be used to compare mean differences in pain scores. Multivariate&#xD;
      regression models will be used to analyze the influence of the co-variates discussed above,&#xD;
      particularly allodynia, duration of headache, and use of medication prior to ED presentation.&#xD;
      Briefly, evidence of confounding will be sought by looking for an association between the&#xD;
      heterogeneous variable and both the independent (study medication) and dependent (pain&#xD;
      status) variables. Between-group differences will be expressed as means or proportions,&#xD;
      bounded by 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).&#xD;
