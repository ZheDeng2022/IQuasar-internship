  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers of the colon and rectum are the third most common cancers in Canadian males and&#xD;
      females. The initial therapy of colorectal cancer is surgery to remove the cancer and nearby&#xD;
      lymph glands. If the cancer has spread to the lymph glands there is a high chance that the&#xD;
      cancer will come back. To reduce the risk of the cancer recurring, patients are treated with&#xD;
      an anticancer drug capecitabine. This study will determine if a simple blood test can predict&#xD;
      which patients are at risk for developing side effects from this chemotherapy. In addition,&#xD;
      participants of this study will be followed to determine if this same blood test will predict&#xD;
      which patients will have their cancer relapse.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the thymidylate synthase gene's promoter has been found to be polymorphic, with&#xD;
      variable numbers of tandem repeats of 28 base pairs in length. These polymorphisms have been&#xD;
      associated with tumor response to treatment with fluoropyrimidines. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase (TS) gene's promoter region are&#xD;
      associated with toxicity from capecitabine treatment specifically development of&#xD;
      myelosuppression and diarrhea. The investigators hypothesize that a polymorphism in methylene&#xD;
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is also associated with toxicity and efficacy of&#xD;
      capecitabine treatment. The investigators speculate that the MTHFR polymorphism only becomes&#xD;
      clinically significant by stratifying patients by TS promoter polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase's promoter region are associated&#xD;
           with development of overall toxicity, diarrhea, neutropenia, or mucositis in patients&#xD;
           treated with capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if a polymorphism in methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is&#xD;
           associated with development of overall toxicity, diarrhea, neutropenia, or mucositis in&#xD;
           patients treated with capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is a potent antimetabolite that is the currently accepted adjuvant treatment for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. As well, capecitabine is used to treat head and neck cancers, breast&#xD;
      cancer and gastric cancer. In 1985, Takeishi et al demonstrated that thymidylate synthase's&#xD;
      gene had a satellite in the 5' untranslated region, which consisted of 3 tandem repeats of a&#xD;
      28 base pair sequence. Horie et al demonstrated that these satellites were polymorphic in&#xD;
      length due to different numbers of tandem repeats, with 2 length polymorphism existing 2&#xD;
      tandem repeats of 28 base pairs (2R) and 3 tandem repeats of 28 base pairs (3R). Subsequent&#xD;
      authors have demonstrated 4 repeats (4R), five repeats (5R) and nine repeats (9R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kawakami et al demonstrated that the number of tandem repeats affected TS gene translation.&#xD;
      They showed those patients homozygous for 3R alleles had higher TS protein levels and 2R/3R&#xD;
      heterozygotes. Using in vitro expression of 2R and 3R genes they demonstrated that the&#xD;
      increased protein levels were due to increased translational efficiency of the 3R RNA and not&#xD;
      due to increased 3R mRNA expression. These tandem repeats are predictive of response rates of&#xD;
      various cancers to fluoropyrimidine cancer chemotherapy. Park et al showed in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients treated with capecitabine, the response rate was 14% in patients&#xD;
      homozygous for 3R repeats, and 80% in the patients homozygous for 2R repeats. No prospective&#xD;
      study has examined if a patient's TS genotype predicts for 5-FU toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A polymorphism in methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase's (MTHFR) gene may also determine a&#xD;
      patient's risk for capecitabine toxicity. A polymorphism in MTHFR exists at position 677, C&#xD;
      to T producing a thermolabile and rapidly degraded enzyme. TT homozygotes have increased&#xD;
      levels of methylene tetrahydrofolate. Methylene tetrahydrofolate stabilizes binding of 5FU to&#xD;
      thymidylate synthase and the complex of TS, 5FU, and methylene tetrahydrofolate is referred&#xD;
      to as the ternary complex. I hypothesize that increased stabilization of TS and 5FU due to&#xD;
      increased amounts of methylene tetrahydrofolate would lead to increased capecitabine toxicity&#xD;
      and efficacy. No study has examined if TT homozygotes have an increased response rate to&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidines or increased toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency has been identified as the cause of rare&#xD;
      severe life threatening reactions to fluoropyrimidines. The first case was reported by&#xD;
      Tuchman et al in a 27 year old woman who had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluoruracil and developed severe neurological&#xD;
      complications. Diasio et al reported the second case again in a women being treated with&#xD;
      5-fluoruracil for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Etienne et al has raised questions regarding the utility of DPD activity alone to&#xD;
      predict patients at risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity. They prospectively studied 185&#xD;
      patients treated with 5FU containing chemotherapy regimens. They found a normal distribution&#xD;
      of DPD activity with a mean value of 0.222 nmol/min/mg protein. They did not find any&#xD;
      correlation between DPD activity and 5FU toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study the effect of these two polymorphic enzymes on&#xD;
      capecitabine's toxicity in adjuvant colon cancer patients. It is anticipated that patients&#xD;
      homozygous for 2R/2R will have higher rates of overall toxicity, diarrhea, neutropenia and&#xD;
      mucositis than 3R/3R homozygotes. For MTHFR, we anticipate that TT homozygotes will have&#xD;
      higher rates overall toxicity, diarrhea, neutropenia, and mucositis than CC homozygotes. The&#xD;
      effect of MTHFR polymorphism on capecitabine's toxicity will be examined controlling for&#xD;
      thymidylate synthase genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been advised to have adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be treated with standard doses of capecitabine according to the X-ACT&#xD;
      study. Toxicities during cycle one will be graded according to National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0. Dose reductions during cycle one will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting treatments patients will provide a 10 ml sample of blood which will be used&#xD;
      to obtain DNA from white bloods. Patients will be genotyped according to TS and MTHFR&#xD;
      genotypes. Plasma will be banked to determined DPD phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allele frequency of 3R tandem repeats is 0.6 and 2R tandem repeats is 0.417. In 100&#xD;
      patients therefore, I would expect 16 patients with 2R/2R genotypes, 48 with 2R/3R genotypes&#xD;
      and 36 with 3R/3R genotypes. It is interesting to note that the incidence of grade 3/4 palmar&#xD;
      plantar erythrodysesthesia and diarrhea is on the order of 14 to 16 percent. A sample of 104&#xD;
      patients we would have a power of 0.8 to show a statistically significant difference of 40%&#xD;
      between 2R/2R (60%) and 3R/3R (20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between TS genotype and development of grade 1/2 and 3/4 overall toxicity will&#xD;
      be examined using the chi square test, with a level of significance of 0.05. Other toxicities&#xD;
      of interest, diarrhea, mucositis and neutropenia, will be examined for association with TS&#xD;
      genotype chi square test. Similar exploratory analysis will be done for MTHFR phenotypes.&#xD;
