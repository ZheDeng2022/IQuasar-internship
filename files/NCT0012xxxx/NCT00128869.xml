  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare whether or not there is a difference in the effectiveness of upper&#xD;
      back (thoracic spine) mobilizations versus manipulations used in a population of patients&#xD;
      with mechanical neck pain. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving a&#xD;
      manipulative technique will experience better outcomes than patients receiving the&#xD;
      mobilization techniques and these results will be evident at a 48-hour follow-up.&#xD;

      Patients with mechanical neck pain who meet the study's inclusion criteria, who do not meet&#xD;
      the study's exclusion criteria will be offered an opportunity to participate in this study.&#xD;
      They will be issued an informed consent detailing the study and will have time to decide&#xD;
      whether or not to participate. Once they have enlisted in the study they will complete forms&#xD;
      to assess their current functional level. The investigator will then perform a standard&#xD;
      clinical exam on the upper quarter to include a comprehensive subjective examination, upper&#xD;
      extremity strength, reflexes, sensory assessment, cervical range of motion, thoracic range of&#xD;
      motion and pain assessment. Once the above data have been collected and the patient has met&#xD;
      the criteria for the study, a second investigator will then choose a randomized and sealed&#xD;
      envelope which will indicate the treatment to be performed. The patient will either receive&#xD;
      mobilization or manipulation to the thoracic spine. Mobilizations will be performed in prone&#xD;
      over the spinous processes of T1-T6. Each one will be performed for 30 seconds each with&#xD;
      force directed posterioanterior. The manipulation will be performed in supine with the&#xD;
      patient's arms crossed over his/her chest. The therapist will pull the patient's arms&#xD;
      downward to create spinal flexion down to the level where the manipulation will occur. The&#xD;
      therapist's manipulative hand will stabilize the lower vertebrae of the motion segment and&#xD;
      his/her body will be used to push down through the patient's arms to perform a high velocity,&#xD;
      low amplitude thrust of the superior vertebrae. The manipulation will first be attempted in&#xD;
      the upper thoracic spine; if a cavitation is heard on the first attempt he/she will move onto&#xD;
      the middle thoracic area. If a cavitation is not heard he/she will attempt a second time&#xD;
      before moving on to the next area. Both areas will receive a maximum of two attempts. Once&#xD;
      the manipulation or mobilization is performed the patient will be assigned one home exercise&#xD;
      which includes rotation of the cervical spine in both directions for 10 reps, 3-4 times per&#xD;
      day. The patient will return within 48 hours for final data collection which will include a&#xD;
      global rating of change scale completed both by the therapist and the patient, pain diagram&#xD;
      and scale, neck disability index, cervical and thoracic range of motion measurements, and a&#xD;
      side effects questionnaire. The patient will then be discharged from the study and will&#xD;
      continue with physical therapy as deemed appropriate at the time of examination.&#xD;
