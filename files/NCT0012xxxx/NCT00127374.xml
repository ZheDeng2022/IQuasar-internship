  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to document the co-existence of depression, low&#xD;
      self-esteem, and high-risk behaviors among overweight and at-risk for overweight female&#xD;
      adolescents; and decrease the prevalence of high-risk behaviors by improving depressive&#xD;
      symptoms/signs and self-esteem through weight management intervention strategies that&#xD;
      encourage long-term mental and physical well being. The proposed research will test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overweight and at-risk for overweight female adolescents have poor self-esteem that may&#xD;
           mask depression and mediate high-risk behaviors; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved weight perception decreases participation in high-risk behavior secondary to&#xD;
           improved self-esteem and depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      How adolescents view (self-concept) and value themselves (self-esteem) may predict future&#xD;
      adjustment and success in life. Self-concept comprises assessment of scholastic, athletic and&#xD;
      job competence, social acceptance, physical appearance, romantic appeal, behavioral conduct,&#xD;
      close friendship, and global self-worth. Self-esteem is the feeling of self-acceptance,&#xD;
      goodness, and worthiness. It influences daily activities, motivation and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents are very vulnerable to low self-esteem. Generally, boys have higher self-esteem&#xD;
      than girls; higher weight students have lower self-concept; and post-menarcheal females have&#xD;
      the poorest opinion of their physical appearance. Higher body mass index (BMI) predicts more&#xD;
      negative self-concept. Body image and physical appearance contribute to general physical&#xD;
      self-concept and self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status individuals are discriminated&#xD;
      against on the basis of weight. Weight-based stigmatization influences self-perception and&#xD;
      the perceptions of significant others. Sustained low self-esteem may precipitate anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, under achievement, poor motivation and inadequate interpersonal relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese adolescents are stigmatized by peers. They may attempt to protect their self-image by&#xD;
      participating in high-risk behaviors. Obese adolescent girls are more likely to report&#xD;
      adverse social, educational and psychological correlates than obese boys. Overweight girls,&#xD;
      but not overweight boys, manifest more depressive symptoms than their normal-weight peers.&#xD;
      Gender differences in clinical depressive syndromes may emerge in early childhood as opposed&#xD;
      to puberty as previously thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early stigmatization of obese children may explain their lower self-esteem and greater shame,&#xD;
      humiliation, and perceived teasing compared with their nonobese peers. Studies have found&#xD;
      increased psychopathology among clinical samples of obese children and demonstrated&#xD;
      improvements in psychological functioning with weight loss. Implementing lifestyle changes&#xD;
      during early adolescence, ages 10 to 13 years, and middle adolescence, ages 14 to 16 years,&#xD;
      may hold the key for preventing obesity and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of approximately 100 overweight or at-risk for overweight&#xD;
      female volunteers, 10 - 14 years old.&#xD;
