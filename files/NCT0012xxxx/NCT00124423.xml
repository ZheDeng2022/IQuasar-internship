    <textblock>
      The Cross Cancer Institute has recently acquired a tomotherapy radiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      machine; the first of its kind in Canada. It has the potential to improve cancer treatment&#xD;
      outcomes where radiotherapy is used. Cervix cancer is a disease where radiotherapy is a&#xD;
      particularly important treatment modality. The researchers believe that by combining&#xD;
      tomotherapy (which has the ability to give higher doses of radiation to areas of cancer while&#xD;
      sparing normal tissues) with radiotherapy given from inside the uterus and vagina&#xD;
      (brachytherapy) disease outcomes will be improved. For this to be possible the researchers&#xD;
      will need to accurately map the doses of radiation given to the cervix, uterus and other&#xD;
      pelvic organs from these two types of radiation treatment. As well as being used for&#xD;
      treatment, the tomotherapy machine can also be used for taking medical images by using very&#xD;
      much lower doses of radiation. This study will allow the researchers to develop the mapping&#xD;
      process by using very low doses of radiation on the tomotherapy unit to take medical x-ray&#xD;
      images of patients being treated by brachytherapy for cervix cancer. In this special&#xD;
      circumstance the researchers expect the images to be of a higher quality than for&#xD;
      conventional computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning.&#xD;

      Megavoltage CT Imaging for Intracavitary Radiation Treatment in Cervix Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of performing CT imaging using a megavoltage CT scanner on five&#xD;
      patients where remote afterloading intracavitary applicators have been inserted for the&#xD;
      purpose of delivering intracavitary radiotherapy in the treatment of cervix cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there has been recent improvements in the treatment of more advanced stages of cervix&#xD;
      cancer by combining radical radiation treatment with concurrent cisplatin based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      there is room for further improvements in local regional control. One approach to achieving&#xD;
      this is to increase the dose of therapeutic radiation to the clinical target volume without&#xD;
      exceeding the tolerance of the adjacent normal tissues. Modern radiotherapy techniques allow&#xD;
      for better conformation of the high dose radiation volume to the clinical target volume by&#xD;
      using external beam techniques (conformal radiation treatment and intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation treatment) and the use of tomotherapy is likely to be particularly advantageous in&#xD;
      this regard. The mainstay of cervix cancer radiotherapy has always been and will likely&#xD;
      remain the use of brachytherapy. Future improvements in the outcome of cervix cancer treated&#xD;
      by radiotherapy are therefore likely to necessitate accurately combining intracavitary&#xD;
      radiation treatment with intensity modulated external beam radiation treatment and&#xD;
      particularly with the use of tomotherapy techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to accurately reconstruct the three-dimensional dosimetry achieved by the&#xD;
      combined use of intracavitary radiation treatment and helical tomotherapy will be pivotal in&#xD;
      the success of this strategy. Conventional CT imaging of patients receiving intracavitary&#xD;
      radiation treatment is hampered by distortion artifacts from the metallic applicators. The&#xD;
      opportunity to gain improved images using megavoltage CT scanning using the same equipment&#xD;
      and same patient set-up that will ultimately by used for the delivery of tomotherapy offers&#xD;
      some unique potential advantages and solutions to the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By imaging patients with the remote afterloading applications in situ, the researchers should&#xD;
      be able to generate accurate isodose distributions in three dimensions for the intracavitary&#xD;
      component of the cervix cancer treatment. By contouring the clinical target volume, which&#xD;
      includes the primary cancer, local routes of spread and regional pelvic lymph nodes, the&#xD;
      researchers can explore the feasibility of generating combined helical tomotherapy and&#xD;
      intracavitary radiation treatment plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are to receive intracavitary brachytherapy on the low dose rate selectron at the&#xD;
      Cross Cancer Institute will be approached to participate in this pilot study. An informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from five patients for this study. Following the insertion of the&#xD;
      remote afterloading applicators in the operating room, patients are normally transferred from&#xD;
      the operating room to Simulator C for orthogonal simulator films and then to Station 30 where&#xD;
      treatment is started approximately two hours later after dosimetry calculations have been&#xD;
      performed and treatment has been prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients consenting to this study, they will proceed from Simulator C to Station 30&#xD;
      via the tomotherapy unit in CBIAR where megavoltage CT scans will be taken. Patients will be&#xD;
      accompanied by a brachytherapy radiation therapist. The megavoltage CT scans will take&#xD;
      approximately one hour to perform, but this will not result in any treatment delay for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isodose volumes from the prescribed intracavitary brachytherapy will be reconstructed on the&#xD;
      megavoltage images. The feasibility of defining the clinical target volume on the megavoltage&#xD;
      scans will be explored. This may require fusion with conventional CT images that will already&#xD;
      have been taken for diagnostic and external beam treatment planning purposes. Megavoltage&#xD;
      and/or fused images will be used to pilot the integration of tomotherapy intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy treatment plans with intracavitary brachytherapy dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will have no influence on individual patient treatments but is a prelude to&#xD;
      a potential dose escalation study using tomotherapy for patients with cervix cancer.&#xD;
