  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clofarabine (injection) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (ALL) who have had at least 2 prior treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study of clofarabine that will be given to patients (orally) with advanced&#xD;
      cancerous tumors or cancerous tumors that have spread in which standard drugs are no longer&#xD;
      effective or no reliable effective treatment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the answers to the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the largest dose of oral clofarabine that can be safely given daily for 5 days&#xD;
           followed by 23 days of rest and repeated every 28 days?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the side effects of clofarabine when given on this schedule?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How much oral clofarabine is in the blood at specific times after administration and how&#xD;
           does the body get rid of the drug?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Will oral clofarabine help treat solid tumor cancer?&#xD;

    <description>Cohorts of 3 patients each were to receive oral clofarabine administered daily for 5 days followed by 23 days of rest (1 cycle) and repeated every 28 days depending on toxicity and response. The starting dose of clofarabine was to be 1 mg/m2/day with subsequent dose escalation to occur in increments of 50% for the first 5 dose levels (1.5, 2.25, 3.5, and 5.0 mg/m2/day) and in increments of 25% thereafter until the MTD/RP2D was determined.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy that is&#xD;
             refractory to conventional therapy or for which no therapy exists. Patients must have&#xD;
             measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be greater than or equal to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be eligible for therapy of higher curative potential. (NB: Where an&#xD;
             alternative therapy has been shown to prolong survival in an analogous population,&#xD;
             that therapy will be offered to the patient prior to discussing this study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of greater than or equal to 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female. Patients who are fertile must agree&#xD;
             to use an effective barrier method of birth control (ie, latex condom, diaphragm,&#xD;
             cervical cap, etc.) to avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 10 days of study treatment (if&#xD;
             patient is a female of childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values, obtained&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to registration: A. ANC: greater than or equal to 1.5 × 10&#xD;
             ^9th/L; B. Platelets: greater than or equal to 100 × 10 ^9th/L; C.Serum bilirubin:&#xD;
             less than 2.0 mg/dL; D. AST and ALT: less than 3 x ULN* without liver involvement OR&#xD;
             less than 5 x ULN with liver involvement; E. Serum creatinine: less than or equal to&#xD;
             2.0 mg/dL. NOTE: ULN = Institutional Upper Limit of Normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received previous treatment with clofarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life&#xD;
             threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation,&#xD;
             or follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any chemotherapy, major surgery, or irradiation, whether conventional or&#xD;
             investigational, 28 days before treatment in this study (42 days for mitomycin-C or&#xD;
             nitrosourea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not recovered from acute toxicities of all previous therapy prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator,&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study (eg, uncontrolled&#xD;
             severe insulin-dependent diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, transient ischemic&#xD;
             attacks, uncontrolled symptomatic coronary artery disease, etc). Patients with&#xD;
             abnormal cardiac function who are in consideration for study participation should be&#xD;
             discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received prior radiation therapy to greater than or equal to 25% of the bone&#xD;
             marrow (eg, no whole pelvic irradiation is allowed) and have not recovered from the&#xD;
             acute side effects of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.&#xD;
