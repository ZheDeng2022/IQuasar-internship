      This observational study will provide data (variations in ventricular size and function) that&#xD;
      are essential to designing and conducting clinical trials. In addition, the study will&#xD;
      evaluate intra- and inter-study variability seen in echocardiography.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy is an important cause of chronic disability and death in pediatric patients&#xD;
      and currently accounts for approximately 50% of cardiac transplants performed during&#xD;
      childhood. Left ventricular (LV) size and function are important independent predictors of&#xD;
      outcome, and echocardiography is the primary way to assess ventricular function in children.&#xD;
      Although there is extensive experience with this technology, data are limited on how&#xD;
      ventricular function changes over time in children, which is a major impediment to conducting&#xD;
      controlled trials of therapy in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards/Research Ethics Boards of all&#xD;
      participating clinical centers:&#xD;

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will prospectively evaluate pediatric patients with dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy who are undergoing clinically indicated echocardiographic evaluation of LV&#xD;
      function. Patients who undergo at least two echocardiograms 3 to 18 months apart will have&#xD;
      their studies performed by the same ultrasonographer. All studies will be sent to the core&#xD;
      laboratory for evaluation of variability in LV mass, volume, and ejection fraction.&#xD;
