      A multicentre study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      nanofiltered Cetor® (called C1-esteraseremmer-N during the development phase) for the&#xD;
      treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) will be performed. This study (KB2003.01) consists&#xD;
      of three parts: Part A - pharmacokinetics (phase II); Part B - treatment of attacks of&#xD;
      angioedema (phase III); and Part C - prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor (phase III). Parts B +&#xD;
      C will provide data on the efficacy of C1-esteraseremmer-N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes within the manufacturing process of C1-esteraseremmer-N, compared to Cetor®&#xD;
      nanofiltration and omission of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, most likely will not affect&#xD;
      tolerability. The nanofiltration will provide more safety regarding viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B of the study, 15 attacks of hereditary angioedema will be treated with open-label&#xD;
      C1-esteraseremmer-N. Attack severity and duration will be monitored by the subjective&#xD;
      experience of the patient himself (which has been shown to be the most sensitive way of&#xD;
      monitoring attack severity) and compared with historical (and literature) data. If possible,&#xD;
      some attacks of acquired angioedema will also be included.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for HAE type I and type II patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Established diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (type I or II): markedly decreased C1&#xD;
             inhibitor activity; decreased (type I), normal or elevated (type II) level of C1&#xD;
             inhibitor antigen; decreased level of C4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 16 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a peripheral, abdominal, facial, laryngeal or genitourinary attack of&#xD;
             angioedema of moderate to severe intensity, starting less then 5 hours before&#xD;
             infusion. An attack is defined as moderate if it affects the normal daily activities&#xD;
             of the patient in any way. Severe attacks are defined by the inability to perform&#xD;
             normal daily activities.&#xD;
