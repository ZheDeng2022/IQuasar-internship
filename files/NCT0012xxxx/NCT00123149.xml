  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety profile of epoetin alfa in&#xD;
      patients with anemia of chronic disease due to rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epoetin alfa is an analogue of erythropoetin, a hormone secreted by kidneys known to&#xD;
      stimulate red blood cell production. Although epoetin alfa has been known to be effective in&#xD;
      treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, information on its effectiveness&#xD;
      and long-term safety for treatment of anemia associated with rheumatoid arthritis is limited.&#xD;
      This 35-week safety study is an extension of a 20-week, prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study that investigates effectiveness of&#xD;
      epoetin alfa in patients with anemia of chronic disease due to rheumatoid arthritis. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that there will be no long-term safety concerns of epoetin alfa&#xD;
      administered once every two weeks in rheumatoid arthritis patients with anemia of chronic&#xD;
      disease. Patients will receive epoetin alfa injections (40,000 units) under their skin once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for up to 31 weeks. Doses may be adjusted depending on the patients' hemoglobin&#xD;
      level up to the maximum of 60,000 units once every 2 weeks or 40,000 units once weekly.&#xD;
