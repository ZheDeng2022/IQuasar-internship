      The goal of our research will be to determine the effectiveness of 17&#xD;
      alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) in the treatment of preterm delivery. Treatment with&#xD;
      progesterone is emerging as the standard of care for prevention of preterm delivery in&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients at high risk for preterm birth due to a prior preterm delivery. Our&#xD;
      goal is to evaluate whether or not progesterone is also effective in reducing preterm birth&#xD;
      in symptomatic patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preterm delivery remains one of the most important issues facing perinatal medicine today. In&#xD;
      1999, prematurity/low birthweight accounted for 4,304 neonatal deaths, reflecting a rate of&#xD;
      neonatal mortality due to prematurity of 23.0 per 100,000 live births. Despite the extent of&#xD;
      the problem, the exact etiology of preterm delivery is not completely understood. It is clear&#xD;
      that many pathways are involved in preterm delivery, and that ultimately these must converge&#xD;
      upon one final endpoint, which is likely related to progesterone. In the animal model&#xD;
      progesterone withdrawal is clearly directly (rodent, rabbit) or indirectly (sheep) involved&#xD;
      in the initiation of parturition, however the exact way in which progesterone works in humans&#xD;
      is unclear. There has been a resurgence of interest in the association between progesterone&#xD;
      and preterm delivery. Two recent trials have looked at the utility of progesterone in the&#xD;
      prevention of preterm delivery in high-risk patients. In a multicenter trial reported in the&#xD;
      New England Journal of Medicine in 2003, Meis et al, recruited 463 patients with a history of&#xD;
      spontaneous preterm delivery and randomized them in a 2:1 ratio to intramuscular&#xD;
      17-hydroxyprogesterone vs. placebo from 16-20 weeks until 36 weeks. Treatment with 17P&#xD;
      significantly reduced the risk of delivery at &lt;37 weeks, &lt;35 weeks, and &lt;32 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Yale Progesterone Study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the use of 17&#xD;
      hydroxyprogesterone for the treatment of preterm labor. The design is similar to the Meis&#xD;
      NEJM trial, except that the patients will be symptomatic with preterm labor, rather than&#xD;
      asymptomatic with a history of preterm delivery. In addition to the therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      planned, the researchers intend to collect specimens to assess for markers of PTD, both&#xD;
      before and after treatment. In this way, the researchers can analyze which pathway of PTD is&#xD;
      involved, and finally, the effect of progesterone on these markers can be assessed.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in preterm labor as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an accurately dated singleton gestation. Accurate dating is defined as&#xD;
             estimated date of delivery (EDD) based on last menstrual period (LMP) dating (280 days&#xD;
             after the first day of the LMP) confirmed by an ultrasound done before 20 weeks, which&#xD;
             yields an EDD within 10 days of LMP dating. If the LMP is not available, the EDD must&#xD;
             be based on 2 ultrasounds performed at least 2 weeks apart, which are concordant&#xD;
             within 5 days of the same EDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with their first presentation of preterm labor will be invited to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose plan of management includes admission to the hospital and&#xD;
             administration of antenatal steroids for fetal well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rupture of membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major known fetal anomalies&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Uterine anomalies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervical cerclage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment during this pregnancy with progesterone after 14 weeks' gestation (use up to&#xD;
             14 weeks' gestation is permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous admission for preterm labor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to tocolysis, including fetal distress, chorioamnionitis,&#xD;
             preeclampsia, hemodynamic instability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coexisting maternal disease including hypertension requiring medical therapy, cancer,&#xD;
             seizure disorder, thromboembolic disorders, liver disease. Patients treated with oral&#xD;
             beta adrenergics for asthma are also excluded.&#xD;
