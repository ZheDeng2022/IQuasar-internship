  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment for patients with malignant brain tumors is disappointing. The disease is&#xD;
      incurable and virtually all patients die from their disease. Despite the devastating nature&#xD;
      of this illness which affects all age groups, its cause remains unexplained. Family&#xD;
      identification with careful clinical and molecular study have led to the discovery of the&#xD;
      genes that cause a number of other devastating diseases like retinoblastoma, cystic fibrosis,&#xD;
      and Huntington's chorea. The investigators propose to study the genetic changes in patients&#xD;
      with familial glioma as a first step in identifying the gene(s) that cause these tumors.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to study the genetic changes in patients with familial glioma as&#xD;
      the first step in identifying the gene(s) that cause these tumors. With informed consent,&#xD;
      DNAs from tumor and non-tumor tissue, histologic sections, pedigrees and detailed clinical&#xD;
      information will be acquired for patients with familial gliomas. A genomic screening&#xD;
      methodology named 2D genomic scanning will be used. Differences detected between the tumor&#xD;
      and normal tissues (blood, fibroblasts) will identify events occurring in the tumoral&#xD;
      process. A comparison of the events in familial and sporadic gliomas will outline some of the&#xD;
      pathways suspected to be involved both in tumor initiation and progression. Briefly, DNA&#xD;
      fragments are amplified with the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) from tumor and normal tissue&#xD;
      using primers designed to identify 100 to 1000 random sites within the genome. The PCR&#xD;
      primers will hybridize throughout the genome and generate a manageable number of short PCR&#xD;
      products that are detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The PCR for both tumor&#xD;
      and constitutional tissues are amplified through 20 to 25 cycles to ensure adequate signal&#xD;
      but to avoid entering a non-exponential phase of the PCR amplification. The products are&#xD;
      radiolabelled and then run on a standard sequencing gel. The single lane containing labelled&#xD;
      PCR products is cut out and then overlaid onto a denaturing grading gel with a 10 to 75%&#xD;
      grading of denaturant. The labelled DNA is then separated in the second dimension and the DNA&#xD;
      is detected by Southern Transfer to nylon membrane or by gel-drying and direct exposure film.&#xD;
      A direct comparison of PCR signals from the tumor and constitutional tissue identifies the&#xD;
      loss or gain of signal which reflects the same phenomena within the genome. The isolation and&#xD;
      characterization of fragment consistently altered in gliomas will provide the first step in&#xD;
      the search for genes responsible in the initiation and progression of gliomas. Because of the&#xD;
      collaboration among investigators of different centres in Canada, the current investigators&#xD;
      have a unique opportunity to perform the study on the largest collection of familial gliomas&#xD;
      in the world. They expect several genomic abnormalities in each tumor. Some of these may be&#xD;
      seen in several patients. Data will be analyzed primarily using descriptive statistics, with&#xD;
      frequency of genetic abnormalities at different chromosomal locations described.&#xD;
