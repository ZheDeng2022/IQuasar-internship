    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide and pamidronate, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Arsenic trioxide and pamidronate may also stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pamidronate may also stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving arsenic trioxide together with&#xD;
      pamidronate may kill more cancer cells. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and&#xD;
      best dose of arsenic trioxide and pamidronate in treating patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      or multiple myeloma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicities of the combination of arsenic trioxide in combination with&#xD;
      pamidronate disodium at four dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacokinetics of pamidronate disodium when given in combination with&#xD;
      arsenic trioxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Utilizing 2-color immunofluorescence (IF) to determine if the treatment with combination&#xD;
      of arsenic trioxide and pamidronate disodium affects the phosphorylation of epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) IV. In patients with multiple myeloma utilizing western blot to&#xD;
      evaluate the pre- and post-treatment levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in lysates of&#xD;
      multiple myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To obtain preliminary data for response to this regimen in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pamidronate IV and over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and arsenic trioxide IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours on days 1-5 and 15-19. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pamidronate and arsenic trioxide until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
