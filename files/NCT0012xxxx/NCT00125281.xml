    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) on itching and fatigue in&#xD;
      patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a disease of the small bile ducts in the liver.&#xD;
      Ursodiol, the only currently available treatment for biliary cirrhosis, does not cure the&#xD;
      disease, and many people continue to have symptoms or liver test abnormalities despite&#xD;
      treatment. SAMe is a naturally occurring substance found in most cells of the body. The&#xD;
      highest levels of the substance are produced by the liver, where it helps to rid the body of&#xD;
      toxins and breakdown products of metabolism. Studies in Europe suggest that SAMe may help to:&#xD;
      1) decrease the fatigue and itching that are common in persons with liver problems, and 2)&#xD;
      decrease levels of liver enzymes in the blood, suggesting that it may decrease the amount of&#xD;
      liver injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age or older with primary biliary cirrhosis who are taking ursodiol and&#xD;
      have symptoms of itching or fatigue may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, physical examination, review of medical records, routine blood tests,&#xD;
      and a symptoms rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants stop all medications for itching 4 weeks before starting the study, but continue&#xD;
      to take ursodiol during the 42-week trial. On entering the study, patients are assigned to&#xD;
      take either SAMe or placebo tablets twice a day for 12 weeks. While taking the medications,&#xD;
      they are followed in the clinic every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 weeks to&#xD;
      fill out symptoms questionnaires and have a short medical evaluation and blood tests. At the&#xD;
      end of 12 weeks, treatment is interrupted for a 2-week &quot;wash-out&quot; period, after which&#xD;
      patients begin a 12-week crossover treatment; that is, patients who were taking SAMe are&#xD;
      switched to placebo, and those who were taking placebo are switched to SAMe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the second 12-week treatment course, patients come to the clinic at 4, 8,&#xD;
      and 12 weeks to fill out symptoms questionnaires and have a medical evaluation and blood&#xD;
      tests. At the last visit, patients are told which type of tablet they received during the two&#xD;
      courses of treatment. SAMe is available without prescription in many forms as an&#xD;
      over-the-counter medication.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) in symptomatic relief of primary&#xD;
      biliary cirrhosis (PBC), we will treat up to 50 patients with either SAM-e (800 mg BID) or&#xD;
      placebo for 12 weeks in a cross-over, double-blind placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-adenosyl methionine is a nutritional supplement which is available as an over-the-counter&#xD;
      formula and is used for treatment of depression and arthritic pain. SAMe is produced in&#xD;
      virtually all cells and participates in many biochemical pathways as a major methyl&#xD;
      contributor. Intracellular levels of SAMe are often decreased in advanced liver disease. At&#xD;
      present SAMe is undergoing extensive evaluation in a large multicenter, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial as an adjunctive therapy of alcoholic liver disease. SAMe has also been evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with intrahepatic cholestasis and cholestasis of pregnancy with promising effects of&#xD;
      relieving pruritus and fatigue and improving serum liver associated enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will recruit patients with PBC who have pruritus or fatigue despite therapy&#xD;
      with ursodiol (the currently recommended therapy of PBC which is partially effective in&#xD;
      relieving pruritus and fatigue). After medical evaluation and a brief period of monitoring,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to receive either SAMe or placebo given in oral form in similar&#xD;
      appearing capsules twice daily. Patients will be followed at regular intervals for symptoms&#xD;
      as monitored by validated questionnaires as well as for side effects and serum biochemical&#xD;
      and hematological tests. After 12 weeks, therapy will be withdrawn for 2 weeks and patients&#xD;
      will then be switched to the alternative capsules, either SAMe or placebo, for another 12&#xD;
      weeks. The primary endpoints of therapy will be improvements in symptoms of pruritus or&#xD;
      fatigue or both. Secondary endpoints will be improvements in serum biochemical liver related&#xD;
      enzymes.&#xD;
