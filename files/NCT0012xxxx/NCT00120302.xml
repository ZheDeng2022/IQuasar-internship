    <textblock>
      This study is not being conducted in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 4 week double blind treatment period. All patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will enter the study at day 0 and be randomized into either&#xD;
      pimecrolimus cream 1% or vehicle treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will return to&#xD;
      clinic on days 7,14 and 28 for assessments of disease severity. Patients who experience an&#xD;
      unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, will attend an unscheduled visit and be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of eligibility include an Investigator's Global Assessment and Pruritus score.&#xD;
      Treatment history will be collected at baseline and Quality of Life Questionnaires will be&#xD;
      carried out at every visit.&#xD;
