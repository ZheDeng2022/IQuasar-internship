  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator&#xD;
      activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, induces regression in carotid atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques in diabetic patients with vascular disease and/or hypertension over a 12 month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rosiglitazone is a new member of the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of drugs which act by&#xD;
      binding to peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). It has been&#xD;
      suggested that the TZD class od anti-diabetic drug may exhibit anti-atherosclerotic effects.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate over a 12 month period the potential benefits of&#xD;
      rosiglitazone on carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques in the type 2 diabetic population&#xD;
      with coexisting vascular disease or hypertension. It is hypothesised that treatment with&#xD;
      rosiglitazone will lead to a decrease in plaque size. In addition it is hoped that&#xD;
      rosiglitazone will have a positive effect on the plaque composition and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the plaque volume change over 12 months as assessed by&#xD;
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). The effectiveness of this modality to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of pharmacological agents on atherosclerosis in vivo has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      previous studies using statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will be to define the changes in plaque lipid content, fibrous cap&#xD;
      thickness and gadolinium enhancement as a measure of fibrous cap inflammation and plaque&#xD;
      neovascularisation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patient who is 30 to 75 years of age at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with coexisting vascular disease (previous myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident or peripheral vascular disease) or hypertension (BP &gt; 150/90)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have initiated statin and fibrate therapy at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening, and have been receiving a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
             screening. [Note: patients not receiving statin or fibrate therapy will be allowed to&#xD;
             enter the study providing that this method of treatment is not required as active&#xD;
             treatment for their medical condition at the time of screening; if any of these&#xD;
             patients develop the need for statin or fibrate therapy during the course of the&#xD;
             study, therapy will be started without the need to withdraw the patient from the&#xD;
             study.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective&#xD;
             contraceptive measures. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraceptive&#xD;
             measures for at least 1 month prior to visit 1 (screening), and should continue to use&#xD;
             the same contraceptive method during the study and for 30 days after discontinuing&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who give their signed informed consent to participate.&#xD;

             internal carotid artery between 10 and 95%. Diagnosis to be performed prior to&#xD;
