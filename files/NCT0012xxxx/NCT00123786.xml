  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) has been approved by many regulatory agencies world-wide and&#xD;
      is in widespread use in the United States, Japan and Europe. In the United States, 18F-FDG&#xD;
      scanning in oncology is approved for federal healthcare reimbursement for non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, oesophageal cancer, melanoma,&#xD;
      head and neck cancer and breast cancer. It has general applications in all areas where&#xD;
      abnormal glucose metabolism may be present including in circumstances such as differentiating&#xD;
      the tumour from scar tissue; evaluating the presence of the tumour in light of rising tumour&#xD;
      markers and normal imaging techniques; and assessing response to therapy where other&#xD;
      techniques are deemed to be unhelpful. Current literature suggests that functional imaging&#xD;
      with 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET) may play an important role in the imaging&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with soft tissue sarcoma, including guiding biopsy; detecting local&#xD;
      recurrence at sites of tumour resection; detecting metastatic disease; predicting and&#xD;
      monitoring response to therapy; and assessing for prognosis. In appropriate situations, it is&#xD;
      possibly the most effective diagnostic strategy. However, due to the low incidence of these&#xD;
      tumours, prospective studies with large multicenter patient groups will be essential to&#xD;
      define the exact diagnostic role of 18F-FDG PET in this clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a specialized nuclear medicine procedure&#xD;
      that uses positron emitting radiolabeled tracer molecules to measure biological activity. The&#xD;
      most common of these tracers, 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FGD), an analog of glucose, is&#xD;
      used to determine abnormal glucose metabolism in tumours and other sites. FDG has general&#xD;
      applications where abnormal glucose metabolism may be present such as differentiating tumour&#xD;
      from scar tissue, evaluating the presence of tumour in light of rising tumour markers and&#xD;
      normal morphological imaging, and assessing response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cross Cancer Institute has been funded to establish a PET centre and research program to&#xD;
      prove the effectiveness of PET scanning in the Canadian health care environment and validate&#xD;
      the data that have been developed in other jurisdictions in specific oncologic indications. A&#xD;
      cyclotron has been installed at the Cross Cancer Institute which produces 18F-fluoride that&#xD;
      is used in the automated synthesis of FDG. The three PET scanners in the Department of&#xD;
      Oncologic Imaging will be used for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary - establish the general utility and value of FDG-PET imaging in patients with known&#xD;
      or suspected soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary - demonstrate the safety of FDG-PET imaging by documentation of adverse events;&#xD;
      determine whether the number of subjects available for study at the Cross Cancer Institute is&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve statistically significant results; determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      extending this study to a larger multicenter design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The proposed trial will be a Phase II, diagnostic imaging, open label, single&#xD;
      site clinical trial. The patient population will consist of patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma. This will also be a pilot study to test the feasibility of extending&#xD;
      this trial to a larger multicenter design in view of increasing sample size and strengthening&#xD;
      conclusions about safety and effectiveness of FDG-PET imaging in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With each scan, the patient will receive a single IV injection of FDG. Initial imaging will&#xD;
      be conducted 60 minutes after an average injection of 200-300 MBq of FDG (dose is dependent&#xD;
      on which scanner is used and patients' weight). The images will then be examined by an&#xD;
      experienced nuclear medicine physician and the location and intensity of abnormal FDG uptake&#xD;
      will be reported. The referring physician will then correlate the findings with the results&#xD;
      of clinical examinations and conventional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The investigators will calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of&#xD;
      the FDG scans. They also intend to evaluate the percentage of patients in which the FDG scan&#xD;
      outcome affected patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules: The subject is free to withdraw at any time. The investigator also has the&#xD;
      right to withdraw a subject from the study in the event of intercurrent illness or other&#xD;
      reasons concerning the health or well being of the subject, or in case of lack of&#xD;
      cooperation. Should a subject decide to withdraw or the investigator decide to withdraw the&#xD;
      subject after administration of FDG, all efforts will be made to complete and report&#xD;
      follow-up observations as thoroughly as possible providing consent is still valid. A complete&#xD;
      final evaluation at the time of the subject's withdrawal is to be made with an explanation of&#xD;
      why the subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study. If the reason for&#xD;
      withdrawing a subject from the study is a specific event or an abnormal laboratory test&#xD;
      result, the event or test result must be recorded as an adverse event and entered into the&#xD;
      Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee: Preliminary data will be analyzed for safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness on a yearly basis until the study ends.&#xD;
