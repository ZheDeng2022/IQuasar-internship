      According to amendment 3 this study addresses the question if intensification of&#xD;
      administration of rituximab in standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      aggressive B-Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) and high risk (aaIPI 2 or 3) results in a better&#xD;
      time to treatment failure (TTTF)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was primarily designed to compare aggressive conventional chemotherapy with a&#xD;
      repetitive high-dose (HD) therapy program using identical, effective drugs at highest&#xD;
      possible dose and dose intensity with/without addition of rituximab (initially 4 treatment&#xD;
      arms). In 2004 the first amendment had to be added in order to close two treatment arms&#xD;
      without rituximab due to recent data revealing a significant advantage for rituximab-treated&#xD;
      patients with CD20+lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned interim analysis in 2010 revealed inferiority of the high-dose treatment thus in&#xD;
      the 2nd amendment the high-dose arm was closed and additionally the rituximab frequency was&#xD;
      raised from 6 to 12 administrations as recent publications gave hint for advantage. The last&#xD;
      amendment was added in 2010 to adjust for delayed recruitment mainly due to organisation&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the high-dose arm was closed only CD20+ B-lymphoma were included past amendment 2.&#xD;
