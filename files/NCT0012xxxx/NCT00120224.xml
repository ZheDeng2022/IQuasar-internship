  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the possibility that medical abortion using mifepristone and&#xD;
      misoprostol - a safe, proven therapy for terminating early first trimester pregnancy - can be&#xD;
      administered in a manner that is simpler and less costly than that routinely employed in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Practitioners themselves, based on history and examination but without sonography, are&#xD;
           able to dependably and correctly determine which patients are eligible for medical&#xD;
           abortion and which patients either are not eligible or require further evaluation to&#xD;
           determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Practitioners themselves, based on a symptom diary and low-sensitivity pregnancy test&#xD;
           but without sonography, are able to dependably and correctly determine when a successful&#xD;
           medical abortion has taken place and when referral for other possible outcomes should be&#xD;
           made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A symptom diary and low-sensitivity pregnancy test are safe and effective means of&#xD;
           separating those women who could benefit from a follow-up visit from those who do not&#xD;
           need one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mifepristone medical abortion has been available in France for a decade and a half and in the&#xD;
      United States since 2001. Over this time, it has been demonstrated to be as safe as or safer&#xD;
      than either surgical abortion or carrying a pregnancy to term. Furthermore, as medical&#xD;
      abortion employs medications rather than surgery to terminate a pregnancy, it has the&#xD;
      potential to greatly increase the availability of locations providing abortion services in&#xD;
      the US, eliminating as it does the need for expensive equipment and surgical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, however, although the availability of medical abortion in the US has increased&#xD;
      with time, it has yet to achieve its full potential. In large part this appears to be due to&#xD;
      two factors which inhibit providers from offering, and women from choosing, the procedure: 1)&#xD;
      Although the approved US medical abortion regimen does not require providers to use&#xD;
      ultrasound examination as part of the procedure, it has become common practice for providers&#xD;
      to do so. This both increases the cost of the procedure and limits the number of facilities&#xD;
      that can offer it. 2) While surgical abortion typically requires only one clinic visit,&#xD;
      medical abortion requires (officially) three or (in practice) two visits, making it more&#xD;
      expensive, less convenient, and less attractive to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is already a great deal of evidence that medical abortion can be safely offered with&#xD;
      two (or even fewer) office visits, and without routine ultrasonography. Most medical&#xD;
      abortions in the United States, in fact, currently require only two visits, and the&#xD;
      possibility exists that women could self-screen at home, based on a symptom checklist, to&#xD;
      determine if the second of these (the follow-up visit) is necessary - an approach that could&#xD;
      spare the large majority of medical abortion clients who have uncomplicated courses an extra&#xD;
      trip to the clinic. There are, in addition, several less-expensive and less&#xD;
      technology-intensive approaches to gathering the diagnostic information currently being&#xD;
      provided, pre- and post-procedure, by ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of an approach to&#xD;
      medical abortion that forgoes the routine use of ultrasonography. It will also provide&#xD;
      evidence on the feasibility of eliminating the requirement for a universal follow-up visit&#xD;
      based on self-screening by medical abortion clients. In providing data to make these tests,&#xD;
      however, the study protocol will not in any way abridge the medical abortion care currently&#xD;
      received by clients at the participating facilities. The study will permit clients to receive&#xD;
      standard care (including a follow-up visit and pre- and post-procedure ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations in all cases) while gathering valuable information which, we hope, will provide&#xD;
      a basis for simplifying standard care in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions to be answered by the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do an interview with the abortion client, a pregnancy test and a physical exam provide&#xD;
           adequate information to determine which abortion clients are eligible for the medical&#xD;
           abortion procedure and which should be referred for sonography (or other diagnostic&#xD;
           tests) before making such a determination?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can a self-administered symptom diary and a follow-up low-sensitivity pregnancy test&#xD;
           provide an adequate basis to determine whether a woman has undergone a successful&#xD;
           medical abortion or whether she requires a sonographic exam (or other diagnostic test)&#xD;
           in order to make this determination?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does a post-abortion pelvic examination provide valuable additional information for&#xD;
           determining whether a woman has undergone a successful medical abortion or whether she&#xD;
           requires a sonographic exam (or other diagnostic test) in order to make this&#xD;
           determination?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can a self-administered symptom diary and a low-sensitivity pregnancy test provide an&#xD;
           adequate basis for determining which medical abortion clients require a follow-up visit?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Practitioners themselves, based on history and examination but without sonography, are&#xD;
           able to dependably and correctly determine which patients are eligible for medical&#xD;
           abortion and which patients either are not eligible or require further evaluation to&#xD;
           determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Practitioners themselves, based on a symptom diary and low-sensitivity pregnancy test&#xD;
           but without sonography, are able to dependably and correctly determine when a successful&#xD;
           medical abortion has taken place and when referral for other possible outcomes should be&#xD;
           made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A symptom diary and low-sensitivity pregnancy test are safe and effective means of&#xD;
           separating those women who could benefit from a follow-up visit from those who do not&#xD;
           need one.&#xD;
