    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a simplified lopinavir/ritonavir-based&#xD;
      therapy will continue to keep the viral load at very low levels after initial treatment with&#xD;
      a combination of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) plus tenofovir and emtricitabine.&#xD;
