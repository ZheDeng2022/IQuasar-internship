  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dimenhydrinate, an over-the-counter, widely used drug in Canada, is an&#xD;
      ethanolamine-derivative anti-histamine. It limits the stimulation of the vomiting center by&#xD;
      the vestibular system, which is rich in histamine receptors. Multiple studies have shown its&#xD;
      effectiveness in treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting in children. It is also used&#xD;
      for treatment of vertigo in children. Furthermore, it has the potential to be much more&#xD;
      cost-effective than ondansetron, with an average cost of $0.90 US per dose . Its principal&#xD;
      side effects are drowsiness, dizziness and anticholinergic symptoms. Restlessness and&#xD;
      insomnia have also been described in children. To date, there has been no published data on&#xD;
      the efficacy of dimenhydrinate in controlling emesis in children with acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do children treated with oral dimenhydrinate during acute gastro-enteritis experience less&#xD;
      vomiting episodes than children treated with placebo?&#xD;

      STRUCTURED RESEARCH ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The use of antiemetic drugs to treat nausea and vomiting during an episode of&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis in children remains controversial. To date, there have been a limited&#xD;
      number of clinical trials studying this subject matter and health authorities'&#xD;
      recommendations are only based on expert opinion. Surveys have shown that despite this lack&#xD;
      of evidence, physicians do quite frequently prescribe these drugs. Dimenhydrinate, a&#xD;
      histamine receptor blocker, has been proven safe and effective in controlling post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting in children. To our knowledge, no clinical trial has been conducted to&#xD;
      study its efficacy in children with acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral dimenhydrinate in the treatment of&#xD;
      vomiting due to acute gastroenteritis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Emergency Department (ED) of an urban pediatric university-affiliated center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children from 1 to 12 years of age presenting to the ED with at least 5&#xD;
      episodes of vomiting in the previous 12 hours and diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis by&#xD;
      attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive 8 doses of&#xD;
      dimenhydrinate or placebo every six hours (1mg/kg/dose, max dose 50mg/dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure: Number of good outcome, defined as 1 episode or less of vomiting 24&#xD;
      hours after the first dose of drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: Need for intravenous fluid administration, number and duration of&#xD;
      vomiting and diarrhea, side effects, revisit rates and parental absenteeism from work will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistics: Based on previously reported data, the researchers estimate that&#xD;
      approximately 70% of patients will be free of emesis in the initial 24 hours post medication&#xD;
      first dose. The researchers would like to obtain a good outcome in more than 85% with the&#xD;
      active medication. With an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 90%, approximately 90 patients&#xD;
      per group will be needed. Patients' characteristics and outcomes will be compared using the&#xD;
      Mann Whitney U test and the Chi-square test for categorical variables and the Student's T&#xD;
      test for continuous variables. Survival curves will also be analyzed.&#xD;
