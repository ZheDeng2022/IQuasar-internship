    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether surgical section of the filum terminale in&#xD;
      children, when added to standard medical therapy, will result in a reliable and&#xD;
      clinically-significant improvement in two main markers of incontinence within/at 12 months&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight % to sixteen % of school-aged children or approximately 50,000 children in British&#xD;
      Columbia (BC) suffer from persistent urinary incontinence (i.e., beyond age 5 years, when&#xD;
      continence is usually achieved). Prevalence decreases with age, yet studies indicate that&#xD;
      10%-25% of healthy adolescents and young adults also suffer from incontinence. Persistent&#xD;
      incontinence has profound social, emotional and behavioral impacts, and adversely affects the&#xD;
      quality of life of affected children and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical management of incontinence in these patients includes repeated visits to the family&#xD;
      doctor and long-term lifestyle changes and/or prescription use. Each year in BC, family&#xD;
      doctors refer about 4500 children to pediatric urologists at BC Children's Hospital (BCCH).&#xD;
      BCCH is the only tertiary care facility for children and youth in the province, so that&#xD;
      children and parents come from all over BC for these appointments and for diagnostic&#xD;
      urodynamics testing. Of these children who are evaluated by pediatric urologists each year,&#xD;
      approximately 900 (20%) are designated as having dysfunctional voiding. In this group,&#xD;
      following one year of non-responsiveness to medical treatment (medication, lifestyle), the&#xD;
      urologist may refer the child to neurosurgery for assessment and possible surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the referral rate of children with incontinence to BCCH Neurosurgery has&#xD;
      increased markedly from 1-2 to 12-15 children per year. This referral is because urinary&#xD;
      incontinence in children is one of the clinical features of a tethered cord syndrome. In this&#xD;
      syndrome, the lower end of the spinal cord (the conus) is pulled down lower than normal by a&#xD;
      thickened band of tissue called the filum terminale, which runs inferiorly from the bottom of&#xD;
      the spinal cord. This &quot;tethered&quot; condition can be treated by surgical section of the filum&#xD;
      terminale. More recently, the concept of an occult tethered cord syndrome (OTCS) has been&#xD;
      proposed; in OTCS, clinical symptoms (e.g., incontinence) are consistent with a tethered cord&#xD;
      syndrome, but the conus ends at a normal location. The concept of the OTCS is controversial,&#xD;
      and it is not yet clear whether or not section of the filum is appropriate. Filum section is&#xD;
      a relatively minor procedure (akin to appendectomy) that requires general anesthesia during&#xD;
      day surgery. In uncontrolled case series, section of the filum terminale in children with&#xD;
      OTCS resulted in a 60%-97% improvement in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this evidence that section of the filum may improve incontinence symptoms, urologists&#xD;
      are keen to refer more patients to neurosurgeons. Furthermore, families are demanding more&#xD;
      tests and options, and are ready to pursue surgery as treatment of their child's&#xD;
      incontinence. This suggests that the referral rate to Neurosurgery will continue to increase,&#xD;
      and there will be a crucial requirement to develop standard policies and procedures related&#xD;
      to offering this surgery to children with incontinence. As yet, however, the effectiveness&#xD;
      and appropriateness of the surgery have not been evaluated systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this matter a comparison will be made between two randomized groups. One group&#xD;
      will undergo early tethered cord release by section of the filum terminale through a limited&#xD;
      posterior lumbar spinal exposure and continued medical therapy for 12 months. This group will&#xD;
      be compared to a second that has continued standard medical therapy without surgical&#xD;
      intervention for a further 12 months. This comparison will be made based on physiological&#xD;
      markers of urinary incontinence, as measured by a urodynamic scale; and quality of life, as&#xD;
      measured by a validated enuresis-specific quality of life scale. The intervention will be&#xD;
      considered to be successful if it improves the urodynamic score by 20%, and the quality of&#xD;
      life of the child and his family are significantly improved.&#xD;
