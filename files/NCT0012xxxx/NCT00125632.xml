  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is currently among the top three leading causes of&#xD;
      central vision loss in veterans (Chomsky et al., 1995) and is the most prevalent cause of&#xD;
      blindness among veterans (37.2%, Quillen &amp; Henry, 2000). The loss of central vision&#xD;
      associated with these diseases has a profound impact on the quality of life of those&#xD;
      affected, with many suffering depression. It is devastating to no longer be able to read a&#xD;
      newspaper or recognize facial expressions. The use of preferred retinal locations (PRLs) to&#xD;
      compensate for diseased foveae has offered hope to these patients in regaining some function.&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a protocol that includes training in three major visual&#xD;
      skills areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visual awareness and eccentric viewing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reading eye movements; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  processing of sequentially presented lexical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Module 1 focuses on making the patient aware of better vision at an eccentric location&#xD;
      relative to degraded vision at the diseased fovea. Module 2 is focused on the improvement of&#xD;
      the control of eye movements with the PRL. Module 3 is focused on reading practice without&#xD;
      eye movements. These program curriculums and preliminary results are provided in the present&#xD;
      proposal. The primary aim of this proposal is to quantitatively assess the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness for improving reading and to establish the minimum training time need for skill&#xD;
      improvement. Sixty patients with AMD who are already using a PRL will be selected to be&#xD;
      similar in visual characteristics (e.g., visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, size of&#xD;
      scotoma, duration of disease) and included in an experimental group. All patients in the&#xD;
      experimental group will be trained with all three modules using a repeated measures -&#xD;
      completely counterbalanced - design to control for training order effects. An additional 24&#xD;
      AMD patients will be recruited for a control group to be tested at the same time intervals as&#xD;
      the experimental patients, but do not receive training between these assessment period&#xD;
      intervals. The control group patients will be given the option to receive training following&#xD;
      the assessment period. Both the experimental and the control patients will be assessed using&#xD;
      the same outcome measures of reading (using MNRead Acuity Charts, the Pepper Visual Skills&#xD;
      for Reading (VSR) Test, and the View Sentences Test). The performance of the experimental&#xD;
      patients on the outcomes battery post-training will be compared to their pre-training&#xD;
      performance on the same battery. Any change in performance of the experimental patients will&#xD;
      be compared to the test-retest performance of the control patients. A questionnaire (the&#xD;
      Veterans Administration Low Vision Visual Functioning Questionnaire) will also be&#xD;
      administered to assess perceived abilities to perform everyday tasks before and following&#xD;
      training. The control patients will also receive the questionnaire before and after their&#xD;
      assessment period. In addition, the experimental patients will also be assessed on the&#xD;
      exercises practiced during the module at the end of each daily training session to determine&#xD;
      exactly when in the training protocol an improvement in performance on the exercises being&#xD;
      trained has occurred. These daily performance measures provide for a finer scale for&#xD;
      detecting performance changes. Statistical analyses will be conducted to answer the following&#xD;
      key questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What visual skills related to reading are trainable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which methods are best for training these skills?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the time course of visual skill improvement?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the answers to these questions depend upon individual patient characteristics (e.g.,&#xD;
           age, disease severity, PRL location, cognitive factors)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do patients who do not undergo training, but have repeated reading performance&#xD;
           assessments, show improvements in reading skills?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances are being made in the area of retinal cell transplantation, gene therapy, and&#xD;
      retinal prosthetics. When these techniques become part of standard clinical care, it is&#xD;
      likely that the patients will require vision rehabilitation techniques to help them make&#xD;
      sense of their potentially fragmented percepts. This research offers an evaluation of&#xD;
      relative successes of the components of reading rehabilitation and will lead to the design of&#xD;
      an efficient and effective composite training strategy.&#xD;
