  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational study enrolling 400 patients with&#xD;
      suspected or certain neurally-mediated syncope, who undergo carotid sinus massage, tilt&#xD;
      testing and Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)implantation. In its second phase, which starts&#xD;
      after the first ILR-documented syncope, the study will register the patient outcome after&#xD;
      administration of ILR-guided therapy, which is left to the discretion of the physicians. The&#xD;
      main objective is to verify the value of ILR in assessing the mechanism of syncope and the&#xD;
      efficacy of the ILR-guided therapy after syncope recurrence.&#xD;

      Study purpose was to verify the value of an Implanted Loop Recorder (ILR) in assessing the&#xD;
      mechanism of syncope and the efficacy of ILR-guided therapy after documentation of syncope&#xD;
      recurrence in patients with suspected or certain neurally-mediated syncope at initial&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center, prospective, observational study enrolling 400 patients with suspected or&#xD;
      certain neurally-mediated syncope, who undergo carotid sinus massage, tilt testing and ILR&#xD;
      implantation. In its second phase, which starts after the first ILR-documented syncope, the&#xD;
      study will register the patient outcome after administration of ILR-guided therapy, which is&#xD;
      left to the discretion of the physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To verify the value of ILR in assessing the mechanism of syncope and the&#xD;
      efficacy of the ILR-guided therapy after syncope recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the exact mechanism of syncope in patients with suspected or certain&#xD;
           neurally-mediated syncope based on the initial evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To prospectively evaluate the correlation between tilt-induced syncope, ATP-induced&#xD;
           asystolic response and/or carotid sinus hypersensitivity and ILR-documented spontaneous&#xD;
           syncope associated with bradycardia and/or asystole;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the relationship between asymptomatic and symptomatic asystoles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the effectiveness of pacing therapy for preventing syncope recurrence in&#xD;
           patients implanted with a pacemaker after an ILR-documented syncope associated with&#xD;
           asystole/bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspected or certain neurally-mediated syncope, based on the Guidelines of the ESC TF on&#xD;

        -  Loss of consciousness different from syncope (e.g. epilepsy, psychiatric, metabolic,&#xD;
           drop-attack, TIA, intoxication, cataplexy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steal syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychologically or physically (due to any other illness) unfit for participation in the&#xD;
           study according to the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patients who are geographically or otherwise inaccessible for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient unwilling or unable to give informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to non-cardiac cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: Phase 1: first ECG-documented syncope Phase 2: first syncope recurrence&#xD;
      after implementation of ILR-guided therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asymptomatic ILR-documented arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ILR-documented pre-syncope/s&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total number of syncopal recurrences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-syncope recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: ISSUE 2 will enroll a minimum of 400 patients during an anticipated period of&#xD;
      3 years. As the study will continue for a period of 6 months after the enrollment of the last&#xD;
      patient, total study duration will be approximately 4 years.&#xD;
