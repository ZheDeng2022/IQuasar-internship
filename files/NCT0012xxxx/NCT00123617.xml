    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the hypothesis that participation in a standard phase III group&#xD;
      based cardiac rehabilitation programme will improve psychological morbidity, quality of life&#xD;
      and cardiovascular risk factors, along with chest pain severity and frequency in women with&#xD;
      cardiac syndrome X.&#xD;

      Very few clinicians treating patients with Syndrome X could dispute that despite an excellent&#xD;
      prognosis, the debilitating symptomology and ineffective treatment regimes typical in this&#xD;
      condition give patients a miserable quality of life. First identified by Kemp (1), the triad&#xD;
      of angina pectoris, a positive exercise test for myocardial ischemia and angiographically&#xD;
      smooth coronary arteries continues to perplex clinician seeking a useful treatment regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible pathophysiology of chest pain associated with Syndrome X is poorly understood in&#xD;
      these patients. Suggested mechanisms include abnormal myocardial flow reserve due to coronary&#xD;
      microvascular dysfunction ('microvascular angina') (2) or a generalised disorder of vascular&#xD;
      function (3),(4) early signs of abnormal left ventricular function (5), which in some&#xD;
      patients may deteriorate over time,(6) and abnormal visceral pain perception (7). Some&#xD;
      patients exhibit insulin resistance (8). However, there have been few adequate systematic&#xD;
      explorations of the psychological and social aspects of Syndrome X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have found increased levels of anxiety in patients with normal or near normal&#xD;
      coronary arteries in the presence of accompanying chest pain (9). Ruggeri et al (10) found&#xD;
      higher level of neuroticism and anxiety in small group of patients with Syndrome X in&#xD;
      comparison with patients with confirmed coronary artery disease. Panic disorders, sometimes&#xD;
      associated with chest pain, are also often presented with depression, hypochondriasis or&#xD;
      other somatoform disorders (11). Studies investigating various non-therapeutic treatment&#xD;
      regimes have repeatedly shown that relaxation and stress reduction lead to fewer incidence of&#xD;
      chest pain in Syndrome X patients (12). However, the same is also true for patients with CAD&#xD;
      (13) along with many other conditions and disorders with related chronic pain (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency and severity of chest pain has been shown to have a direct effect on quality of&#xD;
      life in Syndrome X patients (15). Sand (16) found that over a 7-year follow-up, a higher&#xD;
      percentage of Syndrome X patients had given up work, reduced their daily activities and&#xD;
      reported worsening chest pain in comparison to patients with confirmed coronary disease.&#xD;
      Persistent functional incapacity with concomitant high levels of chest pain in patients with&#xD;
      normal or near normal coronary arteries was also found after an 11-year follow-up (9). Use of&#xD;
      anti-anginals was higher, as was their self reported burden on the health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Collins team recently performed the largest psychosocial investigation of postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with Syndrome X ever undertaken (17). The Hearts and Minds Study, which involved 100&#xD;
      Syndrome X patients, 100 patients with CHD and 100 healthy volunteers found that Syndrome X&#xD;
      patients suffered significantly higher levels of anxiety than CHD patients or healthy&#xD;
      controls. A greater number of Syndrome X patients suffered clinical levels of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression than CHD patients and healthy volunteers, along with suffering significantly&#xD;
      higher levels of psychological suffering as measured by the Health Anxiety Questionnaire than&#xD;
      healthy controls. We also found that Syndrome X patients with a small social network had&#xD;
      higher levels of anxiety than their counterparts with a larger social support structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to address these findings, it is important to identify an intervention which not&#xD;
      only reduces anxiety, but also promotes wellbeing, improves quality of life and augments the&#xD;
      social support resource network available to Syndrome X patients. Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR)&#xD;
      has consistently been shown to improve the psychological wellbeing in cardiac patients, as&#xD;
      recent reviews have highlighted the beneficial effects of CR on symptoms of angina and&#xD;
      dyspnoea, stress level and psychological functioning (18). CR has been shown to have a&#xD;
      positive affect on reducing anxiety levels in cardiovascular patients (19), while high levels&#xD;
      of depression, a frequent co-morbidity in MI patients, have been reduced by CR (20). Women in&#xD;
      particular seem to gain most benefit from CR, as improvements in functional capacity,&#xD;
      coronary risk and psychosocial wellbeing were equal or greater in women than men following&#xD;
      rehabilitation (21). It has been suggested that CR may reduce anxiety in CHD patients by&#xD;
      reducing uncertainty, providing patients with an optimistic yet realistic outlook of&#xD;
      recovery, as well as providing psychological support and promoting coping (18). Few could&#xD;
      argue that a similar outcome in Syndrome X patients would not be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as promoting psychological wellbeing, CR also provides patients with a social support&#xD;
      resource network. The adequacy of social support has been investigated in relation the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with CHD (22) when it was noted that inadequate tangible support was a&#xD;
      significant predictor of both morbidity and mortality. Population based studies have&#xD;
      consistently identified a link between social support and CHD morbidity and mortality in men,&#xD;
      while disease severity and proliferation have been shown to be related to a lack of support&#xD;
      in women (23). Epidemiological studies have also consistently found a link between&#xD;
      depression, social isolation and predicted morbidity and mortality in CAD patients (24). It&#xD;
      has been argued that CR provides the social context through which coronary prevention&#xD;
      interventions are delivered (25) and that this extra social support may have an important&#xD;
      part to play in the patients recovery from, and adaptation to, chronic illness (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of exercise intervention on the frequency and severity of angina has been the&#xD;
      object of investigation for many years. Some studies have reported a reduction in mean weekly&#xD;
      episodes of angina of up to 91% using an acute exercise intervention in CHD patients (13) and&#xD;
      while other studies have been unable to replicate such results, almost all highlight the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of exercise on angina frequency. Nevertheless, very few studies have&#xD;
      investigated the impact of exercise on Syndrome X, either from a psychosocial or&#xD;
      physiological view-point. Erikkson et al (27) addressed the physical deconditioning apparent&#xD;
      in many Syndrome X patients through the use of 8 weeks moderate intensity exercise. Time to&#xD;
      pain improved dramatically, with no increase in maximum pain experienced, while peak exercise&#xD;
      capacity, heart rate and systolic blood pressure also showed improvements. Exercise capacity&#xD;
      and quality of life were also shown to increase following 8 weeks of physical training in&#xD;
      separate group of Syndrome X patients (28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic exercise has been repeatedly shown to have positive effects on psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing, anxiety and depression (29). Patients suffering clinical levels of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression have shown a reduction in the severity of their symptoms(30)while athletes and the&#xD;
      very active became depressed when they were prevented from exercising(31). Studies involving&#xD;
      exercise, anxiety and wellbeing the older population are limited, however subjective health&#xD;
      and psychological wellbeing have been shown to be higher among older people who partake in&#xD;
      regular exercise (32). Anxiety reduction and increased wellbeing has also been shown in&#xD;
      elderly men following an 8-week weekly exercise intervention (33).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we would like to explore the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation in&#xD;
      Syndrome X patients. Exercise is not currently recognised as a treatment regime for Syndrome&#xD;
      X, either as a stand- alone intervention or in conjunction with any other therapy. Patients&#xD;
      are currently given little advice or guidance relating to physical activity due to the lack&#xD;
      of research and information regarding the potential benefit of exercise available to&#xD;
      practitioners. Our previous investigations of Syndrome X have demonstrated a need for an&#xD;
      intervention which would not only reduce the patients reported levels of anxiety, but also&#xD;
      increase their perceived social support, psychological wellbeing and quality of life. CR has&#xD;
      been shown to improve quality of life, reduce anxiety and decrease frequency of angina&#xD;
      episodes in CHD patients through the use of exercise intervention and tangible social&#xD;
      support. Therefore, we would like to investigate the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does cardiac rehabilitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduce the frequency and severity of angina attacks in Syndrome X?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce anxiety, depression and health related worry found in Syndrome X?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improve the quality of life of Syndrome X patients?&#xD;
