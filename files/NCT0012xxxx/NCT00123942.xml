      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of MEDI-507 in patients with CD2-positive lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

    After review of safety events and have decided that further dose escalation of MEDI-507 as a&#xD;
    single agent is not feasible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women at least 18 years of age. Women of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test within 5 days of the initial MEDI-507 administration and&#xD;
             a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 0 prior to receiving the first dose of&#xD;
             MEDI-507. Women of childbearing potential must agree to practice an effective method&#xD;
             of contraception. Sexually active males must agree to use a condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder as determined by&#xD;
             the Laboratory of Pathology at the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of&#xD;
             Health (NIH). Only patients with the following lymphoproliferative disorders will be&#xD;
             eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ATL: Patients with all except the smoldering form of adult T-cell&#xD;
                  leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) will be eligible, regardless of whether they have had&#xD;
                  previous therapy, since there is no effective standard of care therapy for this&#xD;
                  disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CTCL: Patients with all stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) are eligible&#xD;
                  with the exception of Stage Ia. Patients with Stages Ib through III are eligible&#xD;
                  if their disease has failed at least one standard form of prior therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PTCL: Patients with Stages I-IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are eligible if&#xD;
                  their disease has progressed after standard chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  LGL: Patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL) must have&#xD;
                  myelosuppression (granulocyte count ≤1,500/uL; platelet count ≤75,000/uL; or&#xD;
                  hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL), or require hematopoietic support (transfusion or colony&#xD;
                  stimulating factors including filgrastim, IL-11, or erythropoietin) to maintain&#xD;
                  counts at these or higher levels or systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats or&#xD;
                  weight loss). Patients must have disease that is unresponsive to one prior&#xD;
                  therapy. Patients with monoclonal and polyclonal forms of the disease will be&#xD;
                  eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cells must express CD2. CD2 expression will be verified by immunohistochemistry in the&#xD;
             Laboratory of Pathology at the NIH. At least 30% of tumor cells must be CD2 positive&#xD;
             for the patient to be eligible for the study by immunohistochemistry. CD2 staining&#xD;
             will be performed on existing tissue blocks and on fresh tumor tissue if a biopsy is&#xD;
             performed. It is expected that the majority of patients will have CD2 expression&#xD;
             evaluated by flow cytometry and the majority of cells will express the marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt;2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Granulocyte count ≥1,000/mm3 and a platelet count ≥50,000/mm3. Patients with LGL&#xD;
             leukemia are excluded from these criteria. For patients with LGL leukemia, ANC and&#xD;
             platelet count will not be considered in determining study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamate pyruvate&#xD;
             transaminase (SGPT) value ≤2.0-fold greater than the upper limit of normal (if due to&#xD;
             lymphoma in the liver, patients will be allowed to have transaminase values ≤ 5.0 fold&#xD;
             greater than the upper limit of normal) and bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL unless due to&#xD;
             Gilbert's syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) in which case the bilirubin&#xD;
             should be ≤3.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, surgery, and prolonged cytolytic steroid&#xD;
             therapy is allowed provided last treatment was given at least 3 weeks prior to first&#xD;
             dose of study drug administration and all toxicities have resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with other investigational anticancer drugs and monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
             is allowed provided the last treatment was given at least 30 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must understand and sign a National Cancer Institute (NCI) pre-screening&#xD;
             consent form and a protocol specific informed consent form prior to receipt of any&#xD;
             study medication or beginning study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of central nervous system (CNS) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing. The effects of MEDI-507 on the developing fetus and the nursing&#xD;
             infant are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of the risk of increased&#xD;
             HIV-associated complications due to increased immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or with antibodies to hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             because the therapy may be associated with increased viral replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic CMV positivity or CMV PCR &gt;1000 copies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with MEDI-507.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of significant adverse events related to previously administered&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug administration or evidence&#xD;
             of intercurrent illnesses including myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             stroke, or transient ischemic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Respiratory insufficiency requiring oxygen therapy or O2 saturation less than 90% by&#xD;
             pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy or other physical or&#xD;
             psychological illnesses that would increase risk to the patient, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any general medical or psychological or behavioral conditions that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, may pose additional risk in administering study drug to the patient&#xD;
             or will not permit the patient to complete the study or sign informed consent.&#xD;
