      This study investigates group medical visits as a quality improvement strategy for&#xD;
      hypertension. It studies group visits in which patients see their own primary care provider&#xD;
      together with other patients who have hypertension. The group visits are intended to enhance&#xD;
      the patient's self-efficacy for self-management of their chronic disease (hypertension).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Many veterans with hypertension have poorly controlled blood pressure (BP); new&#xD;
      strategies for quality improvement are needed. A new model of care delivery, Group Medical&#xD;
      Visits, holds promise as a means to improve blood pressure control by enhancing patients'&#xD;
      self-efficacy for self-management of their chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The overriding goal of this implementation project is to translate research&#xD;
      findings about management of hypertension into practice and thereby to improve patient&#xD;
      outcome, i.e., adequacy of control of BP, in patients with hypertension. Specific objectives&#xD;
      are to develop and implement a model of group medical visits in iterative steps; to evaluate&#xD;
      whether group medical visits improve patient adherence to prescribed antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications and improve BP control; and to assess patient, physician, and health care system&#xD;
      factors involved in successfully making organizational changes to encompass group medical&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study site: primary care clinics at VA Palo Alto. Study Design: staircase design with&#xD;
      2 steps of design/implementation/formative-evaluation/redesign with increasing numbers of&#xD;
      participants, followed by a 3rd step evaluating the final model. Participants: primary care&#xD;
      providers (MDs and RNPs) and their patients with hypertension. Participating primary care&#xD;
      providers (PCPs) are randomly allocated 2:1 Group Visits (GV)intervention:control; patients&#xD;
      of intervention PCPs are also randomly allocated 2:1, yielding 3 study arms (patients of&#xD;
      GV-PCPs enrolled in GVs; patients of GV-PCPs not in GVs, and patients of non-GV-PCPs). This&#xD;
      design allows for comparison between control patients of primary care providers conducting&#xD;
      group visits with primary care providers who do not participate in the group medical&#xD;
      appointment intervention. Intervention: group medical visits of patients with their own PCP.&#xD;
      Group visits include both education and medical care components. Organizational component:&#xD;
      tracking of organizational issues in establishing the program of group visits; interviews&#xD;
      with key stakeholders to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing the new model of&#xD;
      care. Outcome measures: patients' blood pressures (BPs), medication adherence, satisfaction,&#xD;
      and health-related quality of life; PCP satisfaction; qualitative analysis of themes from&#xD;
      interviews for patient, physician, and medical center factors involved in making&#xD;
      organizational changes to encompass group visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings We exceeded the target enrollment for primary care providers (PCPs) with a total of&#xD;
      16 (11 intervention, 5 control). We enrolled 296 patients; 7 had incomplete baseline data&#xD;
      leaving 289 patients: 145 allocated to GVs, 73 control patients of GV-PCPs, and 71 control&#xD;
      patients of control PCPs. We have also enrolled an additional 12 staff members for&#xD;
      interviews, including the one PCP who did not elect to participate. Study arm comparisons&#xD;
      will not be made until the final data collection is complete. In formative evaluations we&#xD;
      found that patient medical needs were met in the group setting and that both patients and&#xD;
      PCPs were satisfied with the GV format. PCPs and patients have requested that the GVs&#xD;
      continue after the study ends. Space for the GVs has been a major barrier particularly in&#xD;
      light of ongoing construction in the clinic building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status We are now in Step 3 with plans to end the intervention phase at the end of March 2006&#xD;
      and complete final data collection soon thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact Group Medical visits are a new model of health care delivery that hold promise for&#xD;
      improving patient access, patient and provider satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects include both health care professionals and their patients. The included health&#xD;
        care professionals are primary care clinicians practicing at VA Palo Alto who have their&#xD;
        own panels of patients for whom they provide primary care. Included patients are patients&#xD;
        of these primary care clinicians; the patients must have a diagnosis of hypertension and at&#xD;
        least one blood pressure in the previous year that was above guideline-target for that&#xD;
        patient, and patient must be approved by the primary care clinician as suitable for a group&#xD;
        medical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Primary care clinicians with very small patient panels (too small for recruitment of&#xD;
        patients for group visits) ae excluded. Patients are excluded by their primary care&#xD;
        clinician using clinical judgment; typical reasons for exclusion include terminal illness,&#xD;
        dementia that would make patient unable to participate in group discussions. Because&#xD;
        primary care clinicians located at main study site do not provide primary care to children,&#xD;
        no children will be included in the sample.&#xD;
