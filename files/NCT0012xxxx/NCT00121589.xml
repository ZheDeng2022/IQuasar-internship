      This study will explore whether taking the vitamins lutein and zeaxanthin, with or without&#xD;
      Omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil or docosahexanoic acid, also known as DHA) will change the&#xD;
      amount of lutein and zeaxanthin in the blood among people with age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (AMD). AMD is one of the leading causes of legal blindness among people over the&#xD;
      age of 50 in developed countries. In the disease, the retina of the eye, the sensory portion,&#xD;
      worsens in condition. AMD causes progressive loss of central vision, with only peripheral&#xD;
      vision remaining, that is, the ability for someone to see from the edges of the eye. To date,&#xD;
      there is not any effective treatment to improve vision for most people whose AMD is advanced.&#xD;
      Yet some data from research studies suggest a possible role of antioxidants, including&#xD;
      lutein, in reducing the risk of AMD and cataracts. Lutein and zeaxanthin belong to the&#xD;
      carotenoid family of vitamins, of which there are more than 600. There are 40 or 50&#xD;
      carotenoids in the typical diet of human beings, but only 14 major dietary ones are&#xD;
      identified in human plasma. Lutein, in particular, is a vitamin that is found naturally in&#xD;
      the retina, especially in the macula, the region of the eye that is essential for fine,&#xD;
      detailed vision. Previous studies have shown that higher levels of foods rich in Omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acid were associated with a lower likelihood of AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 60 and older who may or may not have AMD, who do not have certain other serious&#xD;
      eye disorders, and who have not had potentially life-threatening illness in the last year may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. About 40 people will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a medical history and physical examination. A blood collection of about&#xD;
      4 tablespoons will be done to measure the amount of lutein and other vitamins in the blood.&#xD;
      Patients will have a complete eye examination consisting of procedures standard to those&#xD;
      given by ophthalmologists. Participants will have photographs taken of their eyes, and they&#xD;
      will undergo a visual field test. Flicker photometry also will be conducted. This consists of&#xD;
      the patients looking at a flashing bluish light with one eye at a time, and turning a knob&#xD;
      until the light stops flashing. Then during the test, patients will look away from the light&#xD;
      and turn the knob until the flashing stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study study, patients will be asked to not take more than two tablets each day of&#xD;
      multivitamins that contain lutein. The vitamin supplements will be provided as pills that&#xD;
      represent one of two vitamin regimens given on a random basis: either lutein and zeaxanthin&#xD;
      with DHA or lutein and zeaxanthin without DHA added. The amounts would be 10 mg/day of lutein&#xD;
      and 2 mg/day of zeaxanthin, with or without 1 g/day of DHA. Patients will return to the study&#xD;
      center for follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. During those&#xD;
      visits, some of the examinations done earlier will be repeated so that the researchers can&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of supplements on patients' eyes. Patients will also be watched for&#xD;
      possible side effects from the vitamins supplements. Lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are&#xD;
      considered to be safe with possible minor side effects, such as headaches and difficulty in&#xD;
      swallowing the tablets. Fish oil or DHA supplements may also cause abdominal discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If information obtained from this study may be important for participants' health, they will&#xD;
      be informed when it is available. There are no plans to give participants the results of any&#xD;
      medical tests, evaluations, or other research data. Further research may be necessary before&#xD;
      such results become meaningful.&#xD;

      The current proposed study is a necessary pilot study to prepare for a large-scale phase III&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial planned to investigate whether oral supplementation with macular&#xD;
      xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      (LCPUFAs) will decrease the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) when&#xD;
      compared to placebo. The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      additional oral supplementation of omega-3 LCPUFAs (1 g/day) to daily supplementation of&#xD;
      lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day) will change the plasma levels of lutein and&#xD;
      zeaxanthin in participants over age 60. The secondary objective is to study whether changes&#xD;
      in serum levels of xanthophylls, lutein and zeaxanthin following oral supplementation will&#xD;
      result in changes in the macular pigment density. In this study, forty participants (20&#xD;
      participants per arm) will take the study medications of lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2&#xD;
      mg/day) with or without the omega-3 LCPUFAs (1 g/day) for 6 months and will be followed for a&#xD;
      total of 9 months (the initial 6 months with supplementation and the last 3 months without&#xD;
      supplementation). Participants will range from those with no AMD and little or no drusen in&#xD;
      either eye through advanced AMD (geographic atrophic, retinal pigment epithelial detachment,&#xD;
      or other signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in one eye. AMD severity will be classified&#xD;
      using Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) criteria for the definition of advanced AMD. This&#xD;
      is a preliminary study to be conducted prior to a large-scale phase III randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial of omega -3 LCPUFAs and lutein/zeaxanthin for patients with moderate to high risk of&#xD;
      AMD. The estimates of increases in serum lutein and zeaxanthin levels and the corresponding&#xD;
      changes of macular pigment densities will provide essential information in conducting a large&#xD;
      phase III randomized trial.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will range from those with no AMD and little or no drusen in either eye&#xD;
        through end stage AMD (geographic atrophic, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, or other&#xD;
        signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in one eye. AMD severity will be classified using&#xD;
        AREDS criteria for the definition of advanced AMD. Children are not included because AMD&#xD;
        is, by definition, an adult disease and the study is designed to assess the effect of oral&#xD;
        administration of lutein in persons in the age group affected by AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged 60 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants may have no evidence of AMD with little or no drusen in either&#xD;
             eye, or may have any stage of AMD through end stage (geographic atrophic, retinal&#xD;
             pigment epithelial detachment, or other signs of neovascular/exudative disease) in one&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The ability to understand and sign an informed consent form prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People who currently smoke are eligible to enroll in this study. However, if smokers&#xD;
             take an AREDS-like supplement, they must not take the AREDS-like supplement during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular disease (other than AMD) which confounds assessment of the retina including&#xD;
             diabetic retinopathy, central serous choroidopathy, optic atrophy, retinal vein&#xD;
             occlusion, active uveitis, significant explained or unexplained visual field loss, or&#xD;
             any other type of retinopathy or retinal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic requirement for any systemic or ocular medication for other eye diseases such&#xD;
             as glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of lutein/zeaxanthin of 6 mg or more: during the last 3 months or&#xD;
             currently taking these supplements. The daily use of the new Centrum or Centrum Silver&#xD;
             or other similar multivitamins will be allowed but is limited to a maximum of twice a&#xD;
             day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has regularly taken 1 gm of fish oil (DHA, EPA) during the last 3 months&#xD;
             or currently taking fish oil supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to be followed for the nine-month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute, potentially life-threatening illness such as heart attack in the last year, or&#xD;
             malignancy or blood disease not in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of lung cancer.&#xD;
