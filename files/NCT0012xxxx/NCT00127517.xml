      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with advanced cancers who receive&#xD;
      AVR118 solution for injection into the skin can achieve improvement in quality of life. Based&#xD;
      on a study in patients with AIDS, possible benefits may include improved appetite and&#xD;
      strength; weight gain; improved mood; and decreased fatigue. For the first three weeks, some&#xD;
      patients receive AVR118, and others receive placebo (an injection expected to have no&#xD;
      benefits). After three weeks, all patients will be offered the opportunity to take injections&#xD;
      of AVR118.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced cancers are usually debilitating. There are few treatments available for symptoms of&#xD;
      advanced cancers like loss of appetite, decreased strength, fatigue, and change in mood. A&#xD;
      Phase II, double blind study comparing treatment with AVR118 to placebo, followed by an open&#xD;
      label phase treating all patients with AVR118, will enable the Sponsor to gather data on&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of AVR118 in this patient population. Patients aged 18-80 with advanced&#xD;
      cancers (excluding central nervous system [CNS] cancers) who are not receiving chemotherapy,&#xD;
      or who are receiving single agent, third line (or beyond) chemotherapy, may be eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
