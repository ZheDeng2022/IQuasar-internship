      This study is a prospective follow-up study to the Dose-Response to Exercise in Women (DREW)&#xD;
      study. In DREW, 450 overweight, sedentary postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either a non-exercise control group or to 1 of 3 weekly physical activity groups. The DREW&#xD;
      study is evaluating the dose-response of exercise training in regard to changes in multiple&#xD;
      cardiac risk factors. This study will measure diastolic heart function in a subset of the&#xD;
      DREW population in order to examine the relationship between dose response, changes in&#xD;
      physical activity, and diastolic function. Diastolic heart function will be assessed using&#xD;
      both traditional and novel echocardiographic measures.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) has become the number one reason for hospitalization in the&#xD;
      United States. Diastolic heart dysfunction is becoming increasingly recognized as a&#xD;
      significant factor in the etiology of CHF. Of the total affected population, 70% of patients&#xD;
      with diastolic heart failure are female, the majority of which are elderly. There is&#xD;
      currently no effective pharmacological therapy for the treatment of diastolic heart&#xD;
      dysfunction. Existing cross-sectional studies and limited training trials supporting the&#xD;
      hypothesis that exercise may improve diastolic function have only studied men. There is a&#xD;
      need for more properly controlled and adequately powered studies examining the effect of&#xD;
      exercise training on diastolic function, particularly in populations at high risk for CHF,&#xD;
      such as sedentary, postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 215 sedentary, postmenopausal women at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive either exercise training or no exercise for six months.&#xD;
      This study will measure diastolic heart function using novel echocardiographic measurements,&#xD;
      such as pulmonary vein flow pattern, tissue Doppler, and color M-mode mitral inflow&#xD;
      propagation velocity. The study will also measure the left ventricular mass.&#xD;
