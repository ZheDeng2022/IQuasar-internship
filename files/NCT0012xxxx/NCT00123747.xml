  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At this time, computed tomography (CT) is the standard tool used at this institution for the&#xD;
      staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For most patients, treatment planning for&#xD;
      NSCLC is performed with the patient breathing freely during CT scanning. However, recent&#xD;
      research has demonstrated that, by holding one's breath briefly, the NSCLC tumor mass can be&#xD;
      held motionless. As a result, the tissue to be treated is better pinpointed and the area&#xD;
      treated is significantly decreased through breath-hold planning. This allows for a higher&#xD;
      dose of radiation to be given to the cancer. PET scanning is a promising newer imaging&#xD;
      modality which has shown to be useful in staging NSCLC. This study hypothesizes that&#xD;
      breath-held PET scanning and breath held-CT scanning will allow for more stringent&#xD;
      radiotherapy plans, minimizing normal tissue toxicity, as well as potentially increasing the&#xD;
      dose deliverable to the primary tumor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemotherapy and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), using&#xD;
      computed-tomography (CT) simulation, is the current standard approach in the treatment of&#xD;
      inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite such therapeutic benefit, local&#xD;
      recurrence nonetheless remains a significant impediment to cure. Attempts to improve the&#xD;
      accuracy of CT-scanning in radiotherapy treatment planning have been increasingly studied.&#xD;
      One such approach is the attempted correlation of CT imaging temporally with the physiologic&#xD;
      breathing cycle, a process known as gating. By imaging the tumor only when the tumor is&#xD;
      immobilized, gating effectively eliminates the effect of motion, thus leading to typically&#xD;
      smaller visible tumor masses and the loss of motion-induced distortions. Lung-tumor&#xD;
      immobilization using self-gated breath-holding at extremes of inspiration has been validated&#xD;
      clinically, and is associated with improved lung-outcome predictors and normal tissue&#xD;
      complication probability overall. Several recent studies have demonstrated PET to be both&#xD;
      highly sensitive and moderately to highly specific in the staging of NSCLC, and even more&#xD;
      sensitive and specific than CT-scanning in the detection of mediastinal and distant&#xD;
      metastases from NSCLC. The co-registration of CT and PET images enables even greater accuracy&#xD;
      than either modality alone, while the functional imaging inherent in PET may better&#xD;
      facilitate the distinction between benign and malignant structures. Overall, the superior&#xD;
      tumor staging capability of PET (or PET-CT fusion) together with the improved dosimetry &amp;&#xD;
      diminished normal-tissue toxicity associated with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is&#xD;
      expected to confer considerable clinical advantage to the use of gated PET in the&#xD;
      radiotherapeutic planning and treatment of NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to define the effect of respiratory-gating on PET-based radiotherapy&#xD;
      planning in comparison to the free-breathing condition for patients with NSCLC. The endpoints&#xD;
      here will be to quantify the variation of both PTV and normal-tissue complication probability&#xD;
      (NTCP) for certain relevant organs (lung, esophagus, heart) via a direct analysis of&#xD;
      calculated volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to identify the correlation between PET-based radiotherapy planning&#xD;
      volumes and CT-based planning volumes for respiratory-gated patients with NSCLC. The endpoint&#xD;
      for this objective will be to quantify the breath-held, PET-based PTVs and NTCPs in&#xD;
      comparison to the breath-held, CT-based PTVs and NTCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consider patients with locally advanced non-small-cell cancer of the lung&#xD;
      (NSCLC) who are eligible for radical (i.e. with curative intent) combined-modality therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will be accrued from the new patient lung clinic at the Cross Cancer Institute.&#xD;
      Following a complete clinical assessment comprising a thorough history and physical&#xD;
      examination, a thorough analysis of all available imaging, a consideration of all available&#xD;
      laboratory results and consideration of any ancillary test results (e.g. pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing), a decision will be made whether or not to offer a patient radical therapy. In the&#xD;
      case of any uncertainties, further tests, such as repeat CT scanning or diagnostic PET&#xD;
      scanning may be arranged to define eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically-proven, unresected lung cancer of the following histologic types:&#xD;
           *squamous cell carcinoma, *adenocarcinoma, *undifferentiated large cell carcinoma,&#xD;
           *non-small cell, not otherwise specified (NOS, diagnosis on cytology alone)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AJC Stage I-III disease (if all detectable tumor can be encompassed by radiation therapy&#xD;
           fields, including both the primary tumor and the involved regional lymph nodes);&#xD;
           patients with positive supraclavicular nodes (N3) are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt; 18 and Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurable disease on the CT and PET images&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must be deemed eligible for radical combined-modality therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients must sign a study-specific informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ineligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M1 disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky performance status &lt; 70 and age &lt; 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have undergone complete tumor resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with post-resection intrathoracic tumor recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of small cell histology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior or concurrent malignancy except non-melanomatous skin cancer (unless disease-free&#xD;
           for at least 5 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior radiotherapy to the thorax or neck&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with myocardial infarction within the preceding 6 months or symptomatic heart&#xD;
           disease, including angina, congestive heart failure and uncontrolled arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women; patients with childbearing potential must practice appropriate&#xD;
           contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to maintain a state of deep inspiratory breath-hold for a minimum length of&#xD;
           time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: In a previous study comparing DIBH-gated CT-scanning to free-breathing&#xD;
      CT-scanning performed at this institution, it was found that a sample size of 10 patients was&#xD;
      appropriate to illustrate both a statistically significant reduction in PTV and a&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction in V20 (the volume of lung treated to a dose of =20Gy).&#xD;
      For the current study, given that the patient population is essentially the same as the last&#xD;
      one, and the fact that PET and CT are comparable imaging modalities for NSCLC in terms of&#xD;
      their sensitivity, a total sample size of 10 patients would be an appropriate number to&#xD;
      assess the difference between breath-held PET and free-breathing PET (i.e. the first&#xD;
      objective). This difference, in terms of both PTV and NTCP, will be assessed for statistical&#xD;
      significance with a paired Student's t-test.&#xD;
