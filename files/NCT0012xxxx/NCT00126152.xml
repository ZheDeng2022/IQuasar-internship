      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a best practice model for&#xD;
      senior falls prevention when implemented in a community setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure differences in the incidence of falls and fall risk factors among&#xD;
      subjects assigned to an intervention group and a control group. Subjects in the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive a multi-faceted intervention based on best practices. Subjects in the&#xD;
      control group will receive written fall prevention education materials. Fall monitoring will&#xD;
      be conducted for subjects in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific components of the intervention will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an individual fall risk assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exercise with balance and strength training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  education on how to reduce falls and fall risk factors; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recommendations for medical care management of identified fall risk factors.&#xD;
