  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reducing the increase in plasma&#xD;
      homocysteine concentrations following an oral methionine load affects vascular function in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, irrespective of the homocysteine-lowering agent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high plasma homocysteine is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death.&#xD;
      However, it remains uncertain whether homocysteine per se, low status of folate, or other&#xD;
      factors related to methionine metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Previous studies have shown that a high concentration of homocysteine in blood is&#xD;
      related to an impaired vascular function in the arteries, an indicator of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk. Virtually all intervention trials used folic acid as a homocysteine-lowering&#xD;
      agent, which may however affect vascular function through mechanisms not related to&#xD;
      homocysteine. The researchers investigated whether reduction in homocysteine concentrations&#xD;
      following a methionine load, via supplementation with serine, betaine or folic acid improves&#xD;
      vascular function in healthy volunteers, in order to distinguish between effects of folic&#xD;
      acid and of homocysteine-lowering per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: The effects of supplementation with serine, folic acid and betaine (all together&#xD;
      with an oral methionine load) were compared to the effects of a placebo (together with a&#xD;
      methionine load) on plasma homocysteine concentrations and on vascular function following&#xD;
      methionine loading in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
