    <textblock>
      This is a dose-seeking study that will test the safety of increasing doses of Rexin-G, given&#xD;
      intravenously, in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy. Rexin-G is a tumor-targeted gene therapy vector that contains a&#xD;
      &quot;killer&quot; gene that blocks the action of the human cyclin G1 gene. Cyclin G1 is a cell cycle&#xD;
      control element that plays an important role in cancer growth. When injected into a vein, the&#xD;
      Rexin-GTM vector seeks out and accumulates in cancerous tumors, therefore, increasing the&#xD;
      concentration of the drug in the cancerous tumors and not in normal neighbouring organs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Every&#xD;
      year, about 30,000 new patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and most will die&#xD;
      within the year. The few patients that live beyond one year are those who have operable&#xD;
      tumors whose cancer has not spread beyond the pancreas. There is no effective treatment for&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that impacts survival beyond a few more months. Therefore, innovative&#xD;
      treatments are urgently needed. A number of experimental therapies are currently under&#xD;
      investigation, and gene therapy is a viable therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A gene called cyclin G1 has been shown to play a very important part in cancer growth. In&#xD;
      animal experiments, when this cyclin G1 gene is blocked, the cancer cells grow much slower or&#xD;
      even die. This study will test the drug, Rexin-G, which contains a gene that works by getting&#xD;
      rid of the cyclin G1 gene. The new gene will get into the tumor cells using a &quot;vehicle&quot; to&#xD;
      carry it into the cells. The &quot;vehicle&quot; that will be used is a virus that has been changed so&#xD;
      that it is not likely to cause disease. This &quot;vehicle&quot; is called a vector. When injected into&#xD;
      a vein, the Rexin-G vector is designed to seek out and accumulate in cancerous tumors,&#xD;
      therefore, increasing the concentration of the drug in the area of the cancer and not in&#xD;
      normal neighbouring organs. When the killer gene gets into the cancer cell, it becomes part&#xD;
      of the cell's genes and tells the cancer cell to begin using the new gene instead of the&#xD;
      cyclin G1 gene. It is hoped that the Rexin-G will arrest the growth of the cancer or&#xD;
      eradicate the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the study are to determine how much Rexin-G can be given to a patient, to assess&#xD;
      how long Rexin-G stays in the body when injected into a vein, and if the drug would cause&#xD;
      antibodies to form, transfer the gene to normal tissues or pass on the gene to another person&#xD;
      or the person's offspring. The final goal is to determine if the Rexin-G vector can shrink&#xD;
      the tumor by comparing the size of the tumor nodules measured by CT scan or MRI before and&#xD;
      after the Rexin-G treatment.&#xD;
