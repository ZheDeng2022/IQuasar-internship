    <textblock>
      Breast cancer affects many women. One of the places to which it can spread is the lymph&#xD;
      glands under the arm. The type of treatment offered to patients often will depend on whether&#xD;
      those lymph glands have cancer in them or not. For this reason, a standard recommendation is&#xD;
      that women with breast cancer have these lymph glands removed with surgery. This cancer&#xD;
      causes side effects including numbness, pain, decreased ability to move the arm and arm&#xD;
      swelling. A new type of surgery which looks only at the first gland that a cancer drains to&#xD;
      (sentinel node biopsy) may help to avoid having to remove the glands under the arm. Also, a&#xD;
      new way of imaging the glands under the arm called Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scanning may also give a better idea of the chance that these glands have cancer in them.&#xD;
      This study is determining whether PET scans before surgery and sentinel node biopsy can&#xD;
      decrease the need for a complete axillary dissection.&#xD;

      1.0 Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in North American women. It is estimated that one in&#xD;
      8 American women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime. Surgical treatment has&#xD;
      evolved from radical mastectomy to breast conservation, and systemic treatment has become&#xD;
      increasingly important. The presence or absence of lymph node metastases is the most&#xD;
      important prognostic factor used to determine type of systemic treatment necessary. Axillary&#xD;
      dissection however, carries with it the risk of nerve injury, lymphedema, decreased arm&#xD;
      motion and seroma formation. Clinical examination, ultrasound, CT scanning and MRI of the&#xD;
      axilla are not sensitive or specific enough to eliminate the need for axillary dissection.&#xD;
      Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) can predict the pathologic status of the axilla and theoretically&#xD;
      could differentiate patients into those with positive node biopsies who require full&#xD;
      dissection versus those who are negative and do not. Frozen section of the sentinel node is&#xD;
      inaccurate and therefore SNB positive patients would require two surgical procedures.&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning of the axilla has been reported to have a high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity and if used prior to surgery may guide the surgeon in determining&#xD;
      the need for full axillary dissection versus SNB alone. PET scanning has also been reported&#xD;
      to identify unsuspected distant metastases not found on standard staging examinations. This&#xD;
      study will investigate the use of PET scanning in conjunction with SNB and results of both&#xD;
      modalities will be correlated with histologic results of axillary dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no reports describing results of a similar study. By performing a properly&#xD;
      constructed clinical trial in T1 - 3 N0 breast cancer patients, the question of whether PET&#xD;
      scanning will make a difference to patient management can be answered. The hypothesis of this&#xD;
      study is therefore, that a PET scan prior to surgery will facilitate staging both locally&#xD;
      (axilla) and distant and will help the surgeon determine whether to do SNB or axillary&#xD;
      dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Primary Objective: To determine whether preoperative PET imaging combined with sentinel&#xD;
      node biopsy can accurately identify nodal status. This would be most important in patients&#xD;
      with a negative PET scan and negative sentinel nodes. If the combination of these tests was&#xD;
      found to have a high negative predictive value for nodal metastases, full axillary dissection&#xD;
      could be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess pattern of lymph node drainage using lymphoscintigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of size limitations of PET scanning in metastatic lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of primary tumor size and evidence of multifocality as compared to&#xD;
           preoperative imaging (mammography +/- ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of unsuspected distant metastases and frequency with which treatment was&#xD;
           changed as a result of the PET scan would also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Patient Population: Pre and post menopausal women with clinical T1-3 N0 breast cancer are&#xD;
      eligible. All will have biopsy proven breast carcinoma. Positive core or fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsies will be obtained in all patients. Core biopsies are preferred. Excisional&#xD;
      biopsies are not allowed. Patients must not be pregnant or lactating and must not have had&#xD;
      prior malignancy. Diabetic patients are ineligible. An informal survey of 8 patients from&#xD;
      Calgary indicates that all 8 would be willing to travel to Edmonton for their PET scan.&#xD;
      (Personal communication from Dr. Mews).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Preoperative Imaging: All patients will have preoperative mammography +/- ultrasound of&#xD;
      the breast. Patients eligible for and consenting to the study will be referred to the Cross&#xD;
      Cancer Institute by their surgeons and will have preoperative PET scanning. Imaging will be&#xD;
      completed within seven days prior to surgery. Once a PET scanner becomes available in&#xD;
      Calgary, the scans will be done there. Potential sites of distant metastases identified by&#xD;
      PET scan will be imaged further and if necessary, possible biopsies will be obtained to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Surgery: Dr. Kelly Dabbs from Edmonton and Dr. Daphne Mew from Calgary will be the&#xD;
      surgeons involved. They have proven experience in doing SNB's. At the time of surgery,&#xD;
      sentinel node biopsy using both blue dye and colloid will be performed followed by level I/II&#xD;
      axillary dissection. The patients may have either segmental resection or mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Pathology: The sentinel node will be assessed by H&amp;E as well as immunohistochemistry as&#xD;
      per standard protocol. Measurements of primary tumor size, size of axillary metastases and&#xD;
      size of in situ component will be documented. All pathology will be reported by Dr. J.&#xD;
      Danyluk, Dr. R. Berendt and Dr. F. Alexander.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Outcome Analysis: Patients with positive axillary nodes on dissection and positive SNB&#xD;
      and/or PET will be considered true positive (TP) for that modality. A negative axillary&#xD;
      dissection and negative PET and/or SNB will identify the true negative (TN) group. A positive&#xD;
      axillary dissection and negative PET and/or SNB will identify the false negative (FN)&#xD;
      subgroup. A negative axillary dissection and positive PET and/or SNB will identify the false&#xD;
      positive (FP) subgroup. Sensitivity (TP/TP + FN) and specificity (TN/TN + FP) will be&#xD;
      determined. If patients do not have successful sentinel node surgery or PET scanning, they&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis of the individual modality which was successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Statistics: In order to have an adequate number of node positive patients to test&#xD;
      sensitivity an overall total of 240 patients is required. The proportion of patients who are&#xD;
      node positive is estimated to be 0.35. A sample of 240 is expected to contain 84 node&#xD;
      positive patients and the probability that at least 72 of the 240 patients are node positive&#xD;
      is 0.95. The subsample of 72 node positive patients is sufficient to perform a one-sided test&#xD;
      of equivalence for a target sensitivity of 0.80 and an allowable difference of 0.10 with&#xD;
      significance level of 10% and power of 80%.The 168 node negative patients from the 240 total&#xD;
      permit a one-sided test of equivalence for which the target specificity is 0.95 and the&#xD;
      allowable difference is 0.05 with significance level of 5% and power of 90%.43&#xD;
