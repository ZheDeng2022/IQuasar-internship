      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the use of a series of the Anodyne&#xD;
      Therapy System in-home treatments over a 90-day period will improve peripheral sensation and&#xD;
      quality of life in persons with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The morbidity, direct cost and mortality associated with lower extremity complications among&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus have been well described in the medical literature.&#xD;
      Peripheral sensory neuropathy is one of the strongest risk factors for both foot ulceration&#xD;
      and amputation in this population. In the absence of neuropathy people rarely develop foot&#xD;
      ulcers. Because of the lack of painful feedback, peripheral neuropathy provides a permissive&#xD;
      environment that allows repetitive tissue injury to occur such that a person may wear a hole&#xD;
      in the bottom of his or her foot much in the way that he or she may wear a hole in a&#xD;
      stocking. Certainly, the early detection of a level of peripheral neuropathy sufficient to&#xD;
      contribute to the development of foot wounds or &quot;loss of protective sensation&quot; is one of the&#xD;
      most important criteria to identify high risk patients for foot complications and is&#xD;
      paramount when instituting a structured treatment plan to prevent lower extremity&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of the application of a series of&#xD;
      Anodyne in-home treatments over a 90-day period to improve peripheral sensation and&#xD;
      self-reported quality of life in persons with diabetes mellitus. This pilot study should&#xD;
      provide preliminary data to determine if additional clinical evaluation is warranted and to&#xD;
      determine an appropriate sample size. The hypothesis is the Anodyne therapy will improve&#xD;
      sensory function over the course of therapy compared to sham therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with diabetes mellitus and peripheral sensory neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects at least 25 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vibration perception threshold (VPT) ≥ 20 volts and ≤ 45 volts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be alert, oriented, mentally competent and able to understand and comply&#xD;
             with the requirements of the study, and provide voluntary informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to complete the required study visits and record&#xD;
             treatment activity in the study logbook.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a VPT &lt;20 or &gt; 45 volts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension greater than 180 systolic or greater than 110&#xD;
             diastolic as determined by enrollment questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are likely to become pregnant during&#xD;
             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active malignancy (including basal cell carcinoma) on the lower&#xD;
             extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had prior reconstructive or replacement knee surgery with&#xD;
             neurological deficits related to the surgery. ( If the patient has had knee surgery,&#xD;
             their neuropathy appears to be uniform and bilateral, then they can be included in the&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of previous back surgery, spinal stenosis, or spinal&#xD;
             compression or radiculopathy with neurological deficits related to spinal cord&#xD;
             pathology. ( If the patient has had back surgery, their neuropathy appears to be&#xD;
             uniform and bilateral, then they can be included in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are non-ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of neuromuscular disease, leprosy, chronic alcoholism, or&#xD;
             sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with foot ulcerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a transmetatarsal amputation or higher&#xD;
