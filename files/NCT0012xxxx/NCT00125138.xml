      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three target doses of&#xD;
      melperone compared to placebo in the treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 20 investigational sites in the United&#xD;
      States (U.S.) and 15 Ex-US sites. The maximum study duration will be 10 weeks. Subjects will&#xD;
      have the option of continuing in an open-label extension study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by&#xD;
      bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and abnormal posture and gait. Many patients can have mild to&#xD;
      moderate symptoms, while others with advanced disease have symptoms which interfere with&#xD;
      activities of daily living to a severe degree. Although effective in addressing motor&#xD;
      dysfunction, long-term use of anti-Parkinsonian agents has been implicated as a component in&#xD;
      the development of psychiatric side effects including psychosis. Treatment of psychosis with&#xD;
      typical antipsychotics is not recommended in this patient population, since even low potency&#xD;
      typical antipsychotics can cause marked exacerbations of parkinsonism in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      patients. The use of atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone and quetiapine)&#xD;
      has shown some efficacy in the treatment of psychosis in PD patients. Melperone is classified&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic. European experience with melperone spans more than 30 years, and it&#xD;
      encompasses an established antipsychotic efficacy profile in the treatment of confusion,&#xD;
      anxiety, unrest (particularly in the elderly) and schizophrenia as well as a favorable safety&#xD;
      and tolerability profile. Eligible subjects with Parkinson's disease psychosis will&#xD;
      participate in a 1-2 week Screening/Washout Period, a 5 week Titration Phase (one of three&#xD;
      doses of melperone or placebo), a 1 week Maintenance Phase and a Taper/Follow-up Period up to&#xD;
      2 weeks. Following the Day 43 assessment, subjects may be given the option of receiving&#xD;
      melperone in an open-label extension study.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited from July 2005 to December 2007. Investigator sites were hospitals, research centers, movement disorder centers, and neurology centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects entered the Screening/Washout Period (for all previous antipsychotic medications) for a maximum of 2 weeks. On Day 1, the criteria for Randomization were reviewed by the investigator and psychiatric, motor function, and safety assessments were performed. Subjects who qualified on Day 1 were randomized to receive melperone or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>
