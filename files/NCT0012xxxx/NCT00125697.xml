    <textblock>
      Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite aggressive&#xD;
      therapy, less than 40% of these patients are expected to live beyond 5 years. The radiologic&#xD;
      imaging of these tumors relies on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) - these studies provide good anatomical information about the size and location of the&#xD;
      tumor, but are unable to evaluate whether the tumor is still viable or contains metabolic&#xD;
      activity, after surgery and, in particular, radiotherapy (RT). This complicates accurate&#xD;
      understanding of the status of the tumor during a patient's follow-up. This study proposes to&#xD;
      add magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a non-invasive imaging method which can monitor&#xD;
      metabolic changes in the tumor, to regular imaging. Understanding the changes that occur in a&#xD;
      tumor over the course of radiotherapy could help predict how well a treatment might work, and&#xD;
      could also be useful in distinguishing a return of the tumor in an area of radiation damage&#xD;
      before it would be obvious on regular imaging.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite aggressive&#xD;
      therapy, less than 40% of these patients are expected to live beyond 5 years. External beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy following maximal surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for this group&#xD;
      of patients. Recent intensification of local therapy with focused radiotherapy planning has&#xD;
      resulted in successful escalation of dose. Further improvement in the therapeutic index of&#xD;
      therapy is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologic characterization of glial tumors relies predominantly on CT and MRI images; these&#xD;
      studies provide good anatomic information regarding the size and location of the tumor, as&#xD;
      well as surrounding structures, but are unable to evaluate viability or proliferative&#xD;
      activity of tumors. Thus, the enhancing lesion on CT or MRI may not correspond precisely to&#xD;
      areas of viable tumor, especially after surgery and radiotherapy. Also, because contrast&#xD;
      enhanced MRI relies on regions of blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, it is not tumor&#xD;
      specific, thus non-neoplastic processes may lead to findings similar to disease progression.&#xD;
      This phenomenon can make conventional radiologic follow-up difficult in patients who have&#xD;
      received radiotherapy, as such imaging techniques are limited in their ability to discern&#xD;
      radiotherapy effect and necrosis from recurrence and progression. Finally, because they do&#xD;
      not discriminate viable tumor, CT and MRI are of limited usefulness in assessing response to&#xD;
      therapy, and are unable to effectively predict outcome. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)&#xD;
      is a relatively new technology which may be able to address these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the changes that occur in tumor related&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) spectra over the course of radical radiotherapy for malignant glioma.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the study will be to identify characteristic evolving metabolite&#xD;
      patterns on MRSI, before, during, and after radiotherapy that correlate with overall&#xD;
      survival, and progression-free survival in high grade gliomas. Secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      involve correlation of MRSI metabolite patterns with time to progression and Karnofsky&#xD;
      performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be older than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have histologically proven malignant glioma of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have bi-directionally measurable enhancing residual disease by T1 weighted&#xD;
           image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be willing to undergo high dose radiotherapy to the brain for the&#xD;
           treatment of their glial tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient or legally authorized representative must fully understand all elements of&#xD;
           informed consent, and sign the consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ineligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ineligibility criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of previous RT to the head and neck region&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of lupus, scleroderma or RT hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-existing medical condition precluding radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric conditions precluding informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical or psychiatric conditions precluding MR studies (eg. pacemaker, aneurysm clips,&#xD;
           neuro stimulator, cochlear implant, severe claustrophobia/anxiety)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for study participation at the time of their initial radiation&#xD;
      oncology consultation in the outpatient department of the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI).&#xD;
      Patients who wish to participate, and satisfy the eligibility and exclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      required to review and sign the consent form at that time. Patients will then undergo regular&#xD;
      staging investigations, construction of an immobilizing shell, treatment planning MRI, and CT&#xD;
      simulation. These studies are typically completed 2 weeks after the initial consult.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy will commence approximately 3-4 weeks after the initial consult. At week 0 of&#xD;
      RT, prior to beginning therapy, the patient will undergo the baseline MRS. The mid-RT MRS&#xD;
      study will be performed during week 4 of RT. The post therapy scan will take place 2 months&#xD;
      post-therapy. From then on, patients will be seen in clinic every 2-4 months for follow-up,&#xD;
      and will undergo MRI and MRS scans with each visit for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The height of each MRS metabolite peak will be measured from voxels within the enhancing MRI&#xD;
      lesion and from voxels in normal brain for each patient. Relative metabolite values&#xD;
      (normalized to the value in normal brain) will then be generated, as well as relative&#xD;
      metabolite ratios (eg. relative choline/relative NAA) for each time point (week 0, week 4,&#xD;
      and post-RT, at follow-up). For each patient, the relative metabolite levels (and ratios)&#xD;
      will be plotted over time. Patients will then be partitioned into groups, based on similar&#xD;
      evolving MRS pattern. For each of the groups, curves of survival and disease free progression&#xD;
      will be generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The curves will be analyzed for statistical&#xD;
      significance by the log-rank method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to accrue 30 patients for the present study. They are confident 30&#xD;
      patients will be sufficient to generate statistically significant results. In a study of the&#xD;
      effects of brain tumor radiotherapy on normal brain as imaged by NMR spectroscopy, Urtasun et&#xD;
      al were able to find statistically significant metabolite changes on proton MRS images with&#xD;
      only 10 patients. In addition, the data to be utilized in the retrospective aspect of the&#xD;
      study contains information on approximately 30 patients and their MRS scans. The trends found&#xD;
      in this data will be used to guide data analysis for the prospective study. Finally, given&#xD;
      the relative distribution and frequency of histologies seen in the new patient CNS clinic at&#xD;
      the CCI, the investigators feel the target accrual of 30 patients is feasible within the time&#xD;
      restraints of the project.&#xD;
