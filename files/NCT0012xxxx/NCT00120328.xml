  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether avosentan (SPP301) is effective in&#xD;
      decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the&#xD;
      western world, accounting for approximately 40% of new cases in the US, and up to 20 to 30%&#xD;
      in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for diabetic nephropathy usually try to deal with the underlying diabetes&#xD;
      or they aim to reduce cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      smoking and dyslipidemia. A few recently approved drugs such as irbesartan and losartan (for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic nephropathy) have a renoprotective activity beyond their antihypertensive&#xD;
      effect. However, morbidity and mortality rates remain high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avosentan may have a positive effect on reducing the amount of protein lost in the urine and&#xD;
      if this is the case it will help treat patients with diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
