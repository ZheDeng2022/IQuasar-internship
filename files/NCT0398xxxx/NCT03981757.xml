      1. Title of the Research Project： Study of Regional cerebral Oxygenation and Brain Blood&#xD;
           Volume change during Carotid Endarterectomy using the NeurOS system (COBBV-CE Trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background/Problem Statement: The use of regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) monitoring&#xD;
           has grown clinically, even becoming the standard of care in some institutions.&#xD;
           Monitoring of intracranial tissue oxygenation is fundamentally possible because light in&#xD;
           the near infrared spectrum (700-900nm) penetrates bone, muscle, and other tissue.&#xD;
           Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have distinct peak absorption spectra, but there is an&#xD;
           isobestic wavelength (i.e., wavelength for which the peak absorption of light is similar&#xD;
           for oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, approximately 810nm) for absorption by total&#xD;
           hemoglobin. Determination of rScO2 thus is possible with transmission of just 2&#xD;
           wavelengths of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the relative&#xD;
           concentrations of oxyhemoglobin versus total hemoglobin. A decrease in rSO2 from&#xD;
           baseline &gt;20% or an absolute rSO2 value &lt;50% often is reported in clinical investigation&#xD;
           as representing a clinically meaningful reduction or &quot;desaturation.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral autoregulation was found to be impaired in carotid stenosis patients. Recent&#xD;
      research found that NIRS allows continuous non-invasive monitoring of cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
      during CEA, with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity in predicting cerebral ischemia&#xD;
      and the need for shunting, which makes it an attractive alternative to stump pressure.&#xD;
      Regional cerebral oxygenation provides a clinically acceptable surrogate of cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow (CBF) for clinical autoregulation monitoring. Monitoring CBF autoregulation with rSO2&#xD;
      has many clinically attractive features, including the following: It is noninvasive,&#xD;
      monitoring requires little caregiver intervention, and it has sufficient resolution to&#xD;
      discriminate the lower autoregulatory threshold to prevent brain ischemia. On the other hand,&#xD;
      simply raising mean blood pressure targets, however, may not necessarily be beneficial&#xD;
      because for some individuals this may result in blood pressure above the upper limit of&#xD;
      autoregulation, which potentially could lead to cerebral hyperperfusion, increasing cerebral&#xD;
      embolic load and/or enhancing cerebral edema in the setting of systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      to cardiac surgery. Individualizing blood pressure during CPB based on physiological&#xD;
      endpoints such as rSO2 monitoring, rather than empiric targets, may provide a means for&#xD;
      modifying the risk for renal injury and major organ morbidity and possibly mortality. In&#xD;
      patients undergoing combined CEA and CABG surgery, it was found that the utility of NIRS&#xD;
      could compliment patient selection for CEA as well as for individual patient management&#xD;
      during. The brain blood volume changes during CEA has not been defined and would be&#xD;
      significantly reduced by carotid artery clamping during CEA. Abnormalities of the circle of&#xD;
      Willis would contribute to reduced brain blood volume. The combination of rSO2 and cerebral&#xD;
      blood volume would be very helpful to prevent mal-perfusion of either side of the brain.&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium could happen after CEA due to reperfusion of the previously ischemic&#xD;
      regions of the brain, regulation of cerebral blood volume after CEA would also prove&#xD;
      beneficial to prevent postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statement: Disposable rSO2 sensors are costly and is becoming a rate limiting factor&#xD;
      hindering its widespread clinical use. Reusable sensors like NeurOS cerebral oximetry are&#xD;
      only a fraction of cost with similar performances in healthy volunteers. We will use NeurOS&#xD;
      in accordance with its approved labeling and indications by FDA. CEA surgery has significant&#xD;
      variations and great clinical importance of cerebral oxygenation during different stages of&#xD;
      surgery. Blood volume changes before, during and after CEA have not been studied previously&#xD;
      and could provide critical information to prevent postoperative cognitive changes. The NeurOS&#xD;
      system calculates the sum of attenuation of two wavelengths to provide brain blood volume&#xD;
      index (BVI) continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting for carotid endarterectomy face two challenges during surgery. First, how&#xD;
      to protect the brain when the carotid artery is clamped, meaning no blood flow to that side&#xD;
      of the brain from this carotid artery. Second, how to prevent hyperemia when the carotid&#xD;
      artery is open and might provide too much blood flow to the brain. Our aim is to study the&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume changes during carotid endarterectomy and&#xD;
      identify whether they are related to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the cerebral oxygenation changes with NeurOS system and correlate desaturation&#xD;
           with outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the brain blood volume changes during CEA surgery and correlate with clinical&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study Design/Methodology: Patients will have NeurOS pads placed on their foreheads.&#xD;
      Continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume&#xD;
      index for the whole length of surgery will be recorded and saved in a USB drive for retrieval&#xD;
      and analysis. Key point data include: Baseline, Anesthesia Induction, Incision, Carotid&#xD;
      Clamping, Clamp Release and Skin Closure. These key points data will be extracted for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Sample selection and size: 100 consecutive carotid endarterectomy patients at Jewish&#xD;
           Hospital, Louisville, KY (6 months to recruit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Describe the proposed intervention: Apply the single use NeurOS cerebral oximetry&#xD;
           sensor adhesive onto patients' forehead who are going to have CEA surgery in the&#xD;
           operating room before anesthesia induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Data collection procedures, instruments used, and methods for data quality control:&#xD;
           Anesthesia providers (attending anesthesiologists, residents and CRNAs) provide routine&#xD;
           anesthesia care for CEA surgery. NeurOS rSO2 reading are automatically recorded in the&#xD;
           VO200-NeurOS Cerebral Oximetry Monitor and the INOVS Monitor respectively. Significant&#xD;
           events (Baseline, Anesthesia Induction, Incision, Carotid Clamping, Clamp Release and&#xD;
           Skin Closure) will be marked manually by the anesthesia providers in the NeurOS system.&#xD;
           Brain blood volume index will be automatically recorded and retracted from the NeurOS&#xD;
           system once surgery is over. All data will be downloaded from the system into an&#xD;
           encrypted USB drive for storage and analysis. Data quality control will be ensured by&#xD;
           the individual system alarms for poor signals and be corrected by anesthesia providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Unit of analysis and observation: Cerebral Oxygenation in percentage of oxyhemoglobin.&#xD;
           Brain blood volume index in the sum of attenuation of two wavelengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Subject Recruitment Methods: All patients presenting to Jewish Hospital for CEA surgery&#xD;
      will be contacted for potential recruitment on the day of surgery in the preoperative area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Informed Consent Process/Complete Waiver Process: Informed consent will be provided to all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all consented patients, baseline cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume index will be&#xD;
      obtained at room air or baseline oxygen requirement level in the NeurOS systems. Both NeurOS&#xD;
      rSO2 and brain blood volume indexes will be continuously recorded and saved in the respective&#xD;
      system throughout the whole CEA surgery. General anesthesia will be induced by using O2&#xD;
      administered via face mask and IV fentanyl 1μg/ kg, propofol 2-3mg/kg and rocuronium 1mg/kg.&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with inhaled isoflurane in air/oxygen mixture and&#xD;
      muscle relaxation using intermittent boluses of rocuronium. Fentanyl will be used as&#xD;
      supplemental analgesia. Normocapnic ventilation was maintained. Upon completion of surgery,&#xD;
      titrated doses of protamine will be administered to reverse the anticoagulant action of&#xD;
      heparin, targeting to achieve baseline preoperative Activated clotting Time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, all rSO2 and brain blood volume index data are downloaded into an&#xD;
      encrypted USB drive for analysis and storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Minimizing Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All HIPPA related information will be stored in a private computer in a password&#xD;
           protected computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cleaning of cables, monitors and reusable equipment are performed after each use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard electrical precautions will be followed to prevent electrical shock to&#xD;
           providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Plan for Analysis of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trend graphs of NeurOS brain blood volume index, arterial blood pressure and cerebral&#xD;
           oxygenation will be plotted together to identify correlations among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume index deviation from the baseline at each&#xD;
           key point will be analyzed to identify whether these critical moments affect cerebral&#xD;
           oxygenation and the brain blood volume. Clinical outcomes data will be collected on&#xD;
           30-day mortality and strokes to identify whether abnormal cerebral oxygenation and brain&#xD;
           blood volume directly (too high or too low, Area Under or Above the Curve) affects&#xD;
           clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Programs to be used for data analysis: Software R&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Research Materials, Records, and Privacy: Identify the sources of research material&#xD;
           obtained from individually identifiable living human subjects: Prospective noninvasive&#xD;
           data on cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume during cardiac surgery. Please see&#xD;
           data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicate what information (records, data, etc.) will be recorded and whether use will be made&#xD;
      of existing records or data: Cerebral oxygenation and brain blood volume. They will be&#xD;
      recorded in the medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explain why this information is needed to conduct the study: These data are necessary to&#xD;
      identify outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specify how the data will be de-identified (if applicable), who has access to the data, where&#xD;
      the data will be stored and how the researcher will protect both the data with respect to&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality. Address physical security measures (e.g., locked facility,&#xD;
      limited access); data security (e.g., password-protection, data encryption); safeguards to&#xD;
      protect identifiable research information (e.g., coding or links): Once required information&#xD;
      is collected, HIPPA information will be deleted. All HIPPA related information will be stored&#xD;
      in a private computer in a password protected computer. No links will be provided to the&#xD;
      public.&#xD;
