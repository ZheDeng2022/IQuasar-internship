  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single-arm, phase II, multicentre clinical trial to determine the rate of&#xD;
      durable clinical benefit of nivolumab in patients with class II expressing microsatellite&#xD;
      stable colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immuno-oncology is transforming the care of certain patients with cancer. Not all patients&#xD;
      respond to these therapies however, and in some common cancers checkpoint blockade has failed&#xD;
      to make any real impact. In 2014 there were over 41,000 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      in the UK and nearly 16,000 deaths from the disease, making it the second commonest cause of&#xD;
      cancer death (Cancer Research UK Cancer Statistics Key Facts). 15% of patients with CRC&#xD;
      develop it as a result of deficient mismatch repair (microsatellite instability - MSI): this&#xD;
      cohort of patients respond well to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as these tumours harbour a very high&#xD;
      number of mutations thus increasing the likelihood of the presence of immunogenic&#xD;
      neo-epitopes which elicit an immune response1. The majority of CRC patients, particularly&#xD;
      those with metastatic disease (around 95%), do not display this hyper-mutator phenotype&#xD;
      (microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC) and in these patients the results of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade&#xD;
      have been disappointing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, MSS CRC patients with a class II expression appear to represent immunologically a&#xD;
      group of MSI-like MSS patients that may respond to usefully to the immunotherapy agent&#xD;
      nivolumab as a single agent and thus a trial of nivolumab in patients with class II&#xD;
      expression of their cancer cells appears to be highly justified.&#xD;
