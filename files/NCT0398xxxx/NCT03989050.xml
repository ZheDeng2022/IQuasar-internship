  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study of vaccine efficacy and safety in adult patients&#xD;
      with malignancies (melanoma/Hodgkin's lymphoma/Non-small cell lung cancer). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to compare serotype specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titres before and&#xD;
      after pneumococcal vaccination in patients receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI). As&#xD;
      an explorative objective, serotype specific IgG antibodies measured by ELISA and those&#xD;
      measured by Opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) after pneumococcal vaccination in patients&#xD;
      receiving ICI will be correlated. In addition, the incidence of immune related adverse events&#xD;
      (irAE) in patients vaccinated during ICI treatment will be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physicians will be informed by mail and pocket cards with all necessary information about the&#xD;
      study, in particular eligibility criteria. Patients currently receiving Immune Checkpoint&#xD;
      Inhibitors will be approached by their treating physicians in case of an already scheduled&#xD;
      vaccination against S. pneumonia. If a patient agrees to participate in the study and to sign&#xD;
      an informed consent form, basic data on demographics, underlying disease, comorbidities, and&#xD;
      irAE will be obtained from the electronic health record and entered into the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal antibody titers will be drawn at baseline and after 30 days. We will actively&#xD;
      follow-up on study patients for four months after enrolment and screen health records of the&#xD;
      enrolled patients after four months to record occurrence of irAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample (9 ml) will be drawn before vaccination. Vaccination will either be performed&#xD;
      by the treating physician or by a general practitioner. After 30 days, a second blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken during an already planned visit at the (outpatient) clinic. Titer assessment&#xD;
      will be performed along STIKO recommendations for immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples for ELISA and OPA titer determination will be stored frozen at Department I for&#xD;
      Internal Medicine and titers will be analyzed in batch at the end of this study. All&#xD;
      therapies and diagnostics including vaccinations will be administered solely as part of&#xD;
      clinical routine and as recommended by appropriate guidelines (RKI STIKO recommendations).&#xD;
