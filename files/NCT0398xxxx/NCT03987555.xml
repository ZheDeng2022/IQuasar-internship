  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this prospective, observational cohort study are to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing paclitaxel therapeutic drug monitoring for cancer patients and explore the&#xD;
      relationship between paclitaxel drug exposure and the development of neuropathic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial studies if paclitaxel can be consistently measured in the blood of patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors undergoing paclitaxel treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Nerve damage is one of the&#xD;
      most common and severe side effects of paclitaxel. The ability to consistently measure&#xD;
      paclitaxel in the blood may allow doctors to control the dose of paclitaxel, so that enough&#xD;
      chemotherapy is given to kill the cancer, but the side effect of nerve damage is reduced.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Determine the feasibility of monitoring paclitaxel serum drug levels in patients with a&#xD;
      solid tumor (e.g. lung, breast, and gynecologic cancers) for which Paclitaxel is the standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare Paclitaxel serum drug levels among patients with differing degrees of&#xD;
           chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare mitochondrial function within circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
           among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at&#xD;
           the end of Paclitaxel treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the ability of pulsed electromagnetic field to modulate immune cells of&#xD;
           individuals experiencing differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
           at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility will be assessed based on the proportion of patients who complete study blood draws at &gt;90% of completed Paclitaxel infusions. A completed Paclitaxel infusion is defined as each dose of Paclitaxel that is completed in its entirety. The a priori success rate will be defined as 90% of patients receiving 100% of study blood draws and the null rate will be set at 50%</description>
