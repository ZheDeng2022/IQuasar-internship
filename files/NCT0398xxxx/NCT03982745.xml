      The aim of this prospective observational study is to evaluate the efficacy of Bonfils&#xD;
      fiberoptic stylet to perform tracheal intubation with double lumen tube after failure of&#xD;
      standard laryngoscopy in 30 adults patients scheduled for elective thoracic surgery, who&#xD;
      require tracheal intubation with double lumen tube for One Lung Ventilation under general&#xD;
      anesthesia in a teaching hospital operating theatre at Ospedali Riuniti Ancona (Italy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study, approved by Marche's Regional Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (CERM), Ancona, ITA on the 07 February 2019. The study is conformed to the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, an informed written consent will be obtained&#xD;
      at recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Bonfils fiberoptic stylet to perform&#xD;
      tracheal intubation with double lumen tube (DLT) after failure of standard laryngoscopy in 30&#xD;
      adult patients (patients 18 years of age) scheduled for elective thoracic surgery, who&#xD;
      require tracheal intubation with (DLT) for One Lung Ventilation (OLV) under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. The study will be performed in a teaching hospital operating theatre at AOU&#xD;
      Ospedali Riuniti Ancona (Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative evaluation will be done before surgery, demographic variables will be collected&#xD;
      and the clinical screening tests to predict a difficult airway will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the intervention, patients will be subjected to standard monitoring of vital&#xD;
      signs (NIBP, FC, SpO2 and ECG) and, after induction of general anesthesia and adequate&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation (3-minutes with facial mask ventilation), a direct laryngoscopy with&#xD;
      Macintosh blade will be performed to insert a DLT. The Cormack-Lehane grade view will be&#xD;
      registered after optimization of the intubation attempt by improving the &quot;sniffing position&quot;&#xD;
      and the external manipulation of the larynx (BURP maneuver). In case of declaration of&#xD;
      intubation failure, it will be used Bonfils fiberscope for the DLT insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum duration of intubation attempt is not established, but a decrease in SpO2 below 90%&#xD;
      will be considered as a criterion for abandoning the procedure and the patient will be&#xD;
      re-oxygenated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum number of attempts allowed will be 2 for the Macintosh laryngoscope and 2 for the&#xD;
      Bonfils fiberscope, after which, in case of failure with the both devices, the patient will&#xD;
      be awakened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In any case of difficulty in patient oxygenation and ventilation with facial mask, a second&#xD;
      generation laryngeal mask will be used. The following parameters relating to the patients&#xD;
      recruited in the study will be recorded: weight, height, BMI, Mallampati score, interincisor&#xD;
      distance, chin-Thyroid distance, Cormack-Lehane view grade at direct laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of this study is to assess the success rate of DLT insertion with&#xD;
      Bonfils fiberscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the procedure, the number of attempts and the occurrence of any complications&#xD;
      will also be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed using the Medcalc 7.3.0.1 statistical program (Medcalc&#xD;
      software, Ostend, Belgium). Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test will be used to test the normality of&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented as mean ± dev. standard or median and 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be averaged, and the data will be presented as mean SD for each variable&#xD;
      with continuous data. Values of P less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between means will be studied by parametric tests (eg Student's t) if the&#xD;
      data are normal distribution and non-parametric tests (eg Wilcoxon) if the distribution is&#xD;
      not normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the efficacy of Bonfils fiberscope, literature have been reported a success&#xD;
      rate higher than 80%. Therefore, assuming a success rate of around 90% (and accepting a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 10%), we should study at least 30 patients for whom we expect to have a&#xD;
      correct tracheal intubation on about 27 patients. A 5% SD would mean that intubation will be&#xD;
      successful in at least 26 patients (85%), which we believe could be considered an excellent&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
