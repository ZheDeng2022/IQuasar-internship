  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short bowel syndrome (SBS) occurs when there is insufficient intestinal mass to support&#xD;
      normal growth and development. Approximately 30 out of every 100,000 babies are affected by&#xD;
      SBS in North America, and these infants remain dependent on intravenous, parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (PN) for prolonged periods of time. Children with SBS frequently fail to achieve sufficient&#xD;
      linear growth and weight gain despite receiving calories in excess of that required by&#xD;
      age-matched healthy children. Poor intestinal absorption, motility and increased inflammation&#xD;
      all contribute to poor growth in these patients. In addition, children with SBS are known to&#xD;
      have significant disturbances to their normal commensal gut bacteria. They may experience a&#xD;
      depletion of specific groups of beneficial gut bacteria, and their metabolic by-products,&#xD;
      specifically short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can lead to intestinal inflammation,&#xD;
      malabsorption, and a less efficient use of consumed calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, I hypothesize that children with SBS who are given supplements of&#xD;
      targeted probiotics will have an increase in beneficial anti-inflammatory bacteria in their&#xD;
      gut that more closely resembles the microbiota profile of healthy children. In addition, the&#xD;
      children receiving probiotic supplementation will have increased concentrations of fecal&#xD;
      SCFAs and improved growth compared to children with SBS who are not receiving&#xD;
      supplementation. The central hypothesis will be tested by 1) prospectively characterizing the&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial populations (by using next-gen sequencing methods), and measuring SCFA&#xD;
      concentrations in the stool of children with SBS receiving probiotic treatment compared to&#xD;
      those receiving no supplementation and 2) determining differences in the growth trajectory of&#xD;
      the children in both groups by measuring sequential anthropometrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either continue with standard of care, or to receive&#xD;
      a daily probiotic for 3 months. A total of 3 stool samples will be collected from each&#xD;
      patient (at the beginning, midpoint and end of the study) and fecal 16S rDNA microbial&#xD;
      sequencing and SCFA concentrations will be compared between groups, as will the groups growth&#xD;
      trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of the study is to determine how to effectively change the gut&#xD;
      microbiota in children with SBS to restore a healthy balance and maximize growth and&#xD;
      development. Although children with SBS have known disturbances to their intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota, it is unclear whether providing an oral probiotic is an effective approach to&#xD;
      correct these disturbances.&#xD;

      1. Introduction and Purpose: The goal of this project is to improve linear growth and&#xD;
           weight gain in children with short bowel syndrome by changing their intestinal&#xD;
           microbiota and ultimately intestinal bacterial metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) occurs when there is insufficient intestinal mass&#xD;
           to support normal growth and development. Approximately 35 babies out of every 100,000&#xD;
           live birth are affected by SBS in North America, and these infants remain dependent on&#xD;
           intravenous, parenteral nutrition (PN) for a prolonged period of time. One of the major&#xD;
           challenges these children face is achieving sufficient linear growth and weight gain&#xD;
           despite receiving calories in excess of that required by age matched healthy children.&#xD;
           Problems with poor intestinal absorption and motility and increased inflammation all&#xD;
           contribute to poor growth in these patients. An important factor in the healthy function&#xD;
           of the remaining small bowel is the intestinal microbial community. It is known that&#xD;
           depletion of certain groups of beneficial gut bacteria, and their metabolic by-products,&#xD;
           specifically short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can lead to intestinal inflammation,&#xD;
           malabsorption, and less efficient use of consumed calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The long-term objective of the study is to determine how to effectively change the gut&#xD;
           microbiota in children with SBS to restore a healthy balance and maximize growth and&#xD;
           development. Although children with SBS have known disturbances to their intestinal&#xD;
           microbiota, it is unclear whether providing an oral probiotic is an effective approach&#xD;
           to correct these disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1: To determine if probiotic supplementation can significantly modulate gut&#xD;
           microbiota and improve growth in SBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2: To determine levels of fecal SCFAs in children with SBS, including those&#xD;
           receiving probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study description: All eligible children will be consented at the time of an outpatient&#xD;
           clinic visit or during an inpatient stay. Enrolled participants will then be randomized&#xD;
           to &quot;placebo&quot; where they will receive the standard of care medical and nutritional&#xD;
           treatment for short bowel syndrome in addition to 1mL of pure MCT (medium chain&#xD;
           triglyceride) oil daily for 3 months, or &quot;probiotic therapy&quot; where they will receive a&#xD;
           combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (5 billion colony-forming units per day) and&#xD;
           Lactobacillus johnsonii,(200 million colony-forming units per day) daily for 3 months in&#xD;
           addition to the standard of care. Randomization will not be blinded. The probiotics were&#xD;
           chosen because they have been well studied in infants and children and both of these&#xD;
           species have been found to be deficient in children with SBS and poor growth. The&#xD;
           placebo was chosen because it is the only inactive ingredient included in the suspension&#xD;
           of the probiotic, it is odorless and tasteless, and has no known side effects. The&#xD;
           probiotic and MCT oil will be given daily either orally or through an existing&#xD;
           gastrostomy tube. Patients who drop out of the study, or who are withdrawn will not be&#xD;
           replaced, and the data from these subjects will be included as part of the analysis in&#xD;
           an intention-to-treat manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool (approximately 200mg per sample) will be collected at 3 separate time points for each&#xD;
      patient (at the beginning, middle and end of the study). Stool will be collected either&#xD;
      during an inpatient stay or at an outpatient clinic visit. If a patient is unable to provide&#xD;
      a stool sample, the family can collect one at home and it can be frozen and brought in at the&#xD;
      time of the next clinic visit. A frozen sample can be used for 16S rRNA sequencing and&#xD;
      metabolomics analysis, but not for SCFA concentration. Microbial gDNA can be recovered from&#xD;
      stool that has been frozen for up to 6 months, with similar sequencing results compared to&#xD;
      freshly processed stool. If a fresh sample is provided, a portion will be used to determine&#xD;
      the concentration of SCFAs. Stool used for 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics will be kept&#xD;
      frozen until analysis is performed. A one-time stool collection will also be obtained from 10&#xD;
      control patients with short bowel syndrome who are growing well and will be used for 16S rRNA&#xD;
      and metabolomics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool used for 16S rRNA sequencing will be kept frozen until the time of analysis. Bacterial&#xD;
      gDNA will then be extracted from fecal contents. Amplicons of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes&#xD;
      will be generated and sequenced using the Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 (UTSW Genomics Core).&#xD;
      Sequencing reads will be filtered and quality trimmed and analyzed using the QIIME software&#xD;
      package.59 Microbial diversity will be estimated by calculating the Shannon diversity index&#xD;
      and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial abundance will be determined using standard curves constructed with reference to&#xD;
      cloned bacterial DNA corresponding to a short segment of the 16S rRNA gene that was amplified&#xD;
      from bacterial reference strains.63 Dr. Koh has also validated qPCR protocols for 6 specific&#xD;
      bacterial groups: 1) Eubacteria (all bacteria); 2)Lactobacillus (a subset of firmicutes); 3)&#xD;
      Bacteroides (a subset of Bacteroidetes); 4) Enterobacteriaceae (ENTERO; pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      gram-negatives such as E.coli, Klebsiella spp, etc); 5) CLEPT (a subset of Firmicutes;&#xD;
      butyrate producing anti-inflammatory Clostridia); 6)EREC (a subset of Firmicutes; butyrate&#xD;
      producing anti-inflammatory Clostridia). Bacterial group specific qPCR provides&#xD;
      quantification of overall abundance of specific groups of bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations of SCFAs in the stool will be measured at all time points that a fresh sample&#xD;
      can be provided. Briefly, fresh fecal samples will be weighed, suspended in water with 0.5%&#xD;
      phosphoric acid and then flash frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen. Given the volatility&#xD;
      of SCFAs, flash freezing will provide more accurate measurements. Fecal suspensions will then&#xD;
      be thawed, homogenized, and extracted with ethyl acetate. Organic extracts will be spiked&#xD;
      with carbon-labeled SCFA standards (in order to accurately quantify SCFA levels) and run on&#xD;
      the GC-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Enrolled patients will be randomized using a centralized process based on a&#xD;
      random table. Randomization will be determined by calling a central project phone number&#xD;
      answered by the research nurse and requesting a subject ID and an allocation to either&#xD;
      standard treatment or conditional surgery. This is an open-label trial and patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo patients will receive the standard of care medical and nutritional treatment for&#xD;
      short bowel syndrome in addition to daily MCT oil. All enrolled patients will have detailed&#xD;
      growth assessment during the study. The primary anthropometric measures of growth will&#xD;
      include weight, height, head circumference (for children &lt;2 years) and mid-arm circumference,&#xD;
      which will be documented upon enrollment, and monthly during the study. Body mass index and&#xD;
      z-scores for growth variables will be calculated at each time point. Expected and median&#xD;
      values for anthropometric parameters will be obtained from the World Health Organization&#xD;
      growth chart for patients &lt;2 years and the Centers for Disease Control growth charts for&#xD;
      patients ≥2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information will also be collected from the medical records for all enrolled&#xD;
      patients including information about age, gender, ethnicity, etiology of SBS, quality and&#xD;
      frequency of daily bowel movements, antibiotic usage in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment and&#xD;
      during the study, infections during the study, surgical history, including any&#xD;
      bowel-lengthening procedures, length and anatomy of small bowel and colon remaining, the&#xD;
      presence of a stoma and/or gastrostomy tube, medical history, medications, detailed nutrition&#xD;
      information (caloric intake from parenteral and enteral nutrition), and routine nutritional&#xD;
      blood work. Stepwise logistical regression analysis of these clinical characteristics will be&#xD;
      performed to model the independent predictors of poor growth, using a significance level of&#xD;
      p&lt;.05. A Fischer's exact test will be performed to assess the overall distribution of&#xD;
      discrete clinical variables among patient analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotic Group - where they will receive a combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ( 5&#xD;
      billion colony-forming units per day) and Lactobacillus johnsonii (200 million colony-forming&#xD;
      units per day) daily for 3 months in addition to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected by both groups at 3 separate time points for each patient,&#xD;
      upon initial enrollment, the midpoint and end of the study). The samples will be collected at&#xD;
      a standard of care clinic visit, during an inpatient stay, or at home by the caregiver and&#xD;
      frozen. Caregivers will be provided with instructions and stool collection kits.&#xD;
