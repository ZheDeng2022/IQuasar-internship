      Colon cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, and colorectal cancer ranks the fifth&#xD;
      leading cause of tumor-related mortality in China. FOLFOX is the recommended adjuvant/&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment for advanced colon cancer and it can improve the R0 resection rate, as&#xD;
      well as reduce recurrence rate, but the overall responding rate is limited. Currently, immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blocked (ICB) emerges as a promising approach in early colon cancer. JS001, as the&#xD;
      first Chinese produced anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has been approved by CFDA in melanoma.&#xD;
      This study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients who meet the&#xD;
      enrollment criteria will receive FOLFOX (Q2W) and JS001 (3mg/kg, Q2W) or only FOLFOX for&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment 6 cycles in pre-operation and same treatment after operation, a total&#xD;
      of six months. The assessment will be conducted in the 6th week and 13th week from the&#xD;
      initiation date in the first cycle. The patients will be followed up for 5 years. The pCR&#xD;
      rate, rCR rate, ORR, DFS, OS and Safety will be compared. This study aims to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with FOLFOX as adjuvant/ neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      for patients with locally advanced colon cancer.&#xD;
