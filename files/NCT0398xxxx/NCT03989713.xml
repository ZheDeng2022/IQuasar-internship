    <textblock>
      In this multicenter, upfront randomized phase II trial, all patients receive quizartinib in&#xD;
      combination with HAM (high-dose cytarabine, mitoxantrone) during salvage therapy. Efficacy is&#xD;
      assessed by comparison to historical controls based on the matched threshold crossing&#xD;
      approach. During consolidation therapy (chemotherapy as well as allo-HCT) patients receive&#xD;
      either prophylactic quizartinib therapy or MRD-triggered preemptive continuation therapy with&#xD;
      quizartinib according to up-front randomization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignant disorder which is characterized by the&#xD;
      expansion of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood, which goes along&#xD;
      with a suppression of normal hematopoiesis including granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and&#xD;
      thrombocytopoiesis. The prognosis is largely determined by cytogenetic and molecular risk&#xD;
      factors, age, performance status and antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). With the&#xD;
      exception of old and frail patients, most AML patients are eligible for intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy, which is given in curative intent consisting of induction and consolidation&#xD;
      therapy. However, despite intensive therapy, the long-term outcome of AML patients remains&#xD;
      poor, with less than 30% of patients achieving long lasting remission and even cure. This&#xD;
      poor outcome is largely due to refractoriness to induction chemotherapy as well as relapses&#xD;
      during and after completion of intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Regarding&#xD;
      refractoriness, about 20-30% of AML patients under the age of 60 years and about 50% of older&#xD;
      patients fail to attain complete remission (CR) following cytarabine plus anthracycline based&#xD;
      standard induction therapy. In addition, patients having achieved CR are at a high risk of&#xD;
      relapse, particularly within the first two years after completion of chemotherapy. Allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is currently the only treatment strategy to&#xD;
      offer the prospect of cure in relapsed/refractory (r/r)-AML; but outcome after allo-HCT is&#xD;
      largely determined by the remission state before allo-HCT. With the aim to induce a CR before&#xD;
      allo-HCT, salvage chemotherapy regimens are administered in r/r-AML. Typically, these salvage&#xD;
      regimens are based on high dose cytarabine (HiDAC), which is frequently combined with either&#xD;
      mitoxantrone (HAM regimen) or fludarabine plus idarubicin (idaFLA regimen). However, there is&#xD;
      still no commonly accepted standard salvage regimen and overall CR rates remain low with less&#xD;
      than one third of the patients achieving a CR. Apart from already known clinical unfavorable&#xD;
      prognostic parameters in relapsed AML such as short first CR duration, older age and previous&#xD;
      allo-HCT, FLT3-ITD has consistently been identified as an unfavorable molecular marker in&#xD;
      both relapsed and refractory AML. Recently midostaurin has been approved by the FDA and EMA&#xD;
      for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML with activating FLT3 mutations. But still roughly&#xD;
      one quarter of patients, who received midostaurin, was refractory to induction therapy and&#xD;
      relapse rate at 2 years excited 40%. Thus, new treatment options are urgently needed,&#xD;
      particularly in r/r-AML with FLT3-ITD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral second-generation bis-aryl urea tyrosine kinase inhibitor quizartinib is very&#xD;
      specific for FLT3, has a high capacity for sustained FLT3 inhibition and an acceptable&#xD;
      toxicity profile. Furthermore, single agent quizartinib doubled the response rate as compared&#xD;
      to standard of care in a randomized study in r/r-AML. Although survival was also improved in&#xD;
      this study the difference was only marginal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol we evaluate the efficacy of quizartinib in combination with HAM (high-dose&#xD;
      cytarabine, mitoxantrone) as compared to historical controls based on the matched threshold&#xD;
      crossing approach followed by randomized prophylactic versus MRD-triggered continuation&#xD;
      therapy with quizartinib including consolidation (chemotherapy as well as allo-HCT) and&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
