      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of electromechanical&#xD;
      exoskeleton-assisted gait training on rehabilitation functional outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      stroke undergoing therapy in an in-patient rehabilitation facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The investigators will study 50 patients with stroke consecutively admitted to a&#xD;
      designated stroke rehabilitation unit in the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center. All patients&#xD;
      will receive their daily 3-hours conventional therapy, plus an hour of either exoskeleton or&#xD;
      over-ground gait training 3 times per week for 60 minutes. Patients were assigned to either&#xD;
      the experimental (exoskeleton) or the control (over-ground) groups by computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization. This is an open-label pragmatic trial, where neither the patients nor the&#xD;
      clinicians could be masked to the intervention. Institution review board (IRB) approval will&#xD;
      be obtained for the protocol. The demographic data to be collected includes: age, gender,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, stroke onset to admission, stroke types (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and stroke&#xD;
      severity (on the National Institute of Health Stroke Severity [NIHSS] scale. Admission and&#xD;
      discharge total Functional Independence Measure (FIM), spasticity and depression scores,&#xD;
      ambulation velocity over 2-minutes (2-MWT) in feet/minute, and discharge disposition. The&#xD;
      intervention is Indego® exoskeleton. The primary outcome measures were: changes in the FIM,&#xD;
      depression and spasticity scores. The secondary outcome measure was discharge disposition.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were analyzed using Students t-test, ordinal variables were analyzed&#xD;
      using Mann-Whitney, and the nominal variables were analyzed using Chi-square analyses.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and at 4-weeks to measure change</time_frame>
    <description>It measure the degree of disability as well as the progress patients make throughout their medical rehabilitation programs. FIM Scale score varies from minimum of 18 to maximum of 126. Higher score better the outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The two minute walk test (2-MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and at 4-weeks to measure change</time_frame>
    <description>It assess the walking distance over two minutes while moving at a comfortable speed. using any ambulation aids (such as cane, walkers, and rollators) used in everyday life. Normal walking speed is 360 ft.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and at 4-weeks to measure change</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical measure of degree of spasticity. Score varies from 0=normal tome to 4=part rigid in flexion and extension. Lower the score the better the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discharge disposition</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Looks at effectiveness of rehabilitation as to how many patients are discharged home. Higher percentage 65% and above the better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and at 4-weeks to measure change</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 21 item self-report rating inventory measuring characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. It ranges in value from 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-offs are as follows: 0-9 indicates person is not depressed, 10-18 indicates mild-moderate depression, 19-29 indicates moderate-severe depression and 30-63 indicates severe depression.</description>
