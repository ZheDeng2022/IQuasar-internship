      Clinical reasoning and recent data suggest that early use of venovenous extracorporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure may confer a survival advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective matched study will assess whether patients who received VV ECMO at less&#xD;
      severe hypoxaemia had differing outcomes to those who received ECMO with very severe&#xD;
      hypoxaemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VV ECMO is increasingly used in refractory respiratory failure. Despite advances in lung&#xD;
      protective ventilation strategies, patients who have severe respiratory failure often develop&#xD;
      complications from mechanical ventilation, including volutrauma and barotrauma. ECMO allows&#xD;
      gas exchange to occur extracorporeally and may reduce the potential burden of iatrogenic lung&#xD;
      injury by allowing a reduction of volume and pressure support - a 'lung rest' strategy. It is&#xD;
      theorised that earlier intitiation of ECMO may allow for better outcomes, as there will have&#xD;
      been less time for iatrogenic lung injury to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK ECMO registry has been collected of patients treated under the NHS England&#xD;
      commissioned respiratory ECMO service since 2011. This study has been previously registered&#xD;
      and publication is intended shortly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be extracted from this registry if they received VV ECMO. Propensity matching&#xD;
      scores will be created and patients will be stratified into groups of 'early' vs 'delayed'&#xD;
      ECMO, based on their probability of being in either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into cohorts based on the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio at decision to&#xD;
      cannulate ('less severe hypoxaemia') and ('very severe hypoxaemia'). Matched cohorts will be&#xD;
      created correcting for key confounding factors (age, primary diagnosis, duration of pre-ECMO&#xD;
      ventilation and PaCO2), using cardinality matching (a novel technique described by&#xD;
      Zubizaretta et al. in 2014) and traditional propensity-score-based methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique with greater balance and statistical power (as defined by sample size) will be&#xD;
      selected for the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analyses will assess the relationship between hypoxaemia at decision-to-cannulate and&#xD;
      confounding factors as above.&#xD;
