  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate rehabilitation training after amputation can result in poor patient outcomes,&#xD;
      injuries, and wasted healthcare resources. This is a serious public health problem due to an&#xD;
      aging population and rising prevalence of diabetes (main cause of amputation in the U.S.). In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will examine the effects of external vs. internal attentional&#xD;
      focus instruction on learning of a balance task in individuals with existing amputation and&#xD;
      those at risk of amputation (older adults with diabetes). With the proposed research, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to expand the understanding of motor learning in individuals with and at&#xD;
      risk of lower limb loss to provide knowledge that will lead to more effective and efficient&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

      1. Prior to participation in the study, the purpose and procedures of the study, including&#xD;
           possible image and video recordings, will be explained to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will then be required to give written consent for their participation and will&#xD;
           receive a copy of their consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The following 2-part research protocol uses a similar experimental protocol (learning a&#xD;
           balance task) on individuals with leg amputation (Part 1), and individuals with chronic&#xD;
           diabetes (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will take place over a 3-day period including screening and baseline testing&#xD;
      (Visit 1), balance training (Visits 2), and retention testing (Visit 3; at least 24 hours&#xD;
      after Visit 2). On Visit 1, the investigators will assess aspects of health and functional&#xD;
      capacity to assess participation eligibility and establish baseline characteristics of the&#xD;
      participants. In addition to medical history and anthropometric measurements, the assessment&#xD;
      will consist of clinical surveys of quality of life, physical activity level, balance&#xD;
      confidence, and fear of falling. Ambulatory performance will be quantified. Additional&#xD;
      amputee-specific measures will be used to assess functional characteristics unique to the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balance training involves standing and maintaining balance on a stabilometer, which&#xD;
      consists of a platform (1.3m long by 1.4m wide) connected to a single axis that allows&#xD;
      bi-directional sway (Lafayette Instrument Co.; Figure 1). The maximum angular deviation of&#xD;
      the platform is 18°. A safety harness is provided to prevent falls but does not provide&#xD;
      support during the performance of the task. The load on the harness will be monitored with an&#xD;
      S-type strain gauge (Delsys Inc., Massachusetts, USA) connected in series to the harness&#xD;
      tether. Participants are required to maintain balance with feet in a medial-lateral&#xD;
      orientation while standing on the balance board and looking straight ahead. A potentiometer&#xD;
      monitors the sway angle of the platform. An integrated timer measures time in balance, which&#xD;
      is defined as when the platform angle is within ± 5° of horizontal.[52] The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is time in balance (sec.) for each 30s trial. The secondary outcome measure is&#xD;
      platform angular deviation from horizontal (RMSE; degree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to receive the 2 attentional focus conditions in random order.&#xD;
      Depending on the condition, participants will receive either internal or the external focus&#xD;
      instruction on where to direct their attention while training to perform the balance task.&#xD;
      During training, the assigned instruction will be reinforced at the beginning and after every&#xD;
      5 practice trials. After they complete training with the first condition, they will go&#xD;
      through a washout period (at least 4 weeks) before receiving training under the other&#xD;
      condition. Participants will be blinded to the purpose of the intervention and study design&#xD;
      until debriefing at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will take place over a 2-day period (Visits 1 and 2), the investigators will&#xD;
      monitor the changes in balance task performance over 40 total practice trials (20 trials each&#xD;
      visit). The balance training consists of thirty 30s trials with a 90s rest interval between&#xD;
      trials. During the rest interval, the platform will be locked to provide a stable surface or&#xD;
      the participant can choose to step off the platform to sit down and rest when needed. After&#xD;
      each 5 trials, participants will be given feedback regarding their performance (time in&#xD;
      balance). No additional feedback will be provided. This protocol has been validated in the&#xD;
      older adult population (mean age 69.4 years) in a previous study (Chiviacowsky et al. 2010).&#xD;
      After each training block of 5 trials, the participant's self-perceived direction of&#xD;
      attentional focus and spontaneous comments during the practice will be checked. The retention&#xD;
      test will be performed at least 24 hours after the 2nd training day (Visit 3). The retention&#xD;
      test will consist of performing 10 trials of the same balance task during which the&#xD;
      participant will not receive any instructions, reminders, or feedback. An additional 10&#xD;
      trials of skill transfer task will be performed with an added cognitive task (counting&#xD;
      numbers backward).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (individuals with diabetes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure of Part 2 of this research is identical to Part 1. The main differences, in&#xD;
      addition to the different participant population are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the baseline health and functional capacity assessments as described in Part&#xD;
      1, the investigators will assess all participants' sensorimotor function using an established&#xD;
      knee joint reposition sense test on a Cybex Norm dynamometer (Computer Sports Medicine Inc.,&#xD;
      Stoughton, MA, USA). This test assesses participant's ability to reproduce a joint angle&#xD;
      using only proprioception. The test performance will be measured as the absolute error in&#xD;
      degrees between the reproduced and target angles. This specific test was chosen to quantify&#xD;
      the lower limb sensorimotor function because previous studies have shown it to be predictive&#xD;
      of mobility outcomes in older adults in general and in those with diabetes. The investigators&#xD;
      will determine individuals with diabetes-related sensorimotor impairment if the error is&#xD;
      greater than 3.65°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be randomly assigned to receive either internal or external focus&#xD;
      instructions conditions during the balance training. The experimental protocols and&#xD;
      procedures will be the same as in Aim 1, including the screening (Visit 1), balance training&#xD;
      (Visits 2), and retention and skill transfer testing (Visit 3; at least 24 hours after Visit&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
