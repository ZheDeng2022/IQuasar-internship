  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth sedentary reduction program over a&#xD;
      6-month period of time in adults with past or present knee symptoms, injuries, or surgeries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior, in excess, is associated with numerous health consequences including poor&#xD;
      physical function. Older adults with symptomatic knee pain spend the majority of their waking&#xD;
      hours engaging in sedentary behaviors. To reduce the risk of disability, improve quality of&#xD;
      life, and prevent deterioration in physical function, it is imperative the investigators&#xD;
      develop ways to reduce sedentary time. Smartphone ownership among older adults is increasing&#xD;
      and may provide a scalable opportunity to disseminate a sedentary reduction intervention.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate and compare changes in sedentary behavior and physical&#xD;
      function between an mHealth sedentary reduction, mHealth intervention plus coaching, and&#xD;
      delayed mHealth group. Sedentary behavior and physical function will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after randomization.&#xD;

NEAT!2: Participants randomized to NEAT!2 will have their NEAT!2 app turned on after randomization. When 30 minutes of continuous non-movement or sedentary time is detected, the NEAT!2 app will provide a vibration or audio notification as well as display a reminder on the phone's lock/home screen. Participants will be asked to use the app for the 3 months of the intervention. Participants will be given an initial goal to reduce total sedentary time by 30 minutes/day, ultimately progressing to a 90 minute/day reduction by 3 months. After the 3-month assessment, participants randomized to NEAT!2 will have the option to continue using the app until 6 months.</description>
