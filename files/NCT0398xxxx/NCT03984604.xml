  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a disorder where people are having trouble sleeping and can include difficulty&#xD;
      falling asleep, staying asleep and waking up too early, as well as having unrefreshing sleep.&#xD;
      CHI-921 is a cannabis extract in sunflower oil produced as a treatment for insomnia. This&#xD;
      trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHI-921 on people with insomnia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the patient-reported sleep latency and patient-reported wake after sleep onset&#xD;
           after 3 weeks per treatment dose with CHI-921 compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effects of CHI-921 compared to placebo on PSG sleep architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effects of CHI-921 compared to placebo on Patient Global Impression of&#xD;
           change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the daytime residual effects that may be associated with CHI-921 as compared&#xD;
           to placebo during the double-blind treatment period using patient's morning and evening&#xD;
           questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression of change, Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh&#xD;
           Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale as well as the Rey Auditory Verbal&#xD;
           Learning Test and Digit Symbol Substitution psychometric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the effect on sleep of abruptly discontinuing CHI-921 compared to placebo&#xD;
           (during run-out period).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the clinical safety and tolerability of CHI-921 compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Evaluation of the accuracy of sleep data obtained by actigraphy as compared to&#xD;
           traditional PSG.&#xD;
