      The purpose is, in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in the early phase after&#xD;
      ictus, to examine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effect of spontaneous and induced changes on the brain's static and dynamic&#xD;
           autoregulation calculated by transcranial Doppler (TCD), ICP and MAP (primary purposes)&#xD;
           and ICP and PbtO2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect of mild hyper- and hypocapnia as well as of mild hyper- and hypoxia on the&#xD;
           brain's static and dynamic autoregulation, ICP and PbtO2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The relationship between brain autoregulation, mild hyper- and hypocapnia, as well as of&#xD;
           mild hyper- and hypoxia and metabolism in microdialysate on the one hand and the&#xD;
           occurrence of DCI during hospitalization and poor neurological outcome one year after&#xD;
           ictus on the other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous aneurysm subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs annually in approximately 400&#xD;
      people in Denmark. SAH is most commonly seen in younger (median age 56 years) and women&#xD;
      (71%), have a high mortality (21-44%) and result in a poor neurological outcome in about 50%&#xD;
      of patients. Due to the relatively young patient population and high mortality and morbidity,&#xD;
      SAH in the population causes the same number of lost working years as blood clots in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of complications like hydrocephalus and re-bleeding can be minimized by rapid&#xD;
      external ventricular drainage and aneurysm closure, and so-called delayed cerebral ischaemia&#xD;
      (DCI) is currently considered to be the most frequent serious complication of SAH. DCI occurs&#xD;
      in 20-30% of patients, most often within the first 14 days, is characterized by a reduction&#xD;
      in consciousness or focal neurological deficit lasting at least one hour without any other&#xD;
      underlying cause and is associated with a significantly increased risk of a poor outcome. The&#xD;
      cause and treatment of DCI is controversial, and the previous hypothesis of vasospasm as the&#xD;
      sole contributor is currently supplemented by a broader focus on several other mechanisms,&#xD;
      including the brain's blood supply and its regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain's blood supply (CBF) is kept relatively constant in healthy by changing cardiac&#xD;
      diameter and thus the cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) during changes in brain perfusion&#xD;
      pressure (CPP, measured as mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus intracranial pressure (ICP))&#xD;
      within certain limits. This mechanism is known as cerebral autoregulation. Outside these&#xD;
      limits, respectively. decreases and increases CBF, with the consequent risk of&#xD;
      hypoperfusion/ischemia and hyperperfusion/vasogenic edema with prolonged changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weakened autoregulation, i.e. that CBF varies passively with CPP also within the normal&#xD;
      autoregulation limits, is described in e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemic stroke,&#xD;
      acute liver failure and meningitis, with complete or partial restoration of autoregulation by&#xD;
      hyperventilation (mild hypocapnia). SAH also describes impaired autoregulation with varying&#xD;
      association with disease severity, DCI and outcome. It is not known whether mild hypocapnia&#xD;
      restores autoregulation in patients with SAH, whereas animal experimental studies suggest&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced intracerebral oxygenation (PbtO2) is associated with a worse outcome after SAH.&#xD;
      Cerebral microdialysis measures the concentration of certain metabolites in the brain and can&#xD;
      provide an insight into whether metabolic activity is affected by oxygen deficiency, and&#xD;
      so-called anaerobic combustion occurs. Microdialysis measurements with elevated lactate&#xD;
      concentration, which is a metabolic product, among other things. Anaerobic combustion appears&#xD;
      to occur prior to clinical signs of DCI, as well as during the DCI episodes, decreasing&#xD;
      PbtO2. It is possible that these findings could be due to a condition of impaired&#xD;
      autoregulation and too low perfusion pressure to meet brain metabolic needs, but this has not&#xD;
      previously been elucidated. It is also unknown if it is possible to improve brain metabolism&#xD;
      by increasing the brain's perfusion pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is therefore to investigate brain autoregulation in patients with&#xD;
      SAH.&#xD;
