    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, single dose design. This study is conducted in male&#xD;
      and female patients between ≥40 and 85 years of age with severe osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
      Approximately 1034 patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee randomized 1 to 1&#xD;
      treatment group (1:1) will receive a single intra- injection of 4 milliliter (mL) of Ampion&#xD;
      or saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical effects of treatment on severe osteoarthritis of the knee will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 weeks, using the Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis Index 3.1, and the Patient's Global&#xD;
      Assessment of disease severity (PGA).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC A (Pain Subscale) The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC®) Osteoarthritis Index is a questionnaire that measures pain, stiffness, and function both independently and collectively, using a Likert 3.1, 5-point scale. The Likert Scale uses the following descriptors for all items: none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme, corresponding to an ordinal scale of 0-4. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <description>WOMAC C (Function Subscale) The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC®) Osteoarthritis Index is a questionnaire that measures pain, stiffness, and function both independently and collectively, using a Likert 3.1, 5-point scale.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Severeity (PGA)&#xD;
The PGA is a 5-point scale used to capture the participant's overall impression at the time of the assessment in the index knee. This is a single question and the score ranges from 0 to 4, where 0 anchors &quot;very well&quot; and 4 anchors &quot;very poor.&quot; A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>

                  worsened symptoms in the treated knee, and subjects who increase their&#xD;
                  corticosteroid dose above their starting dose of corticosteroid during the study&#xD;
