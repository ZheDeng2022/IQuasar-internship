    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of AZD4635 in Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies. This&#xD;
      study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort1 and Cohort2. At least 3 or up to 6 evaluable Japanese&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled in Cohort1 and 6 evaluable&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in Cohort2.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 monotherapy in Japanese patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize the single-dose and multiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of&#xD;
      AZD4635 monotherapy Determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AZD4645 monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I, open-label study of AZD4635 in Japanese patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. At least 3 or up to 6 evaluable&#xD;
      Japanese subjects with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled in Cohort 1 and 6&#xD;
      evaluable patients will be required for Cohort 2 to confirm the tolerability. The total&#xD;
      number of evaluable subjects in each cohort will depend upon available data in each cohort&#xD;
      and decision of Safety Review Committee(SRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to start in June 2019 and end in June 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study to confirm the tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments and treatment duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive AZD4635 once daily (QD). A single dose of AZD4635 will be taken on&#xD;
      Cycle 0 Day1 and the subsequent dose of AZD4635 will be taken from Cycle 1 Day 1 until&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion is met. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 21 days of&#xD;
      continuous dosing.&#xD;
