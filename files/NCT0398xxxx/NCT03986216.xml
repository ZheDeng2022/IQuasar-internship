  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to develop an individualized, synergy resistant, portable&#xD;
      electromyographic (EMG)-driven functional electrical stimulation (FES) device that allows for&#xD;
      Reliable and Intuitive control of hand (ReIn-Hand) opening while using the paretic arm during&#xD;
      lifting and reaching. Furthermore, to enable sufficient practice intensity both in the clinic&#xD;
      and at home, the investigators propose to develop the ReIn-Hand device with easy-to-use&#xD;
      utilities by developing a user-customized forearm/hand orthosis with embedded EMG recording&#xD;
      and stimulation electrode. To test the device feasibility, a small clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted. Information related to the clinical trial will be provided below.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with moderate to severe stroke will be recruited for both lab-based testing and&#xD;
      home-based practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-training clinical evaluation (lab-based). In this session, a research physical&#xD;
           therapist will evaluate the participant's arm function and impairment level using&#xD;
           standardized clinical assessments to ensure eligibility for participating in this study.&#xD;
           Once confirmed, a set of standardized clinical assessments will be conducted by the&#xD;
           research physical therapist as the baseline assessments of the participant's hand/arm&#xD;
           function. This visit is expected to last approximately 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-training device setup (lab-based). The participant will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
           of the recruited physical therapists (PTs) or senior student physical therapists (SPTs)&#xD;
           who has been recruited and consented to participate in this study. The assigned PT will&#xD;
           determine 1) the electrode positions for recording the participant's muscle activities&#xD;
           during the performance of different arm/hand functions, and 2) the stimulation electrode&#xD;
           positions and stimulation intensities for achieving the best hand opening with the&#xD;
           forearm at the individual's mid-range of available supination/pronation. Then, the&#xD;
           corresponding electrode positions will be marked, and the forearm/hand with these&#xD;
           markers will be scanned. This visit is expected to last approximately 3 hours. The&#xD;
           scanned results will be used offline to develop a forearm-hand orthosis (FHO) that fits&#xD;
           the participant's forearm and hand. During this visit, the investigators will measure&#xD;
           the time for the PT/SPT to set up 1) recording electrodes, 2) detecting rules, 3)&#xD;
           stimulation electrodes and configuration, and 4) the time for scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pre-training device-use learning sessions (2 visits, lab-based). After the FHO is ready,&#xD;
           the participant will be called to participate in the 1st and 2nd lab-based training&#xD;
           sessions for the use of ReIn-hand device. During these 2 visits, the assigned PT/SPT&#xD;
           (1st test) or the research PT (2nd test) will train the participant to use the FHO and&#xD;
           the ReIn-Hand software on a mobile device, until the participant demonstrates the&#xD;
           ability in using the device independently twice in a row. During these 2 visits, the&#xD;
           investigators will measure the time for the participant to 1) learn the use of the&#xD;
           ReIn-Hand device (from the start of the session to the time that the participant is able&#xD;
           to demonstrate ability to independently use the device twice in a row), 2) attach the&#xD;
           FHO, 3) use the software for 1 trial (including connecting all the cables following the&#xD;
           instructions, start the software and finish 1 trial), and 4) clean up. At the end of the&#xD;
           1st (for PTs) or the 2nd (for individuals with stroke) learning sessions, a 5min user&#xD;
           survey will be conducted to report the level of ease-of-use of the ReIn-Hand device.&#xD;
           During the 2nd learning session, the participant will also be re-tested on part of the&#xD;
           clinical assessments, however, this time with the assistance of the ReIn-Hand device.&#xD;
           Each of these 2 visits is expected to last about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-training 2nd baseline clinical measures (lab-based). Within one week prior to&#xD;
           starting the Home-based practice, a research PT will conduct the 2nd baseline clinical&#xD;
           measures, which will repeat the 1st baseline clinical measures with an additional&#xD;
           quantitative measure of maximal hand opening area and closing force (QMHOC). For QMHOC,&#xD;
           pressure sensors (Pressure Profile Systems, Inc., Los Angeles, CA 90045) in conjunction&#xD;
           with portable Moire Phase Tracking cameras (Metria Innovation, Inc., Wauwatosa, WI) will&#xD;
           be used. The whole QMHOC will take about 10 minutes, and the whole 2nd baseline clinical&#xD;
           measure session will take about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pre-training EEG measures (lab-based). Within one week prior to starting the Home-based&#xD;
           practice and within one week following completion of the 12-week Home-based practice,&#xD;
           the participant will take part in an EEG experiment. During this session, a 9x9 mm&#xD;
           marker will be placed on the tip of each finger, with another on the back of the hand as&#xD;
           reference, which will allow for the measure of the position and angle of the&#xD;
           fingers/hand by 2 portable Moire Phase Tracking cameras (180 Hz; Metria Innovation Inc.&#xD;
           Milwaukee, WI). In addition, surface EEG electrodes will be mounted on a stretchable&#xD;
           fabric cap based on the 10/20 system. A Polaris Krios handheld scanner and reflective&#xD;
           markers (NDI, Ontario, Canada) will be used to record the EEG electrode positions&#xD;
           compared to the coordinate system defined by the nasion, inion, and pre-auricular&#xD;
           notches. Eye movement detection electrodes will also be placed on the supra- and&#xD;
           infra-orbital margins for detection of vertical eye movement. EMG will be recorded from&#xD;
           the extensor carpi radialis, flexor carpi radialis, and deltoid of the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once prepared, the participant will be seated in an experimental chair with: 1)&#xD;
           adjustable straps across the shoulders and waist to maintain proper posture, 2) paretic&#xD;
           forearm attached to an orthosis that is linked to the ACT-3D, a robot that will provide&#xD;
           required arm support, 3) hand around a cylinder with a custom pressure sensor mat&#xD;
           (Pressure Profile System Inc., CA). The participant will be instructed to perform 1 of 2&#xD;
           movements: 1) hand opening while resting on a haptic table, or 2) hand opening while&#xD;
           lifting against 50% of their maximum shoulder abduction force. The investigator will&#xD;
           measure scalp recordings and EMG recordings using a 160-channel EEG/EMG system using&#xD;
           active electrodes (Biosemi, Inc., Active II, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), hand opening&#xD;
           area or finger flexion force.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Home-based practice. After above 5 lab-based visits, participants will take the&#xD;
           ReIn-Hand device, including the FHO, the mobile device with ReIn-Hand software, and the&#xD;
           electronic stimulator (300 PV, Empi, Minnesota, USA, a FDA approved clinical device)&#xD;
           back home. At home, participants will perform 20 trials of pre-set tasks, like reaching&#xD;
           and grasping, per session (1 hour), 1 session per day, 7 days per week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
           During these 12 weeks, the participant will visit the lab once per week to make&#xD;
           necessary device changes, and perform part of the clinical assessments and QMHOC measure&#xD;
           without the ReIn-hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Post-training tests (lab-based). The sessions #4 mentioned above will be repeated at one&#xD;
           week and 3-month after the 12-week home-based practice. The session #5 will be repeated&#xD;
           at one week after the 12-week home-based practice. All the post-training tests will be&#xD;
           preformed without ReIn-hand device.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Box and Blocks Test (BBT) Score across the 12 weeks of the intervention, immediately after conclusion of intervention, and 3 months post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured pre-intervention (within 1 week prior to intervention), 1 time per week during intervention, immediately after conclusion of intervention (within 1 week), and at a 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are seated at a table, facing a rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments of equal dimensions by means of a partition. One hundred and fifty small wooden cubes or blocks are placed in one compartments or the other. The individual is instructed to move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other for a period of 60 seconds. The BBT is scored by counting the number of blocks carried over the partition from one compartment to the other during the one minute trial period. Patients hand must cross over the partition in order for a point to be given, and blocks that drop or bounce out of the second compartment onto the floor are still rewarded with a point. Multiple blocks carried over at the same time count as a single point.</description>

    <measure>Change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment Motor (FMA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured pre-intervention (within 1 week prior to intervention), 1 time per week during intervention, immediately after conclusion of intervention (within 1 week), and at a 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after stroke evaluates and measures recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. It is used in both the clinical and research settings, and is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of motor impairment. Areas of assessment include activities of daily living, functional mobility, and pain. Different movements are judged on the individuals ability to perform with full capacity, limited capacity, or total inability to complete the movement. Scores range from 0-66, with 0 and 66 representing no and normal residual upper extremity motor function, respectively.</description>
