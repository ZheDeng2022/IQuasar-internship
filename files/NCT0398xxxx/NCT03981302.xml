    <textblock>
      This study assumes that family nursing will enhance the management of chronic nonmalignant&#xD;
      pain (CNP) for the patients and their family members. CNP accounts for a major healthcare&#xD;
      problem with a thorough impact on several levels. Living with CNP is a condition of life,&#xD;
      that calls for acceptance, but due to the invisible nature of CNP, the patients often&#xD;
      experience a lack of understanding and doubt about the condition´s reality making acceptance&#xD;
      challenging. Research indicates that the involvement of relatives has a positive effect on&#xD;
      the management of CNP. An existential need for individualised adapted involvement is&#xD;
      expressed by patients and relatives. Family nursing has the potential to comply with the&#xD;
      expressed need but is not investigated on patients with CNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to explore if an intervention with systematic family nursing&#xD;
      conversations with patients with chronic nonmalignant pain and their selected family members&#xD;
      is effective on primary self-efficacy and secondary family function, quality of life and&#xD;
      anxiety/depression. The intervention is based on the concept of &quot;family systems nursing&quot;&#xD;
      developed by Wright and Leahey. Besides usual treatment, the intervention consists of 3-4&#xD;
      structured conversations each 1,5 hour between the nurse, the patient and their selected&#xD;
      family members. Previous to the intervention, the involved nurses will go through a family&#xD;
      nursing course of three days duration. During the intervention, regular reflection sessions&#xD;
      will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is quasi-experimental with a baseline- and a post-test in two comparable&#xD;
      groups of patients and their selected family members: An intervention group and a control&#xD;
      group. The design is chosen to prevent contamination of the control group data if the nurses&#xD;
      change behaviour regarding families after participating in the course. Collection of data&#xD;
      from the control group will be completed before the course. In the intervention group, a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment will be conducted four months after the post-test. Structured telephone&#xD;
      interviews will obtain the selected self-reported outcomes from patients and their family&#xD;
      members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (World-Medical-Association, 2008). The Data Protection Agency has approved the study with&#xD;
      j-number VD-2019-152. According to The Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics,&#xD;
      there is no obligation to notify the study (record number: H-19016896).&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assumes that family nursing for the patients with Chronic nonmalignant pain (CNP)&#xD;
      and their family members by increased self-efficacy will enhance the management of the&#xD;
      changed life condition and alleviate the related suffering of the family. The study has a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental design and is the first sub-study of a superior mixed methods study&#xD;
      consisting of a total of three sub-studies. The other substudies apply qualitative designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNP is usually understood as pain with a duration of at least three months with no relation&#xD;
      to life-threatening causes. CNP accounts for a major healthcare problem with a thorough&#xD;
      impact on several levels. Nineteen per cent of the adult European population has been found&#xD;
      to suffer from moderate to severe CNP, which decreases physical and mental health, ability to&#xD;
      work, wellbeing and quality of life. Additional mortality is increased. CNP has consequences&#xD;
      for the patients´ social network as well and is associated with a poorer family function. The&#xD;
      relatives get affected themselves with reduced physical and mental health. Living with CNP is&#xD;
      a condition of life, that calls for acceptance. But CNP is an invisible illness, and despite&#xD;
      the considerable impact, the patients often experience a lack of understanding and doubt&#xD;
      about, whether the CNP is real. In the strive to achieve a legitim sick role and help to&#xD;
      alleviate the suffering, patients with CNP continually seek out the health care system. The&#xD;
      expenses at the socioeconomic level are compared to other chronic diseases comprehensive.&#xD;
      Thus, gaining acceptance of CNP may be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involvement of relatives for patients with CNP is sparsely described in the literature, but&#xD;
      indicates, that involvement increases marital satisfaction and contribute to a better outcome&#xD;
      for both patients and spouses. Managing CNP necessitates &quot;being on the same page&quot;, and&#xD;
      involvement of relatives is vital to obtain a common understanding. Within other disease&#xD;
      areas, the involvement of relatives has resulted in reduced stress for spouses, closer family&#xD;
      relations and increased family function. Thus, it may be assumed that the involvement of&#xD;
      relatives has a positive effect on the management of CNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study exploring experiences, needs and preferences of the patient, relatives&#xD;
      and pain specialists regarding the involvement of relatives in chronic pain trajectories&#xD;
      indicates that patients and relatives have an existential need for individualised adapted&#xD;
      involvement. Family nursing based on the concept of &quot;family systems nursing&quot; developed by&#xD;
      Lauren Wright and Maureen Leahey has the potential to comply with the expressed need. Wright&#xD;
      and Leahey´s understanding of family nursing is inspired by the postmodernism and biology of&#xD;
      cognition and based on theories of systems, communication, cybernetic and change. The nurse&#xD;
      must simultaneously concentrate on both patient and family and focus on interaction,&#xD;
      reciprocity and connection between different systems, consisting of the patient, the family&#xD;
      and the larger system they are a part of. Family nursing aims to change restricting beliefs&#xD;
      and alleviate illness suffering. The essential components of the family systems nursing&#xD;
      concept comprise the clinical practice models: The Illness Beliefs model and the&#xD;
      Calgarymodels. The illness beliefs model illuminates the family's different beliefs about&#xD;
      their problems. The Calgary models consist of the Calgary family assessment model and the&#xD;
      Calgary intervention model and aim to support change and help the family to find new ways to&#xD;
      handle the illness. In the family assessment, the nurse may use the concrete assessment&#xD;
      tools: Genogram and ecomap to draw the internal and external structures of the family. The&#xD;
      intervention model is focusing on strength and resilience in the family instead of deficits&#xD;
      and dysfunction and describes the cognitive, affective and behavioural interventions the&#xD;
      nurse may use to facilitate change. Family nursing and the clinical practice models are&#xD;
      operationalised within a therapeutic relationship between the nurse, the patient and the&#xD;
      family members, making the conversation fundamental to perform family nursing. Using&#xD;
      questions during the conversations is essential to create new perspectives and alleviate&#xD;
      suffering. Questions may provide information for both the nurse and the family, and an&#xD;
      invitation to tell about illness experiences may on its own be a healing intervention. There&#xD;
      is a distinction between two kinds of questions making a dichotomy. Assessment/linear&#xD;
      questions are investigating and intend to provide information for the nurse.&#xD;
      Interventional/circular questions invite to reflection, initiate change and encourage the&#xD;
      family members to understand their problems in new ways and find new solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarised CNP is a condition with radical consequences on several levels. Due to the&#xD;
      chronicity of the condition, management is necessary, but the impact and invisibility of CNP&#xD;
      impede this discipline. It is assumed that the involvement of relatives will strengthen&#xD;
      patient's and family members self-efficacy and benefit the process of acceptance. Family&#xD;
      nursing based on the family systems nursing concept has the potential to comply with the need&#xD;
      for individualised adapted involvement expressed by patients and relatives but has not been&#xD;
      investigated on patients with CNP. Family nursing interventions in other illness areas have&#xD;
      shown positive. An integrative review describing the reactions from diseased families, who&#xD;
      participated in family nursing interventions finds that the family response corresponds to&#xD;
      the intention of family nursing. However, there is a need for further illness specific and&#xD;
      quantitative research since existing knowledge primary is based on qualitative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate, whether an intervention with systematic&#xD;
      conversations with patients with chronic nonmalignant pain and their selected family members&#xD;
      in a context of family nursing is effective on primary self-efficacy and secondary family&#xD;
      function, quality of life and anxiety/depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of&#xD;
      Neuroanaesthesiology, The Neuroscience Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention with family nursing is based on the previously described concept of &quot;family&#xD;
      systems nursing&quot;. The intervention will consist of structured conversations named &quot;family&#xD;
      nursing conversations&quot; between the nurse, the patient and up to three selected family members&#xD;
      on 15 years or older. In the framework of family systems nursing the family is widely&#xD;
      understood as a group of individuals who are bound by strong emotional ties, a sense of&#xD;
      belonging, and a passion for being involved in one another's life. Thus, the notion of family&#xD;
      members goes beyond relationships connected by law or genetic. Family nursing will, during&#xD;
      the conversations, be operationalised by the selected components from the concept. The&#xD;
      specific use of the components cannot be standardised since family nursing must be tailored&#xD;
      to match the needs of the specific family. Each conversation takes 1,5 hour. Every family are&#xD;
      offered three or four family nursing conversations as needed with roughly three weeks&#xD;
      interval. All patients also receive the usual treatment from the Multidisciplinary Pain&#xD;
      Centre. Previous to the intervention, the involved nurses will go through a three days family&#xD;
      nursing course, and will during the intervention participate in regular reflection sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is quasi-experimental with a baseline- and a post-test in two comparable&#xD;
      groups of patients and their selected family members: An intervention group and a control&#xD;
      group. In the intervention group, a follow-up assessment will be conducted four months after&#xD;
      the post-test. The design is chosen because the number of nurses in the chosen clinical&#xD;
      setting is limited. All the nurses must participate in the family nursing course and will&#xD;
      subsequently likely change their behaviour regarding the involvement of family members. The&#xD;
      control group will be recruited at the beginning of the study to prevent contamination of&#xD;
      data when the nurses' after the course have developed competencies to care for the whole&#xD;
      family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured telephone interviews will obtain the selected self-reported outcomes from patients&#xD;
      and their family members. By this, the amount of missing data is expected to be minimal. All&#xD;
      participants consisting of the patients and their selected family members are assessed by the&#xD;
      same outcome measures. The primary outcome is General self-efficacy scale (GSE), and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are Iceland-Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ),&#xD;
      quality of life (SF12) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The study&#xD;
      comprises a self-designed questionnaire for the patients and their family members with the&#xD;
      chosen outcomes, socio-demographic data and health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is based on the primary outcome GSE and the results from Scholz et al. 20002&#xD;
      regarding psychometric findings from 25 countries, including Denmark. Based on the average&#xD;
      GSE on 29,716, with a significance level on 95% (α = 5), a power on 80 % (β = 20), a desired&#xD;
      MIREDIF on 15% between the control group and the intervention group plus a calculated drop&#xD;
      out on 25%, the sample size is calculated to 25 patient/family dyads in each group. Thus, a&#xD;
      total of 50 patient/family dyads must be included. A patient/family dyad consists of one&#xD;
      patient and a maximum of three selected family members. If the patient drops out, the entire&#xD;
      dyad drops out. If a family member drops out, the dyad is retained in the project, when at&#xD;
      least one family member continues. If all family members drop out, the dyad drops out as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be described from the selected questionnaires using conventional descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, parametric statistics as regards normally distributed variables and&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics as regard variables, that differs from the normal distribution.&#xD;
      Logistic regression analyses are carried out to describe GSES-10, ICE-EFFQ, SF12, and HADS&#xD;
      for patients and family members, who receive family nursing conversations and usual&#xD;
      treatment. These are compared to patients and family members, who only receive usual&#xD;
      treatment. Connections to socio-demographic data and health information will be described.&#xD;
      The reporting of the study will attempt to meet the recommendations from The Joanna Briggs&#xD;
      Institute Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies (non-randomized experimental studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study has&#xD;
      been reported to the Data Protection Agency and is approved with j-number VD-2019-152.&#xD;
      According to The Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics, there is no obligation&#xD;
      to notify the study (record number: H-19016896). The patients and their family members will&#xD;
      receive written and oral information about the project according to the guidelines from the&#xD;
      Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics and rules about time to think it over&#xD;
      will be followed. Written consent will be obtained, and verbal consent will be obtained&#xD;
      before each telephone interview. Data will be anonymised throughout the analysis process and&#xD;
      in all forms of reporting of the results. The aim is to include at the maximum three family&#xD;
      members of each patient, but if the patient caused by this is forced to choose between the&#xD;
      family members, the number of family members may be adjusted. Likewise, children younger than&#xD;
      15 years may be included, if it is considered proper and unethical to refrain from doing it.&#xD;

    <description>General self-efficacy refers to global confidence in one´s coping ability across a wide range of demanding or novel situations. GSE is tested in 25 countries, including Denmark, and GSE is suggested to be a universal construct. GSE consists of ten items with every four categories of answers varying from &quot;not at all true&quot; to &quot;exactly true&quot;. Thus the score can range from 10 to 40. The higher the score, the higher the general self-efficacy. The average GSE is 29,716, but there is no cut-off score.</description>

    <description>ICE-EFFQ is developed by the conceptual framework of Calgary Family Assessment Model for families, who experience acute or chronic illness. ICE-EFFQ measure family function within the last four weeks and consists of 17 items within four categories: Expressing emotions, collaboration and problem-solving, communication and behaviour. It uses a Likert scale with a scoring range from 1 (almost never) to 5 (all the time). The score can vary between 17 and 85. A high score indicates a good family function, but no exact cut-off score distinguishes between optimal or less optimal family function.</description>

    <description>SF-12 is the short form of a generic international quality of life instrument with 12 items, often used to asses health results and health-related quality of life. SF-12 measures self-reported health-related physical and mental quality of life. The SF12 provides data within the two main categories: Physical and mental health, each divided into four health domains. The total raw scores in each health domain are transformed into 0-100 scores, again transformed into T-scores. A higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

HADS consists of two subscales for respectively anxiety and depression with every seven items and measures self-reported symptoms the last seven days. The items are rated on a four-point scale and scored from 0-3 with total scores in each subscale ranging from 0-21. Scores between 0-7 represent no case, scores between 8-10 indicates mild cases, scores between 11-15 indicates moderate cases, and scores from 16 and above suggests severe cases.</description>
