    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, randomized, subject- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      mode-of-action study to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of fevipiprant compared to&#xD;
      placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in 48 moderate to severe asthma patients with sputum and&#xD;
      blood eosinophilia.&#xD;

      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of fevipiprant&#xD;
      (QAW039) compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment in moderate to severe asthma&#xD;
      patients with an elevated sputum eosinophil count (≥ 2%) and high blood eosinophil count (≥&#xD;
      250 cells/μL). This study is also designed to investigate the effects of fevipiprant on key&#xD;
      inflammatory cells bearing the DP2 receptor (such as eosinophils, Th2/Tc2 cells, and ILC2&#xD;
      cells) in sputum and blood.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a non-confirmatory, mode-of-action, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomized, subject and investigator blinded study in 48 moderate to severe asthma patients, who are on at least medium dose ICS, with or without other asthma controller and with elevated sputum eosinophils count of ≥ 2% of the total cell count from an induced sputum specimen and a peripheral eosinophil count ≥ 250 cells/μL of blood. They should be on standard of care asthma medications for 4 weeks prior to screening with no past or current medical history of other chronic or severe pulmonary diseases. Randomized patients will be treated with fevipiprant or matching placebo for up to 98 days. A group of 10 healthy subjects will also be recruited to examine baseline levels of prostaglandins and DP2-related biomarkers and compare them to biomarker data from asthma patients at baseline and after therapy with fevipiprant.&#xD;
Healthy volunteers will not receive study treatment.&#xD;

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a subject and investigator-blinded study. Subjects, investigators and all site staff will remain blinded to study treatment throughout the study.&#xD;
Unblinding a single subject at site for safety reasons (if necessary for subject management) will occur via an emergency system in place at the site.&#xD;
The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of study drugs that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, and odor.&#xD;
The sponsor may be unblinded to the study treatment at any time, especially in case of a safety concern.</masking_description>
