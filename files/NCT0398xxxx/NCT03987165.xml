  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study is evaluating the impact of music therapy on neonates, specifically&#xD;
      infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). The goal is to study the effect of&#xD;
      music therapy on an infant's behavioral (i.e feeding patterns, sleep patterns, severity of&#xD;
      withdrawal) and physiological systems (i.e. heart rate, respiratory rate). The investigators&#xD;
      are also studying the impact of music therapy on the infant's utilization of resources (i.e.&#xD;
      total opioid usage and total length of stay).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The research will be carried out at the Tulane Lakeside Hospital for Women and Children.&#xD;
      Caregivers of eligible infants will be approached by the medical team during the infants stay&#xD;
      at the hospital and asked if they would be willing to hear more about this study. Fliers will&#xD;
      be provided and also posted so that pregnant mothers or mothers who see the flier can also&#xD;
      find out more about the study and decide to participate. Mothers may contact the study&#xD;
      directly. Alternatively the medical team will ask the caregiver if the research team can&#xD;
      contact them to set up a time to talk to them about the study. If the caregiver agrees then&#xD;
      the contact information for the caregiver will be provided to the research team who will&#xD;
      schedule an in person meeting to go over the protocol and obtain consent. The PI or one of&#xD;
      the research team will meet with the infant's parent/legal guardian, review the study&#xD;
      explaining all music therapy methods that will be used, explain the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation, answer all questions and ask for consent to allow infant to participate in the&#xD;
      study, to allow researchers to audio-video record the music therapy session, and to allow&#xD;
      researchers to review medical records of the parent/legal guardian and infant to obtain&#xD;
      information for the Data Collection Form regarding the infant's gestational age, race,&#xD;
      ethnicity, gender, diagnosis, pregnancy and delivery complications, results of the any&#xD;
      laboratory work, infant medication history, and daily withdrawal Scores over the study&#xD;
      period, or until infant's medical discharge. Infants will still be able to participate in the&#xD;
      study if the caregiver does not consent to audio-visual recording. Informed consent and HIPAA&#xD;
      forms will be obtained electronically via REDCap, including electronic capture of the&#xD;
      mother's signature as well as consenting research assistant's signature, and the original&#xD;
      electronic copy of the informed consent and HIPAA forms are maintained in the REDCap&#xD;
      database, accessible only by study personnel as listed in the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent has been obtained, the parent/legal guardian will complete the&#xD;
      following questionnaires and surveys: Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACE), Duke&#xD;
      Functional Support System Questionnaire (FSSQ), Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), Postpartum&#xD;
      Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ), Prenatal Life Events Scale (PLES Revised), Perinatal Stress&#xD;
      Scale:NICU (PSS:NICU), the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and the COVID-19 Exposure and&#xD;
      Family Impact Survey (CEFIS). The parent/legal guardian does not have to be present, but can&#xD;
      be present for all music sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy interventions will take place over the course of five days. The anticipated&#xD;
      length of stay in the hospital for infants with NOWS or iatrogenic exposure to opioids is 21&#xD;
      days and for healthy full term infants is two to three days; however per institutional&#xD;
      protocol, infants exposed to long-acting opioids in utero could be monitored up to 72-96&#xD;
      hours prior to discharge to monitor for signs of withdrawal. We will continue study&#xD;
      procedures until completion of the music therapy treatment schedule, or until infant's&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital if infant is discharged before completing all music therapy&#xD;
      sessions. We will not interfere with standard medical care and therefore recognize that&#xD;
      infants without NOWS will receive less days of music therapy in general, however the&#xD;
      consistent daily administration of music therapy will provide some ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a cross-over design with participants undergoing music therapy once daily&#xD;
      (either morning or afternoon) using a Song of Kin, defined as a familiar song used to lull&#xD;
      the infant to sleep. If Song of Kin is not provided, the default lullaby will be &quot;Twinkle&#xD;
      Twinkle Little Star.&quot; In addition, there will be sessions of standard nursing care with no&#xD;
      treatment intervention (CON). Counterbalancing will be achieved by assigning a different&#xD;
      order of presentation of conditions for each group. Each day, infants will receive a music&#xD;
      therapy session lasting up to 20 minutes using the above mentioned technique. The music&#xD;
      therapy session will be in the morning or afternoon depending upon which treatment group the&#xD;
      participant is assigned to. There will not be any visits by the music therapist during&#xD;
      sessions that the infant is to receive standard nursing care with no treatment intervention&#xD;
      (morning/afternoon). Over the 5 day period (all week, including weekends) participants will&#xD;
      experience conditions in the following order (with music therapy sessions designated as &quot;MT&quot;&#xD;
      and control data only designated as &quot;C&quot;):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (AM - music therapy, PM - control) Day 2 (AM - control, PM - music therapy) Day 3 (AM -&#xD;
      music therapy, PM - control) Day 4 (AM - control, PM - music therapy) Day 5 (AM - music&#xD;
      therapy, PM - control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 (AM - control, PM - music therapy) Day 2 (AM - music therapy, PM - control) Day 3 (AM -&#xD;
      control, PM - music therapy) Day 4 (AM - music therapy, PM - control) Day 5 (AM - control, PM&#xD;
      - music therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first session, a research assistant will place electrodes on the infant so that&#xD;
      they study team can gather sympathetic and parasympathetic response non-invasively using&#xD;
      MindWare Portable Lab System (MindWare Technologies, Gahanna, Ohio). These electrodes will&#xD;
      remain on the infant throughout each session and be removed via adhesive removing pads&#xD;
      following each session's data collection. This will minimize discomfort to the infant&#xD;
      secondary to electrode removal and minimize risk of skin irritation by leaving electrodes in&#xD;
      place for a proloned period of time. The medical team will complete the standard hospital&#xD;
      withdrawal scoring scale for each infant with NOWS or suspected to have NOWS following unit&#xD;
      policy. Withdrawal scores will not be collected on newborns who are not thought to have NOWS.&#xD;
      Data related to the NOWS symptoms and medical conditions will be obtained from medical&#xD;
      records. Additional observational data before and after the music sessions will be collected&#xD;
      by the research assistant, including descriptions of where the session is conducted&#xD;
      (isolette/bassinette), activity level, vital signs, sleep/wake pattern, sucking pattern, and&#xD;
      any other observed behaviors throughout the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research materials and data collection tools are submitted with this IRB&#xD;
      package: Data Collection Form and Key, Medical Abstraction Form, Music Therapy Session Notes,&#xD;
      Support System Questionnaire (FSSQ), Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), Postpartum Bonding&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PBQ), Prenatal Life Events Scale (PLES Revised), Adverse Childhood Experiences&#xD;
      (ACE) Scale, Duke Functional Support System Questionnaire (FSSQ), Perinatal Stress Scale:NICU&#xD;
      (PSS:NICU), the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact&#xD;
      Survey (CEFIS) and Research Code Identification Sheet.&#xD;
