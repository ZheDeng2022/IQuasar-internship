      The objective of this study is to evaluate angiographic confirmation of placement of any&#xD;
      guidewire beyond the CTO, in the true vessel lumen, in patients undergoing CTO percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) in which at least one Teleflex guidewire and at least one&#xD;
      Turnpike catheter are used.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, single-arm, intent-to-treat, literature-controlled clinical&#xD;
      study. The study will be conducted in up to 15 investigational sites in the U.S. This study&#xD;
      will enroll up to 150 patients to provide adequate powering for hypothesis testing and an&#xD;
      evaluable sample size of at least 135 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for this study is participants with signs and/or symptoms considered typical&#xD;
      of ischemic heart disease attributed to a de novo CTO in a native coronary artery who are&#xD;
      suitable candidates for a percutaneous revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study devices include the GuideLiner® V3 catheter, TrapLiner® catheter, Turnpike® catheter,&#xD;
      and a series of five coronary guidewires (SpectreTM guidewire, R350TM guidewire, RaiderTM&#xD;
      guidewire, WarriorTM guidewire, and BanditTM guidewire). All study devices are currently&#xD;
      510(k) cleared for non-CTO indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GuideLiner catheters are intended to be used in conjunction with guide catheters to&#xD;
           access discrete regions of the coronary and/or peripheral vasculature, to facilitate&#xD;
           placement of interventional devices, and to assist in crossing de novo chronic total&#xD;
           occlusions (CTO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The TrapLiner catheter is intended for use in conjunction with guide catheters to access&#xD;
           discrete regions of the coronary and/or peripheral vasculature, to facilitate placement&#xD;
           of interventional devices, to facilitate the exchange of an interventional device while&#xD;
           maintaining the position of a guidewire within the vasculature, and to assist in&#xD;
           crossing de novo chronic total occlusions (CTO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Turnpike catheters are intended to be used to access discrete regions of the&#xD;
           coronary and/or peripheral vasculature. They may be used to facilitate placement and&#xD;
           exchange of guidewires, to subselectively infuse/deliver diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
           agents, and to assist in crossing de novo coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO). The&#xD;
           Teleflex guidewires are intended for use in percutaneous procedures to introduce and&#xD;
           position catheters and other interventional devices within the coronary and peripheral&#xD;
           vasculature, including use in crossing or assisting in crossing de novo coronary chronic&#xD;
           total occlusions (CTO).&#xD;
