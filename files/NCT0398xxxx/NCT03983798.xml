    <textblock>
      In french context, simulation training is not well implemented in medical school, mainly in&#xD;
      psychiatry. We aim to build a formative and summative assessment tool of competences specific&#xD;
      to this pedagogic context, so as to support its development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This studies aims to explore learning process and factors supporting or preventing from&#xD;
      learning of medical students during simulation in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenient sample of 72 voluntary participants, allocated among 6 groups of around 12&#xD;
      students, will be recruited at Paris Descartes, Paris Diderot and Brest Universities between&#xD;
      september of 2018 and june of 2019. Each participant will complete 6 hours of psychiatric&#xD;
      simulation training, dealing with mood disorders, anxious disorders, eating disorders,&#xD;
      borderline disorders, substance abuse and schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be offered to complete a portfolio about learning process during the&#xD;
      trimester they are involved, a concept gap before and after each training and the &quot; Learning&#xD;
      Effectiveness Inventory Scale &quot;at the end of simulation. A purposive sample of students will&#xD;
      have to complete a face-to-face semi-interview (until reaching data saturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video record of simulation and audio-record of debriefing will be analysed to enhance&#xD;
      triangulation process of analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the end of the nineties, pedagogical transformations question traditional pedagogical&#xD;
      system which supports a passive learning from master to student, trying to overcome classical&#xD;
      &quot; teaching paradigm&quot; to &quot; learning paradigm &quot;. Despite several critics, the notion of &quot;&#xD;
      professional competence &quot; emerges as one of the essential purpose of learning. Competence&#xD;
      might be defined as &quot; complex ability that professional built, starting from a specialized&#xD;
      knowledge base, developed and controlled by a collegial peer who constitute the profession &quot;,&#xD;
      implying &quot; a reflexive practice inside and after action &quot; which creates or increases new&#xD;
      competence in return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in french context, this paradigmatic revolution didn't really happened yet, including&#xD;
      in psychiatry. Moreover, there are no engineering didactic work on specific skills required&#xD;
      by a physician (psychiatrist or not) should have in care of a patient with psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. For instance, skills required when a surgeon has to deliver a &quot;clear, loyal and&#xD;
      adjusted&quot; information to a patient with a schizophrenia ; and try to get his or her agreement&#xD;
      so as to operate a intestinal blockage? As a matter of facts, no integrated competence&#xD;
      referential will be able to be a reference in this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a report which is nowadays a reference for the faculties of medicine all over the world,&#xD;
      the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (CRMCC) define a framework of&#xD;
      essential skills that each physician have to control: medical expertise, erudition ;&#xD;
      communicational and relational abilities; collaboration ; professionalism ; management;&#xD;
      health promotion. In the French context, skills that each medical student have to provide fo&#xD;
      the psychiatric speciality are defined by 33 questions of national classifying exam (ECN).&#xD;
      The &quot; Psychiatry and Addictology Referential &quot; points to medical students the reference&#xD;
      knowledge to provide to respond to these questions during the challenge of ECN. But this&#xD;
      referential doesn't explain skills, abilities and attitudes required with a patient with&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The places of providing essential skills defined by CRMCC applied in French psychiatry (as&#xD;
      relational and communicational skills for instance) are thus often situated in others spaces.&#xD;
      Realization of well supervised clerkship in psychiatry constitutes for example one of the&#xD;
      privilege way of skills acquisition. Nonetheless in French context, all the undergraduate&#xD;
      students can benefit from psychiatry during their clerkship; especially because of the&#xD;
      rarefaction of well supervised internship (decreasing demography of psychiatrist), associated&#xD;
      with increase number of medical student over the past few years. Moreover, realization of an&#xD;
      only internship can not include all the diversity of main family situation that should be&#xD;
      known by each physician; mainly because of dichotomy of internship between adult and child&#xD;
      and adolescent psychiatry, specific populations specific who go to different service&#xD;
      according to there trouble (emergencies, closed unit, expert diagnosis centers…). Providing&#xD;
      pedagogical tools allowing acquisition of basic skills, abilities and attitudes&#xD;
      (complementary to knowledge and know-repeat) to care patient with psychiatric disorders seems&#xD;
      thus interesting, for improving medical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, assessment modalities determine for students work methodology and time involved in&#xD;
      each learning, following Hawthorne effect. Assessments support learning assessed, involving&#xD;
      long term memory, following &quot; testing effect &quot; ; and hierarchize planning of ulterior&#xD;
      learning activities. Trials of ECN in this current shape will probably value acquisition of&#xD;
      declarative knowledge for students who would like to succeed in the competition; to the&#xD;
      detriment of know-how and life skills. These skills to care patients who suffer from&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders won't be neither provided during a specialty residency, unless it might&#xD;
      be especially oriented to psychiatry. Thus, it seems important to wider summative assessment&#xD;
      modalities in psychiatry during undergraduate medical studies, so as to value acquisition of&#xD;
      the wall skills required for a physician in care of a patient with psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
      Which implies precise explanation of skills, abilities and attitudes needed, to balance&#xD;
      success of ECN with their acquisition. In that context, simulation can offer a good response&#xD;
      to this double aim : formative et summative. However, if some theorical approach are&#xD;
      references to understand learning process in simulation, very few learning tool are validated&#xD;
      in simulation, and none, to our knowledge, did a modelisation on learning process in&#xD;
      psychiatric simulation for medical students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore learning process in a simulation training using simulated patients&#xD;
      in psychiatry for 5th year medical students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is one of the 3 studies included in a PhD on learning process during simulation&#xD;
      training in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this 3 studies will aim at building a formative and summative assessment tool&#xD;
      of competences specific to this pedagogic context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
