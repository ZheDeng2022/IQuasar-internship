  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this arm of the study is to find the best way to give patients this&#xD;
      investigational product and determine if it can treat advanced melanoma by stimulating the&#xD;
      immune system. PV-001-DV is an attenuated (weakened) strain of dengue virus developed as a&#xD;
      potential preventative vaccine for dengue fever by the US Army as Dengue Virus-1 #45AZ5. This&#xD;
      is the first time PV-001-DV will be given to patients with melanoma. Up to 4 dose levels of&#xD;
      PV-001-DV will tested in this arm. PV-001-DV (at the lowest dose) will be given to a group of&#xD;
      3 people. As each dose level is found to be safe, it will be given to another other 3 people&#xD;
      at the next higher dose level, for a total of up to 10 people in this study. Investigators&#xD;
      will monitor patients carefully for any harmful side effects. The side effects in people&#xD;
      cannot be completely known ahead of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be progressing after having completed prior therapy with a PD-1 / PD-L1&#xD;
      antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4. If the patient is positive for BRAF, the&#xD;
      patient must have progressed on at least one BRAF inhibitor in addition to a PD-1 / PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitor alone or in combination with CTLA-4 for metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a prescribed amount of PV-001-DV injected into one of their melanoma&#xD;
      tumors. Scans will be performed during the study at different times to see if their tumors&#xD;
      have changed in size. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested&#xD;
      for changes to the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
