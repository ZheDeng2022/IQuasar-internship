    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which pulmonary embolism (clot) can be&#xD;
      dissolved when treated with a very low dose of a systemic thrombolytic drug (clot buster)&#xD;
      along with standard anticoagulant therapy as compared to the standard of care anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy alone.&#xD;

      The OVERALL OBJECTIVE of this investigation is to determine whether very low-dose intravenous&#xD;
      tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA] (24 mg) + standard anticoagulation therapy&#xD;
      (intravenous heparin) for treatment of acute PE (pulmonary embolism) in intermediate-high&#xD;
      risk patients will have superior clot lysis (breakdown of clot) by chest CTA (computed&#xD;
      tomography angiography) at 24 ± 6 hours post infusion compared to standard of care treatment&#xD;
      alone. Acute intermediate-high risk PE patients are those with acute symptoms &lt;14 days),&#xD;
      simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI)&gt;0, normal systemic arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure (&gt;90mmHg) without vasopressor support, elevated biomarkers (troponin or BNP), and&#xD;
      evidence of RV dysfunction (right ventricular to left ventricular ratio&gt;0.9).The study is&#xD;
      planned to evaluate the reduction in clot burden based on the obstruction index using the&#xD;
      Refined Modified Miller Score (RMMS), improvement in right ventricular (RV) function, and&#xD;
      overall safety in the two treatment groups. 40 Subjects with intermediate-high risk PE&#xD;
      (hemodynamically stable PE with a RV/LV ratio ≥ 0.9, elevated biomarkers, and sPESI&gt;0) will&#xD;
      be recruited and randomized to one of two treatment groups: 24mg of systemic (IV) tPA + IV&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin versus saline placebo + IV unfractionated heparin. After delivery of&#xD;
      the systemic (IV) tPA/placebo, patients will continue IV unfractionated heparin therapy for&#xD;
      at least 24 hours. If there is no evidence of active bleeding nor significant hemoglobin drop&#xD;
      (i.e., ≥ 2 mg/dL), patients will be transitioned to standard dose apixaban, 10 mg twice-daily&#xD;
      x one week followed by 5 mg twice-daily for at least 6 months. Some patients will require&#xD;
      indefinite apixaban therapy based on patient-specific factors, including unprovoked nature of&#xD;
      PE event, and/or persisting DVT/PE risk factors. Finally, consideration will be given for&#xD;
      decreasing the apixaban dose to 2.5 mg twice-daily after 6 months. Apixaban was selected as&#xD;
      the anticoagulant of choice due to its very favorable bleeding profile in large clinical&#xD;
      trials, which is an important consideration when prescribing an anticoagulant following&#xD;
      systemic thrombolysis. Within 24 ± 6 hours post study drug infusion, a repeat chest CTA and&#xD;
      echocardiogram will be performed. sPESI will also be calculated at this timepoint.At Day 30,&#xD;
      180 and 365, all subjects will have clinic visits which will include a physical exam, repeat&#xD;
      echocardiogram if previous echo was abnormal, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, assessment of adverse and bleeding events and a review of concomitant&#xD;
      medications including compliance with apixaban. At Days 3, 7, 90 and 270, a remote health&#xD;
      check will occur via telephone or email assessing adverse and bleeding events, alongside a&#xD;
      review of concomitant medications (including an assessment of compliance with apixaban).The&#xD;
      standard of care for patients with submassive PE is to either receive anticoagulant therapy,&#xD;
      EKOS (Catheter Assisted Thrombolysis) or thromboectomy. tPA is given at the FDA approved dose&#xD;
      (100mg) occasionally at doses much higher than our study proposes. PatientS with PE will have&#xD;
      the initial CTA, echocardiogram and lab work as standard of care. The follow up CTA is&#xD;
      usually standard of care at Day 30 and the follow up echocardiograms are considered standard&#xD;
      of care if the previous echocardiogram was abnormal.The study is being done as a proof of&#xD;
      concept that low dose tPA is effective in clot lysis and will result in far less risk than&#xD;
      the FDA dose. If our study achieves its aims, the research will advance clinical practices in&#xD;
      treating pulmonary embolism by reporting the safety of lower dose tPA and opening&#xD;
      opportunities to further explore the use of lower dose tPA to improve patient safety and&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
