  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of adding a palliative care intervention&#xD;
      for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) to current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care is comprehensive, coordinated interdisciplinary care for patients and&#xD;
      families facing a potentially life-threatening illness. This consists of specially trained&#xD;
      teams of professionals including physicians, nurses, social workers, and chaplains that&#xD;
      provide care and support in inpatient and outpatient settings. While the specific assistance&#xD;
      and support provided by the Palliative Care Service depends on individual patient and family&#xD;
      needs and preferences, it may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain and symptom management&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Psychosocial and spiritual support&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assistance with treatment choices&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Help in planning for care in the community&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and heterogeneous fibrotic lung disease.&#xD;
      It is universally fatal, with an average time to death between two to five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IPF experience significantly diminished quality of life and increased symptom&#xD;
      burden. Besides dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and deconditioning, patients with IPF experience&#xD;
      significant depression and anxiety. The benefit of palliative care has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      several other diseases, notably, in metastatic lung cancer. Patients with metastatic lung&#xD;
      cancer who were seen by palliative care at the time of their diagnosis and throughout their&#xD;
      disease course were found to have increased survival, improved quality of life, and received&#xD;
      less aggressive care at the end of their life. This finding has prompted significant research&#xD;
      in the role of palliative care in other diseases, including chronic lung disease. A&#xD;
      non-blinded, randomized trial of a multi-disciplinary breathlessness service intervention in&#xD;
      patients with advanced disease including cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease (ILD), and congestive heart failure demonstrated improvement in&#xD;
      breathlessness, anxiety, and even survival. Specific Aim 1: Determine if quality of life is&#xD;
      improved with a palliative care intervention. Specific Aim 2: Determine if depression and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms are decreased with a palliative care intervention. Secondary aims include an&#xD;
      examination of pulmonary function tests (PFT), number of hospitalizations, and overall&#xD;
      mortality as an effect of a palliative care intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 10-item survey with scores ranging from 1 to 27 and with higher scores indicating greater levels of depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is a commonly-used pulmonary function test (PFT) measuring lung function. Greater spirometry output will be considered a measure of greater treatment efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of diffusing capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diffusing capacity is a commonly-used pulmonary function test (PFT) measuring the transfer of gas from air in the lung to the red blood cells in lung blood vessels. Greater diffusing capacity will be considered a measure of greater treatment efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of lung volume</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lung volume is a commonly-used pulmonary function test (PFT) measuring the volume of inhaled or exhaled air. Greater lung volume will be considered a measure of greater treatment efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of 6-minute walk distance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>6-minute walk distance will be considered as a measure of invention efficacy, with an increase in 6-minute walk distance considered a measure of greater treatment efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total number of hospitalizations due to any cause</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of hospitalizations due to any cause will be considered as a measure of intervention efficacy, with decrease hospitalizations in the treatment group considered a measure of greater treatment efficacy.</description>
