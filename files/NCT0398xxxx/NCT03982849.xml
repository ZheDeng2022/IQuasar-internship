  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial will be done on 92 patients , randomly divided into two groups by&#xD;
      lottery method to compare the efficacy and safety of topical silymarin cream 0.7% with&#xD;
      topical 4% hydroquinone cream. Patients will be treated for 3 months and for the next 3&#xD;
      months will be followed up for relapse of melasma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A comparative study done by Nofal A et al, comparing the effectiveness and safety of topical&#xD;
      silymarin versus hydroquinone, concluded that silymarin cream can be used as more potent and&#xD;
      safer treatment option for the treatment of melasma.8 Two different concentrations of&#xD;
      silymarin cream (0.7% and 1.4%) were used in this study and the results showed that both the&#xD;
      groups have no statistically significant difference in terms of therapeutic response (mean of&#xD;
      percentage reduction in MASI was 39.21 for 0.7% silymarin cream group and 33.84 for 1.4%&#xD;
      silymarin cream group). Additionally relapse cases were identified in 7.14% of patients in&#xD;
      both the groups. This shows that silymarin used at low concentration can prove to be more&#xD;
      potent than at high concentration when it comes to effectiveness, cost and adverse effects.&#xD;
      Therefore, I will compare 0.7% silymarin cream with 4% hydroquinone cream in my clinical&#xD;
      trial for the treatment of melasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of this study is to observe the effects of this alternative treatment option and&#xD;
      compare it with the first line drug so that it can be recommended in the guidelines as an&#xD;
      alternative treatment option for melasma. The study by Nofal at al. was done in Egypt where&#xD;
      most if the people have type 4 skin and environmental conditions are also similar to&#xD;
      Pakistan. However a very small population group was included in the study. I want to do the&#xD;
      same interventional trial on a larger population size to validate silymarin as an effective&#xD;
      and safer treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending ANTH dermatology out patient, fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      inducted. Informed written consent will be taken from the enrolled patients and&#xD;
      confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. A detailed history will be taken&#xD;
      focusing on duration and onset, family history, any relation to pregnancy, effect of exposure&#xD;
      to sun, systemic inquiry and prior treatment sought. Fitzpatrick skin type and melisma&#xD;
      pattern will be assessed. Melasma type will be assessed with the help of Wood's light&#xD;
      examination. The severity of melasma will be assessed using MASI score. Random distribution&#xD;
      of patients will be done through lottery method. Group A will be treated with topical&#xD;
      hydroquinone 4% cream applied once daily at night and group B with silymarin 0.7% cream&#xD;
      applied twice daily. All the patients will be advised to have proper sun protection measures,&#xD;
      use physical protection like umbrella or a P cap and a wear sunscreen having a sun protective&#xD;
      factor of at least 60. Patients will be advised not to use topical retinoids or any other&#xD;
      product containing peroxide in it and not to apply the cream near eyes, mouth or nose.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to do a patch test on volar aspect of arms for 3 days before starting&#xD;
      the treatment on face and immediately stop the treatment and report if she develops erythema&#xD;
      and/or burning sensation with either drug. Digital photography will be taken at baseline and&#xD;
      after every month during the treatment course till three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be booked for follow up at 1 month interval for 6 months. Treatment will be&#xD;
      given for 3 months and will be followed up for the next 3 months (during which patients will&#xD;
      be using only sun protection measures) to observe relapse of melasma. On follow up visits&#xD;
      during treatment period, history will be taken regarding compliance to treatment and drug&#xD;
      tolerance. The MASI score will be calculated at baseline and each follow up visit. Clinical&#xD;
      efficacy will be assessed in terms of percent reduction in MASI score from baseline. Any&#xD;
      adverse effect of treatment and patient's satisfaction using the short assessment of&#xD;
      patient&lt;s satisfaction will be measured at each visit. Information will be recorded on&#xD;
      specially designed performas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 25. Data will be presented as mean Â± SD for quantitative variables (age, percent&#xD;
      reduction of MASI, Short Assessment of Patient Satisfaction) and frequency with percentages&#xD;
      for categorical variables (sun exposure, family history, previous therapy, melasma type,&#xD;
      melasma pattern, melasma severity, burning and erythema). Independent sample t-test will be&#xD;
      used to compare percent reduction in MASI score between both treatment groups at each follow&#xD;
      up. Paired sample t-test will be used to compare the MASI score with baseline at each follow&#xD;
      up visit within both groups. Chi-square test will be applied to compare the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, and safety in terms of any side effect between both groups throughout the study&#xD;
      period. P-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
