    <textblock>
      This clinical report describes a technique for ridge splitting, and gradual expansion in the&#xD;
      maxilla with simultaneous implant placement with in the split ridge, with the preservation of&#xD;
      the thin buccal plate of bone for proper blood supply.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the procedures will perform under local anesthesia (mepivacain with levonordefrin).&#xD;
      Horizontal Atrophic maxillary sectors will use for the development of the treatment sequence.&#xD;
      All the patients will prepare initially with study models that permitted surgical and&#xD;
      prosthetic planning as well as the non-strict surgical guide for intraoperative use. After&#xD;
      application of conventional local anesthesia techniques, a full thickness incision 3 line&#xD;
      pyramidal flap will be expose the defect ridge. The incision will extend to the next tooth or&#xD;
      at least 5 mm more posterior from the end of the osteotomy indicated, securing direct&#xD;
      observation of the alveolar crest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a direct view of the alveolar crest, if the ridge presented a width close to 1.5 mm, the&#xD;
      ARST was performed immediately; if it presented less than 1.5 mm, then it was worn down with&#xD;
      a diamond bur (low speed motor at 1800 rpm) to reduce the height, obtaining an improved&#xD;
      alveolar crest width up to approximately 1.5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this condition the bone splitting technique could be performed using the piezoelectric&#xD;
      system (Piezotome2Â¨, Satelec Action, France), calibrating the device on the D1 setting and&#xD;
      using profuse saline irrigation. The preparation sequence was begun with the CS3 insert until&#xD;
      a total depth of 10 mm was achieved across the entire extension of the ridge. The procedure&#xD;
      continued with the CS1 insert and finally the CS2 insert. The CS% insert was used in two&#xD;
      patients with the possibility of widening the osteotomy segment; this sequence always&#xD;
      achieved a complete extension in depth of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group the vertical bone cuts through the cortical layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the distal end of the horizontal split: a vertical cut was made with the high-speed&#xD;
           bur within the vicinity of the buccal plate of bone; for the start of the separation.&#xD;
           With a full vertical depth of 13 mm. Final design of the splitting cut was (L-SHAPE)&#xD;
           SPLIT The control group the vertical bone cuts through the cortical layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the distal and mesial end of the horizontal split: a vertical cut was made with the&#xD;
           high-speed bur within the vicinity of the buccal plate of bone; for the start of the&#xD;
           separation. With a full vertical depth of 13 mm corresponding and joining the previous&#xD;
           vertical cut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the expander to do the implants bed.-Preparation of the implant bed in the mesial end&#xD;
      of the horizontal split using the spreading kit.-The final size spreader in the first implant&#xD;
      osteotomy site with the first spreader in the second implant bed 3 mm apart. Dental implant&#xD;
      placement. Placing the first implant in place while the separation kept preserved .placing&#xD;
      the last spreader in the second implant osteotomy site. Bone deficiency is addressed by&#xD;
      filling with osteoplastic material; a bio resorbing barrier membrane is arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT assessment For the calculation of marginal bone loss(MBL), the implant will use as a&#xD;
      reference by adjusting the cross-sectional long axis in the center of the implant and&#xD;
      bisecting it (showing the buccolingual and mesiodistal dimensions). On the cross-sectional&#xD;
      view, a line will draw just parallel to the implant, starting at the crest of the labial&#xD;
      plate of bone and ending at the apical level of the implant; height will recorded in&#xD;
      millimeters. The same process was repeated from the palatal direction. The panoramic view&#xD;
      (longitudinal cut) will utilized to calculate the mesial and distal bone heights in&#xD;
      millimeters.&#xD;
