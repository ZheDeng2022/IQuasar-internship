  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pioneer study demonstrated a proof of concept for IS-FISH with the new ISX technology. This&#xD;
      state of the art technology has been recently acquired by the CHU of Amiens. In the present&#xD;
      study the investigators want to establish a workflow for simultaneous immunostaining and&#xD;
      characterization of FISH cytogenetic pathological signals with the imaging flow cytometer&#xD;
      ISX, such as chromosomic gains, losses and translocations in multiple myeloma (MM). The gold&#xD;
      standard technology for the detection of prognostic cytogenetic aberrations in MM is a FISH&#xD;
      analysis after bone marrow (BM) plasma cells sorting (PCS).2,3 In MM, plasma cells isolation&#xD;
      is usually based on CD38 and/or CD138 expression. Cytogenetic risk stratification is guided&#xD;
      by the detection of 4 chromosomal aberrations: TP53 and CDKN2C deletions, CKS1B gains and&#xD;
      t(4;14) translocation. Thanks to ISX technology the investigators may avoid cumbersome task&#xD;
      of cell sorting (outsourced service for our hospital) meanwhile measuring precisely and&#xD;
      qualitatively aberrant FISH signals on a large amount of cells.&#xD;

      In a first time (period of 6 months), the development will be performed on CD38 and/or CD138&#xD;
      expressing cell lines. Regular FISH protocols will be finely tuned to fit immunophenotyping&#xD;
      and cells in suspension constraints needed in IS-FISH. In a second time, the protocol will be&#xD;
      applied to MM BM. Cells from BM aspiration will be processed and analysed on the ISX in&#xD;
      Amiens. Based on last years local activity, this step is expected to last 2 years, so as to&#xD;
      be able to obtain 5 samples from patients harbouring of each prototypical cytogenetic&#xD;
      aberration above described. Inclusions will be guided by the results of PCS conducted before&#xD;
      the first treatment initiation. Finally the results will be compared with PCS.&#xD;

Development of the technique of the first period will be made in order to test :&#xD;
the ability to measure FISH and immunostaining signals simultaneously&#xD;
the ability to count a number of FISH spots consistent with ploidy (eg 1 X centromeric signal for men, 2 for women).</description>

    <description>Combination of immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and FISH in suspension (IS-FISH) may provide both cytogenetic and phenotypic information for a large number of cells in a single test. In this scope, a recent study demonstrated a proof of concept for IS-FISH to detect non pathological signals with the new ImageStream X technology (ISX).1</description>
