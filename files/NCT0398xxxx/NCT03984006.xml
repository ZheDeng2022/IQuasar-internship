    <textblock>
      Autoimmune thyroid disease revealed close relationship with heart failure, including the&#xD;
      entities of subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Heart failure is a principal&#xD;
      complication of all forms of heart disease. The American College of Cardiology defines HF as&#xD;
      a complex clinical syndrome that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or inject&#xD;
      blood. In fact, it may be caused by a defect in myocardial contraction, by an impairment in&#xD;
      ventricular filling with preserved systolic function ('diastolic HF') or by a combination of&#xD;
      both. Earlier detection of probable trend of heart failure in subclinical thyroid diseases is&#xD;
      very important in not only Taiwan, Pan-Asia, but all over the aging world. However, it is not&#xD;
      currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 20 patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, subclinical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism, and collect their urine specimens in outpatient clinic per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic biological markers via this prospective study. The study was designed as&#xD;
      prospective pattern, and the investigators will enroll clinical and subclinical thyroid&#xD;
      disease with quarterly follow-up, then detect urine exosomal proteins NT-proBNP. The&#xD;
      investigators try to find the correlation of outcome with unknown/fresh biomarkers in this&#xD;
      study with time-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to find earlier predicting biomarkers for heart dysfunction in&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid disease.&#xD;

      Clinical and subclinical thyroid disease is usually used to describe patients with mild&#xD;
      symptoms correlated to hyperthyroid or hypothyroid state. Thyroid ultrasonography could&#xD;
      differentiate benign or malignant nodular lesion, together with fine needle aspiration&#xD;
      cytology and surgical pathology. Thyrotropin (TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone) is the&#xD;
      pivotal investigation in laboratory diagnosis to define subclinical thyroid diseases. An&#xD;
      elevated TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels in serum is defined to be&#xD;
      subclinical hypothyroidism, and a subnormal TSH with normal thyroid hormone concentrations to&#xD;
      be subclinical hyperthyroidism. Generally, the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism and&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism were reported as 4% -10% &amp; 1%-2% in general population, respectively.&#xD;
      Although subclinical thyroid disease is prevalent, there is still no consensus for screening&#xD;
      clinical and subclinical thyroid disease, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, nodular&#xD;
      goiter and thyroid cancer. Under consideration of age, gender or familial history of&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid disease. However, screening for thyroid dysfunction should be considered&#xD;
      in some high risk patients, including 1) elderly; 2) history of atrial fibrillation; 3)&#xD;
      previous thyroid disease history; 4) other confirmed autoimmune diseases; 5) neck exposure of&#xD;
      radiation (for example, nasopharyngeal cancer, post-radiation); 6) family history of probable&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid disease, and 7) pregnant state with prior thyroid disease history.&#xD;
      Therapeutic decision for clinical and subclinical thyroid dysfunction should be considered&#xD;
      individually. Therapeutic options will be anti-thyroid medications and/or radioactive iodine,&#xD;
      and thyroidectomy could be considered with larger goiters for hyperthyroidism. For clinical&#xD;
      and subclinical hypothyroidism, the therapeutic consideration should be aimed on reduction of&#xD;
      progression to overt hypothyroidism, improving heart function, correction of dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      and relieving senescence depressive mood. Thyroid ultrasonography will help us to keep long&#xD;
      term observation of thyroid structural change. But long term outcome for treatment of such&#xD;
      functional and structural thyroid diseases had not been recorded delicately in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Further investigations should be observed in the future. The investigators hope to check the&#xD;
      relationship between various thyroid diseases and biochemical survey/ultrasonography. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is aiming for early prevention and detection the potential risk factors&#xD;
      for thyroid diseases in Taiwan.&#xD;
