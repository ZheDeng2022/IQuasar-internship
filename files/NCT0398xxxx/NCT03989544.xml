  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, randomized, open label, parallel group study designed to&#xD;
      compare tezepelumab PK exposure in healthy subjects following single subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      administration of a fixed dose of tezepelumab by using vial and syringe, APFS, or AI. A total&#xD;
      of 315 subjects will be randomized to receive a single, fixed dose of tezepelumab&#xD;
      administered SC using vial-and-syringe, APFS, or AI at 1 of 3 injection sites: abdomen, thigh&#xD;
      or upper arm. Separate randomization lists will be produced for each weight group (50 to &lt; 70&#xD;
      kg, 70 to &lt; 80 kg, 80 to 90 kg), and within each of the 3 weight groups, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of the 9 combinations of treatment (vial-and-syringe, APFS,&#xD;
      or AI) with injection site (abdomen, thigh, upper arm). Within each weight group, at least 36&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized resulting in at least 12 subjects per treatment group (device)&#xD;
      within each weight group.&#xD;
