  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is among the most widespread in the male population and represents 20%&#xD;
      of all cancers diagnosed from the age of fifty, in Italy. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      is a common strategy of treatment that is used for increase survival. However, ADT is&#xD;
      associated with significant side effects, such as fatigue, loss of muscle mass and strength,&#xD;
      cognitive decline and reduced quality of life, with an increased the risk for falls and&#xD;
      fractures, cardiometabolic syndrome and cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numerous side effects from ADT could potentially be countered by the regular Physical&#xD;
      Exercise (PE), with favorable effects on body composition, physical performance, bone health&#xD;
      and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to maintain the results obtained, PE must be undertaken regularly, becoming a&#xD;
      healthy habit of life. The patient motivation is therefore a fundamental element for&#xD;
      guaranteeing adherence to the intervention and its integration into people's lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim is to analyzed patients with PCa at the time of diagnosis regarding their&#xD;
      lifestyle, includes regular PE, and motivation to make changes about their habits. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will describe the perceived barriers by patients about this&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will allow the development of an experimental intervention of PE,&#xD;
      associated with therapeutic education, and assess its impact on the health of patient&#xD;
      undergoing ADT, considering the realistic possibilities of application in the daily life of&#xD;
      these patients, testing its feasibility and safety, the compliance and the satisfaction of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be invited to an interview guided by open-ended questions, focused on&#xD;
      collecting information related to the usual lifestyle, the motivation to undertake healthy&#xD;
      changes and the perceived barriers to adopting an healthy lifestyle. In particular, the&#xD;
      interview is focused on collecting the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the level of PE: type, frequency and intensity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the presence of health risk factors such as smoking, eating and drinking habits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the presence of cognitive disorders, investigated through the Mini Mental State&#xD;
           Examination and through some questions aimed at catching the subjective perception of&#xD;
           one's cognitive state;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the stage of motivation to the adoption of healthy lifestyle that includes regular PE;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the perceived barriers to one's ability to change one's lifestyle by adopting a regular&#xD;
           habit of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the interview, all patients will receive information about the importance of adopting&#xD;
      a healthy lifestyle for the prevention of various diseases and even more to counteract the&#xD;
      negative effects of PCa care. By adopting the Transtheoretical Model of Change (by Prochaska&#xD;
      and DiClemente), will be identified the stage of motivation to change the risk factor&#xD;
      identified through the interview. Consequently, these patients will receive a personalized&#xD;
      message, with the aim of promoting change to healthy behavior. All patients will be informed&#xD;
      about the existence and purpose of the Life Style Service in collaboration with LILT (Italian&#xD;
      League for the Fight against Cancer) of the Health Information Service, active at CORE, at&#xD;
      the Santa Maria Nuova Hospital in Reggio Emilia. In particular, patients in the&#xD;
      &quot;contemplation stage&quot; will be informed about the possibility of contacting the clinic&#xD;
      spontaneously at any time.The researcher will send the request to the public health clinic.&#xD;
