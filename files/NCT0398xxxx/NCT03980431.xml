  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-labeled phase II diagnostic clinical trial to explore the safety and&#xD;
      clinical value of FBY in suspected adult brain tumor patients. The investigation regarding&#xD;
      the clinical value of FBY includes 1) the metabolic characteristics of FBY in suspected&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors; 2) role of FBY to differentiate tumor progression from&#xD;
      pseudoprogression. A single dose of 0.10 mCi/kg FBY will be intravenously injected for PET&#xD;
      examination. Quantitative features will be extracted to analysis the PET images. Cranial MRI&#xD;
      (with contrast enhancement) will also performed as diagnostic comparison with FBY. For&#xD;
      patient who took surgery after multiple examination, histopathology, molecular pathology and&#xD;
      LAT-1 immunohistochemistry will also be obtained.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FBY is a new PET tracer derived from tyrosine, with the carboxyl group replaced by boron&#xD;
      trifluoride, and is transferred across cell membrane through LAT-1. LAT-1 is a sodium&#xD;
      independent amino acid transporter and is highly expressed in tumor cells. Considering the&#xD;
      significant role in cancer development as well as in nutrient delivery, FBY could be a&#xD;
      promising PET tracer to reflect altered metabolism in tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim to observe the safety of FBY, and investigate the diagnostic value of FBY in&#xD;
      the patient with suspected brain tumors. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria are&#xD;
      included in clinical trials after fully communicating the condition, explaining the benefits&#xD;
      and risks of clinical trials, clarifying the patient's willingness to include the clinical&#xD;
      trial, and signing informed consent. The cohort number, FBY administrative dose, imaging&#xD;
      protocols are decided based on the investigators' preliminary data. The diagnosis and&#xD;
      post-examination treatment are based on the recommended guideline, combined with the&#xD;
      subject's own situation for standardized diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
