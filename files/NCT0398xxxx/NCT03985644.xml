    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is an optimal radical therapy for selected patients with hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. Hangzhou criteria could safely and effectively expand Milan criteria with expanded&#xD;
      population and comparable survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Hangzhou&#xD;
      criteria in a multi-center cohort.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths worldwide. Among all the liver cancer cases, hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) constitutes 75-85%. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HCC and&#xD;
      is in high demand in China. The advent of Milan criteria has helped to select the recipients&#xD;
      reasonably. However, the organ allocation system driven by the Milan criteria seemed to be&#xD;
      too strict so that many centers worldwide have expanded the criteria in the aspects of&#xD;
      morphological features, histopathology and biomarkers. Hangzhou criteria introduce the&#xD;
      covariables of histopathologic grading and α-fetoprotein (AFP) into the selection of&#xD;
      recipients for the first time. Based on the multi-center HCC patient cohort undergoing&#xD;
      transplantation, this study aims to characterize an ideal candidate selecting system beyond&#xD;
      the Milan criteria.&#xD;

        Patients aged ≥18 years and &lt;=75 with HCC who underwent a primary whole or split liver&#xD;
        transplant from a deceased donor were eligible for enrollment at the time of transplant.&#xD;
        All of patients were histologically confirmed HCC by postoperative pathological examination&#xD;
        in the participating centers. The donor-to-recipient arrangements all conformed to the&#xD;
        principle of ABO compatibility. Key exclusion criteria were incomplete follow-up, missing&#xD;
        essential data for analysis (tumor size, number, differentiation grade, α-fetoprotein&#xD;
        (AFP)) or vascular invasion according to radiological criteria, and excludes those with&#xD;
        perioperative mortality (&lt;30 days)&#xD;
