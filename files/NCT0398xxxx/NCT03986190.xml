    <intervention_name>Healthy Juntos</intervention_name>
    <description>Parent-adolescent dyads will log in to a secured website for a total of eight weeks. The intervention will be delivered primarily through smartphones and will include didactic content on healthy lifestyle behaviors (for parents/adolescents), family behavior change content for setting weekly goals and self-monitoring health behaviors (for parents/adolescents), and positive parenting content (for parents only), all of which were developed in accordance with participant feedback based on formative intervention development work. In addition, and to increase participant compliance/reduce attrition often observed in digital health interventions, human support (&quot;supportive accountability&quot;) will be provided. Specifically, each family will be assigned a &quot;coach&quot; who will use video conferencing software or phone to engage in weekly 15-30 minute conversations with parents regarding their family's progress throughout the intervention period.</description>
