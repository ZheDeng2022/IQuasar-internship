  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use formal measures to monitor the outcome of using&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy to treat self-injurious behavior in adults with Autism Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder for whom psychotropic medication has not worked. This study will be fundamentally&#xD;
      different from the previously published literature on the subject in that this will be a&#xD;
      prospective study which will aim to recruit multiple participants in an open label study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. They must have a&#xD;
      confirmed ASD diagnosis and be generally healthy. As part of the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the participant must have an appointment with their primary care provider or a&#xD;
      hospital internist to complete a physical exam and required tests (EKG, CXR [chest x-ray],&#xD;
      CMP [Comprehensive Metabolic Profile], CBC [Complete Blood Count], and head CTscan). At the&#xD;
      first pre-treatment appointment (Visit 1), the participant and their legal guardian will&#xD;
      review and sign the consent and assent forms with the investigator. The legal guardian also&#xD;
      sign a Sentara Norfolk General Hospital release of medical information. The guardian will&#xD;
      then fill out the ASD Diagnostic Checklist, Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised, and the&#xD;
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The physician will complete the Self-Injury Trauma Scale, which&#xD;
      documents the number, type, and severity of unhealed self-injury traumas. At the end of the&#xD;
      Visit 1, the guardian will receive a Subject Diary Card to record the number of self-injury&#xD;
      episodes per day, the number of aggressive episodes per day, and the perceived severity of&#xD;
      episodes that day. The Diary Card also has space to record the medication taken by the&#xD;
      participant every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second pre-treatment appointment (Visit 2) will consist of a complete psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluation with review of all medical evaluations. The subject must receive medical clearance&#xD;
      to undergo ECT treatment. The first Diary Card will be collected at this time, and a second&#xD;
      Diary Card will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving medical clearance, participants (accompanied by their guardians) will begin&#xD;
      to receive ECT treatments. They will receive ECT 3 times a week for 4 weeks, for a total of&#xD;
      12 treatments (Visits 3- 14). All ECT treatments will take place in the Outpatient Surgery&#xD;
      and Diagnostic Unit of Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, and will be performed by Dr. Shriti&#xD;
      Patel or Dr. Justin Petri. All subjects will receive bilateral ECT. Participants will be&#xD;
      placed under general anesthesia (Etomidate) and given a primary muscle relaxant&#xD;
      (Succinylcholine). An anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist will be present and will&#xD;
      hyperventilate the patient to lower their seizure threshold. The first ECT treatment (Visit&#xD;
      3) will determine the participant's seizure threshold. Subsequent ECT treatments (Visits&#xD;
      4-14) will be determined by the acting psychiatrist based on the patient's seizure threshold.&#xD;
      Following the procedure, the patient will recover in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the course of the treatment, guardians will continue filling out the Diary Card.&#xD;
      Once treatment begins, guardians will be asked to also include any side effects of the&#xD;
      treatment noted by themselves or the participant. Guardians will turn in and receive new&#xD;
      Diary Cards weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After acute ECT treatment is complete, patients and their guardians will return to Eastern&#xD;
      Virginia Medical School (EVMS) Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences for&#xD;
      post-treatment appointments (Visits 15-18). At these post-treatment appointment guardians&#xD;
      will complete the ASD Diagnostic Checklist, Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised, and the&#xD;
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The psychiatrist will complete a second Self-Injury Trauma&#xD;
      Scale. At this time the Diary Card will be collected and subjects will receive Diary Cards&#xD;
      for 1 month. Visits 15-18 will occur at 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months post -&#xD;
      acute ECT treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects and their legally-appointed guardians will participate in a total of 18 visits over the course of 1 year. Visits 1 and 2 will occur during weeks 1 and 2. These visits will be for psychiatric and medical evaluations and will take about 1 hour each. Visits 3-14 will take place three times a week for four weeks. These visits will be for the ECT treatments and will take about 2-3 hours each. Visit 15 will take place 1 week post-treatment and visit 16 will take place 4 weeks post-treatment. Guardians will keep a daily diary card between visits 1 and 16, spanning a time of 10 weeks. Visits 17 and 18 will take place at 6 months and 12 months, respectively, and take about 1 hour each.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in Self-Injury Trauma Scale (SIT) across time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Injury Trauma Scale (SIT). This scale allows differentiation and quantification of self-injury completed by the physician based on a complete medical assessment, location of injury, type of injury, number of injuries, and an estimate of severity.&#xD;
Scales include:&#xD;
Number Index (NI) - Scores range from 0 (no current injuries) to 5 (17 or more current injuries)&#xD;
Severity Index (SI) - Scores range from 0 (no current injuries) to 5 (maximum severity of current injuries)&#xD;
Estimate of Current Risk - Scores range from Low (no current injuries or a lower level of injuries) to Moderate (any abrasion/laceration near the eyes OR any contusion except on the head) to High (any moderate contusion on the head OR any severe abrasion/laceration or contusion)</description>

    <measure>Changes in Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) across time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 43-item revised scale is specifically intended to assess the variety of repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD, grouped into 6 categories: 1) stereotyped behavior, 2) self-injurious behavior, 3) compulsive behavior, 4) ritualistic behavior, 5) sameness behavior, and 6) restricted injurious behavior.&#xD;
All items are scored from 0 (behavior does not occur) to 1 (behavior occurs and is a mild problem) to 2 (behavior occurs and is a moderate problem) to 3 (behavior occurs and is a severe problem).&#xD;
Scale scores for the above 6 scales include:&#xD;
Number of Subscale Items Endorsed: The total number of items in each scale rated 1, 2, or 3 (per scale)&#xD;
Total Subscale Score: The sum of the ratings for all items in that scale (per scale)&#xD;
Overall Number of Items Endorsed: The sum of all &quot;Number of Subscale Items Endorsed&quot; (combined scales Total score)&#xD;
Overall Score: The sum of all &quot;Total Subscale Scores&quot; (combined scales Total score)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) across time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 58-item measure useful for evaluation inappropriate and maladaptive behavior with five subscales: 1) Irritability, Agitation, Crying; 2) Lethargy, Social Withdrawal; 3) Stereotypic Behavior; 4) Hyperactivity, Noncompliance; and 5) Inappropriate Speech.&#xD;
All items are scored from 0 (Not at all a problem) to 3 (the problem is severe in degree).&#xD;
Each of the 5 scales includes a sum of scores for items on that scale, ranging from [0] (no problem with this measure) to [12 to 48, depending on the scale] (severe problem with this measure).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in ASD Diagnostic Checklist (ADC) across time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 7, 11, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 30-item instrument designed after the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule), ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised), and DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V) criteria for autism, used to assess: 1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, 2) difficulties in communication, and 3) restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.&#xD;
All items are scored &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.&#xD;
Scale scores are the sum of the number of &quot;Yes&quot; responses for each scale. Scores range from [0] (zero &quot;Yes&quot; responses equivalent to no ASD-related behaviors) to [6 to 14, depending on the scale] (all &quot;Yes&quot; responses equivalent to higher ASD-related behaviors).&#xD;
Total Score includes the sum of all items with a &quot;Yes&quot; response, ranging from 0 (no ASD-related behaviors) to 30 (higher ASD-related behaviors)</description>
