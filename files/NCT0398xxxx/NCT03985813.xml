  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening Wizard (SW). Primary Care Providers (PCPs) are often uncertain about how to best&#xD;
      refer adolescents who screen positive for depression or suicidality. Screen-positive youth&#xD;
      who are either not in treatment, or express dissatisfaction with current treatment will be&#xD;
      consented by an on-site research assistant (RA). Those parents and patients receiving SW will&#xD;
      answer additional questions: adaptive screens developed in a previous NIMH study (MH100155)&#xD;
      for suicidal risk, anxiety, and mania; perceived barriers; and preferences about treatment.&#xD;
      SW generates recommendations for PCPs reflecting patient clinical needs and preferences.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening Wizard will be delivered by Primary Care Providers (PCPs) at well child visits,&#xD;
      beginning with screening occurring within the waiting room which will yield decision support&#xD;
      guidance delivered and followed by the PCP at that same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilized an open trial design. A stepped wedge design was originally proposed and&#xD;
      efforts were made to adhere to this study design, however after a year of low recruitment and&#xD;
      resultant recruitment sites pulling out the of the study, the overall study design was&#xD;
      changed to an open trial. Additional recruitment sites were onboarded to the study and&#xD;
      provided with the intervention arm in order to obtain feasibility data on the intervention&#xD;
      components of the study. For reference a stepped wedge design involves the sequential random&#xD;
      rollout of an intervention over two time periods. Following a baseline period in which no&#xD;
      clusters (=practices) are exposed to the intervention, the crossover is typically in one&#xD;
      direction, from control to intervention and continues until both of the clusters have&#xD;
      crossed-over to receive the intervention, with observations taken from each cluster and at&#xD;
      each time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of Screening Wizard will increase the rate of personalized referrals&#xD;
      experts in specialty mental health would provide, compared to Treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Ultimately, this study design was an open trial after unsuccessful attempts to maintain initial recruitment sites in the study.&#xD;
This study initially attempted to use a stepped wedge design, which involves the sequential random rollout of an intervention over 2 time periods. Following a baseline period in which no clusters (= practices) are exposed to the intervention, the crossover is typically in one direction, from control to intervention and continues until both of the clusters have crossed-over to receive the intervention, with observations taken from each cluster and at each time period.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>At exit interview after Baseline phone visit. The baseline visit occurs 24-48 hours after initial screening and the exit interview call will be made within 1 month following the completion of the baseline phone assessment.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction to Screening Wizard will be assessed through a question developed by investigators to understand experience with the program. The question investigators have adapted from literature reviews on satisfaction is: &quot;If a friend were in need of a mental health referral, would you recommend Screening Wizard to him/her? The response options include: No, definitely not; No, I don't think so; Yes, I think so; Yes, definitely.</description>

    <description>Satisfaction with the technical components of interventions will be assessed through certain questions from the Post System Satisfaction and Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). The PSSUQ is 19 items with response options ranging from 1 to 7 where 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. The PSSUQ has sub-scores derived from subsets of the questions which reflect system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Questions from sub-domains were chosen to tailor the questioning to this particular intervention. Another question about the need to learn new things before using the app was asked to be rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1= strongly disagree and 5= strongly agree.</description>

Our form datasets will include original case report forms, a detailed codebook of variable names, value labels, and programming formats and all study documentation including the protocol and manual of procedures. For descriptive/raw data, study investigators/study staff will upload to NIMH's National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Health Illness (NDCT) on a semi-annual basis all analyzed data being uploaded prior to primary paper publication.</ipd_description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study design changed from a stepped wedge design to an open trial. As a feasibility trial, the study was not adequately powered to detect significant effects. In some cases, minor issues with the SW decision tree algorithm led to providers in the SW arm receiving guidance for a higher level of care than was necessary. It's possible that some documentation reviewed in the EHR was missing during the consensus and matching process between the EHR referral data and the SW report.</limitations_and_caveats>
