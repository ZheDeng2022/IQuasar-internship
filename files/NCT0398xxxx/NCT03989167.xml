      A cluster randomized study in the primary care setting to evaluate a computer-based clinical&#xD;
      decision support system to aid in the identification and management of patients with FH. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of the study is the number of patients diagnosed with FH at thirty months&#xD;
      after study initiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common cause of premature coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD). The prevalence of heterozygous FH has been estimated to be 1 in 500, but recent&#xD;
      studies estimate that the prevalence might be as high as 1 in 200. FH is an&#xD;
      autosomal-dominant genetic disorder caused by defects in the hepatic uptake and degradation&#xD;
      of LDL, primarily due to mutations in the genes coding for the LDL receptor, apolipoprotein B&#xD;
      (APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), or LDL-receptor associated&#xD;
      protein 1 (LDLRAP1), resulting in high levels of LDL-C and total cholesterol . As a&#xD;
      consequence, patients with heterozygous FH have a significantly increased risk of developing&#xD;
      premature coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FH is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, and it is estimated that only a few percent of&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed adequately. In Sweden there are no official figures regarding the&#xD;
      prevalence of FH, but the patient association for FH recently published a report estimating&#xD;
      that only 21 % of the patients in Sweden have been diagnosed. Early treatment with lifestyle&#xD;
      changes and high doses of statins has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, reducing the risk of CAD with 40 - 70 % or more in treated&#xD;
      individuals as compared to not treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of FH has traditionally been based on a combination of clinical signs, family&#xD;
      history and cholesterol concentrations. Recently more emphasis has been placed on genetic&#xD;
      testing for establishing definitive diagnosis. In Sweden the long-term aim is to diagnose 80&#xD;
      % of all individuals with FH by 2025 according to the &quot;National Guidelines for Cardiac Care&#xD;
      2015&quot; published by The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision support (CDS) systems have shown promising results in improving healthcare&#xD;
      performance, but results are still conflicting and some studies have not been able to find&#xD;
      any clear improvement in quality of care or patient outcomes. Computer-based CDS systems have&#xD;
      previously been implemented to aid in the identification and management of patients with FH.&#xD;
      The results from these studies are promising; however, to the best of our knowledge, no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial has been conducted investigating the effects of a computer-based&#xD;
      CDS in FH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision support (CDS) systems are tools that can be used to raise awareness of&#xD;
      specific conditions, leading to more individuals being diagnosed and treated in accordance to&#xD;
      guidelines. Clinical decision support for Familial hypercholesterolemia (CDS-FH) is a cluster&#xD;
      randomized trial that will be conducted in the primary care setting in the county of&#xD;
      Östergötland, Sweden. The primary care clinics participating in the study will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 to CDS intervention or to control. Before the study is initiated all of the physicians&#xD;
      working at the participating primary care clinics will receive information regarding FH and&#xD;
      the associated risk for cardiovascular disease. Information regarding the study, FH and&#xD;
      technical aspects of CDS-FH will be available for the participating physicians throughout the&#xD;
      entire study period. The investigators intend to include all primary care clinics in the&#xD;
      County of Östergötland (n = 44). Participation is non-compulsory. The population in the&#xD;
      County of Östergötland is 467 158 inhabitants (December 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDS-FH has been developed in collaboration between Cambio Healthcare systems and Evry&#xD;
      Healthcare Systems (the suppliers of the EHR in the county of Östergötland), the Cardiology&#xD;
      Department at Linköping University hospital, Uppsala University and primary care&#xD;
      professionals in the counties of Östergötland. CDS-FH is activated when a physician attests a&#xD;
      cholesterol lab result in the laboratory section of the EHR. If the patient has high levels&#xD;
      of total cholesterol or LDL-C (Total cholesterol &gt; 8 mmol/l or LDL-C &gt; 5.5 mmol/l, adjusted&#xD;
      for age strata and ongoing treatment with cholesterol lowering medications), in combination&#xD;
      with other risk factors for FH (according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria),&#xD;
      a screen warning will appear informing the responsible physician that the patient may have&#xD;
      FH. On the other hand, if the patient does not have elevated levels of total cholesterol or&#xD;
      LDL-C, or if any exclusion criteria are met, no screen warning will appear when the&#xD;
      cholesterol lab-result is attested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By clicking on the warning screen that was activated due to high cholesterol levels, a window&#xD;
      will open displaying an overview of the patient's cholesterol values and prior diagnoses&#xD;
      recorded in the EHR that are consistent with premature CAD. A link to further information&#xD;
      regarding FH from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare is also provided. The&#xD;
      physician is thereafter urged to consider sending a referral to the local FH clinic, and to&#xD;
      prescribe or intensify treatment with lipid lowering medication. The referral is&#xD;
      automatically generated by the CDS application and the CDS also makes a short note in the EHR&#xD;
      regarding the suspicion of FH. The physician can chose to postpone the decision or make a&#xD;
      decision to refrain from sending the referral. In case the choice is made to refrain from&#xD;
      sending the referral the physician is asked to specify why in a mandatory short text comment,&#xD;
      in order to monitor the main reasons for not continuing the investigation of suspected FH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FH clinic will receive all the referrals generated by the CDS-FH and all referrals&#xD;
      generated as part of the regular routine in the region. All patients diagnosed with FH at the&#xD;
      FH-clinic will be registered and assigned to either the CDS intervention group or to the&#xD;
      control group. Any relatives currently residing in the County of Östergötland or in the&#xD;
      County of Uppsala that are diagnosed with FH as a result of cascade screening will also be&#xD;
      registered at the FH-clinic and assigned to either the CDS intervention group or to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is the number of probands (index patients) diagnosed with FH&#xD;
      at thirty-four months after study initiation.&#xD;
