    <textblock>
      A Quality Study in the use of Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit(PACU) in Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,&#xD;
      and the ability to bypass this unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to investigate the amount of patients who is required to be secondary&#xD;
      admitted to the PACU, after primary discharge from the operating room to the surgical ward,&#xD;
      thereby bypassing the PACU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to investigate the use of our standardized regimen for discharging&#xD;
      patients directly to the surgical ward, thereby bypassing the PACU. The anaesthesiology dept.&#xD;
      have a local standard operating procedure for doing this, and the patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This means that Patients will be discharged directly to the surgical ward if the following&#xD;
      criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  American Society of Anaesthesiologist-score (ASA-score) &lt; 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaesthesia and surgery without any complications, vital signs normal during the whole&#xD;
           procedure and not demanding oxygen supplement on the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloodloss &lt; 500 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative evaluation, Early Warning Score, and postoperative score documented in&#xD;
           Electronic Patient journal(EPJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will upon arrival at the surgery start a registration containing preoperative&#xD;
      data(baseline morbidity, sex, height, weight, type of anaesthesia and surgery), perioperative&#xD;
      data containing surgery and anaesthesia data, and postoperative discharge-score(local&#xD;
      operating procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge to either the surgical ward or the PACU, the patient will be observed closely&#xD;
      the first 2 hours while recording every intervention made by the nurse staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial 2 hours the recording goes on the next 24 hours recording every event and&#xD;
      intervention which lead to a doctor consult, by telephone or physically examining the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the investigators wish to evaluate the use of the discharge Score(Danish Society of&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and Intensive care Medicine(DASAIM)-SCORE), which is used as the discharge score&#xD;
      after surgery in other hospitals in Denmark, and the investigators therefore record this&#xD;
      after surgery, and every 30 minutes after the surgery for the first 2 hours.&#xD;
