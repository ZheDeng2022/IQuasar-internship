  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of rifampin or efavirenz on&#xD;
      the PK, safety, and tolerability of single doses of fedratinib in healthy subjects. Each&#xD;
      study part will consist of a nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, open-label design. The study&#xD;
      parts can be run in any order or in parallel. Subjects may participate in one part only. For&#xD;
      each part, subjects will participate as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period (includes baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up telephone call (4 days [± 2 days] after discharge) During the study, blood&#xD;
           samples will be collected at prespecified times for PK. Subject safety will be monitored&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper&#xD;
             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or postmenopausal (defined&#xD;
             as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal range according to the laboratory used at&#xD;
             Screening).&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the investigator at Screening and&#xD;
                  Baseline (prior to starting study treatment). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
                  testing during the course of the study, as applicable, and after end of study&#xD;
                  treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence from&#xD;
                  heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to&#xD;
                  use, and be able to comply with, any one of the following highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception methods without interruption, beginning at least 14 days prior to&#xD;

             of birth control (condoms not made from natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are&#xD;
             recommended]) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while receiving&#xD;
             study treatment, during any dose interruptions, and for at least 30 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be healthy, as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination (PE), clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12-lead&#xD;
             ECG at screening and check-in (Day -1), as applicable:&#xD;

             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin&#xD;
             must be at or below the upper limit of the reference range, on or before check-in (Day&#xD;
             -1). Other clinical laboratory results must be either within normal range or deemed&#xD;
             not clinically significant by the investigator. Any out of range lab tests may be&#xD;
             repeated up to one time during the screening period and up to one time at check-in per&#xD;
             Investigator discretion to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (inclusive), supine diastolic BP must be in the range of 50 to 90 mmHg (inclusive),&#xD;
             and pulse rate must be in the range of 40 to 100 bpm (inclusive) at screening. Repeat&#xD;
             vital signs may be measured at investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at screening; male subjects&#xD;
             must have a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value ≤ 430 msec&#xD;
             and females must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec. An ECG may be repeated up to two times,&#xD;
             and the average of the QTcF values will be used to determine subject eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History (ie, within 3 years) of any clinically significant neurological, GI, hepatic,&#xD;
             renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, hematological,&#xD;
             dermatological, psychological, or other major disorders as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that places the&#xD;
             subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study or&#xD;
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study (congenital nonhemolytic&#xD;
             hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is not acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has prior history of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has signs or symptoms of WE (eg, severe ataxia, ocular paralysis, or&#xD;
             cerebellar signs) without documented exclusion of WE by thiamine level and brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has thiamine deficiency, defined as thiamine levels in whole blood below&#xD;
             normal range according to institutional standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has active tuberculosis or another disease caused by mycobacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication, including vaccines, within 30&#xD;
             days of the first dose administration (with the exception of any odansetron&#xD;
             administered for purposes of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral&#xD;
             supplements and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration&#xD;
             (with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 grams/day for no more than 3 consecutive&#xD;
             days to treat minor illness or headache [per Investigator judgment]).&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion (eg, bariatric procedure). Appendectomy and&#xD;
             cholecystectomy are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
