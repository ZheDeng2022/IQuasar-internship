      The purpose of this study is to test whether patients with breast cancer who are being&#xD;
      treated with non-anthracycline trastuzumab therapy can safely be monitored for heart related&#xD;
      side effects less often than usual.&#xD;

        A member of the patient's treatment team, the protocol investigator, or research team at&#xD;
        MSK will identify potential research participants. The preliminary screen of eligibility&#xD;
        will be confirmation of the diagnosis of HER2-positive breast cancer. A member of the&#xD;
        treatment team will discuss the study and the possibility of enrollment in the study with&#xD;
        potential subjects that meet this eligibility criterion. The study will be conducted at the&#xD;
        Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center of MSK as well as at the regional MSK network sites.&#xD;
        Recruitment at both main and regional network sites will ensure the enrollment of diverse&#xD;
        populations of different ages, races, and ethnic groups onto the study. Patients will then&#xD;
        be consented to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In most cases, the initial contact with the prospective subject will be conducted either by&#xD;
        the treatment team, investigator or the research staff working in consultation with the&#xD;
        treatment team.&#xD;
