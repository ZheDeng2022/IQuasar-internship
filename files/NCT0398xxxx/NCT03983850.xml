  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell or bone marrow transplants can cure or control blood cancers. Sometimes the donor&#xD;
      cells see the recipient's body as foreign. This can cause complications. A high dose of the&#xD;
      drug cyclophosphamide (PTCy) can help reduce these risks. Researchers want to see if a lower&#xD;
      dose of PTCy can have the same benefits. Based on encouraging results from the first part of&#xD;
      the study, researchers now are investigating whether a lower dose of PTCy can allow other&#xD;
      immunosuppression to be decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a lower dose of PTCy and now also shorter duration of another immunosuppressant&#xD;
      called mycophenolate mofetil will help people with blood cancers have a more successful&#xD;
      transplant and fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 15-65 with leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma that is not curable with&#xD;
      standard therapy and is at high risk of returning without transplant, and their healthy adult&#xD;
      relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, breathing, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow samples: A needle inserted into the participant s pelvis will remove marrow and a&#xD;
      bone fragment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant recipients will stay at the hospital and be prepped with chemotherapy over 6 days&#xD;
      for the transplant. They will get stem cells through a catheter in the chest or neck. They&#xD;
      will get the cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. They will stay in the hospital about 4 more&#xD;
      weeks. They will have blood transfusions. They will have frequent blood tests and 2 bone&#xD;
      marrow samples within 1 year after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor participants will have bone marrow taken from their pelvis or stem cells taken from&#xD;
      their blood. For the blood donation, blood will be taken from a vein in one arm, move through&#xD;
      a machine to remove white blood cells, and be returned through a vein in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 5 years....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) reduces rates of severe acute and chronic&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)&#xD;
      and safely facilitates human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      When clinically translated, the dose (50 mg/kg) and timing (days +3 and +4) of PTCy used were&#xD;
      partly extrapolated from murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched skin&#xD;
      allografting models and were partly empirical&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both MHC-haploidentical and MHC-disparate murine HCT models, a dose of 25 mg/kg/day was&#xD;
      superior to 50 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4 in terms of GVHD severity and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MHC-haploidentical HCT model, a dose of 25 mg/kg on day +4 was equivalent to 25&#xD;
      mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to better GVHD prevention, lower dosing of PTCy is associated with less broad&#xD;
      reduction of T-cell numbers after PTCy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), used as adjunct immunosuppression with standard dose PTCy, can&#xD;
      have substantial gastrointestinal toxicity and can impede immune reconstitution and&#xD;
      pathogen-specific immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether a dose of PTCy 25 mg/kg on day +3 and +4 or on day +4 only can maintain&#xD;
      adequate protection against grade III-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether a reduced duration of MMF, in combination with PTCy 25 mg/kg/day on days +3&#xD;
      and +4, can maintain adequate protection against grade III-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically or cytologically confirmed hematologic malignancy with standard indication for&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation including one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of intermediate or adverse risk disease by the 2017 European&#xD;
      LeukemiaNet criteria in first morphologic complete remission&#xD;
&#xD;
      AML of any risk in second or subsequent morphologic complete remission&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or subsequent complete remission&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimal residual disease detected after first line&#xD;
      therapy and/or adverse genetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelodysplastic syndrome of intermediate or higher score by the Revised International&#xD;
      Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary myelofibrosis of intermediate-2 or higher risk by the Dynamic International&#xD;
      Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic myelogenous leukemia resistant to or intolerant of &gt;=3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors or&#xD;
      with prior history of accelerated phase or blast crisis&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma including Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed within 1 year of completion of&#xD;
      primary treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with 17p deletion and/or unmutated IgHV or refractory to or&#xD;
      intolerant of both BTK and PI3K inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature T or NK neoplasms as defined in the WHO guidelines of sufficient type and severity for&#xD;
      allogeneic HCT based on the Prognostic Index for T-cell lymphoma (PIT) score of&#xD;
      low-intermediate risk or higher or on recently published clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematologic malignancy of dendritic cell or histiocytic cell type&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma, stage III, relapsing after therapy with both a proteasome inhibitor and an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drug (IMiD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age 15-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one potentially suitable HLA-haploidentical donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Karnofsky performance score &gt;=60&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized, phase I/II study&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive myeloablative conditioning, HLA-haploidentical bone marrow HCT, and&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy, MMF (depending on cohort), and sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small pilot of 5 evaluable patients will receive the standard PTCy 50 mg/kg on days +3/+4&#xD;
      to obtain a limited amount of comparative pharmacokinetic and T-cell immunophenotyping and&#xD;
      repertoire data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the study will proceed to a small, two-level [1) 25 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4, 2) 25&#xD;
      mg/kg on day +4 only] phase I dose de-escalation study based on the standard 3+3 approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for development of grade III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) at day +60 as&#xD;
      the dose-limiting toxicity and then phase II will proceed with the shorter duration of the&#xD;
      days of treatment (+3/+4 or +4) which is associated with 0-1 of 6 patients with grade III-IV&#xD;
      aGVHD at day +60 and with the least amount of toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simon optimal two-stage phase II trial design, to rule out excess grade III-IV acute GVHD&#xD;
      with this decreased PTCy exposure, will be used in the phase II portion of the study which&#xD;
      will enroll an additional 14 patients to see if this lower PTCy exposure is associated with a&#xD;
      similar rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD as is expected with 50 mg/kg on days +3/+4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the phase II portion of the trial evaluating PTCy 25 mg/kg/day on&#xD;
      days +3/+4, a dose de-escalation will be conducted to determine if the dose of MMF&#xD;
      (standardly days +5 to +35) may be reduced without meaningful impact on avoidance of grade&#xD;
      III-IV acute GVHD. The tested dose levels will be 1) MMF from days +5 to +18 and 2) no MMF.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a second Simon optimal two-stage phase II trial design, to rule out&#xD;
      excess grade III-IV acute GVHD with decreased MMF exposure, which will expand on the lowest&#xD;
      MMF dose that is associated with acceptable toxicity and enroll an additional 14 patients to&#xD;
      see if this lower MMF is associated with a similar rate of grade III-IV acute GVHD as is&#xD;
      expected with full 30 day MMF treatment.&#xD;

                  study entry and for at least one year post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative to understand and the&#xD;
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Pediatric patients (&lt;18 years&#xD;
             of age) will provide assent, and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) will provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects requiring standard therapies to prepare for HCT should be referred in&#xD;
             remission if possible. However, these diseases are often aggressive and require swift&#xD;
             evaluation for HCT while concurrently attempting to establish disease control through&#xD;
             the administration of standard therapies. If ongoing therapy for the underlying&#xD;
             disease outside of the NIH is not in the best interest of the subject according to the&#xD;
             clinical judgment of the PI, then the subject may receive up to 2 cycles of standard&#xD;
             treatment for his/her underlying hematologic malignancy as a bridge to HCT on this&#xD;
             protocol, prior to starting the research phase of the study. The subject must have a&#xD;
             Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60% at the start of the first&#xD;
             cycle to proceed. If it becomes apparent that the subject will not be able to proceed&#xD;
             to HCT, then he/she must come off study. Subjects receiving standard therapy will be&#xD;
             told about the therapy, associated risks, potential benefits, alternatives to the&#xD;
             proposed therapy, and the availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere,&#xD;
             outside of a research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria - Related Donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Related donor deemed suitable and eligible, and willing to donate, per clinical&#xD;
             evaluations, who are additionally willing to donate blood, bone marrow, saliva, oral&#xD;
             swab and stool for research. Related donors will be evaluated in accordance with&#xD;
             existing institutional Standard Policies and Procedures for determination of&#xD;
             eligibility and suitability for clinical donation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria - Recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Prior experimental&#xD;
             therapies must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the date of beginning&#xD;
             conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection excluding controlled fungal infection on appropriate treatment, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, endocrinopathy&#xD;
             (significant uncontrolled or untreated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiency), or active psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior myeloablative conditioning for autologous or allogeneic HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An HLA-matched-sibling donor who is available and willing to donate bone marrow. Note:&#xD;
             The patient must have access to HCT using this donor for this to be an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women who intend to become pregnant during the study are excluded&#xD;
             because myeloablative conditioning is toxic to the developing fetus with the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The potential for some of the study medications to be transmissible via breast milk of&#xD;
             nursing mothers is unknown. Because there is unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding must be&#xD;
             discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy of non-hematopoietic type (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers)&#xD;
             which is: metastatic, or relapsed/refractory to treatment, or locally advanced and not&#xD;
             amenable to curative treatment, or limited disease treated with curative intent&#xD;
             treatment within the last 2 years. This excludes non-melanoma skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The severity of the hematologic malignancy does not warrant the potential toxicity of&#xD;
             myeloablative allogeneic HCT as judged by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria - Related Donor&#xD;
