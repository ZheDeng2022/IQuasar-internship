  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the family perspective on follow-up programs after&#xD;
      treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It is relevant when new follow-up&#xD;
      programs are to be designed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 90 % of paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), treated on&#xD;
      the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-2008 protocol, are alive&#xD;
      five years after diagnosis. The main reason for treatment failure being relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of relapse after treatment for ALL is highest within the first two years after&#xD;
      cessation of maintenance therapy. Therefore, it has been routine in most countries to&#xD;
      follow-up patients in the outpatient clinic every one or two months during the first years&#xD;
      after end of therapy for ALL in order to detect recurrence and possible late sequelae at an&#xD;
      early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with ALL there are only a few studies on the value of routine follow-up,&#xD;
      including haematological status after cessation of maintenance therapy. These studies showed&#xD;
      that approximately 90% of the relapses were diagnosed in children with symptoms of leukaemia&#xD;
      progression and that routine blood tests and clinical follow-ups were of little value. It is&#xD;
      well known that there are other issues besides the risk of relapse, which are relevant for&#xD;
      families after cessation of ALL therapy i.e. risk of late effects of treatment, psychosocial&#xD;
      problems related to the child's return to &quot;normal&quot; life etc. These issues will also have an&#xD;
      impact upon how the follow-up programs are planned. The investigators will study the family&#xD;
      perspectives on follow-up during the first 5-years after cessation of maintenance therapy in&#xD;
      a Danish cohort of children treated according to the NOPHO ALL-2008 protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study. Outcomes are patient-reported as the&#xD;
      measurement instrument used is questionnaires. Eligible families are families with children&#xD;
      diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Denmark and being in the period 0-5 years&#xD;
      after cessation of maintenance therapy.&#xD;
