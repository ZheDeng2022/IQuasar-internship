  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia(MSIMI) has been recognized a significant clinical&#xD;
      problem. Evidence has shown that individuals with MSIMI have 2 to 2.5 times higher risk to&#xD;
      develop a major averse cardiovascular events over 3-5 years, compared to their counterparts&#xD;
      who have no MSIMI. Nevertheless, investigations into the study of MSIMI among women who have&#xD;
      chest pain but artery stenosis &lt; 50% have been lacking. In this project, the investigators&#xD;
      used positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate perfusion defect during mental stress to&#xD;
      diagnose MSIMI. Women with chest pain and coronary artery stenosis &lt; 50% were included as the&#xD;
      experimental group, age-matched healthy people as the control group, the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to compare the incidence of MSIMI in the two groups. At the same time, the study also observe&#xD;
      the change of MBF during mental stress and the relationship between MBF and MSIMI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this project are to assess MSIMI prevalence in chest pain women with coronary&#xD;
      artery stenosis less than 50%, as compared to age matched healthy women, and the MBF change&#xD;
      during mental stress and adenosine vasodilator stress by PET with N-13 ammonia . This study&#xD;
      will also establish the methodology of echocardiography to diagnose MSIMI by comparing with&#xD;
      PET. To evaluate the consistency of myocardial blood flow (MBF by PET-CT) and peripheral&#xD;
      blood flow (PAT ratio by EndoPAT) during stress test. and to explore the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      MSIMI from aspects of neuroendocrine mechanism, sex hormone level, humoral immunity index and&#xD;
      proteome expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stress testing will be conducted at the PET-CT and echocardiography unit of Guangdong&#xD;
      Provincial People's Hospital. Following a 20-minute calibration-rest period, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a series of 3 consecutive mental stress tasks. The mental stress&#xD;
      tests are embedded in the virtual reality device, and the subjects can carry out the mental&#xD;
      stress test with the virtual reality device on their heads. (1) Stroop Color-Word test, is&#xD;
      administered by computer on a video monitor. A word appeared in the middle of the screen-Red,&#xD;
      Green, Yellow, or Blue-in one of these four colors. At the bottom of the screen the words&#xD;
      Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue appeared with the font color not matching the word meaning. The&#xD;
      participant is asked to match the color of the word in the middle of the screen with the&#xD;
      meaning of the color word at the bottom by clicking on the correct option, which lasts about&#xD;
      4 minutes. and then (2) Public speaking with anger recall: during this test, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to give a speech on a recent situation in which they experienced anger to an audience&#xD;
      of three observers (doctors) after 1 minute of preparation. Prior to the speech, subjects are&#xD;
      told that their speech will be evaluated on their description of the situation, as to what&#xD;
      happened, what they thought, felt, what they did, and what happened as a result. If they run&#xD;
      out of things to say, the research tech will prompt them with questions to elicit more&#xD;
      content until the three minutes are up. and at last the (3) Mental arithmetic: during this&#xD;
      test, patients will be asked to perform a series of serial subtractions beginning at a given&#xD;
      number which will be different for each repeated test and will be chosen by the tester from a&#xD;
      fixed list of various numbers, with encouragement to perform calculations as quickly as&#xD;
      possible; Each mental stress lasts for 4 minutes, there is no rest between the two mental&#xD;
      stress, and the whole process of mental stress is 12 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of participants wih an presence of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) during the 3 mental stressors.&#xD;
MSIMI is defined by the following: compared to rest, 1) Each myocardial segment was scored from 0 to 4, with 0 being normal, 1 possibly normal, 2 definitely abnormal, 3 severely abnormal, and 4 no perfusion. The investigators calculated summed scores in a conventional fashion, including a summed stress score, a summed rest score, and a summed difference score. A summed difference score â‰¥3 is typically used as evidence of MSIMI.</description>
