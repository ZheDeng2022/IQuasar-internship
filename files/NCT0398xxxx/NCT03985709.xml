  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome appears to be a significant contributor to musculoskeletal health and&#xD;
      disease. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with&#xD;
      prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. Genetic background, gender, dietary&#xD;
      intake, and social factors are also important factors which contribute to the musculoskeletal&#xD;
      health, as well as to the normal balance of intestinal microbiota. The link between gut&#xD;
      microbiota and joint inflammation in murine models of arthritis has been established, and it&#xD;
      is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated&#xD;
      substantial alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, psoriasis), which include&#xD;
      decreased microbial diversity and lower abundances of bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes&#xD;
      phylum that are known to have immunoregulatory properties.These new findings open important&#xD;
      future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel&#xD;
      biomarkers and treatment strategies. Further investigation into the mechanisms linking&#xD;
      changes in the microbiome to alterations in bones and joints is necessary. Next Generation&#xD;
      Sequencing, metatranscriptomic analysis, and metabolomic approaches may provide yet-greater&#xD;
      insight and help further understand these mechanisms. To investigate gut microbiota change&#xD;
      will be associated with the sintoms of knee and / or hip OA in italian patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have hip or knee OA according on radiographic findings&#xD;
             (Kellgren-Lawrence scale ≥3). A physiatrist (physician) will establish the diagnosis&#xD;
             of pain-OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or neurological disorders, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or&#xD;
             allergies or other ongoing illnesses (i.e., irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes,&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, etc.) or recent antibiotic treatment (i.e., &lt;3 months before the&#xD;
             beginning of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were excluded.&#xD;

             Depression Inventory (BDI) or more than 30 points in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
             (STAI), dementia and not Italian speaking due to the high level of language skills&#xD;
