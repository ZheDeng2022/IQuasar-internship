  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot interventional study to investigate the acceptability, tolerability, and side&#xD;
      effect profile for varying numbers of treatment sessions/day of a new rTMS treatment in&#xD;
      adolescents with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Conventional rTMS has been limited to&#xD;
      sinusoidal biphasic electromagnetic pulses. In contrast, the First Dawn rTMS system by&#xD;
      NeuroQore can sustain a repetitive linear asymmetric pulse. In addition, identification of&#xD;
      rTMS treatment sites in adolescents with TRD most often relies on anatomic landmarks, but the&#xD;
      First Dawn rTMS system utilizes personal fMRI data in a novel algorithm to determine where to&#xD;
      apply the rTMS in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on adult data in healthy volunteers and patients with TRD, the investigators propose&#xD;
      that the First Dawn rTMS system will be acceptable and well-tolerated by adolescents and will&#xD;
      have minimal side effects. Please see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02667041 for&#xD;
      details on the completed pilot study in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate acceptability, tolerability, and side effects in groups&#xD;
      of patients receiving treatment in numbers of sessions/day that are gradually accelerated&#xD;
      over the course of the study. Results will be used to inform the development of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 18 patients will be placed into 6 sub-groups sequentially as they are enrolled. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a maximum of 30,000 pulses in their treatment course, as tolerated. The&#xD;
      first group will receive daily sessions, similar to standard rTMS treatment. Each of the&#xD;
      remaining groups will be set to receive more frequent sessions/day in decreasing numbers of&#xD;
      days on a graduated schedule while holding the total number of pulses for each patient's&#xD;
      treatment course at 30,000 pulses. in addition, the investigators will recruit one healthy&#xD;
      volunteer to test fMRI server data transfer and analysis. This healthy volunteer will not&#xD;
      receive rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess: 1) the feasibility of enrollment (number&#xD;
      of patients who enroll divided by the number of patients approached), 2) study retention&#xD;
      (number of patients completing the study divided by the number enrolled), and 3) AE/SE&#xD;
      profile of the treatment at each protocol level and 4) patient experience in the study across&#xD;
      the sample and within the sub-groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to: 1) evaluate daily changes in symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and mental status; 2) evaluate fMRI changes in the LDLPFC after treatment; 3)&#xD;
      evaluate post-treatment and 3-month changes in depression symptoms, global function, mental&#xD;
      status, verbal memory.&#xD;

    <description>Device: First Dawn rTMS System used in 18 patients divided into groups of 3. Each group will receive a different and gradually increasing frequency of treatment sessions/day (1-10) over a decreasing number of days (10-1). The total number of pulses for all levels will be 30,000. The use of each level will be dependent on tolerability and safety of the previous lower level, i.e., if one level is not tolerated well by a group, progression to the next level will not occur.</description>
