      This study will include the subjects who enrolled in DACAB trial (NCT02201771) to observe&#xD;
      clinical outcomes 5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting（CABG）.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the occurrence of MACE-4 ( a composite of all-cause&#xD;
      death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) among 3 randomized&#xD;
      regimens (T+A, T alone, A alone) in previous DACAB trial within 5 years after CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare the occurrence of MACE-5( a composite of all-cause&#xD;
      death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and hospitalization for&#xD;
      unstable angina); MACE-3 ( a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and&#xD;
      stroke); all-cause death; cardiovascular death; myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary&#xD;
      revascularization; hospitalization for unstable angina and grafts patency rate among 3&#xD;
      randomized regimens in previous DACAB trial within 5 years after CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are to compare the occurrence of MACE-4; MACE-5; MACE-3; all-cause&#xD;
      death; cardiovascular death; myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary revascularization and&#xD;
      hospitalization for unstable angina between 2 cohorts with or without grafts/vein grafts&#xD;
      failure at 1 year angiographic follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational study designed to compare clinical outcomes 5&#xD;
      years after CABG in subjects enrolled in DACAB trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 12-month randomized treatment from DACAB trial, investigators would not make&#xD;
      any interventions or impact on subjects'therapeutic strategy. Aspirin monotherapy would be&#xD;
      given to most subjects according to the current guidelines. However, other antiplatelet&#xD;
      regimens might be given for subjects by their attending physician based on the subject's&#xD;
      individual condition. Subjects would spontaneously undergo regular laboratory test ,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound cardiography (UCG), coronary computed tomographic&#xD;
      angiography (CCTA) or coronary angiography (CAG) and clinical follow-up according to clinical&#xD;
      need and their individual condition. At 5-year (± 3 month) after CABG, a face-to-face visit&#xD;
      is scheduled to be performed to collect the occurrence of clinical events, including types&#xD;
      and time of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some prospective exploratory analysis are planned. According to the 1-year angiographic&#xD;
      outcome of all grafts from the DACAB trial, all subjects will be allocated to 2&#xD;
      non-randomized cohorts: Cohort A with at least one graft failure (Fitzgibbon Grade B or O) at&#xD;
      1 year, and Cohort B without any graft failure at 1 year. Then prospective exploratory&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to compare the occurrence of MACE-4; MACE-5; MACE-3; and other&#xD;
      outcomes between 2 non-randomized cohorts from 1-year angiographic follow-up to 5 years after&#xD;
      CABG. Similar analysis will be performed according to the 1-year angiographic outcome of vein&#xD;
      grafts only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other preplanned subgroup analysis included: baseline gender, baseline age stratification(70&#xD;
      years), baseline status of acute coronary syndrome, history of hypertension, baseline history&#xD;
      of diabetes, baseline history of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, baseline history of&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, baseline history of prior myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      baseline history of stroke, baseline history of peripheral vascular disease, Baseline history&#xD;
      of COPD , baseline history of CKD-3 or above , baseline history of smoking, baseline left&#xD;
      main coronary artery disease, baseline SYNTAX score stratification, baseline EuroSCORE&#xD;
      stratification, baseline CABG with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, baseline CABG with or&#xD;
      without internal thoracic artery grafts, baseline CABG with or without complete&#xD;
      revascularization.&#xD;
