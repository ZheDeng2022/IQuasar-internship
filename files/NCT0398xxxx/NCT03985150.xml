  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment approaches for peripheral artery disease are largely unsatisfactory.&#xD;
      Therefore, diseased tissue will be collected as well as patient-specific arterial geometries.&#xD;
      The tissue will be tested microstructurally and mechanically to obtain data required to&#xD;
      optimize treatment methods through in silico modeling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a severe cause of morbidity in patients. Common treatment&#xD;
      approaches are too often still unsatisfactory. Angioplasty is commonly followed by&#xD;
      restenosis, caused by overloading of the arterial tissue. This study is aimed at improving&#xD;
      this treatment approach through the in silico simulation of arterial remodeling after balloon&#xD;
      expansion. Such simulations require the input of a patient-specific geometry and the&#xD;
      mechanical properties of (diseased) arterial tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for an above knee lower limb amputation due to critical ischemia will be&#xD;
      recruited in this study. After the surgery, the femoralis superficialis will be collected, as&#xD;
      well as the CT or MR angiogram obtained before the surgery. The arterial tissue will be&#xD;
      mechanically tested to obtain material properties and the medical image will be used to&#xD;
      determine the arterial geometry. A correlation study will be carried out to explore the&#xD;
      possibility of including a predictive simulation of the restenosis outcome of balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty in the clinical practice.&#xD;
