  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is one of the most common causes of children's morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality globally. Oral or intravenous rehydration is the only effective treatment in&#xD;
      reducing morbidity and mortality rates in AGE. However, new attempts to identify other&#xD;
      therapeutic methods to reduce the symptoms of diarrhea are of interest. The administration of&#xD;
      pleuran (β- (1,3 / 1,6) -D-glucan) appears to be such an alternative. In Poland, pleuran is&#xD;
      being marketed for treating AGE. Its potential immunomodulatory effect is based on the&#xD;
      stimulation of both humoral and cellular immunity. The active substance of the product&#xD;
      (pleuran) was extracted by unique and patented technology from Pleurotus ostreatus. The&#xD;
      substance was previously isolated, identified and chemically characterized by Karacsonyi and&#xD;
      Kunia. Pleuran is registered as a diet supplement and distributed in 20 European and&#xD;
      non-European countries. The testing for toxicity was performed by the Institute of Preventive&#xD;
      and Clinical Medicine of Slovak Medical University (Final Report No. 5-51/04) and the tests&#xD;
      were performed in compliance with the criteria of the Directive of Good Laboratory Practice&#xD;
      and Directive 2004/10/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 11th February 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of pleuran in reducing the duration and the severity of AGE symptoms&#xD;
      in children, a randomized, placebo-controlled, fully-blind study has been designed. A total&#xD;
      of 120 children will be randomly assigned to receive either Imunoglukan PH4 syrup in the&#xD;
      experimental group or matching placebo in the control group. The primary outcome measure will&#xD;
      be the duration of diarrhea. The statistical analysis of the results will be conducted in&#xD;
      both intention-to-treat and per-protocol approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: This will be a randomized, fully-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with&#xD;
      allocation 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children aged 13- 120 months, hospitalized or requiring a visit to the&#xD;
      emergency department due to acute gastroenteritis (AGE) lasting at least 24 h, but no longer&#xD;
      than 72 h at the time of inclusion to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting of the study: The study participants will be recruited from patients requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization in 4 paediatric departments or counselling in the emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      due to AGE in the Paediatric Teaching Clinical Hospital, the Medical University of Warsaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study within 24 hours of&#xD;
      hospitalization or ED visit basing on the physical examination and interviews with&#xD;
      caregivers. The BMI will be calculated and put on WHO percentiles charts. In order to&#xD;
      determine the etiology of AGE, the stool sample will be collected for viral tests (rota-,&#xD;
      adeno- and noroviruses markers) before the intervention. If any indication for&#xD;
      microbiological stool investigation occurs (the patient in severe condition or with prolonged&#xD;
      symptoms in whom specific treatment is considered, or patient with underlying chronic&#xD;
      disease), the stool sample will be cultured. The caregivers will be informed about the&#xD;
      purpose, methods, safety of the intervention and the course of the study. In order to ensure&#xD;
      that the assessed parameters and endpoints are comparable appropriate scales will be applied.&#xD;
      To assess the severity of diarrhea, the Modified Vesikari Score will be used. The dehydration&#xD;
      degree will be evaluated by means of the WHO scale and the Clinical Dehydration Scale (CDS)&#xD;
      recommended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition&#xD;
      (ESPGHAN). The Bristol Stool Form Scale will help to objectify the assessment of stool&#xD;
      consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will involve the random allocation of patients to group A or B. The&#xD;
      stratified randomization has been designed with the use of two subgroups. The subgroups will&#xD;
      be created depending on the duration of diarrhea at the time of enrolment: 24-48 h&#xD;
      (short-lasting diarrhea- SLD) and 48-72 h (long-lasting diarrhea- LLD). The participants of&#xD;
      each subgroup will be randomly allocated to the study groups (experimental or control), in&#xD;
      blocks of four.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active product and placebo will be prepared, weighed, packaged in identical bottles and&#xD;
      signed with random numbers by the manufacturer, with the blinded meaning of numbers. The&#xD;
      information about the allocation will be deposited in a sealed envelope in a safe place in&#xD;
      the administrative part of the department, kept by the independent person not involved in the&#xD;
      study. The study product will be delivered to the main researcher in boxes of four, ensuring&#xD;
      the contest of 2 active and 2 placebo samples in each box. Subsequent boxes will be used to&#xD;
      allocate consecutive patients within the subgroups A and B. By opening each subsequent box,&#xD;
      the numbers of bottles in the box will be randomly assigned to the next four patients in a&#xD;
      subgroup by the researcher. The contents of the bottles will look and taste the same.&#xD;
      Researchers, caregivers, patients, and a person responsible for the statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be blinded to the intervention until the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children allocated to the experimental group will receive Imunoglukan PH4 oral suspension (10&#xD;
      mg of pleuran and 10 mg of vitamin C in 1 ml of syrup) in a dose 1 ml / 5 kg body weight,&#xD;
      while patients in the control group will receive a placebo: a vitamin C oral suspension (10&#xD;
      mg of vitamin C in 1 ml of syrup) in a dose 1 ml / 5 kg body weight. Both syrups will be&#xD;
      administered once a day in the morning, before the first meal, until signs of AGE subside (&lt;&#xD;
      3 stools / 24 hours and normalization of stool consistency - grade 2-5 according to Bristol&#xD;
      Stool Form Scale) or until the 14th day of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure proper rehydration, patients in both groups will receive an oral rehydration&#xD;
      solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids if necessary, according to daily fluids requirements. A&#xD;
      normal diet will be delivered. Each patient will receive antipyretic, analgesic (Ibuprofen,&#xD;
      Acetaminophen), and antiemetic (Ondansetron) if necessary. Patients will not receive other&#xD;
      medicines that may interfere with the disease course (probiotics, Diosmectite, Racecadotril).&#xD;
      If indications occur, the patient will receive an antibiotic according to the ESPGHAN&#xD;
      recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hospitalization, patients will be examined every day by the physician, with the&#xD;
      assessment of dehydration level, the need for intravenous rehydration or concomitant&#xD;
      treatment. The results of the evaluation will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF). Both&#xD;
      during and after the hospitalization, the caregiver will record AGE symptoms in a diary (a&#xD;
      number of stools per day, their consistency and accompanying symptoms e.g. fever, vomiting,&#xD;
      abdominal pain). Complete diaries will be collected from caregivers via email or by telephone&#xD;
      conversation. After discharge, caregivers will have the possibility to contact a physician to&#xD;
      receive basic consultation about oral rehydration and eventual side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coded, paper CRF containing all the scales and questionnaires will be created for each&#xD;
      patient. After finishing the observation, the data from the symptoms diaries completed by the&#xD;
      caregivers will be transferred by the physician to the paper versions of the CRFs. After&#xD;
      completing the study, data from the CRFs will be transferred to two electronic databases by&#xD;
      two independent persons to confirm the accuracy of the data. Electronic database and CRFs&#xD;
      will be prepared in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software. The collected data will be&#xD;
      properly stored to allow for data verification. Confidentiality of data, including personal&#xD;
      data of the study participants, will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE) Every AE will be recorded and reported to the investigator and&#xD;
      manufacturer, according to a pre-established procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Altman nomogram was used to estimate the sample size of experimental and control groups.&#xD;
      To demonstrate a clinically relevant difference of 24 h in duration of AGE symptoms in&#xD;
      experimental and control groups, with 5% significance level and a power of 90%, assuming the&#xD;
      standard deviation of the variable in each group of 40 h, a sample of 110 patients will be&#xD;
      needed (55 patients in each group). Allowing for 10% attrition of participants during the&#xD;
      study, we estimated the sample size as 120 patients (60 patients for each experimental and&#xD;
      control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise baseline characteristics. Intention-to-treat&#xD;
      (ITT) and per protocol analyses will be used to present the results of the study. The&#xD;
      comparison of group A and B in terms of the primary endpoint (duration of diarrhea) will be&#xD;
      performed with Student's t-test if the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test will be &gt;0.05.&#xD;
      Otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. In the case of dropouts or not completed&#xD;
      observations before the 14th days of the study, the log-rank test will be performed. The&#xD;
      Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the groups A and B in terms&#xD;
      of the incidence of adverse events and the severity of diarrhea. Statistical significance&#xD;
      will be based on two-tailed tests with p-value of 5%. All estimates will be presented with&#xD;
      95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment No 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presented protocol contains amendments approved by the Bioethics Committee on May 11,&#xD;
      2020. The main reason for those changes was an unsatisfactory pace of recruitment in the&#xD;
      first 11 months of study commencement. A detailed analysis revealed the reduction in the&#xD;
      number of hospitalizations due to AGE in our Department compared to the previous year and&#xD;
      difficulties in meeting the inclusion criteria. In the following months, the COVID pandemic&#xD;
      significantly limited the number of patients hospitalized in our hospital. By the time the&#xD;
      changes were made we recruited only three patients into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the listed reasons we have introduced the following changes to the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first version of the protocol assumed the recruitment of patients among hospitalized&#xD;
           children only. The amendment introduced the possibility of recruitment also among&#xD;
           children requiring counselling in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initially, patients were recruited only at the Department of Pediatric with Clinical&#xD;
           Assessment Unit (the unit initiating and conducting the study). The amendment introduced&#xD;
           4 other clinics of the Pediatric Teaching Clinical Hospital, the Medical University of&#xD;
           Warsaw, including the Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The age group of recruited patients initially 13- 60 months (up to 6 years of age) was&#xD;
           extended to older children 13- 120 months (up to 10 years of age).&#xD;
