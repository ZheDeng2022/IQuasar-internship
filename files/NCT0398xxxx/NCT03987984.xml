      The aim of this study was to adapt to the Sensory Eating Problems Scale to Turkish. Within&#xD;
      the scope of the study, firstly the Turkish version of the scale will be developed and then&#xD;
      its reliability and validity will be examined.&#xD;

      The etiology of childhood feeding problems is often complex and likely due to multiple&#xD;
      factors, such as biological issues, oral motor deficits, and environmental contingencies.&#xD;
      Sensory processing, or the ability to receive, integrate, and process sensory input, such as&#xD;
      visual, olfactory, or gustatory information, has also been speculated to influence eating. A&#xD;
      growing literature has examined the association between sensory processing and eating&#xD;
      behavior in several populations of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While child feeding problems have been found to be associated with withsensory processing&#xD;
      problems, clinicians could benefit from more specifics about the types of oral sensory&#xD;
      problems most associated with feeding problems. For example, the Oral Sensory Processing&#xD;
      subscale of the Sensory Profile includes a collection of sensory problems associated with&#xD;
      feeding difficulties such as gagging easily to food or utensils in the mouth, rejecting&#xD;
      certain food tastes or smells, accepting limited food textures, biting the tongue or lips ,&#xD;
      but without documentation that identifies the separate dimensions of oral sensitivity&#xD;
      problems relevant to children's feeding problems. Further, along theOral Sensory Processing&#xD;
      Subscale of the SP, a particular oral sensory problems, such as sensitivity to texture, may&#xD;
      be measured by only one or two items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory Eating Problems Scale is a newly developed scale and can measure specific oral&#xD;
      sensory problems in children. SEPS can also provide a more detailed assessment of sensory&#xD;
      eating behavior than provided in previous studies by developing the Sensory Eating Problems&#xD;
      Scale (SEPS) to identify specific dimensions of oral sensitivity children show during&#xD;
      feeding. However; there is no short, easy to use and easy to understand sensory eating&#xD;
      problems scale with the Turkish version.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is a widely used parent-report measure of meal time and feeding behavior. It consists of 35 items; the first 25 of which focus on child behavior and the last 10 of which provide an index of parental feelings about, and strategies for, addressing mealtime and feeding problems.</description>

    <description>The survey was designed to evaluate caregivers' various responses to questions about quality of life related to activities of daily living, feeding, and generalized worry with 6 items in each category.</description>
