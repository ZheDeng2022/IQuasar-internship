      Phase I, multicentre clinical trial of olaratumab plus trabectedin in patients with advanced&#xD;
      soft-tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaratumab plus trabectedin could be synergistic and with a manageable toxicity profile in&#xD;
      advanced STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a phase I, non-randomised, one-armed, multicenter trial, open-label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation rules include patients in blocks of 3 o 6 patient. Treatment is a&#xD;
      combination of unlimited cycles of oralatumab and trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary clinical study endpoint of phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended dose of olaratumab combined&#xD;
      with trabectedin in advanced soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary clinical study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective Response Rate (ORR): ORR is defined as the number of subjects with a Best&#xD;
           Overall Response (BOR) according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival (PFS): time to progression or death from treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS): Time from treatment initiation until death. Efficacy measured&#xD;
           through tumor response according to Choi criteria. The evaluation criteria will be based&#xD;
           on the identification of target lesions in baseline and their follow-up until tumor&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of clinical outcome with translational biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (QoL) measured per QLQ-C30 questionnaire of EORTC&#xD;

      PHASE I DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of evaluable patients to be included in this trial is 25. However 28 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled considering the possibility of 3 non-evaluable cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation rules proceed as follows: escalating in cohorts of 3-6 patients per dose&#xD;
      level. Three patients are treated at a given dose level. If at least 2 patients are observed&#xD;
      to have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the prior dose level is defined as the maximum&#xD;
      tolerable dosage (MTD) (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case&#xD;
      it is the tentative MTD). If 0 of the 3 patients are observed to have DLT, the dose level is&#xD;
      escalated one step for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above. If&#xD;
      exactly 1 of the 3 patients treated show DLT, 3 additional patients are treated at the&#xD;
      current dose level. If none of these additional 3 patients show DLT, the dose level is&#xD;
      escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above; otherwise,&#xD;
      the prior dose level is defined as the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is usually defined as cycle 1 grade 3 or above toxicity,&#xD;
      excepting grade 3 neutropenia unaccompanied by either fever or infection. More specifically,&#xD;
      for this clinical trial, DLT will be applied only to either of the following toxicities&#xD;
      occurring during the first treatment cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological toxicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Febrile neutropenia with documented Grade ≥3 infection or sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia complicated by haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 days or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-hematological toxicities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 3-4 events, excluding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea or vomiting without appropriate antiemetic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 transaminitis will not be considered Dose Limiting Toxicity unless this would&#xD;
           entail a delay in the treatment administration. This Adverse Event (AE) is well known as&#xD;
           secondary effect of trabectedin in the first two cycles and has no clinical impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-escalation levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEVEL -1: Olaratumab 15 mg/Kg D1 and D8 + Trabectedin 0.9 mg/m2 D1 This is a security level&#xD;
      in case level 0 causes DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEVEL 0*: Olaratumab 15 mg/Kg D1 and D8 + Trabectedin 1.1 mg/m2 D1&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEVEL 1: Olaratumab 15 mg/Kg D1 and D8 + Trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 D1&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEVEL 2: Olaratumab 15 mg/Kg D1 and D8 + Trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2 D1&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEVEL 3**: Olaratumab 20 mg/kg Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1) and Cycle 1, Day 8 (C1D8) (induction) +&#xD;
      Trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2 D1 Olaratumab 15 mg/kg D1 and D8 (maintenance) + Trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2&#xD;
      D1&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Dose starting level is 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **In the LEVEL 3 Olaratumab dose of 20 mg/kg will be considered only for the first 2 doses&#xD;
      (as induction doses, cycle 1 days 1 and 8)) and then, the maintenance dose will be 15 mg/m2&#xD;
      for the rest of cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle encompasses 21 days. It is not allowed dose-escalation for one given patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons the first patient will be followed for 1 week before any other patient can&#xD;
      be enrolled, given than the combination of trabectedin and olaratumab hasn't been&#xD;
      administered to any patient so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the inclusion of the third patient in a given dose-level it is necessary to have all the&#xD;
      safety information of the first cycle of the previous 2 patients included in the same&#xD;
      dose-level. Before moving on to the next dose-level, at least three patients must have been&#xD;
      followed during 3 weeks (1 cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trabectedin dose-level escalation is supported by previous phase I trials&#xD;
      focusing on trabectedin combination. In STS, the lowest level for trabectedin was 0.9 mg/m2&#xD;
      for combination with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and showed to be active61. With other&#xD;
      antiangiogenic agents, combination produced prolonged cytopenias. Therefore, starting level 0&#xD;
      uses Trabectedin 1.1mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Tumor samples to be collected: The most recent archive tumor sample (1 block) must be&#xD;
      donated for diagnosis confirmation and for biomarker analysis and another tumor sample after&#xD;
      2 cycles of olaratumab and trabectedin is also mandatory..&#xD;
&#xD;
      When feasible another tumor block should be collected after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Translational study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the signalling pathways underlying the response to the combination of&#xD;
           olaratumab and trabectedin in formalin-fixe, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, from STS&#xD;
           patients (HTG Molecular Oncology Biomarker Panel (OBP) Assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate the potential predictive biomarkers (immunomodulatory signature) of the&#xD;
           response to olaratumab and trabectedin, with clinic results, such as progression-free&#xD;
           survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate the activity of olaratumab plus trabectedin with gene expression profiling&#xD;
           in 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA) fibrosarcoma immunocompetent mice models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FFPE samples (pre-treatment), before enrolment and after cycle 2. Both biopsies are&#xD;
           mandatory. If the patient did not received any treatment in the last 6 months,&#xD;
           previously to the enrolment, any biopsy taken within this period will be acceptable to&#xD;
           the translational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When feasible, optionally for the patient, another tumor block should be collected after&#xD;
           the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Peripheral blood samples taken at baseline, cycle 1 days 8, pre-cycle 2 day 2, pre-cycle&#xD;
           3 day 1 and after documented response of progression and after progression in 1 PAXgene&#xD;
           tube and 2 BD Vacutainer® Cellular Preparation Tube (CPT)™.&#xD;
