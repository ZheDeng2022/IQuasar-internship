  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no objective data on the outcome of a daylong workshop as commonly offered to the&#xD;
      surgical residents by various institutions. Hence we planned a study with the objectives to&#xD;
      determine if a one-day laparoscopic skills workshop enhanced the knowledge and skills of&#xD;
      surgical residents in minimal access surgery and did the workshop scores have any correlation&#xD;
      with the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) scores for the procedures performed&#xD;
      in the real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of our study shall indicate the impact of one-day laparoscopic skills workshop on&#xD;
      the knowledge and psychomotor skills of the surgical residents. The skills gained from the&#xD;
      workshop shall also be correlated with DOPS scores reflecting the transfer of skills to real&#xD;
      life performance.&#xD;

      I. Introduction and Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching and learning of psychomotor skills is of paramount importance for surgical residency&#xD;
      programs. The 'traditional' model of teaching surgical skills on 'real' patients using graded&#xD;
      responsibility is being seriously questioned. More and more focus has recently shifted on the&#xD;
      use of models and simulators, with an objective of better preparation of residents for the&#xD;
      operating room experience. At Aga Khan University, the focus of surgical training is still on&#xD;
      the traditional model, but some innovations have been introduced to enhance the training&#xD;
      outcomes and safety of the patients. The innovations include use of short workshops on bench&#xD;
      models to train the residents in basic surgical skills before they can operate on the real&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational impact of such short workshops has been difficult to document, since a&#xD;
      long-term follow up is usually not possible. But some recent data suggests that minimal&#xD;
      access skills workshops can improve both the knowledge base and motor skills of the trainees.&#xD;
      There is also some data to suggest that the skills obtained during a workshop not only have a&#xD;
      long lasting effect on the performance of the residents, but may also result in change in&#xD;
      practice of the participants. There is no study available where the educational effect of&#xD;
      surgical workshop has been correlated with the real time work place based performance of the&#xD;
      surgical residents including DOPS (direct observation of procedural skills). DOPS is a form&#xD;
      of work place based assessment of residents' knowledge and skills, and can be used as a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for the actual performance of the residents in the real world. Improvement&#xD;
      of DOPS scores after the workshop might demonstrate the educational influence of the workshop&#xD;
      on the residents' knowledge and skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rationale and Objective of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The section of General Surgery at Aga Khan University offers surgical skills workshops to&#xD;
      trainees every year to enhance their knowledge and psychomotor skills for the last many&#xD;
      years. There is a general perception amongst the trainees and the faculty that these&#xD;
      workshops have been quite valuable in refining the skills of the surgical trainees. However,&#xD;
      there is no objective data to support this perception and hence there is a need to document&#xD;
      the outcome of this important academic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic questions that need to be answered are; if there is an effect of laparoscopic&#xD;
      skills workshop on enhancing the knowledge and skills of surgical residents and how do the&#xD;
      workshop scores correlate with the DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) scores. The&#xD;
      results of this study may be used for improving the teaching methods for surgical residents&#xD;
      as well as the enthusiasm of the faculty involved in such labor intensive activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to determine the difference in the mean scores of knowledge and&#xD;
      skills assessment of surgical residents attending the minimal access skills workshop before&#xD;
      and after the workshop; and at an interval of 2 months. The second objective is to compare&#xD;
      the workshop scores with the DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) scores conducted&#xD;
      before and after the workshop during the same study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a quasi-experimental, single arm, repeat measure study design. The&#xD;
      pre-workshop knowledge and skills scores of residents will be compared with immediate&#xD;
      post-workshop scores and scores of repeat assessment at 2 months after the workshop. The&#xD;
      scores of DOPS on laparoscopic surgery before and after the workshop will also be compared&#xD;
      for any change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The trainees enrolled in the residency programs of General Surgery and&#xD;
      Obstetrics / Gynecology of Aga Khan University have the mandate of acquiring skills of&#xD;
      minimal access surgery as a part of their surgical armamentarium. These residents will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the proposed study and the workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size &amp; Groups: A non-probability, all-inclusive sampling technique will be used. A&#xD;
      voluntary participation will be required and the expected number of participants has been&#xD;
      estimated to be 30+. The residents will be divided into two groups based on their expected&#xD;
      exposure to minimal access surgery Group I: year 1 &amp; 2 residents Group II: year 3, 4 &amp; 5&#xD;
      residents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The workshop will be a one-day event and conducted at the Anatomy Dissection Hall of&#xD;
      the Aga Khan University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-workshop Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an MCQs based pre-test to assess the basic knowledge of the residents. The&#xD;
      questions will be related to the knowledge of abdominal anatomy, electro-cautery, harmonic&#xD;
      scalpel, laparoscopic instruments, port insertion techniques, physiological effects of&#xD;
      laparoscopy, complications and management of laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by assessment of baseline psychomotor skills of the residents on&#xD;
      laboratory-based models. The skills assessed will focus on port insertion, hand-eye&#xD;
      coordination and depth perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The training workshop will consist of didactic lectures, videos and live&#xD;
      demonstrations on the basic knowledge and skills related to the minimal access surgery. The&#xD;
      components of workshop will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A lecture focused on introduction to laparoscopic surgery including equipment /&#xD;
           instruments, energy sources, operating room setup and team work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Video demonstration of various techniques of creating pneumoperitoneum followed by&#xD;
           hands-on practice on bench model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A tutorial on physiological effects, complications and outcome of laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Live demonstration of following techniques of minimal access surgery with focus on&#xD;
           hand-eye coordination and depth perception, followed by hands-on practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Transfer of bean balls across dishes&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Passing thread through hooks&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Passing rope in graspers / running rope&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Cutting a circle on gauze with endo-scissors The various components of the workshop&#xD;
                will be spaced by intervals of refreshment and adequate time for hands-on practice&#xD;
                to avoid fatigue. (Please see the attached workshop program for time&#xD;
                specifications)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-workshop Assessment: The workshop will be followed by an immediate post-course&#xD;
      assessment consisting of an MCQ test as well as assessment of psychomotor skills on a&#xD;
      previously designed preforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval Assessment: All the participants of the workshop will be asked to keep a log of&#xD;
      their involvement in minimal access procedures during the next two months. The purpose of log&#xD;
      keeping is to assess their involvement in such procedures which may have an independent&#xD;
      effect on their skills as compared to the influence of the workshop alone. At the end of this&#xD;
      period, these residents will be invited to an interval assessment of their surgical skills on&#xD;
      a previously designed performa to document the durability of surgical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Performance: The technical skills of the residents will be video-recorded at&#xD;
      all three stages of assessment. The skills will be scored by two independent surgeons using&#xD;
      the GOALS scoring system.18 The scores will be compared for inter-rater reliability and any&#xD;
      difference will be sorted out by mutual discussion. Surgery residents routinely perform the&#xD;
      DOPS and scores will be taken for DOPS performed on minimal access surgery before and after&#xD;
      the workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic data will be described in frequencies / percentage, while&#xD;
      the pre and post MCQ / skills mean scores (3 readings) will compared by using repeat measures&#xD;
      of ANOVA. Pre and post DOPS scores (2 readings) will be compared by using paired t test. The&#xD;
      scores of MCQs, skills and DOPS will be compared by using correlation coefficient (Pearson&#xD;
      r).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of year of residency on scores will be analyzed by using one way ANOVA. Construct&#xD;
      validity of the intervention will be calculated by comparing the scores of various years /&#xD;
      level of experience. Inter-rater reliability of assessors will be assessed by comparing the&#xD;
      scores of two assessors (Bald Altman test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Clearance: An ethical approval for the conduct of the study will be obtained from the&#xD;
      institutional ethics committee. An informed consent will be obtained from the participants&#xD;
      for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed results will be given after completion of the study. It is expected that&#xD;
      post-workshop knowledge and assessment scores of surgical residents will be better as&#xD;
      compared to pre-workshop scores. The performance of residents in DOPS will also improve after&#xD;
      the workshop. It is also expected that the scores of the senior residents will be better than&#xD;
      the junior residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Conclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will objectively establish the effect of surgical skills workshop on&#xD;
      enhancing the knowledge and skills of the surgical residents. Te study will also demonstrate&#xD;
      the correlation between the workshop and DOPS scores.&#xD;
