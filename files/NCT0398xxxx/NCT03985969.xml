  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enzyme responsible for the conversion of elafibranor into its active metabolite, GFT1007,&#xD;
      has not been formally identified, but it is believed to have similar characteristics to an&#xD;
      α,β-ketoalkene reductase previously identified in rat liver cytosol. In vitro studies in&#xD;
      human liver cytosol fractions have shown that indomethacin inhibits the enzyme responsible of&#xD;
      the transformation of elafibranor into GFT1007. As a result, indomethacin was included in the&#xD;
      list of prohibited co-medications in all clinical trials with elafibranor, and a formal&#xD;
      Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) clinical study is being conducted to elucidate the effect of&#xD;
      indomethacin on elafibranor pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
