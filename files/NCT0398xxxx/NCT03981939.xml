  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the disease burden and unmet&#xD;
      need of perianal fistulas within Crohn's disease (CD) in Ontario.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective follow-up observational study of participants with CD with and&#xD;
      without complex perianal fistula (CPAF) from January 2002 to March 2017. The study will&#xD;
      verify the potential of using procedure codes to reliably identify participants with CPAF in&#xD;
      Validation Study (Objective 1), compare Crohn's participants with CPAF (cases) to matched&#xD;
      participants without CPAF (controls) to determine the disease burden and healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilization of Crohn's related CPAF in Ontario, and will describe the participant's journey&#xD;
      among Crohn's participants following the first diagnosis of CPAF (Objective 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 600 participants (300 participants with CPAF and 300&#xD;
      participants without CPAF). All participants will be enrolled in 2 observation groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD Participants with/without CPAF (ICES data)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD Participants with CPAF - The Ottawa Hospital (TOH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected through Ontario health administrative data. Participants will be&#xD;
      observed retrospectively who were diagnosed with CD with and without fistula between index&#xD;
      period: April 2002 and July 2013. Participants will be followed up retrospectively from the&#xD;
      index period (that is onset of CPAF) to the end of study (Objective 2), and for 5 years&#xD;
      following the (Objective 3) index date defined as onset of CPAF will be selected based on the&#xD;
      first time they meet the first code in the case definition identified in Objective 1 between&#xD;
      April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2012. The overall time for data collection in this study will be&#xD;
      approximately 7 months.&#xD;

    <description>Impact of total disease burden on participants CD with and without CPAF was measured as total cost and cost by sector which included general physicians (GP), specialist, all physician OHIP, home care services, hospital admissions, dialysis, cancer, and radiation, emergency department (ED), Ontario drug benefit (ODB), hospital outpatient clinics, same day surgery (SDS). Index date was defined as the date the first time the participant meets the case definition i.e. diagnosis of CD with CPAF in the index period.</description>

Index date was defined as the date the first time the participant meets the case definition i.e. diagnosis of CD with CPAF in the index period. Participants with CD and CPAF were categorized into pre-defined treatment pathways and results are reported in three arms: No Intervention, EUA ± Seton and Advanced Intervention.</description>

        <description>Healthcare Resource Utilization was based on three procedures which included the number of ED visits, number of hospitalizations and number of outpatient visits. Index date was defined as the date the first time the participant meets the case definition i.e. diagnosis of CD with CPAF in the index period. Participants with CD and CPAF were categorized into pre-defined treatment pathways and results are reported in three arms: No Intervention, EUA ± Seton and Advanced Intervention.</description>
