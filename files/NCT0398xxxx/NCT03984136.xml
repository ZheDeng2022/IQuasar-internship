  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. The control group can share their&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention certified online HIV results (COHIV) with another&#xD;
      party freely through a social networking tool, while the intervention group will be asked for&#xD;
      the COHIV before he can see the COHIV of his friend. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      requires exchange will promote HIV testing and thus reduce HIV incidence among MSM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. A WeChat-based mini program has&#xD;
      been developed to send and receive Center for Disease Control and Prevention certified online&#xD;
      HIV results (COHIV). WeChat is the ubiquitous communication and social networking tool in&#xD;
      China. We will use the social network method for participant recruitment. A social network&#xD;
      consists of one ego and some alters, and in this study a social network will be considered as&#xD;
      a cluster. In a social network, ego is the MSM who shares his certified HIV test results with&#xD;
      or without exchange mechanism by the WeChat mini program, while alters are recipients of the&#xD;
      shared links. So the ego can shares his COHIV with many alters. After an ego shares the&#xD;
      certified HIV test result with exchange mechanism (intervention group) or without exchange&#xD;
      mechanism (control group) with their WeChat contactors, the people who click the link will be&#xD;
      candidate alters in our study. 1020 alters will be recruited as the participants and the&#xD;
      randomization would be based on the unit of social network, which means the alters will be&#xD;
      randomized into the same group that the ego is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will receive his friend's COHIV and can only open it&#xD;
      when the participants share their own in exchange. If the participant already has the COHIV,&#xD;
      the system will lead the user to send his COHIV to the friend. If the participant does not&#xD;
      have the COHIV, the system will guide him to make online appointment at the testing clinic.&#xD;
      The participants in the control group will be able to receive and open the friend's COHIV&#xD;
      entirely at the friend's discretion without the mandatory exchange requirement. The system&#xD;
      will also guide users on how to get an HIV test by making appointments with the MSM friendly&#xD;
      clinics in the mini program. Questionnaires are scheduled at baseline, month 3, 6 and 9.&#xD;
      Follow-up questionnaires will be delivered through WeChat. The primary outcome is HIV testing&#xD;
      rate of the participants in the past three months.&#xD;
