    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-site run-in phase (six subjects) followed by a multicenter&#xD;
      continuation phase (114 subjects), Phase IV study. Eligible subjects will be receiving&#xD;
      CPX-351 as their usual medical care administered according to FDA approval, as a condition&#xD;

      This is an open-label, non-randomized study of a non-drug intervention in subjects receiving&#xD;
      CPX-351 as their usual medical care administered according to its FDA approval. The study&#xD;
      intervention is the application of a prescribed outpatient care model, including a nurse&#xD;
      teacher educational program and quality of life surveys for both subjects and caregivers, in&#xD;
      subjects who meet medical and logistical criteria. Induction therapy and medical follow-up&#xD;
      are performed without prophylactic admission to an inpatient facility.&#xD;
