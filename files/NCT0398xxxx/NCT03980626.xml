  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: This pilot study tests the effects of aerobic exercise training on cognitive function&#xD;
      in breast cancer survivors (BCS). To test aim 1, the investigators will randomize up to forty&#xD;
      post-menopausal BCS (3-24 months post-treatment) to a 12-week walking intervention (n=20) or&#xD;
      usual care (n=20). Walking participants will attend small group (n=3-5 BCS) sessions led by&#xD;
      an exercise specialist 3 times weekly. Usual care participants will complete baseline and&#xD;
      post-testing and be offered two sessions with an exercise specialist after all data have been&#xD;
      collected. Aim 1 measures include accelerometry, neurocognitive testing, and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes at baseline and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The investigators will generate preliminary data on clinical and biological correlates&#xD;
      of exercise and cognition, including treatment protocol, cardiorespiratory fitness, brain&#xD;
      structure and function, and cancer-related fatigue. To test aim 2, all participants will&#xD;
      complete a fitness test, electrophysiology, and patient-reported outcomes at baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention. A subset of participants will also be invited to undergo magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance, and effect&#xD;
      sizes expressed as standard mean difference will be calculated.&#xD;

    <description>The exercise intervention is designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, a known correlate of cognition and brain health, and follows the American College of Sports Medicine exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Participants will engage in small group, moderate-to-vigorous intensity walking sessions three times weekly. Sessions will begin with a warm-up and end with a cool down and be progressive in nature. Volume of exercise will increase across weeks such that participants will progress from 15-20 minutes of walking to 40-45 minutes by week 8, and from 40-55% of their estimated heart rate reserve (HRR) to 65% of their HRR by week 9. All sessions will be led by trained exercise specialists to ensure close monitoring of participant safety. Participants will wear heart rate monitors and be asked to rate their perceived exertion to ensure they are exercising within the prescribed range. Modifications to each participant's exercise prescription will be made as needed.</description>
