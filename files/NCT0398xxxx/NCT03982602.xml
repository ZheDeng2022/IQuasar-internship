  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury is a major health concern in United States. There is a un-met need to&#xD;
      develop new therapeutic options for faster neuron recovery without causing significant side&#xD;
      effects. The role of ketones in neuronal recovery has been studied and has been found to be&#xD;
      useful in decreasing size of contusion. The present study aims to study the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility profile of ketogenic diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major health concern for United States contributing nearly&#xD;
      one-third of injury-related deaths in United States. The Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1.7 million people in the United States sustain a TBI each&#xD;
      year. It is responsible for significant disabilities and the total cost of productivity loss&#xD;
      was estimated to be $76.5 billion in the United States in 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several animal models have demonstrated the effectiveness of ketones in brain injury to&#xD;
      decrease the size of contusion, improving cortical ATP levels, reduced brain edema and&#xD;
      cellular apoptosis. Ketones have been shown to be effective in neuromodulation in animal&#xD;
      models. Evaluation of carbohydrate free diet has been done in traumatic brain injury patients&#xD;
      and it was noted to not cause fluctuations in blood glucose. There is a need for safety and&#xD;
      feasibility study of ketogenic diet in traumatic brain injury patients and to understand the&#xD;
      effectiveness in neuromodulation in humans. The present study focuses on identifying the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of KD in traumatic brain injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot project data will be utilized to design future randomized clinical trials. Based&#xD;
      on the safety data, further trials will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of KD in&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury patients and its effectiveness in controlling elevated intracranial&#xD;
      pressure. It will open the avenue for consideration of new treatment option for intracranial&#xD;
      pressure management and functional recovery. From a nutrition perspective, Ketogenic diet&#xD;
      might become the standard of care for this patient population.&#xD;
