  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Singapore, the Ministry of Health has declared a &quot;War on Diabetes&quot; and major efforts will&#xD;
      be made to develop and deploy programs to prevent diabetes. One of the cornerstones of&#xD;
      diabetes management involves dietary modifications to reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
      However, implementation of a low GI diet is highly complex requiring the individual to choose&#xD;
      foods from a long list which are primarily based on western consumption patterns. Many foods&#xD;
      in the Asian diet, which largely consist of carbohydrates such as white rice, noodles and&#xD;
      other flour based products, are not represented. An alternative solution will require&#xD;
      innovative ways to alter commonly available food products that will not only help reduce&#xD;
      postprandial glycaemia but also preserve the sensory characteristics of the foods to create a&#xD;
      new generation of food products both functional and palatable. One such approach is the&#xD;
      incorporation of plant compounds that lower the glucose absorption from foods. The aim of the&#xD;
      project is to measure the GI of carbohydrate-based food with edible plant derived molecules.&#xD;
      Natural, plant-derived anthocyanin will be incorporated into bread to produce low GI bread.&#xD;
      Anthocyanins are well known for its anti-oxidant activity and recent studies reported that&#xD;
      anthocyanins also had an inhibitory activity against digestive enzymes that break down&#xD;
      carbohydrates. It can potentially inhibit amylase, and suppress the increase in postprandial&#xD;
      glucose level from starch. Bread is a carbohydrate-rich product, which contains a high amount&#xD;
      of rapidly digestible starch, and therefore many of them have a high GI. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine the glycaemic effects of anthocyanin fortified bread. The effort is designed to&#xD;
      enable and inform population interventions that will have an impact on the health of the&#xD;
      population in a sustainable manner by introducing innovative foods into the food supply that&#xD;
      are 'health promoting' based on rigorous human experiments and are acceptable to the public&#xD;
      and other major stakeholders.&#xD;
