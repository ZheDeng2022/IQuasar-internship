      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most adult women with irregular periods of unknown cause report symptoms dating back to early&#xD;
      adolescence. This study aims to learn how girls' periods change in the 2 years after their&#xD;
      first period. We are also looking at girls who may have a condition called PCOS. This will&#xD;
      help researchers learn what healthy puberty looks like and how they can spot signs of hormone&#xD;
      problems early on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how long it takes girls to develop regular menstrual cycles after their first&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy girls ages 8-14 who either (1) haven't had their first period but show signs of&#xD;
      puberty, such as breast development and hair in the genital area; or (2) had their first&#xD;
      period in the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls at risk for PCOS age 8-14 who have a mom or sister with PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare with the girls, we are looking at women &gt;=18-34 years old with PCOS,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women &gt;= 18-34 years old without PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parent or guardian must allow their daughter to participate. They must attend all study&#xD;
      visits with her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will first be screened by phone. Those who qualify will be screened in person.&#xD;
      They will have a physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will have an&#xD;
      ultrasound of their abdomen. They will fill out questionnaires. They will sit in a BOD POD&#xD;
      for 6 minutes: This is an egg- shaped machine that takes body measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have sets of visits at home or at the clinic about every 6 months. The&#xD;
      number of visits in each set will depend on their menstrual cycle. Then they will have a&#xD;
      final visit. Visits will include repeats of the screening tests. There are additional parts&#xD;
      that participants may choose to be involved in depending on how involved they want to be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home, participants will collect their urine daily to measure hormones. They will keep a&#xD;
      diary of their periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last about 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults: Women with known PCOS will complete the same Screening Visit as the girls and will&#xD;
      collect dried urine specimens at home for 8 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Healthy control women group will complete the same Screening Visit as the girls and&#xD;
      collect dried urine specimens at home for 2 menstrual cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad goal of these studies is to determine the physiologic and pathophysiologic&#xD;
      underpinnings of irregular menstrual cycles among adolescents in general and those with&#xD;
      increased genetic risk for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in the early post-menarchal&#xD;
      period. Irregular menstruation affects &gt; 2.5 million reproductive-age women in the US each&#xD;
      year1. Most adult women with oligomenorrhea of unknown etiology reporting symptoms dating&#xD;
      back to early adolescence. While a period of cycle irregularity is well-described in the&#xD;
      first few years after menarche, a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of normal&#xD;
      reproductive axis development in the post-menarchal female has hampered our ability to&#xD;
      distinguish abnormal from normal developmental trajectories. Moreover, the commonly held&#xD;
      belief that menstrual irregularity among teenage girls is normal has also delayed detection&#xD;
      of pathology in reproductive development, precluding institution of early preventative&#xD;
      strategies to curtail future reproductive morbidity.&#xD;
