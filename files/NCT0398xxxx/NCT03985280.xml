      Pilot, prospective, randomized study to compare the effectiveness of two techniques against&#xD;
      chronic hip pain :cooled radiofrequency on sensory innervation of the hip and intra-articular&#xD;
      infiltration of local anesthetic and corticoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EudraCT protocol code. 2018-000269-36&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promoter / Principal Investigator. Jorge Orduña Valls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name of the person responsible for the monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nativity Well of the Rose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Pilot, prospective, randomized study to compare the effectiveness of two techniques&#xD;
      against chronic pain of hip: radiofrequency cooled on sensory innervation of the hip and&#xD;
      intra-articular infiltration of local anesthetic and corticoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase of the trial. Phase IV, efficacy evaluation with respect to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions to study. Percentage of subjects with VAS reduction greater than 50% compared to&#xD;
      baseline at three months after application of the technique in the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longer duration of the analgesic effect (defined as a reduction of the VAS greater than 50%&#xD;
      basal) at six months from the application of the technique in patients with hip pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Application of radiofrequency cooled on nerve endings of the hip. The standard&#xD;
      treatment Non-surgical consists of intra-articular injection of local anesthetic and&#xD;
      corticoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main and secondary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of subjects with improvement in the two groups defined as VAS reduction&#xD;
           greater than 50% with respect to the baseline after three months from the application of&#xD;
           the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the persistence of the clinical effect in terms of pain reduction (quantified by&#xD;
           a reduction of 50% in the VAS scale compared to the baseline) after six months after the&#xD;
           application of the Radiofrequency cooled on sensitive nerve branches of the hip compared&#xD;
           to intra-articular injection of local anesthetic and corticoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the improvement of functional capacity of patients submitted to radiofrequency&#xD;
           cooled compared to those treated by intra-articular injection of local anesthetic and&#xD;
           corticosteroid measured by the WOMAC and Oxford Hip score scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the duration of the clinical improvement in terms of pain reduction quantified&#xD;
           by the scale VAS (analog visual scale) per year after the application of both&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the improvement of the quality of life of patients subjected to&#xD;
           radiofrequency cooled with respect to those treated by intra-articular injection of&#xD;
           local anesthetic and corticosteroid measured by the SF 36 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main valuation variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of pain by means of the Visual analogic scale (VAS) A significant reduction in&#xD;
      pain will be considered when VAS decreases by&gt; 50% of the baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional improvement valued by the scales: Oxford Hip score, WOMAC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Better of the quality of life valued by the SF 36 scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the clinical effect by means of the duration of improvement of the VAS&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population under study and total number of patients. Adult patients with chronic hip pain&#xD;
      greater than three months who has not responded to treatment conservative and that is not&#xD;
      subsidiary of surgery either by the evolutionary stage or by contraindications related to&#xD;
      morbidity terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period of follow-up. The duration of the intervention is 12 months from randomization. After&#xD;
      the scheduled interventions, patients will be scheduled for monthly follow-up, three, six and&#xD;
      twelve months after the procedure&#xD;
