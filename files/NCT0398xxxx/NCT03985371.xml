  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect preliminary efficacy and safety data on the use of&#xD;
      EDTA EYE Drops (EED) on subjects during an episode of band keratopathy (BK).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, pilot study of up to 6 subjects with documented BK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 phases: In Phase 1 subjects must be willing to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      evaluation of safety and BK symptoms during the treatment period of 6 months (Days 7, 60,&#xD;
      120, 180) and for follow up at Months 9 and 12. In Phase 2 subjects must be willing to return&#xD;
      to the clinic at 18 and 24 months post-first dose for a final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of the study, potential subjects will be screened and if they meet entry&#xD;
      requirements they will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, subjects will be assessed for baseline symptoms and visual acuity, have&#xD;
      corneal photographs taken of their affected eye, dispensed EED and instructed to use it for 2&#xD;
      times/day for 6 months in the eye with BK. They will be dosed for the first time in the&#xD;
      clinic in order to show them how to consistently use the drops. Subjects will also be given a&#xD;
      diary card to record potential adverse events and pain levels (with the first level being&#xD;
      noted in the clinic), dismissed from the clinic and reminded to return on Day 7 for&#xD;
      assessment of tolerability and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each subsequent visit (Days 7, 60, 120, 180) the subject will be asked to rate their pain&#xD;
      at the time of the visit on a pain analog scale. Their diary card will be reviewed for&#xD;
      potential adverse events (AEs) and use of EED will be assessed for technique and compliance.&#xD;
      Between visits, subjects will be called every 4 weeks by a member of the study site team to&#xD;
      assess potential AEs and dosing compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the subject or their caregiver will check the treated eye on a weekly basis and&#xD;
      note whether the calcific bands are still present on the diary card. When bands have&#xD;
      disappeared, subject will notify the eye clinic and schedule a return visit to obtain corneal&#xD;
      photographs and visual acuity test. This may occur outside the planned study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 180, subjects will present at the clinic to return their diary card and unused study&#xD;
      product. They will be asked to return to the clinic on Days 270 and 360 for assessment of&#xD;
      their visual acuity, pain, corneal photography of the affected eye and potential AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 360 will be considered the end of study phase 1. Phase 2 of the study includes long term&#xD;
      follow up for possible recurrence. Subjects will be scheduled to return for follow-up visits&#xD;
      at months 18 and 24 for assessment of visual acuity and recurrence of BK symptoms.&#xD;
