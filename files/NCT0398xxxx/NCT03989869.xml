    <textblock>
      The research question begin addressed by this study is &quot;Is Very Early Medical Abortion (VEMA&#xD;
      - before a pregnancy is visible on ultrasound scan) as effective as medical abortion when&#xD;
      performed later and an intrauterine pregnancy can be visualised with ultrasound?&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is important to patients and public, because delays to abortion care can cause mental&#xD;
      distress, and pain and bleeding are worse at later gestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is examining whether earlier or delayed administration of abortion medications&#xD;
      affects the efficacy and side effects of the medical abortion process, in women with very&#xD;
      early pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any women who had a positive pregnancy test, requesting abortion, but did not have a visible&#xD;
      pregnancy on ultrasound scan could take part in the study. Women with signs, symptoms or&#xD;
      ultrasound findings suggesting ectopic pregnancy would not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at a community sexual and reproductive health centre that&#xD;
      provides abortion care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be involved in the study for a maximum period of 4 weeks. They will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either immediate abortion care or delayed abortion care. In each arm of&#xD;
      the study they will receive clinical care that they would otherwise routinely receive. In&#xD;
      addition to this, they will receive a telephone call follow up with a short questionnaire to&#xD;
      complete over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted in Scotland but the results will be combined with findings from&#xD;
      similar research groups across Europe as part of a consortium of researchers. This consortium&#xD;
      is coordinated by the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women 18 years old or above opting for medical abortion with a pregnancy estimated by&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. No signs of ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage or other pathological pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Transvaginal ultrasound (part of the clinical protocol at the abortion visit) shows no&#xD;
             confirmed Intrauterine Pregnancy (IUP see definitions below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing and able to return to the clinic for possible delayed treatment and at 1 to 2&#xD;
             weeks after the start of treatment for follow up&#xD;

                  Pregnancy of Unknown Location) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ultrasound shows a gestational sac, or sac like structure, but without a yolk&#xD;
