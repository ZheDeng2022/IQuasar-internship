    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized clinical study is to compare the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of post-operative pain after root canal treatment with ultrasonically-activated or&#xD;
      laser-activated irrigation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients older than 18 years who require root canal treatment of an asymptomatic tooth with&#xD;
      vital or necrotic pulp are included. Those teeth are subjected to root canal treatment using&#xD;
      hand and rotating/reciprocating instruments, in combination with irrigation (3% NaOCl, 17%&#xD;
      EDTA). After chemomechanical preparation, the teeth are randomly allocated to one of the&#xD;
      following groups, according to the final irrigant activation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonically activated irrigation (UAI), with an Irrisafe file (Satelec Acteon,&#xD;
           Mérignac, France) held 1-3mm from working length, driven by an ultrasonic device,&#xD;
           activated for 3 x 20 seconds. In between each 20-second cycle, each canal is rinsed with&#xD;
           1 mL NaOCl and finally with 2 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser-activated irrigation (LAI), with the tip of a pulsed Er:YAG laser (2940 nm,&#xD;
           Fidelis II, Fotona) held above the canal entrance, activated for 2 x 30s. Settings are&#xD;
           20 Hz, 50 μs, 20 mJ. In between each 30-second cycle, each canal is rinsed with 1 mL&#xD;
           NaOCl and finally with 2 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The canals are then dried using paper points and obturated with gutta percha and an epoxy&#xD;
      resin sealer using warm vertical condensation. Finally, the endodontic access is sealed with&#xD;
      a provisional or permanent filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is asked to keep a pain diary after the treatment, indicating postoperative pain&#xD;
      on a visual analogue scale at 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment. Pain medication&#xD;
      (Ibuprofen 400mg) is prescribed, and the intake of analgesic tablet is recorded at the same&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Treatment Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical + dental history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination: sensibility tests, percussion, palpation, mobility, pockets&#xD;
           measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulpal and periapical diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of pre-op pain on 100mm VAS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient information and informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explanation on how to complete the pain diary and how and when to return it&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rubber dam, disinfection of operative field&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Removal of caries and/or defective restorations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build-up to provide a reservoir for the irrigation if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crown-down preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length determination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apical enlargement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrigation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3% NaOCl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  17% EDTA when shaping completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irrigation throughout the whole procedure with 27G notched-end needle 2 - 3 mm from WL&#xD;

    <description>The root canals and the pulp chamber are filled with NaOCl 3%. An Irrisafe file, driven by an ultrasonic unit according to the manufacturers' instructions, is held at 1-3 mm from WL (precurved if canal is curved) and activated for 30 s. The canal is then rinsed with NaOCl using a 27G needle. This cycle is repeated three times (i.e. 3*20s).</description>
