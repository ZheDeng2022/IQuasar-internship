  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study 100 patients due to undergo surgery that will result in an ostomy will be&#xD;
      provided with the Alfred SmartBag system. The system encompasses a pouch, a baseplate that&#xD;
      can track the volumetric filling of the pouch through integrated thermistor and capacitive&#xD;
      sensors and potential leakage and skin irritation development through integrated thermistors&#xD;
      in the wafer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While patients with ileostomy have a risk of dehydration, early identification of those at&#xD;
      greater risk may lead to home intervention and decreasing hospital readmission. Decreased&#xD;
      readmissions ultimately leads to faster post-operative recovery, decreased risk of&#xD;
      complications associated with readmissions (e.i. nosocomial infection, pneumonia, etc.) and&#xD;
      decreased healthcare costs. Also evaluating the patients for possible stoma related&#xD;
      complications in real time will help in treating them in a timely manner.&#xD;

      Sample size The number of subjects planned to enroll in the study is 100. It is plan to&#xD;
      enroll 4 participants per month. Participants will be part of the study from the date of&#xD;
      consent to the date when complete the follow-up at 90 days post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and screening of potential participants Patients scheduled for office visit with&#xD;
      staff physician who will be undergoing to colorectal surgery with new ileostomy creation at&#xD;
      the Cleveland Clinic, Main Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdraws:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Written request&#xD;
           should be made to the Principal Investigator (PI) via mail. Emre Gorgun, MD, 9500 Euclid&#xD;
           Ave. - A30. Cleveland, Oh. 44195&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be withdrawn from the study if become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be withdrawn from the study if any type of electronic implants is&#xD;
           applied (i.e. pacemakers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will be withdrawn per PI and/or sponsor request in the best interest of the&#xD;
           participant (e.i. medical condition, technical problems with device or mobile app).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before withdrawn, participants will have the opportunity to contact nurse (care&#xD;
           coordinator) to request information about changing Alfred SmartBag to regular ostomy bag&#xD;
           at their own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research team:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator, co-investigators, research coordinator, nurse (care coordinator),&#xD;
      sponsor's representative must be part of the study in IRB and must be compliant with research&#xD;
      policies. In addition, everyone in the team must complete CITI and HIPAA in Human Subject&#xD;
      Research training courses before engaging in any research activity. No one can take active&#xD;
      role in the study without previous documentation and approval by IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant enrollment During the preoperative period (average time within 30 days prior to&#xD;
      the surgery), eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study by the clinical&#xD;
      staff. First, staff physician or clinical personnel will introduce the study. If a patient is&#xD;
      interested, the Research Coordinator will explain the study in detail, answer any questions,&#xD;
      and provide the informed consent in a quiet clinical setting. If a patient agrees to&#xD;
      participate, he/she will sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before surgery/introductory session: after signing the informed consent and within 30&#xD;
           days prior to surgery, a participant will meet with the Research Coordinator and&#xD;
           sponsor's representative who is certified vendor at Cleveland Clinic, Main Campus.&#xD;
           Together, they will provide an extensive training on the Alfred SmartBag system&#xD;
           including the ostomy bag and the mobile application. Also, they will assist to set-up&#xD;
           the mobile app in the participant's smart phone (e.i. iPhone, Android). This system will&#xD;
           allow participant and research study personnel to monitor stoma output daily and in real&#xD;
           time. At his time, participant will receive the Alfred Jr. Teddy Bear toy as a part of&#xD;
           the &quot;Patient Engagement Program.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the surgery: staff physician will apply the Alfred SmartBag on the ostomy site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perioperative period (hospitalization/inpatient period): participant will receive&#xD;
           standard of care post-operative evaluation and assessment by attending physician and&#xD;
           clinical staff. Patient Coaches and certified vendor will contact participant to offer&#xD;
           support and answer any question regarding the Alfred Smart Bag system (ostomy bag and&#xD;
           mobile app).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At discharge from hospital: at the moment of discharge, the participant will receive 30&#xD;
           days-Supply Kit box (complete description of the items can be found on Appendix 2; table&#xD;
           1(p. 29). Participant will be able to monitor ostomy output in real time and contact&#xD;
           clinic staff personnel if alerted by the mobile app. In addition, Starbucks gift card&#xD;
           $15 dollars and Amazon gift card $25 dollars will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At day 30 post-surgery: second formal wound review will be performed as a part of the&#xD;
           standard of care. Documentation of the 30 Day Post-Operative Report. Appendix 2; table 2&#xD;
           (p. 31-34).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At day 60 post-surgery: record output in the mobile application. Documentation of the 60&#xD;
           Day Post-Operative Report. Appendix 2; table 2 (p. 31-34).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At day 90 post-surgery and beyond: record last output in the mobile app. Documentation&#xD;
           of the 90 Day Post-Operative Report. Appendix 2; table 2 (p. 31-34). This is the end of&#xD;
           the participation of the study. After this event, participants will not be provided with&#xD;
           any part of the Alfred Smart Bag system either ostomy bags, mobile application, or any&#xD;
           other services provided as a part of this study. At this time, participants will have&#xD;
           the opportunity to choose what type of ostomy bag they prefer to continue with at their&#xD;
           own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time, complications, unanticipated problems, adverse effects, phone calls, 30-day&#xD;
      post-operative report will be documented in logs according to standard practices or in&#xD;
      formats included in Appendix 2; table 2 (p.30-31).&#xD;

    <description>The Alfred SmartBag encompasses a pouch, a baseplate, and a hub, is intended to be used as a continuous ostomy monitoring system by tracking the volumetric filling of the pouch through integrated thermistor and capacitive sensors and potential leakage and skin irritation development through integrated thermistors in the wafer. The Alfred SmartBag system is indicated for daily use for both in-patient and out-patient settings to provide information to patient and medical professionals. The data is intended to aid patient self-management and to alert the clinical team to changes in the patient condition that may warrant specific intervention.</description>
