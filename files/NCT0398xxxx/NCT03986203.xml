  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Spry&#xD;
      Belt. The Spry Belt is intended to deliver energy to the user's skeleton to reduce the&#xD;
      progression of age-related decrease in bone quality in postmenopausal women. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will receive the active treatment, while the other half will receive the&#xD;
      sham/placebo treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women lose a significant amount of bone after menopause and are at high risk of breaking&#xD;
      bones. Bone cells have been shown to be responsive to different forms of applied energy,&#xD;
      which can be used to reduce the progression of age-related declines in bone properties. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Spry Belt&#xD;
      when used regularly over one year. The Spry Belt, a medical device that is worn around the&#xD;
      hips like a belt, provides energy to the user's skeleton with the goal of improving bone&#xD;
      quality in postmenopausal women with osteopenia, or low bone mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, controlled study, all participants will receive the Spry Belt for at-home&#xD;
      use over the 12 month study. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the active or&#xD;
      sham/placebo treatment group and give a Spry Belt that is pre-programmed to deliver the&#xD;
      corresponding therapy. Participants will self-administer treatment sessions at least 5 times&#xD;
      per week for 12 months. The effectiveness of the Spry Belt treatment will be assessed via CT&#xD;
      and DXA scans of the user's bones to evaluate changes in bone density and strength over the&#xD;
      study duration.&#xD;
