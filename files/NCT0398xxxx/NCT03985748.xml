      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization and outcomes of AeroEclipse® II Breath&#xD;
      Actuated Nebulizer (BAN, Monaghan Medical Corporation, Plattsburgh, NY) vs. standard&#xD;
      continuous flow nebulizers (SN). We hypothesize that the use of AeroEclipse® II BAN will&#xD;
      reduce the number of nebulizer treatments needed (primary outcome).&#xD;

      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective administration of aerosolized medications depends on the patient's age, physical&#xD;
      and cognitive ability the delivery system, and the patient-device interface. Physical ability&#xD;
      means the patient's ability to use a specific device, based on factors such as inspiratory&#xD;
      volumes and flows, hand-breath coordination, or ability to use a mouthpiece. Cognitive&#xD;
      ability indicates the patient's understanding of how and when to use a device and medication.&#xD;
      Airway size, respiratory rate, inspiratory flow rate, and breathing pattern create&#xD;
      substantial challenges for effective aerosol delivery. While most aerosol generators can be&#xD;
      used with all age groups, special consideration should be given to young children because&#xD;
      they cannot master the complex steps required for adequate delivery of aerosol treatments. A&#xD;
      mouthpiece may be used for patients &gt; 3 years who are able to cooperate, while a face mask is&#xD;
      recommended for patients who cannot use a mouthpiece. Face masks should be properly fitted&#xD;
      with minimal leak, particularly avoiding aerosol delivery into the eyes, to optimize inhaled&#xD;
      dose. Aerosol generators are equally efficacious if they are age appropriate and used&#xD;
      correctly. Regardless of age, patients need to demonstrate ability to seal the lips around&#xD;
      the mouthpiece and ability to generate sufficient flow for the specific inhaler. However, the&#xD;
      impact of breath-actuation on nebulizer utilization and outcomes vs. standard nebulizer has&#xD;
      yet to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per the American Association Respiratory Care (AARC) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Aerosol&#xD;
      Delivery Device Selection for Spontaneously Breathing Patients: 2012, the &quot;appropriate&#xD;
      selection of an aerosol generator&quot; is reflected by 1) a positive clinical outcome after&#xD;
      aerosol therapy, 2) use of proper technique in applying aerosol delivery system, 3) patient&#xD;
      adherence with application of aerosol delivery systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admissions to Rhode Island Hospital (RIH) for respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are common. COPD exacerbations are typically treated&#xD;
      with a combination of intravenous or oral corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators.&#xD;
      Inhaled bronchodilators, including Albuterol, Atrovent and Combivent (a combination of&#xD;
      Albuterol and Atrovent), are usually administered as a nebulized solution until there is&#xD;
      clinical improvement to the point where patients can be transitioned back to their outpatient&#xD;
      metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Standard nebulizers are delivered as a continuous stream of&#xD;
      inhaled medication through an interface that the patient holds in his/her mouth. As the&#xD;
      medication is delivered irrespective of whether the patient is inhaling or exhaling, a&#xD;
      significant portion that is intended to be deposited into the lung never reaches its&#xD;
      destination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Breath Actuated Nebulizers (BANs) have been developed to provide nebulized&#xD;
      medications only when the patient inhales. Industry-sponsored studies, included those that&#xD;
      have been funded by Monaghan Medical (Monaghan Medical Corporation, Plattsburgh, NY), the&#xD;
      manufacturer of the AeroEclipse II BAN, have demonstrated that nebulized medications&#xD;
      delivered via a BAN device have improved drug deposition to more distal areas of the lungs.&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the hospital with an acute COPD exacerbation have improved lung&#xD;
      hyperinflation and tachypnea when nebulized bronchodilators are administered through a BAN&#xD;
      device compared with a continuous flow nebulizer. In addition, BAN use has been associated&#xD;
      with a cost savings, in part due to improved workflow efficiency for respiratory therapists&#xD;
      and a decrease in the overall number of nebulizer treatments needed. However, there is a&#xD;
      paucity of data that address more clinically-relevant outcomes in patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations that are treated with bronchodilators delivered by BANs versus continuous&#xD;
      flow nebulizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the utilization and outcomes of AeroEclipse® II Breath Actuated Nebulizer (BAN,&#xD;
      Monaghan Medical Corporation, Plattsburgh, NY) vs. standard continuous flow nebulizers (SN).&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of AeroEclipse® II BAN will reduce the number of nebulizer&#xD;
      treatments needed (primary outcome). Other clinical outcomes gathered (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
      are described in Experimental Design and Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center superiority randomized controlled trial. All patients&#xD;
      admitted to RIH from the Emergency Department for acute COPD exacerbation are eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment. The risks of involvement are no greater than if the patient was not to&#xD;
      participate as these patients all receive nebulizers as standard of care. Clinically, either&#xD;
      BAN or SN can be utilized in acute COPD exacerbations to delivery aerosolized drugs. Both BAN&#xD;
      and SN are FDA approved and are currently marketed. BAN's breath-actuating technology offers&#xD;
      more targeted, on-demand drug delivery, which consequently increases the cost of the device.&#xD;
      RIH does not currently use the BAN in adult patient care services because the of the lack of&#xD;
      available clinical superiority data (the data we are seeking to gather from the present,&#xD;
      proposed investigation) to justify such additional costs. The breath-actuating technology&#xD;
      uses a one-way valve to deliver the aerosol in response to the patient's inspiratory flow.&#xD;
      The SN does not have such a one-way valve, thus delivers the drug in a more continuous,&#xD;
      uninterrupted flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive AeroEclipse® II BAN or SN in the RIH&#xD;
      Emergency Department. They will have an equal chance of being placed in either group.&#xD;
      Patients will be screened and identified in the Emergency Department. They will receive the&#xD;
      BAN or SN for the duration of their stay in the hospital, as long as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to enroll up to 150 patients to participate in the study for the duration of their&#xD;
      stay in the hospital. Consent will be obtained ideally from patients in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department although if still eligible, patients could be consented on the patient care unit.&#xD;
      The collected data will be obtained specifically for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On subject enrollment, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C)&#xD;
      will be administered. The SGRQ is a 14-item questionnaire developed to measure health status&#xD;
      (quality of life) in patients with COPD and is well-validated in this patient population. The&#xD;
      SGRQ-C will serve as a baseline measurement for each patient. Not all patients at the time of&#xD;
      inclusion will have any objective data to support the diagnosis of COPD (i.e., no previous&#xD;
      PFTs). Therefore, this information will provide some measurement of disease severity for&#xD;
      these patients. Patients will use either BAN or SN per randomization assignment for as long&#xD;
      as treatment with nebulizers is clinically indicated by their healthcare team for the&#xD;
      duration of their stay in the hospital. If patients get intubated, they will remain enrolled&#xD;
      in the study as long as treatment with nebulizers is clinically indicated by their healthcare&#xD;
      team after extubation. Researchers will review the patient's EMR for demographic, past&#xD;
      medical history, medications, vital signs, nursing data, radiographic, and laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups will have bedside, handheld PFTs performed (measuring FEV1 and FVC)&#xD;
      at baseline. These measurements will be performed by respiratory therapist or trained&#xD;
      research personnel. Subjects will also be asked to complete a daily Likert scale rating their&#xD;
      shortness of breath while receiving nebulizer treatments for up to 7 days.&#xD;

          -  Patient must be 18 years or older and must be admitted to RIH for acute COPD&#xD;
             exacerbation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to understand the information about the research protocol that is&#xD;
             provided by the investigators and be able to sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a patient does not meet this criterion, consent can be obtained from a&#xD;
                  surrogate decision maker&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spanish speaking patients will be included and consent will be obtained using the&#xD;
                  short form and an interpreter. The SGRQ-C is translated and validated in Spanish&#xD;
                  and is readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to receive nebulizer treatments per assigned&#xD;
             randomization group&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to enroll patient within 24 hours of presentation to the Emergency&#xD;
             Department, where Time 0 = triage time, or before administration of the 5th nebulizer&#xD;
             treatment, whichever comes first&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women&#xD;
