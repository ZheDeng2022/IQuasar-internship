  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how resistance training impacts appetite and the brain's&#xD;
      response to food. The study will be evaluating how the brain responds to food images as well&#xD;
      as how behaviors and hormones change with a 12 week resistance training intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1: To determine if RT impacts neuronal function associated with food intake behavior in a&#xD;
      manner favoring reduced EI in overweight/obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to pre, post-RT fMRI measures will demonstrate ↓ neuronal responses to&#xD;
      food cues in the insula, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, brain regions implicated in&#xD;
      reward, impulsivity, motivation, and regulation of ingestive behaviors. These changes will be&#xD;
      associated with ad libitum EI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine if RT impacts appetite-related peptides, ratings, and food intake&#xD;
      behaviors in a manner favoring reduced EI in overweight/obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to pre, post-RT measures will show changes in appetite-related peptides,&#xD;
      ratings (↓ hunger ↑ satiety), and behaviors (↓food-related cravings &amp; impulsivity, ↑&#xD;
      self-efficacy) consistent with EI reduction. Changes in appetite regulation indices will be&#xD;
      associated with changes in relevant brain networks (Aim 1). These changes will also be&#xD;
      associated with ↓ ad libitum EI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: To determine if RT impacts neuronal function and appetite-related peptides&#xD;
      and behaviors in a manner favoring ↓ EI in Non-Compensators (top tertile of fat mass loss) as&#xD;
      compared to Compensators (bottom tertile of fat mass loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to Compensators, Non-Compensators will show ↓ neuronal responses to food&#xD;
      cues and default network, and changes in appetite-related peptides, ratings, and behaviors&#xD;
      consistent with ↓ EI.&#xD;
