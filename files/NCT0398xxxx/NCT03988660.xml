  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate diagnostic biomarkers for acute appendicitis (AA) are lacking. Circulating&#xD;
      fibrocytes (CFs) are increased in inflammatory states. It is not known whether they are&#xD;
      altered in appendicitis. This study aimed to assess if CF altered in AA, and compared their&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy with white cell count (WCC), C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils,&#xD;
      lymphocytes, neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), monocytes, basophils and eosinophils in&#xD;
      diagnosis of AA in patients presenting with right iliac fossa pain (RIFP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      95 consecutive adults were recruited in a cohort based prospective study at University&#xD;
      Hospital Limerick, 15 were healthy individuals and 80 were patients with RIFP. Peripheral&#xD;
      venous samples were obtained at presentation. Clinical, biochemical and histo-pathological&#xD;
      parameters were recorded. CF levels were determined by dual-staining for CD45 and Col-1 using&#xD;
      FACS and correlated with histopathological diagnoses. P&lt;0.05 was taken as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that in patients with suspected appendicitis, CF levels may improve&#xD;
      the diagnostics, reduce unnecessary radiation and negative appendicectomy rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis (AA) is the commonest abdominal emergency. Despite its high prevalence,&#xD;
      the diagnosis of appendicitis remains a challenge. The clinical presentation is frequently&#xD;
      atypical and symptoms often overlap with many other conditions. Coupled with this, failure to&#xD;
      reach a prompt diagnosis can result in adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating fibrocytes (CFs) were first described in 1994 by Richard Bucala. They are&#xD;
      haematopoietic cells derived from the bone marrow. They circulate in the monocyte fraction&#xD;
      and can differentiate into myelofibrocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes (among other cell&#xD;
      types). They have a prominent role in inflammatory and healing processes, and in the&#xD;
      development of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies to date have examined the role of CFs in acute appendicitis. Thus, the aims of&#xD;
      this clinical trial were (1) to determine if CFs are altered in acute appendicitis, (2) to&#xD;
      assess and compare their diagnostic accuracy with CRP, WCC, neutrophils, lymphocytes,&#xD;
      neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), monocytes, basophils and eosinophils, and (3) to&#xD;
      determine the most reliable predictors in diagnosing AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study was undertaken to (1) determine circulating fibrocytes levels (CF)&#xD;
      in patients with histologically confirmed acute appendicitis (AA), and (2) to determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of circulating CF levels in the diagnosis of AA, in adults (age ≥&#xD;
      16 years) presenting acutely with right iliac fossa pain, at the University hospital&#xD;
      Limerick. The diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed by histopathological assessment&#xD;
      following appendicectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided in three cohorts following their final diagnosis on discharge and based&#xD;
      on the histopathology results. (1) patients with RIFP who underwent an appendicectomy and had&#xD;
      a normal appendix at histological assessment i.e histologically proven normal appendix group&#xD;
      (HPNG). (2) patients with RIFP who underwent an appendicectomy and had an inflamed appendix&#xD;
      at histological assessment i.e histologically proven appendicitis group (HPAG). (3) patients&#xD;
      with RIFP who had an alternate diagnosis on discharge other than appendicitis i.e alternative&#xD;
      diagnosis group (ADG). Another cohort was added as (4) healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected included date of admission, patient's gender, age, presenting symptoms,&#xD;
      duration of symptoms, CF levels, preoperative WCC and its differentials (neutrophil,&#xD;
      lymphocyte, neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), monocyte, basophil and eosinophil counts),&#xD;
      CRP, final clinical diagnosis, operation and post-operative diagnosis based at histological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral venous samples were obtained from patients in cohort 1, 2 and 3 (n= 80) and&#xD;
      healthy controls (n=15). A single 10 mL sample of heparinized venous blood was collected via&#xD;
      peripheral, upper extremity venipuncture. Samples were collected in sodium heparin (EDTA)&#xD;
      vacutainer tubes and transferred to the laboratory within 3 hours. Samples were then&#xD;
      processed to isolate the buffy coat layer using density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque,&#xD;
      Sigma-Aldrich, Wicklow, Ireland). The resulting peripheral blood mononuclear cells were&#xD;
      subsequently washed in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and re-suspended in freezing medium&#xD;
      (50% foetal bovine serum, 40% RPMI medium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide) prior to transfer to&#xD;
      cryogenic vials in 1-ml aliquots. Finally, samples were cooled in a cryogenic temperature&#xD;
      control rate container to -80 °C until processing for flow cytometry. Following white blood&#xD;
      cell isolation using density gradient centrifugation, 1×106cells were re-suspended in flow&#xD;
      cytometry buffer (RPMI medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 0.1% sodium azide and 25 mM&#xD;
      HEPES). Cells were fixed and permeabilised using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD&#xD;
      Biosciences, Oxford, England) and blocked prior to intracellular staining of Collagen-I with&#xD;
      mouse anti-human Collagen-I antibody (Millipore, Cork, Ireland, Product code MAB3391) which&#xD;
      was subsequently stained with Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson&#xD;
      ImmunoResearch Europe, Suffolk, England; Product code 115-545-146). Cells were then stained&#xD;
      for cell surface antigen CD45 using PerCP anti-human CD45 (Biolegend, London, England). Cells&#xD;
      were then re-suspended in PBS before subsequent analysis on the flow cytometer (BD&#xD;
      FACSVerse). All analysis was done on a BD FACSVerse (BD Biosciences) using BD FACSuite v1.0.5&#xD;
      (BD Biosciences). Fibrocyte levels were displayed as a percentage of the total white blood&#xD;
      cell population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS for Mac OSX version 25.0. Data were presented as&#xD;
      means and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Distribution of variables was assessed by histograms, Q-Q plots, and box plots. Analysis of&#xD;
      Variance (One-Way ANOVA) was used to compare between different independent groups.&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare between the biomarkers and the different groups (HPNG&#xD;
      vs. HPAG vs. ADG), and for subgroup analysis pairwise comparisons were performed, a P - value&#xD;
      of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Receiver operating characteristic&#xD;
      (ROC) curve was used to characterize and compare between the diagnostic accuracy of CFs, WCC,&#xD;
      CRP, neutrophils, NLR and monocytes. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to&#xD;
      assess for independent predictors for AA.&#xD;
