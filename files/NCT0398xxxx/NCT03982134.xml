  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find the dose of the study drug PDR001 that, when&#xD;
      given in combination with the drug Panobinostat, results in the best outcomes for metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-randomized Phase Ib study combining PDR001 with HDAC inhibitor&#xD;
      Panobinostat in patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC who have failed prior Anti PD1 or&#xD;
      PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      Panobinostat in combination with PDR001. Standard 3+3 design will be used for dose escalation&#xD;
      or de-escalation. Depending upon tolerability and dosing, the total number of participants&#xD;
      may vary from 9-24. Initially patients will start from dose level '0' and there will be 1&#xD;
      dose escalation level '1' and two de-escalation levels ('-1' and '-2'). The maximum number in&#xD;
      each dose level will be 6.&#xD;

             contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;

                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;

                  vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes) in the absence of other medical&#xD;
                  justification or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In&#xD;
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman&#xD;
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of&#xD;
                  child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the&#xD;
             study treatment and for 150 days after stopping study treatment and should not father&#xD;
             a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as&#xD;
             well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the&#xD;
             drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;

             inhibitors like Cimetidine, Grapefruit juice and Seville oranges as mentioned in&#xD;
             appendix E. If patient can come off of these drugs and receive an alternative therapy&#xD;
             then they will be eligible as far as time equals 4 half-lives of that medication has&#xD;
             elapsed prior to starting protocol therapy.&#xD;
