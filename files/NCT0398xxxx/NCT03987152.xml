      Congenital vascular anomalies are uncommon and belong to the group of rare diseases.These&#xD;
      vascular malformations can cause serious complications including obstruction of vital organs&#xD;
      and their function, recurrent infection and significantly reduced quality of life of persons&#xD;
      affected.Treatment options range from conservative to surgical extirpation or intralesional&#xD;
      embolisation/sclerosis. Unfortunately, this is often not enough. Many patients still have&#xD;
      complaints like severe pain and invalidation due to the lymphatic or venous malformation&#xD;
      making a normal functional life impossible. Recent case reports mention the positive effects&#xD;
      of refractory patients with Sirolimus. Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is currently the&#xD;
      only FDA-approved mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital vascular anomalies are uncommon and belong to the group of rare diseases. In 1996,&#xD;
      the International Society of the Study of Vascular Anomalies adopted a new classification,&#xD;
      distinguishing vascular malformations from vascular tumors. This classification was revised&#xD;
      in 2014 and newly identified genetic features were taken into account. Vascular malformations&#xD;
      feature dysplastic malformed vessels and are a consequence of a defective development of the&#xD;
      embryonic vascular system. Vascular malformations can involve lymphatic vessels, capillaries,&#xD;
      veins and arteries or even combinations. These vascular malformations are present at birth&#xD;
      and grow with the child. Treatment options range from conservative to surgical extirpation or&#xD;
      intralesional embolisation/sclerosis. Unfortunately, this is often not enough. Many patients&#xD;
      still have complaints like severe pain and invalidation due to the lymphatic or venous&#xD;
      malformation making a normal functional life impossible. These vascular malformations can&#xD;
      cause serious complications including obstruction of vital organs and their function,&#xD;
      recurrent infection and significantly reduced quality of life of persons affected. As the&#xD;
      natural course of the disease affects multiple body systems, the therapeutic management is&#xD;
      challenging. To date, no other medical treatment options are available. Although standard&#xD;
      pain medication is given according the (inter) national pain protocols, patients still suffer&#xD;
      pain and are not able to function normally in daily life. Majority (60-70% percent of the&#xD;
      patients) of the patients is not able to have a normal life, with a normal job and normal&#xD;
      social activities. Children are often not able to go to school normally, cannot play outside&#xD;
      and have pain at the site of the malformation. The vast majority of literature reporting&#xD;
      medical therapies for vascular anomalies consists of case reports and small series and is&#xD;
      complicated by publication bias (negative findings are often not published), inconsistent use&#xD;
      of nomenclature, and the absence of clinical trials. Recent case reports mention the positive&#xD;
      effects of refractory patients with Sirolimus. Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is&#xD;
      currently the only FDA-approved mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, indicated for&#xD;
      prevention of kidney allograft rejection in adults and children 13 years or older, but is&#xD;
      commonly used to manage organ rejection in younger children.&#xD;
