  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this evaluation is to document the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions&#xD;
      (relative to baseline) in patients treated with the transcarotid artery revascularization&#xD;
      (TCAR) procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center evaluation of patients requiring carotid&#xD;
      revascularization who are treated with the FDA-cleared ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS in&#xD;
      conjunction with the FDA-approved ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System. Both the ENROUTE&#xD;
      Transcarotid NPS and ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System have received CE mark and are&#xD;
      commercially available in the European Union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will have been offered the TCAR intervention as part of&#xD;
      standard of care for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, regardless of whether or not&#xD;
      they agree to be in the study. Therefore, the act of participation in this procedure will not&#xD;
      be the determining factor in whether or not the patient receives the TCAR treatment. Subject&#xD;
      participation means they agree to undergo two additional DW-MRI imaging procedures&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure and at 30 days to determine whether there is an increase in&#xD;
      new white lesions. Any other procedure other than the active collection of consent and data&#xD;
      by the sponsor is standard of care for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be monitored to document the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions&#xD;
      (relative to baseline).&#xD;
