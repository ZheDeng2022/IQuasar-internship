  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) offers a cure to those with&#xD;
      chronic HCV infection. For marginalized communities, linkage to care services often aren't&#xD;
      enough to overcome barriers to accessing the medical system. For difficult to link&#xD;
      populations, offering treatment at the same non-clinical community space may improve uptake&#xD;
      and reduce loss-to-follow-up. The purpose of this 2 year study is to assess the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and effectiveness of accelerated initiation of commercially available DAA&#xD;
      therapy targeting socially marginalized communities (e.g., medically underserved, homeless,&#xD;
      people actively injecting drugs). The study will be carried out at two community sites that&#xD;
      perform HCV testing: (a) fixed community site and (b) community mobile site via clinical&#xD;
      research van. Participants (n=150) who test anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA positive (chronic&#xD;
      infection) are invited to enroll into the no one waits (NOW) Study and begin HCV treatment at&#xD;
      point of diagnosis. All evaluation, medication dissemination, and follow-up care will take&#xD;
      place at the project site. The investigators will estimate the effect of on-site&#xD;
      point-of-diagnosis (POD) treatment on (1) time from HCV testing to treatment initiation, (2)&#xD;
      completing treatment, and (3) attaining (sustained virologic response) SVR-12; overall and by&#xD;
      study site. A secondary product will be a lesson learned guide of recommendations for&#xD;
      implementing a POD on-site test and treat program for dissemination beyond San Francisco.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOW is an open-label study evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      accelerated community-based treatment program of SOF/VEL x 12 weeks started at time of&#xD;
      chronic HCV diagnosis (intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      effectiveness of accelerated initiation of commercially available direct-acting antiviral&#xD;
      (DAA) therapy targeting socially marginalized communities (e.g., medically underserved,&#xD;
      homeless, people actively injecting drugs). The proposed study will be carried out at two&#xD;
      community sites that perform HCV testing: (a) fixed community site and (b) community mobile&#xD;
      site. The fixed site is located in the Tenderloin Neighborhood of San Francisco: The Quaker&#xD;
      Meeting House (QMH). The QMH is the current location for an established drop-in center for&#xD;
      young adult (&lt; 30 years old) people who inject drugs, a group at highest risk for acquiring&#xD;
      new HCV infection but representing a group with the lowest engagement in HCV treatment. The&#xD;
      QMH site is complete with two phlebotomy stations, centrifuge, clinical exam station,&#xD;
      interview rooms, and office space. The QMH research site will prioritize study enrollment for&#xD;
      young adult people who inject drugs (PWID). The community mobile site (DeLIVER Van) is&#xD;
      situated in a mobile van; a 145 sqft space equipped with a phlebotomy station, clinical exam&#xD;
      table, centrifuge, and portable Fibroscan® 430 Mini Plus. The DeLIVER Van will serve two&#xD;
      neighborhoods in San Francisco with high HCV burden but few community-based medical service&#xD;
      organizations: the Bayview neighborhood and Outer Mission neighborhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will (1) implement new tools, notably FIBROSCANS, to measure fibrosis in an&#xD;
      at-risk group (HCV positive patients); (2) implement a new standard of care, treatment&#xD;
      on-demand in an at-risk group (HCV positive active drug users); (3) assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of expanding standard of care into non-clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will undergo a combined eligibility screening/entry visit, which&#xD;
      includes HCV testing (antibody and RNA), rapid anti-HIV test, and HBsAG (hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      surface antigen) testing and consent for medical record linkage. If HCV RNA reactive,&#xD;
      participants are offered enrollment into the treatment cohort and provided 2 week supply of&#xD;
      SOF/VEL (provided by Gilead as part of the NOW Study) upon completion of a clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, baseline survey, and venipuncture for baseline labs. If the participant is&#xD;
      actively insured, the study investigators will obtain insurance-authorized SOF/VEL to&#xD;
      complete the remainder of the 12 week treatment course. If the participant is not actively&#xD;
      insured, the study team will assist with insurance acquisition and subsequently obtain&#xD;
      insurance-authorized SOF/VEL to complete the remainder of the 12 week treatment course. For&#xD;
      any participants, if insurance-authorized SOF/VEL is delayed beyond the initial 2 week&#xD;
      study-provided SOF/VEL, additional supplies of SOF/VEL as needed to ensure an uninterrupted&#xD;
      12 week treatment course. Participants will return every 2 weeks during treatment (12 week&#xD;
      course) for medication dispensation and study visit activities. And for two post-treatment&#xD;
      visits for clinical monitoring (e.g., HCV RNA testing) and research activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants in the intervention study (cohort): Chronic HCV (anti-HCV positive and HCV&#xD;
      RNA positive) men and women ages ≥18 years newly diagnosed or re-engaged in care at a fixed&#xD;
      or mobile community-based site. Participants should be HBsAg negative, have no known history&#xD;
      of decompensated cirrhosis or end stage renal disease, not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and&#xD;
      not be taking medications that are contraindicated with SOF/VEL.&#xD;

    <description>Trained research staff will measure participants liver stiffness using liver ultrasonographic elastography. Research staff place ultrasound gel directly on participant's skin on the area of the torso. Research staff will position the participant's body on the exam table to assure the liver can be located, placing the small probe on the body's surface (skin with gel) and begin recording images of the participant's liver.&#xD;
The procedure will take 15-30 minutes, depending on the ease with which the research staff is able to accurately locate the participant's liver.&#xD;
Results from the FibroScan will be discussed with a trained provider.</description>
