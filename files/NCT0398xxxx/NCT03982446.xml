      This study will assess the hereditary component of pancreatic cancer in the largest series of&#xD;
      patients up to date through the parallel analysis of 62 cancer-associated genes. The&#xD;
      investigators will obtain germline DNA from blood samples that have been collected from 2000&#xD;
      to 2019 from patients with pancreatic cancer. The investigators plan to analyze germline DNA&#xD;
      for mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that have been previously&#xD;
      linked to a predisposition towards cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome can provide useful insight on the overall understanding of pancreatic&#xD;
      pathogenesis while possible associations with age of diagnosis, tumor stage and other cancer&#xD;
      types might arise. In addition to that, it can lead to the characterization of new variants&#xD;
      or even new genes that predispose to pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed deleterious mutations in established cancer genes can provide valuable clinical&#xD;
      information that can lead to effective, individualized patient management. Furthermore,&#xD;
      family relatives of the individuals found to carry mutations can also benefit from&#xD;
      established screening protocols for various cancer types, such as frequent colonoscopies in&#xD;
      the case of an MMR mutation predisposing for Lynch syndrome, or preventative surgeries in the&#xD;
      case of a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. In addition to that, specific therapies that&#xD;
      have been previously shown to be effective in breast or ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 &amp;&#xD;
      BRCA2 mutations, such as platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors can be also&#xD;
      effective in mutations carriers with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has poor prognosis mainly highlighted by the low&#xD;
      5-year survival rate, which is estimated to be around 6%. Although pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      incidence is approximately 0.5% in the general population, it has a high-mortality rate. It&#xD;
      is being registered as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United&#xD;
      States. Poor prognosis is mainly attributed to the lack of efficient treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the majority of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases being sporadic, familial clustering&#xD;
      (defined by the presence of at least two first degree relatives with pancreatic cancer) is&#xD;
      observed in ~20% of the cases, whereas a clear genetic cause is identified in approximately&#xD;
      half of these cases. Pancreatic cancer is known to occur in a range of cancer predisposing&#xD;
      syndromes, such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Peutz-Jeghers, familial adenomatous&#xD;
      polyposis, Lynch, Li-Fraumeni and familial atypical multiple mole syndromes, while there have&#xD;
      been clear associations with loss-of-function mutations in non-syndromic cancer genes, such&#xD;
      as PALB2 and ATM. In addition, individuals carrying mutations in PRSS1 gene that predisposes&#xD;
      for hereditary pancreatitis are also considered to be at high-risk for pancreatic cancer. It&#xD;
      is therefore clear that pancreatic cancer is not related with a single cancer predisposition&#xD;
      gene, but with numerous known and probably yet to be discovered, cancer susceptibility genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the accurate fraction of genetic predisposition in pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      hasn't been determined. Previous studies have evaluated the prevalence of loss-of-function&#xD;
      mutations in known cancer predisposition genes in pancreatic cancer patients through the use&#xD;
      of multi-gene panels. The mutation yield ranged from 3.8% to 9.7% in genes that were&#xD;
      previously found relevant to pancreatic cancer predisposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through these studies, it has been highlighted that family history and stage of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer or age at diagnosis is not always a predictor of an underlying genetic factor, while&#xD;
      phenotypic heterogeneity is usually associated with mutation status. The search for novel&#xD;
      predisposition genes in pancreatic cancer patients without family history is ongoing through&#xD;
      candidate genes analysis or through whole exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology Clinicopathological characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA from pancreatic cancer patients will be retrospectively and prospectively&#xD;
      collected from the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) Tumor Repository, through&#xD;
      years 2000-2019. Written informed consent has already been obtained from all patients for the&#xD;
      use and storage of their biologic material along with their approval for their participation&#xD;
      in research studies. The study will be in agreement with the 1975 Helsinki statement, revised&#xD;
      in 1983.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with pancreatic cancer will be retrieved form&#xD;
      their medical record. Diagnosis will be confirmed through pathology reports, which will also&#xD;
      provide information about grade, proliferation rate, histological subtype and lymphovascular&#xD;
      invasion. From the patient medical record, tumor size, nodal involvement as well as&#xD;
      metastatic lesions (TNM staging) will be reported. Importantly, detailed family history will&#xD;
      be collected. The collection of these information will be in compliance with the regulations&#xD;
      of the Bioethics committees of participating hospitals. Clinicopathological characteristics&#xD;
      will be correlated with the different genomic abnormalities identified by sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Germline DNA extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected from patients with pancreatic cancer. Germline DNA from white&#xD;
      blood cells will be isolated using a commercially available blood DNA extraction kit.&#xD;
      Germline DNA will then be subjected to mechanical fragmentation via sonication to reach a DNA&#xD;
      size of approximately 200-250 bp for downstream next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next-Generation Sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted capture enrichment NGS relies on in-solution hybridization of DNA libraries with&#xD;
      TACS (Targeted Capture Enrichment Sequences) for the identification of germline mutations in&#xD;
      cancer patients. First, TACS that target mutations associated with hereditary cancer (in a&#xD;
      total of 62 cancer predisposing genes) are designed and prepared by PCR followed by&#xD;
      biotinylation. Biotinylated TACS will then be immobilized on streptavidin coated magnetic&#xD;
      beads for subsequent hybridisation with the DNA libraries. DNA libraries are prepared from&#xD;
      patient derived-germline DNA that fulfill quality control criteria (DNA yield, DNA integrity&#xD;
      and fragment size) according to established protocols. Library preparation involves the 3'&#xD;
      end and 5' end adaptor ligation and each DNA library will be barcoded using unique&#xD;
      oligonucleotide DNA sequences to allow subsequent discrimination after sequencing. Subsequent&#xD;
      to barcoding, samples will undergo hybridization using custom made 5'-biotynylated TACS&#xD;
      followed by PCR amplification. Finally, enriched DNA libraries will be normalised and pooled&#xD;
      on a NGS platform prior to paired-end sequencing using manufacturer's protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioinformatic and Data Analysis Sequence data from leucocyte (buffy coat) DNA will be&#xD;
      demultiplexed and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using appropriate aligner algorithms&#xD;
      (BWA) to generate a BAM file. A combination of variant calling algorithms will be used to&#xD;
      call germline mutations. Local realignment will be performed for accurate detection of small&#xD;
      insertions and deletions and appropriate algorithms to detect rearrangements. Bioinformatics&#xD;
      tools for copy number alterations (CNAs) calling such as ASCAT-2, CNVkit or ANACONDA will be&#xD;
      used for the assessment of focal gene amplification or deletion events. Read depth-based&#xD;
      analysis will also be taken into consideration for assessment of gene-level CNAs. Appropriate&#xD;
      variant annotators will be used to annotate the identified alterations to each gene. Germline&#xD;
      variant databases such as ClinVar will be used for the classification of variants according&#xD;
      to the ACMG guidelines.&#xD;
