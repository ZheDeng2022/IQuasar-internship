  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the primary aim of this study to identify symptoms and/or specific words (trigger&#xD;
      words) indicative of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (sSAH) during emergency telephone&#xD;
      calls to the Emergency Medical Service Copenhagen (EMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, it is the aim to determine the association between the symptoms/trigger words and&#xD;
      sSAH, the sensitivity of the symptoms/trigger words and finally, to identify factors in the&#xD;
      telephone visitation that may influence the level of activated prehospital response&#xD;

      Study design: Nested case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of patients with confirmed sSAH is established. It will consist of patients admitted&#xD;
      between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 registered in the Danish National Patient&#xD;
      Register with a primary discharge diagnosis of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage&#xD;
      (International Classification of Disease code I60.0-I60.9). Using central person&#xD;
      register-numbers, their medical records will be extracted and reviewed to validate the&#xD;
      diagnosis. Validation is performed by two independent investigators with the assistance of a&#xD;
      predeveloped case report form with diagnostic criteria (named &quot;CRF Diagnosis validation&quot;). At&#xD;
      the time of the study design, the cohort contains data on patients from year 2014 from a&#xD;
      previous study. For the present study data must be collected on patients from year 2015 to&#xD;
      2018. The Danish National Patient Register is accessed online via the Danish Health Data&#xD;
      Board (Sundhedsdatastyrelsen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls are identified in the EMS Copenhagen database of emergency telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audiotaped emergency medical telephone calls are kept on record at the EMS Copenhagen. Audio&#xD;
      files of calls from patients with confirmed sSAH and selected controls are extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Central Person Register is daily updated with regards to vitality. This register can be&#xD;
      accessed online via the Danish Health Data Board (Sundhedsdatastyrelsen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish National Patient Register contains information on diagnoses related to hospital&#xD;
      admissions. These will be used to calculate the Charlson Morbidity Index score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be extracted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Danish National Patient Register:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of sSAH, admitted between years 2015 and&#xD;
      2019:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPR-number&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission date and time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission hospital To calculate the Charlson Morbidity Index score, a second data&#xD;
           extraction is performed for patients with sSAH validated by medical record review. This&#xD;
           time, data on prior diagnoses are extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing sSAH cohort (patients admitted in year 2014):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPR-numbers of patients with sSAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of first hospital admission in relation to the sSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated EMS response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMS Copenhagen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPR-numbers of matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated EMS response for patients with sSAH in the years 2015-2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audiotaped EMS telephone calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a pilot study a Case Report Form (named &quot;CRF: symptoms&quot;) will be designed by&#xD;
           replaying twenty randomly selected audiotaped emergency calls from patients with sSAH.&#xD;
           Members of the research group will listen to the selected telephone calls and discuss&#xD;
           which symptoms and information should be extracted. A RedCap data collection template is&#xD;
           then coded according to the CRF. For the main study, all telephone calls from patients&#xD;
           with sSAH and controls without sSAH are then replayed and data extracted to the RedCap&#xD;
           data collection system using &quot;CRF: Symptoms&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Central Person Register:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-day vital status on all patients with confirmed sSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1977 the Danish National Patient Register has registered all inpatient, outpatient and&#xD;
      emergency department visits to Danish hospitals. It is considered a high quality database.&#xD;
      Specifically for sSAH however, we have found a positive predictive value of only 63%. To&#xD;
      minimize the inaccuracy of using the these unvalidated data, we have chosen to review all&#xD;
      medical records twice to verify the sSAH diagnosis. Accuracy is therefore expected to be very&#xD;
      high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audiotaping of emergency telephone calls became an automated process by January 2014. At&#xD;
      certain time periods, not all calls were recorded due to changes in the data storing system.&#xD;
      If patients are believed to have called the EMS in any of these periods, this will be&#xD;
      addressed in the final manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diagnosis validation, investigators will be blinded to the othersÂ´ findings as they&#xD;
      will enter data into individual electronic spreadsheets. In case of disagreement a third&#xD;
      investigator will review the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency telephone calls from cases and controls are anonymized before data collection by&#xD;
      renaming the audiofiles according to a predeveloped key. Data entered in RedCap will be&#xD;
      entered under the anonymized file name. Data are unblinded when statistical analyses are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility of Case Report Form: Several investigators will divide the task of replaying&#xD;
      telephone calls and extracting data. To ensure a uniform data collection, reproducibility of&#xD;
      categorizations in the &quot;CRF: Symptoms&quot; is tested and instructions and definitions adjusted if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess reproducibility, selected variables in the CRF is compared between two&#xD;
      investigators. Kappa-values above 0.5 is considered acceptable. Binary variables are tested&#xD;
      with kappa-statistics, ordered categorical variables are tested with weighted kappa&#xD;
      statistics and numerical variables are tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics: Continuous data will be reported as medians with inter quartile range&#xD;
      (IQR). Proportions of patients with each symptom/ trigger words will be reported as&#xD;
      percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: Associations between specific symptoms / trigger words and sSAH will be&#xD;
      calculated as odds ratios. Sensitivities of identified symptoms or trigger words are&#xD;
      calculated. P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. To identify predictors for&#xD;
      dispatching an ambulance or physician-staffed mobile response unit with the highest priority&#xD;
      level, a logistic regression analysis will be performed with dispatch yes/no as the outcome&#xD;
      and age, sex and variables obtained in the CRF as possible predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the assumption that the symptoms of interest occur in 25% of sSAH patients and 5% of&#xD;
      controls a statistically significant difference can be detected with a power of 80% at the 5%&#xD;
      significance level, providing we include 195 cases and 390 controls (ratio 1:2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed in collaboration with the department statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of more than 10% missing data for any variable a plan for imputation will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unknown proportion of patients with confirmed sSAH is expected not to be registered with&#xD;
      an emergency telephone call to the EMS Copenhagen. This can be because they were not admitted&#xD;
      via the EMS in which case they may constitute a certain group of patients with regards to&#xD;
      their general use of the health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sSAH patients without a registered emergency medical telephone call might also reflect the&#xD;
      nature of the acute situation in which a CPR-number may not always be obtainable. This can&#xD;
      create an inclusion bias as audiotaped telephone calls cannot be identified. These patients&#xD;
      are potentially among the most acutely affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare how patients without a registered contact with the EMS Copenhagen differ from&#xD;
      those with a contact, they will be compared by age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index scores&#xD;
      and 30-day mortality.&#xD;
