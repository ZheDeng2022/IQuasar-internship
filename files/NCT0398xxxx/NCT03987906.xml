  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is defined as multidisciplinary care that increases quality of life (QOL) for&#xD;
      patients with a life-threatening illness. Although it is known that patients with the most&#xD;
      severe physical and psychological symptoms have the greatest need for palliative care, these&#xD;
      patients are often not referred to palliative care services in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a system called STEP (Symptom screening with Targeted Early&#xD;
      Palliative care) that identifies patients with high symptom burden in order to offer them&#xD;
      timely access to palliative care. The investigators are conducting a multi-center trial at&#xD;
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Kingston General Hospital to compare STEP with usual&#xD;
      symptom screening in medical oncology clinics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trials have shown that when patients with advanced cancer were referred&#xD;
      early to specialized palliative care teams, they had improved QOL, symptom control, and&#xD;
      greater satisfaction with their cancer care. Such routine specialized palliative care&#xD;
      intervention, while effective, may be challenging to enact broadly with widespread shortages&#xD;
      of palliative care physicians. STEP systematically identifies patients with the greatest&#xD;
      need, using symptom screening at every outpatient visit, with triage and targeted referral to&#xD;
      palliative care. This could reduce resource use while directing care to the most vulnerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients from Breast, Lung, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, and Gynecology&#xD;
      medical oncology clinics will be assigned randomly either to receive STEP or to follow usual&#xD;
      symptom screening. All patients will complete questionnaires measuring outcomes of QOL,&#xD;
      symptom control, depression, and satisfaction with care at recruitment, 2, 4 and 6 months.&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the impact of STEP on these outcomes, compared to screening&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
