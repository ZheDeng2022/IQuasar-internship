      The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions&#xD;
      (relative to baseline) and debris captured in the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS inline filter&#xD;
      during a transcarotid stenting procedure.&#xD;

      The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS has received CE Mark and is commercially available in the&#xD;
      European Union. The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS may be used in conjunction with carotid artery&#xD;
      stent approved for revascularization in patients with carotid disease in the context of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial of the ENROUTE Transcarotid&#xD;
      NPS in conjunction with all commercially approved carotid artery stents used for&#xD;
      revascularization in patients with carotid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the incidence of post procedure DW-MRI lesions&#xD;
      (relative to baseline) and debris captured in the ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS inline filter&#xD;
      during a transcarotid stenting procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient is considered enrolled after:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the transcarotid arterial sheath has entered into the patient's vasculature. Insertion&#xD;
           of the venous sheath does not qualify a patient as enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are screened but do not meet all study criteria are considered screen failures&#xD;
      and may not be enrolled. Patients in whom an arterial sheath is placed but who do not meet&#xD;
      all study entry criteria are considered enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator is responsible for maintaining any information pertaining to the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee review and approval as required by local law.&#xD;
