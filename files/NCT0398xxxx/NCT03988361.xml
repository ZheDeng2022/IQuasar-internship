  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been organised to help improve the embryo quality in couples having&#xD;
      high rate of sperm showing apoptotic signs. For this, the investigators intend to use a&#xD;
      procedure (MACS: magnetic-activated cell sorting) that allows the identification and the&#xD;
      removal of the apoptotic sperm cells. This procedure will increase the chance of using&#xD;
      non-apoptotic sperm during in vitro fertilization via Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection&#xD;
      (ICSI). By using this procedure the investigators aim to increase the rate of embryos with&#xD;
      good quality for these particular couples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies of infertile couples have demonstrated that male factor plays a role in infertility.&#xD;
      Spermatozoa can present damages at molecular levels that have an effect on fertilization and&#xD;
      embryo development. One of these molecular damages is represented by DeoxyriboNucleic Acid&#xD;
      (DNA) fragmentation whose negative impact on embryological outcome appears during genome&#xD;
      activation after fertilization and is also correlated with increased miscarriage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA fragmentation represents one of the late manifestations of apoptosis. Identification of&#xD;
      spermatozoa showing DNA fragmentation (apoptotic spermatozoa) requires fixation and staining.&#xD;
      Therefore this method cannot be applied in clinical practice to select for non-apoptotic&#xD;
      spermatozoa for ICSI. However, this selection is possible by using magnetic-activated cell&#xD;
      sorting (MACS). The procedure is based on the identification and depletion of spermatozoa&#xD;
      showing the early marker of apoptosis, namely the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS),&#xD;
      by using the ability of Annexin V to recognize this antigen in the plasma membrane of&#xD;
      apoptotic sperm cells. After MACS, the fraction that is enriched in non-apoptotic cells&#xD;
      (Annexin V-negative cells) can be further used for clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MACS system makes use of a separation column placed in a magnetic field, and of Annexin-V&#xD;
      reagent labeled with paramagnetic beads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the semen sample will be subject to Density Gradient Centrifugation (DGC). The&#xD;
      sample obtained will be divided in 2 fractions: one fraction will be subject to magnetic&#xD;
      sorting (fraction 1) and the other fraction will represent the control (no sorting; fraction&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells from fraction 1 will be incubated with Annexin-V and then passed through the&#xD;
      separation column located in a magnetic field. The apoptotic cells (Annexin V-positive cells)&#xD;
      will be selectively retained in the column. The non-apoptotic cells, not being labeled by&#xD;
      Annexin V, will pass through the column and will be collected for further use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment of ICSI, sibling mature oocytes will be inseminated with spermatozoa from&#xD;
      fraction 1 (enriched in non-apoptotic cells) or from fraction 2 (control, conventionally&#xD;
      prepared spermatozoa). Following ICSI, all the inseminated oocytes will be individually&#xD;
      cultured in the same conditions in the same culture dish. The choice of embryo(s) for&#xD;
      transfer will be based on embryo quality. The supernumerary good-quality embryos from both&#xD;
      arms will be frozen for further use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to determine whether the use of MACS improves the embryo&#xD;
      quality/utilization rate in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation rate. To avoid&#xD;
      inter-patient variation, the study is design as a sibling oocyte study. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be performed by analysing median, mean, proportions, standard deviation,&#xD;
      ranges and 95% confidence intervals as appropriate. Standard parametric and non-parametric&#xD;
      tests will be used, as appropriate, to compare primary and secondary outcomes between groups.&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: a number of 142 mature oocytes in each arm will be necessary to&#xD;
      achieve 80% power of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure from 13% in the control group to 26% in the experimental group.&#xD;
