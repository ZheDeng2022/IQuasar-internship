    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) study to determine the MTD and optimal dosing of Oratopo. No control group has been&#xD;
      included.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and activity study.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid tumor malignancies. In the treatment&#xD;
      period groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of oral Oratopo will be&#xD;
      administered and will be followed for toxicity. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is&#xD;
      reached, or nonlinear increases in exposure are confirmed, or a maximum dose of Oratopo is&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
