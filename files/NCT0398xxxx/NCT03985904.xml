  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effects of an art therapy intervention carried out&#xD;
      in museums to facilitate the process of recovery in mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 127 adults in mental health follow-up will be recruited for this study. They will be&#xD;
      assigned in to two parallel non randomized groups: to either receive usual care from primary&#xD;
      or specialized services (control group) or to receive usual care plus access to art therapy&#xD;
      (intervention group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the trial will be assessed for a period of 3 months. After the baseline&#xD;
      visit, all participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months. In the follow up visits,&#xD;
      investigators will assess participants recovery, social support, global functioning and use&#xD;
      of health and social services.&#xD;

&#xD;
      QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN. The researchers will review and report the process during the trial&#xD;
      covering participant enrolment, consent, eligibility and allocation to trial groups, policies&#xD;
      to protect participants, including reporting of harm and completeness, accuracy and&#xD;
      timeliness of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. Participants will be recruited over a period of three months&#xD;
      by mental health professionals (mental health nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists and&#xD;
      occupational therapists). Participants will not receive financial reimbursement for taking&#xD;
      part in this trial. Participants will be identified from outpatient services who meet all the&#xD;
      study eligibility criteria (listed in section Eligibility). ICD-10 (International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases) and GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning) will be used to screen&#xD;
      participants at recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA DICTIONARY. All variables collected in this study will be listed and described in a case&#xD;
      report form, with associated guidelines, to ensure consistency in all gathered data. The&#xD;
      following data will be collected in this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographical data. Medical history. Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF)&#xD;
      Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR-15) Personal Resiliency Nursing Outcomes&#xD;
      Classification=1309 Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire Service Utilisation:&#xD;
      Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ASSESSMENT. The estimated sample size is n = 102, for a t test with two&#xD;
      independent samples, with one tail, an effect size of 0.5, an α of 95% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the validation of the QPR-15, taking into account the subject-item ratio of at least 5: 1&#xD;
      (15 items), and considering the minimum number of recommended subjects to perform an&#xD;
      Exploratory Factor Analysis, The minimum number of participants must be 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, estimating losses of 20%, the total number of participants estimated for the study is n&#xD;
      = 127.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS ANALYSIS PLAN. The results will be analyzed by intention to treat. The change of&#xD;
      means in the main outcome variable between the two study groups will be analyzed with the&#xD;
      Student's t-test and if the criteria for its application with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test are not met. For the categorical secondary variables, the Chi square test will be&#xD;
      used. We will also consider the performance of a multivariate analysis of variance (ANCOVA)&#xD;
      to introduce some possible covariate that differs between the two comparison groups in the&#xD;
      first evaluation. For all comparisons, a confidence level of 95% will be used. The program R&#xD;
      version 3.5.1 will be used. for all statistical analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. A cost-effectiveness from a Health Service perspective (finances&#xD;
      perspective) will be performed. The time horizon is one year and will include only direct&#xD;
      costs. This refers to direct health costs (medication and healthcare use of mental health and&#xD;
      social services including outpatient and emergencies visits and hospital admissions). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN FOR MISSING DATA. Each researcher is responsible for ensuring that any missing data will&#xD;
      be reported as missing in the study database. Procedures can sometimes be considered when&#xD;
      using statistical methods that fail in the presence of any missing values, or when in the&#xD;
      case of multiple-predictor statistical models all the data for an individual would be omitted&#xD;
      because of a missing value in one of the predictors. For analyzes involving multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis, a multiple imputation approach will be considered and used if&#xD;
      statistically sound, depending on the proportion and pattern of missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS TO ENSURE VALIDITY AND QUALITY OF DATA. Accurate and reliable data collection will be&#xD;
      assured by verification and cross-check of the case report form (CRF) against the&#xD;
      researcher´s records (source document verification). Source document verification will be&#xD;
      conducted for 5% of data in subjects. Discrepancies and queries will be generated accordingly&#xD;
      in the CRF for online resolution by the researcher at the site. In addition, the CRF data&#xD;
      will be reviewed on an ongoing basis for medical and scientific plausibility.&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR-15) is an instrument of 15 items to measure the recovery of people using mental health services.

    <description>Personal resiliency (Nursing Outcomes Classification = 1309) defined as the &quot;adaptation and positive function of an individual after a significant adversity or crisis&quot;. It is a nursing result that has indicators that are used to determine the achievement or changes produced in response to a nurse intervention in the person with respect to states, behaviors or perceptions measured along a continuum using a Likert scale of 0 (never shown) to 5 (always shown).</description>

    <description>Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire of 11 items to measure perceived social support. Each item is scored using a Likert-type scale of 1 (much less than I would like) to 5 (as much as I would like) with a score ranging between 11 and 55 points. In the Spanish validation, a cut point was chosen in the 15th percentile, which corresponds to a score lower than 32 indicating a low perceived social support and a score equal to or greater than 32 indicating a normal support.</description>

    <description>Client socio-demographic and service receipt inventory - European version (CSSRI-EU) collects information on the use of services to calculate the cost of the required care. The use of services of the mental health network in the last three months will be collected: Emergency, Primary Care, Community Mental Health Unit, Hospitalization Unit, Rehabilitation Unit, Therapeutic Community, private center and others. The services derived from pharmacological expenditure per person will be included.&#xD;
It´s adaptability ensures it is compatible with the research aims, context, participants' likely circumstances, and the quantity and precision of information required</description>
