      BACKGROUND: The patients diagnosed with end stage renal disease require dialysis and for that&#xD;
      they need to have a vascular access for hemodialysis (HD) placed. Vascular access&#xD;
      complications are the most common cause of hospitalization among patients in HD. An AV&#xD;
      fistula (AVF) is a surgical connection made between an artery and a vein, created by a&#xD;
      vascular specialist, typically placed in an arm. AV fistulas are the preferred vascular&#xD;
      access for long-term dialysis. In order to be able to carry out an adequate and uncomplicated&#xD;
      dialysis treatment, two needles have to be placed in the fistula. It requires specialized&#xD;
      technical ability to install well-functioning needles in the vessels of an AVF. The&#xD;
      buttonhole technique is one of the two recommended techniques. For the buttonhole technique,&#xD;
      two puncture sites are selected in the fistula. Here, exactly in the same spot a needle is&#xD;
      inserted with the same angle and direction until a fibrous tunnel is formed, like a hole for&#xD;
      an ear ring. Cannulation is now possible with blunt needles which are gentler and reduce&#xD;
      complications. The time required to create a buttonhole tunnel is 6-12 cannulations, ie 6-12&#xD;
      dialyses. It is crucial for the future survival of the tunnel tracks, that a maximum of one&#xD;
      to two persons cannulates until the track is created. This is a logistic challenge in a busy&#xD;
      dialysis unit and may result in using a cannulation technique that is not recommended. A less&#xD;
      time consuming method to create the buttonhole tunnel track may increase the use of the&#xD;
      technique. A new method has been used in several dialysis units in Denmark. Using this method&#xD;
      the tunnel tracks are created in 1-3 dialyses by repeated cannulations (4-6 needles one at a&#xD;
      time) in the same two puncture sites in the fistula. The experiences so far indicates that&#xD;
      this method reduces the dialysis sessions needed to create the tunnel tracks with 4-10&#xD;
      sessions. Thus, the logistic challenges of ensuring continuity in persons creating the tunnel&#xD;
      track will be reduced. The purpose of the research project is to investigate whether a new&#xD;
      method for creating buttonhole tunnels will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the number of well-functioning buttonholes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be less painful for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the number of dialysis needed to create the buttonhole tunnel track.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cause unchanged or fewer fistula associated complications and infections.&#xD;

      Background: See above. Aims:To study whether a new method of creating a buttonhole tunnel&#xD;
      tracks can reduce the incidence of buttonhole technique failure and the patients pain with&#xD;
      needling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: A randomized, multi-center study enrolling 42 patients in hemodialysis&#xD;
      from two HD units in Denmark. The study will begin end of May 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized into 2 groups where cannulation will be carried out by a small&#xD;
      group of dialysis nurses with experience and skills in buttonhole cannulation. In both groups&#xD;
      the same nurse will carry out the cannulation the first four dialysis sessions. At the&#xD;
      following sessions the cannulation will be carried out by the nurse/nurses responsible for&#xD;
      the patient. The procedures throughout the study will be the same in both participating&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (K): creating buttonhole tunnels according to the standard method, ie.&#xD;
      cannulation with a single sharp cannula in the AVF at each dialysis for 6-12 dialyses until a&#xD;
      blunt needle can be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group (I): creating buttonhole tunnels according to the new method, ie.&#xD;
      repeated cannulation with several sharp needles (4-6 pieces) at each dialysis for 1-3&#xD;
      dialyses until a blunt cannula can be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The creation of a buttonhole tunnel track is defined as completed when two consecutive&#xD;
      dialyses have been carried out with no use of sharp needles, however no longer than 24&#xD;
      dialysis sessions.Thus, the period of time will be of different length for each participant.&#xD;
      In the period until the tunnel is created, data will be collected at each dialyses regarding&#xD;
      number of cannulations, type of needle (sharp or blunt), cannulator and patient-experienced&#xD;
      pain with needling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is buttonhole technique failure defined as the need for cannulations&#xD;
      carried out using sharp needles in the buttonhole for three consecutive dialyses or in case&#xD;
      lack of ability to insert blunt needles in the buttonhole for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up from the date of the completed creation of the buttonhole tunnel track in both&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 month ongoing follow-up of the primary outcome buttonhole survival and the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes AVF associated infections, complications and AVF survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:The power calculation is based on the expected incidence of the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure: buttonhole technique failure. Based on calculations in the two dialysis centers from&#xD;
      randomly selected patients with buttonhole tunnels made using the intervention and the&#xD;
      control method, it appears that the estimated buttonhole technique failure is 10 % and 30 %,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-off rate is estimated to 30%. The number of participants for the study is calculated at&#xD;
      21 subjects in each group to achieve a power of 0.8 with a type error rate of 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out. Censoring in case of death, if the person&#xD;
      wants to withdraw from the study or moves, AV fistula failure for non-buttonhole associated&#xD;
      causes and kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:The baseline characteristics of the study population will be presented&#xD;
      as counts and proportions and compared between randomization groups with chi-square test /&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test (depending on number of observations) for categorical variables.&#xD;
      Continous variables will be presented as mean (SD), respectively, median (IQR) depending on&#xD;
      normality of data and compared between groups by t-test, respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum&#xD;
      test. Normality will be evaluated by quantile plots and Shapiro-Wilks test. Moreover,&#xD;
      repeated measurements will be compared by mixed effects models. Time to event outcomes will&#xD;
      be compared by the Kaplan-Meier method and tested by log-rank test, furthermore discrete time&#xD;
      survival methods will be applied as a sensitivity analysis. P-values &lt;0.05 are regarded as&#xD;
      statistically significant. Follow-up will be censored at 1 year. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using Stata, version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex., USA).&#xD;
