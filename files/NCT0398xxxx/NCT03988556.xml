      The main objective of the present study is to investigate the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CareMin650 in patients with 1) head &amp; neck cancer at high risk of or&#xD;
      suffering from oral mucositis and/or radiation dermatitis due to the administration of&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, 2) breast cancer&#xD;

      The main objective of the present study is to investigate the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CareMin650 in patients with 1) head &amp; neck cancer at high risk of or&#xD;
      suffering from oral mucositis and/or radiation dermatitis due to the administration of&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, 2) breast cancer&#xD;
      at high risk of or suffering from radiation dermatitis due to the administration of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective non-comparative study. Two cohorts of patients will be included, based&#xD;
      on the tumour location. Each cohort will be divided into two subgroups according to whether&#xD;
      the treatment is for curative or preventive purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with head &amp; neck cancer (cohort A), either starting radiotherapy with or&#xD;
           without chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy (no lesions, prophylactic intent,&#xD;
           cohort A1) or having started treatment and presenting with grade 1 to 3 lesions of oral&#xD;
           mucositis and/or radiation dermatitis (curative intent, cohort A2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with breast cancer requiring radiation therapy (cohort B), either starting&#xD;
           radiation therapy (i.e. no lesions, prophylactic intent, cohort B1) or having started&#xD;
           treatment and presenting with grade 1 to 3 lesions of radiation dermatitis (curative&#xD;
           intent, cohort B2) it is planned to select a maximum number of 72 patients (36 in each&#xD;
           cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients will be included in each of the four predefined subgroups, until the&#xD;
      target number of patients in each subgroup has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photobiomodulation treatment will be initiated at inclusion and will be continued for the&#xD;
      duration of radiotherapy (6 to 8 weeks maximum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum total participation in the study is anticipated to be approximately ten weeks for&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;

    <description>CareMin650 is a photobiomodulation device which consists of a Lightbox and a light applicator to deliver red light with wavelength of 650 nm and irradiance between 10 and 50 mW/cm² to skin or mucosa.&#xD;
For curative treatment, the dose to be delivered has been set at 6J/cm2. If the lesions of patients included in a curative cohort are resolved before the end of the radiotherapy period, the treatment will be applied with a preventive aim and the dose will decrease from 6 to 3J/cm2.</description>
