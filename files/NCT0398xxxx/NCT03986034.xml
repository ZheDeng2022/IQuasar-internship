      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug venetoclax treats chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Researchers want to find&#xD;
      better treatments for CLL. To do that, they need to learn how the drug affects CLL cancer&#xD;
      cells and the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about genetic changes that happen during treatment of CLL with venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with relapsed or refractory CLL after at least 1 prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, participants will get venetoclax free of charge through the NIH. Venetoclax is&#xD;
      started at a low dose. The dose will be increased every week until participants reach their&#xD;
      maximum tolerable dose. This usually take about 5 weeks. Participants will visit the NIH at&#xD;
      least once per week. Visits will be about 4 hours. They may have to stay in the hospital to&#xD;
      be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, participants will continue to get the drug through their local cancer doctor and&#xD;
      their health insurance. Patients will also visit the NIH every 6 months, or if their disease&#xD;
      progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the NIH participants will have regular health assessments. These will include physical&#xD;
      exams and a review of the medicines they are taking. They will talk about how they are&#xD;
      feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draws&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body (maximum 3 per&#xD;
      year)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsies: A small amount of marrow will be taken out of the participant s hip&#xD;
      bone with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional lymph node biopsies: A small piece of the participant s tissue will be taken out&#xD;
      with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last at least 2 years.&#xD;

      This study aims to study the clonal dynamics and kinetics of response during the ramp-up&#xD;
      phase of venetoclax in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosis of CLL/SLL (treatment naive or relapsed/refractory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Must have designated hematologist/oncologist who has agreed to assume care and continue&#xD;
           venetoclax after the ramp-up phase is complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLL/SLL will enroll on the study. Subjects will be treated at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center for the duration of the ramp-up phase of venetoclax. After the ramp-up phase is&#xD;
      complete, subjects will be transitioned to the care of their local hematologist/oncologist&#xD;
      and receive venetoclax monotherapy or in combination with other agent(s) at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating oncologist. Subjects will have the option to follow-up at the NIH every 6 months&#xD;
      (from initiation of venetoclax) and at (suspected) progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the proportion of subjects with clonal shift during the ramp-up phase of&#xD;
      venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine response kinetics of venetoclax therapy in the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and&#xD;
      bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess relationship between clonal shifts and minimal residual disease (MRD) status,&#xD;
           progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess immunologic changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow during venetoclax&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess circulating-tumor DNA in response to treatment during venetoclax treatment&#xD;
