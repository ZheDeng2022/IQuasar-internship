      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn how members of IRB committees interact with each other. They want&#xD;
      to see how this affects the decision-making process. They want to learn how members see their&#xD;
      role and the roles of their fellow members. They want to see if these views are actualized&#xD;
      during meetings. To do this, researchers will sit in on IRB meetings and interview committee&#xD;
      members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the dynamics between IRB members. To explore how these dynamics affect the IRB&#xD;
      process of decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH IRB staff or members&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, an investigator (AI) will sit in on IRB meetings for 6 months. The AI will take&#xD;
      notes on the dynamics of the committees. The AI s will focus will be on the dialogue and the&#xD;
      behavior of both the group and each member. The AI will also focus on the factors that form&#xD;
      the decision-making process. The AI will audio-record the meetings to help take detailed&#xD;
      notes. These recordings will be destroyed after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the AI does not hear from members before the IRB meetings, the AI will assume that the&#xD;
      member is agreeing to take part in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, the AI will contact some members about taking part in a 60-minute interview. The&#xD;
      interview will be semi-structured. It will be on site and in person. It will explore how the&#xD;
      members see their role and the roles of others on the committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact information will be collected only for members who take part in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawing from the study will not affect any member s role on the IRB.&#xD;

      Objective: The study has two objectives. The primary objective is to explore what dynamics&#xD;
      exist within IRB committees, how members in each role interact with each other, and how these&#xD;
      interactions affect participation in the deliberation/decision-making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this research is to explore what each member/staff perceives&#xD;
      his/her role and the roles of other committee members to be and whether these perceptions are&#xD;
      congruent with how roles are actualized during meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Our target population consists of all members/staff of NIH IRBs and IRB&#xD;
      panels that fall under the NIH Intramural Federal Wide Assurance (FWA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The project will involve two phases: direct observation and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews. Phase I (direct-observations) will involve an associate investigator, Hina&#xD;
      Walajahi, sitting in on regularly scheduled IRB meetings at the NIH and taking observational&#xD;
      notes on committee dialogue, individual and group behavior, and factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the decision-making process. Meetings will be audio-recorded in order to validate the&#xD;
      observation notes. The observational data will be used to select appropriate committee&#xD;
      members/staff and guide questions for the semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase II (semi-structured interviews), the same associate investigator will conduct&#xD;
      in-person, semi-structured interviews with contacted IRB members/staff regarding role&#xD;
      perception respective to other members and the committee as a whole. Interviews will last&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes. They will be audio-recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: A qualitative codebook will be created from observational and interview&#xD;
      data, focusing on themes including, but not limited to: member interactions, member&#xD;
      participation in discussion, committee deliberation processes and voting behavior.&#xD;
