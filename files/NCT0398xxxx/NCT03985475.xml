      Identify the cutaneous microbiota on a cutaneous lesion (cellulite, wound, rash, etc.) on a&#xD;
      swab, biopsies or abscess puncture and on &quot;healthy&quot; skin on a skin swab performed for&#xD;
      cutaneous mapping to search for staphylococcal deposits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulite is characterized by inflammation and an alleged infection of the skin and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissues. Previous studies have shown a low yield of samples such as biopsy and&#xD;
      needle aspiration of the order of 16%. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      and Streptococcus pyogenes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional cultivation has limitations such as the lack of detection of fastidious&#xD;
      microorganisms, or the use of antibiotics. Molecular diagnostic methods, such as detection of&#xD;
      16S ribosomal DNA followed by amplification and pyrosequencing, have been used to overcome&#xD;
      the limitations of microbial culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, the authors investigated the causes of acute cellulitis without performing&#xD;
      drainage but skin biopsies from the infected site and another non-infected site by&#xD;
      quantitative PCR, pyrosequencing, and conventional culture. PCR identified&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus methicillin in approximately 30% -40% of cases with similar&#xD;
      frequency in infected and uninfected sites. In another study R. felis was found in not only&#xD;
      bedsores, but also, swabs taken from healthy skin, as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, S.&#xD;
      aureus and Streptococcus group A. Being engaged in the exploration of the human microbiota&#xD;
      especially by culture we propose to extend the knowledge of this skin microbiota in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in Infectious Disease services.&#xD;
