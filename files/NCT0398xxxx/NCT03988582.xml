  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether treatment with EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells&#xD;
      (EBV-CTLs) is effective, and to test any good and bad effects of treatment with EBV-CTLs.&#xD;
      EBV-CTLs are a special immune cells that may attack abnormal cells. EBV-CTLs are made by&#xD;
      taking cells from a healthy person, growing them in a laboratory for several weeks to educate&#xD;
      them to recognize and destroy EBV infected cells, and then storing them in a freezer until&#xD;
      they are required for treatment.&#xD;

             response to rituximab (alloHCT recipients) rituximab and/or multi-agent chemotherapy&#xD;
             (SOT and other immune compromised recipients) and appropriate first line chemotherapy&#xD;

                       current but with a history of prior EBV+ malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients in Cohort 1 (D) and 2 (B) treated for EBV viremia without evidence of&#xD;

                  follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A biopsy showing EBV+ malignancy or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A combination of EBV viremia AND radiographic appearance consistent with an EBV+&#xD;
                  malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. EBV-associated lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders not associated with&#xD;
        immunodeficiency (biopsy required) (e.g. EBV+ Hodgkin lymphoma, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Based on prior studies, patients with NK/T lymphoma will only be eligible for protocol if&#xD;
        EBV-CTL therapy is being administered from their HCT donor either prior to or after HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Other EBV-associated malignancies (biopsy required) including nasopharyngeal carcinoma,&#xD;
        EBV+ gastric cancer, EBV+ leiomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in cohort 3 will be assessed for whether alternative standard therapy is&#xD;
             available prior to being consented to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in cohort 3 will need a biopsy showing EBV+ disease.&#xD;

             0.5mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Need for vasopressor or ventilatory support, unless deemed to be caused by the&#xD;
