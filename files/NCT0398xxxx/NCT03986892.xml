      The project is designed as a large scale, cross-sectional study. This research seeks to&#xD;
      identify physical fitness and cardiovascular parameters that best resemble underlying&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk with age. Further, it will examine which physical fitness markers are&#xD;
      impaired most in heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) diseases including heart failure are the leading causes of morbidity,&#xD;
      with age being the primary risk factor. The combination of age-related organic functional&#xD;
      impairment and reduced physical fitness can drastically impact an individual's healthspan.&#xD;
      One's lifespan can potentially be prolonged by the preservation or improvement of physical&#xD;
      fitness. However, it remains unclear as to which biomarkers are most suitable for&#xD;
      distinguishing between healthy aging and the impaired organ function associated with heart&#xD;
      failure. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the components of physical fitness and CV&#xD;
      function will be performed to identify the most important factors contributing to aging in&#xD;
      relation to both health and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional investigation will consist of two parts: the COmPLETE-Health (C-Health)&#xD;
      and COmPLETE-Heart (C-Heart) studies. C-Health will examine the aging trajectories of&#xD;
      physical fitness components and CV properties in a healthy population sample aged between 20&#xD;
      and 100 years (n = 490). Separately, C-Heart will assess the same markers in patients at&#xD;
      different stages of chronic heart failure (n = 80). The primary outcome to determine the&#xD;
      difference between C-Health and C-Heart will be cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      walking speed, balance, isometric strength, peak power, and handgrip strength. Physical&#xD;
      activity as a behavioural component will be assessed objectively via accelerometry. Further,&#xD;
      CV assessments will include pulse wave velocity; retinal, arterial, and venous diameters;&#xD;
      brachial and retinal arterial endothelial function; carotid intima-media thickness; and&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic function. The health distances for C-Health and C-Heart will be&#xD;
      calculated using the methodology based on statistical (Mahalanobis) distance applied to&#xD;
      measurements of quantitative biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research seeks to identify physical fitness and CV biomarkers that best resemble&#xD;
      underlying CV risk with age. Further, it will examine which physical fitness markers are&#xD;
      impaired most in heart failure. The presented integrative approach could define new&#xD;
      recommendations for diagnostic guidance in aging. Ultimately, this study is expected to offer&#xD;
      a better understanding of which functional characteristics should be specifically targeted in&#xD;
      primary and secondary prevention to achieve an optimal healthspan.&#xD;
