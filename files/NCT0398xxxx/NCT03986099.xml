      A randomized, open label trial of two strategies for Virus Load Differentiated Care (VLDC)&#xD;
      monitoring of virologic outcome in a rural community based treatment program in Zimbabwe.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized trial among HIV infected children and adolescents and young&#xD;
      adults receiving ART at 8 treatment outreach sites near their homes provided by Chidamoyo&#xD;
      Mission Hospital. The investigators will implement virus load (VL) testing at &quot;near point of&#xD;
      care&quot; using either the GeneXpert Quant or the SAMBA to evaluate the safety, clinical and&#xD;
      virologic outcomes of near POC monitoring of virus load at the Chidamoyo Christian Hospital&#xD;
      in Mashonaland West Zimbabwe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that our proposed package of care will result in a decrease in&#xD;
      virologic failure, increase virologic suppression and prevent drug resistance in this key&#xD;
      population in a rural ART treatment program. Process and cost data will be collected for&#xD;
      subsequent cost-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infected children and adolescents on ART will be randomized (1:1) to either SOC (300) or&#xD;
      a near POC VLDC monitoring. SOC VL is performed by Roche COBAS at the Provincial Hospital&#xD;
      Chinhoyi and the results returned to the hospital within 4 weeks. Those randomized to near&#xD;
      POC will be tested with the Cepheid GeneXpert assay and results are available within 3 days.&#xD;
      Follow-up repeat testing for HIV RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/ml is offered using the same virologic&#xD;
      monitoring system at the next drug/clinic visit within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that viral load monitoring and potentially genotyping to sustain&#xD;
      suppression to &lt; 1,000 copies/ml will reduce treatment failure to &lt; 15%. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include the rate of drug switching and the evaluation and prevention of drug resistance. The&#xD;
      study will enroll up to 600 children (3 -10) years and adolescents (11-21) years, providing&#xD;
      data that will guide strategies for management of children and adolescents who are surviving&#xD;
      on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine if implementation of point of care virus load differentiated&#xD;
      care (POC virus load), targeted genotyping and mHealth tools will result in improved&#xD;
      virologic suppression among children and adolescents (&lt;21years) on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The primary study endpoint is viral load suppression at 48 weeks among PLWHA &lt;&#xD;
      21 years old, using VLDC implemented as near POC compared to SOC semi- annual virus load&#xD;
      testing. The investigators will enroll young PLWHA from eight communities and the Chidamoyo&#xD;
      Hospital Clinic as a rolling prospective cohort. The investigators hypothesize that an&#xD;
      intervention package of digitized data, local immediate POC Virus load and genotype will&#xD;
      result in &gt; 90% virologic suppression after 1 year. The estimated minimum sample size to&#xD;
      detect at least a 15% increase in virologic suppression with 90% power, at significance level&#xD;
      Î±=0.05 assuming 10% loss to follow up rate (LTFU) rate is 356 PLWHA on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. rate of switching from 1st to 2nd line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. frequency of Drug Resistance Mutations (DRM) among 1st and 2nd line virologic failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the frequency of Hepatitis B virus infection (HBSag).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with Ben Gurion University Global Health, the investigators will perform an&#xD;
      ethnographic survey over the course of the primary study. The objective is to develop&#xD;
      formative research to understand the individual and community variation in suppression rate&#xD;
      and drug switching including differences in virologic failure and adherence by age, gender,&#xD;
      rural outreach site, orphan-hood/caregiver and socio-economic status.&#xD;
