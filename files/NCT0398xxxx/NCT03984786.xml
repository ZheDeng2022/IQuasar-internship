  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) shows considerable promise as a&#xD;
      convenient treatment for alcohol misuse. ICBT may differ in whether the user works alone&#xD;
      (self-guided) or along with an individual who guides treatment (e.g., therapist/health&#xD;
      educator). Guided ICBT involves completing online lessons over several weeks coupled with&#xD;
      support from a guide in the form of emails, online messages and/or brief telephone calls.&#xD;
      Self-guided ICBT allows users to complete lessons by themselves without any contact with a&#xD;
      guide. In some studies, guided-ICBT has shown greater reductions in alcohol consumption than&#xD;
      self-guided ICBT. Further, some research on alcohol treatment shows that assessment in itself&#xD;
      may have an effect on alcohol consumption, a phenomenon referred to in the literature as&#xD;
      &quot;assessment reactivity&quot;. It is believed that verbalizing one's drinking problems to another&#xD;
      person might lead to greater realization of the problem extent and severity, which in turn&#xD;
      can lead to initiation of the change process. Experimental studies have shown that extended&#xD;
      and frequent assessments lead to greater alcohol reductions compared to brief and infrequent&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ICBT for alcohol misuse is an attractive treatment option, it is not often available&#xD;
      to clients as part of routine care. The Online Therapy Unit at the University of Regina is&#xD;
      currently exploring extending services to include guided ICBT for alcohol misuse. The Unit&#xD;
      has been providing treatment in ICBT for depression and anxiety as well as various health&#xD;
      conditions since 2010 and has offered treatment to ~4200 individuals. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate ICBT for individuals with alcohol misuse within the routine online&#xD;
      clinic, and to investigate ways to optimize future modes of delivery. Of specific interest in&#xD;
      this study, is how outcomes vary depending on whether or not weekly guidance from a health&#xD;
      educator is available and whether or not an initial extended assessment telephone call is&#xD;
      included or not compared to a briefer screening telephone call. Of interest will also be if&#xD;
      the extended assessment leads to greater alcohol reductions and higher motivation&#xD;
      pre-treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse refers to alcohol consumption that causes harm to the drinker, others, and/or&#xD;
      greater society. Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) shows considerable&#xD;
      promise as a convenient treatment for alcohol misuse. The overall goal of ICBT for alcohol&#xD;
      misuse is typically behavioural change measured in terms of reduction of drinks consumed, as&#xD;
      opposed to abstinence. The design of these interventions may differ in whether the user works&#xD;
      alone (self-guided) or along with an individual who guides treatment (e.g., therapist/health&#xD;
      educator). Guided ICBT involves completing online lessons over several weeks coupled with&#xD;
      support from a guide in the form of emails, online messages or brief telephone calls.&#xD;
      Self-guided ICBT allows users to complete lessons by themselves without any contact with a&#xD;
      guide. In some studies, guided-ICBT has shown greater reductions in alcohol consumption than&#xD;
      self-guided ICBT. Further, some research on alcohol treatment shows that assessment in itself&#xD;
      may have an effect on alcohol consumption, a phenomenon referred to in the literature as&#xD;
      &quot;assessment reactivity&quot;. It is believed that verbalizing one's drinking problems to another&#xD;
      person might lead to greater realization of the problem extent and severity, which in turn&#xD;
      can lead to initiation of the change process. Experimental studies have shown that extended&#xD;
      and frequent assessments lead to greater alcohol reductions compared to brief and infrequent&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ICBT for alcohol misuse is an attractive treatment option, it is not often available&#xD;
      to clients as part of routine care. The Online Therapy Unit at the University of Regina is&#xD;
      currently exploring extending services to include guided ICBT for alcohol misuse. The Unit&#xD;
      has been providing treatment in ICBT for depression and anxiety as well as various health&#xD;
      conditions since 2010 and has offered treatment to ~4200 individuals. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate ICBT for individuals with alcohol misuse, and to investigate ways to&#xD;
      optimize future modes of delivery. Of specific interest in this study, is how outcomes vary&#xD;
      depending on whether or not weekly guidance from a health educator is available and whether&#xD;
      or not an initial extended assessment telephone call is included or not compared to a briefer&#xD;
      screening telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clients will be recruited online, through use of Google Ads and/or Facebook ads. Clients may&#xD;
      also learn of the course from providers/organizations who will be informed of the study&#xD;
      through posters, emails, and phone calls. All interested clients will be directed to the&#xD;
      study website (www.onlinetherapyuser.ca) to complete an online screening questionnaire. As&#xD;
      part of this questionnaire, they will be presented with a consent form explaining the&#xD;
      screening protocol. After consent is given, clients will be assessed for eligibility using an&#xD;
      online screening questionnaire. The online screening questionnaire captures demographic&#xD;
      information (e.g., sex, ethnicity, location), contact details (e.g., telephone number, email&#xD;
      address), information about alcohol, depression and other mental health issues, and&#xD;
      background information needed to deliver therapy (e.g., medical history, mental health&#xD;
      history, symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once clients have been assessed for eligibility through the online screening questionnaire,&#xD;
      they will be asked to book a telephone interview with unit staff. During the telephone&#xD;
      screening interview, clients will be asked a series of follow-up questions to the online&#xD;
      screening questionnaire to ensure eligibility as per exclusion criteria. Clients who meet any&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria during the online telephone screening interview will be referred to&#xD;
      more appropriate mental health services. Clients who are excluded in the screening&#xD;
      questionnaire by reporting a low score on either TLFB or AUDIT, or a high score on PHQ-9,&#xD;
      will be informed about relevant treatment options and will be offered unguided ICBT with no&#xD;
      assessment interview. Clients who are included in the study, will be randomized by the&#xD;
      interviewer, while the client is still on the phone, to one of four conditions. The two&#xD;
      factors in the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factor 1: Guidance (yes or no)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factor 2: Assessment interview (yes or no)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a factorial trial with two factors, each client will be randomized to one of four&#xD;
      conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Condition 1: Assessment interview and Guidance Condition 2: Assessment Interview and No&#xD;
      Guidance Condition 3: No Assessment Interview and Guidance Condition 4: No Assessment&#xD;
      Interview and No Guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the randomization those randomized to either condition that includes assessment&#xD;
      interview will receive this interview immediately. The assessment interview consists of the&#xD;
      Alcohol Use Disorder section of Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 5 (SCID5). Clients will then be provided a user-name&#xD;
      and temporary password, Those randomized to conditions with no assessment interview will be&#xD;
      provided user-name and password immediately after the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clients will have access to the ICBT course on the second Monday after the screening&#xD;
      interview, regardless of whether they have been randomized to assessment interview or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before accessing the ICBT course with user-name and password, clients will be presented with&#xD;
      a consent form that explains the nature of treatment, as well as a pre-treatment&#xD;
      questionnaire, where participants will complete questions about alcohol consumption in the&#xD;
      preceding week, depression and motivation to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clients will receive the Alcohol Change Course, an internet intervention targeting&#xD;
      alcohol misuse. The course is an adaptation of a program originally developed in Switzerland.&#xD;
      The program has been adapted to better fit the programs that are commonly used at the Online&#xD;
      Therapy Unit (8 weeks in length, gradual time release, downloadable exercises, wide range in&#xD;
      age). Patient partners have also studied the program and provided feedback, which has led to&#xD;
      additional changes. It comprises 12 online lessons (1 to 2 lessons per week over 8 weeks),&#xD;
      and the content is based on cognitive behaviour therapy and relapse prevention. Materials are&#xD;
      presented in a didactic (i.e., text-based with visual images) and case-enhanced learning&#xD;
      format (i.e., educational stories demonstrate the application of skills). All clients are&#xD;
      presented with worksheets at the end of each lesson that contain exercises that facilitate&#xD;
      skill acquisition. In all conditions, lessons will be released gradually in a standardized&#xD;
      order over 8 weeks with regular automatic emails informing clients about upcoming lessons.&#xD;
      Clients will complete outcome questionnaires at screening, baseline (pre-treatment), 8 weeks&#xD;
      (post-treatment) and at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
