  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation, MTD expansion (Phase 1b) and cohort expansions (Phase 2) study to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of a combination of NAP with durvalumab in subjects with&#xD;
      selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter (n=3-5), prospective, dose-finding and MTD cohort&#xD;
      expansion study, recruits patients with previously treated solid tumors known with high&#xD;
      likelihood of 5T4 antigen expression on tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the dose-escalation part are treated with the combination of NAP and durvalumab&#xD;
      using a fixed dose of durvalumab and the 3+3 design for NAP dose escalations. The (Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) of NAP for the combination treatment will be established based on Dose&#xD;
      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occurring during the first cycle of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second dose escalation part is performed at the second highest safe dose in the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase, pre-treated with obinutuzumab (anti-CD20), for elimination of anti-drug&#xD;
      antibodies (ADAs) to NAP. In this part, the safety of the NAP-durvalumab combination are&#xD;
      assessed with obinutuzumab given prior to the initiation of that regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTD expansion part, in which approximately 10-15 patients are treated at the confirmed MTD of&#xD;
      NAP. Six additional patients are enrolled at the previous dose level to assess whether a&#xD;
      lower dose may achieves a better risk-benefit balance. This cohort recruits patients with the&#xD;
      same tumor types as in the escalation part, as well as 5T4-positive colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      and gastro-esophageal cancer (GE). Measurable disease is required. This expansion cohort will&#xD;
      help assess the biologic activity of the combination and to gain some preliminary insights on&#xD;
      its potential antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following solid tumors known to have &gt; 80% probability of 5T4 expression and thus may be&#xD;
      included in both the dose escalation phase and the MTD expansion: breast cancer, epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, cervical and endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal and urothelial&#xD;
      cancer, head and neck, mesothelioma, melanoma, hepatic carcinoma, prostate cancer, and&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy is acceptable.&#xD;

             failure rate (e.g., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note&#xD;
             that some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g., male or&#xD;

             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral&#xD;

             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective]; and&#xD;
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  All AEs while receiving prior immunotherapy must have completely resolved or&#xD;
