  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to identify the physical and dietary profile of adult women&#xD;
      presenting constitutional leanness (CL), comparatively with normal-weight peers and&#xD;
      BMI-matched women with anorexia nervosa. After an evaluation of their daily energy intake,&#xD;
      physical activity level, body composition, aerobic capacities and muscle strength, women from&#xD;
      the normal weight and CL groups will be asked to realized laboratory sessions to evaluate&#xD;
      their energy intake and appetite feelings responses to acute exercise&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body composition (using X-ray absorptiometry), muscle strength (biodex), daily energy intake&#xD;
      (dietary record), food preferences (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) and physical&#xD;
      activity level (GT3X accelerometers) will be assessed among women with constitutional&#xD;
      leanness normal weight women and women with anorexia nervosa. The CT and NW groups will then&#xD;
      be asked to randomly realized three experimental session: i) a rest session with an fixed&#xD;
      lunch meal; a rest session with an ad libitum meal ; iii) an exercise session with an ad&#xD;
      libitum meal. Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during the two last sessions.&#xD;
      Appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to&#xD;
      the lunch will also be assessed.&#xD;
