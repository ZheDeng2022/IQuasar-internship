  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multi-center GET.FEEDBACK.GP randomized controlled trial is designed based on patients'&#xD;
      needs and preferences. In order to evaluate the effect of feedback in the broader setting of&#xD;
      primary care, a total of 1076 primary care patients with elevated levels of depression (PHQ-9&#xD;
      score ≥ 10) will be randomized into three groups who either receive a) patient-targeted and&#xD;
      physician-targeted feedback of depression screening results, b) a physician-targeted feedback&#xD;
      of depression screening results only, or c) no feedback of screening results. The primary&#xD;
      study outcome is depression severity after 6 months, secondary outcomes include the patients'&#xD;
      behavior and cognitions after the screening, depression care according to German guideline&#xD;
      recommendations and the health economic evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is one of the most significant clinical disorders. In primary care, every&#xD;
      sixth patient suffers from increased depression level, which is associated with higher risk&#xD;
      of suicide, increased risk of onset and progression of chronic physical conditions. Still,&#xD;
      depression is under recognized and undertreated in primary care. Moreover, evidence regarding&#xD;
      the efficacy of depression screening in primary care is insufficient to draw clear&#xD;
      conclusions. Our previous mono-center depression screening trial in cardiac patients,&#xD;
      provides first evidence that written patient-targeted feedback improves depression severity,&#xD;
      encourages greater patient participation and engagement in mental health. To amplify these&#xD;
      effects, the multi-center GET.FEEDBACK.GP randomized controlled trial is now designed based&#xD;
      on patients' needs and preferences. In order to evaluate the effect of feedback in the&#xD;
      broader setting of primary care, a total of 1076 primary care patients with elevated levels&#xD;
      of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) will be randomized into three groups who either receive a)&#xD;
      patient-targeted and physician-targeted feedback of depression screening results, b) a&#xD;
      physician-targeted feedback of depression screening results only, or c) no feedback of&#xD;
      screening results. The primary study outcome is depression severity after 6 months, secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the patients' behavior and cognitions after the screening, depression care&#xD;
      according to German guideline recommendations and the health economic evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Using a randomized-controlled study design one third of the patients and their attending general practitioner will receive feedback after depression screening. The feedback for the patient contains the screening result, information about depression in general, guideline based treatment recommendations for patients and contact-information for treatment. The feedback for the general practitioner contains the screening result and guideline-based recommendations, i.e. to inform patients of their depression screening result. Nevertheless, in order to reflect routine clinical practice, the physicians will decide themselves whether or not to address depression during their consultation with the patient.</description>
