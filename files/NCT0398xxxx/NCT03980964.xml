  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present prospective trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of CyMedica Orthopedics&#xD;
      e-vive™ system, a multifunctional electrotherapy device providing neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES) for reducing pain and accelerating functional recovery in patients with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis. This post-market trial will involve patients who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis, Kelgren-Lawrence Grades II, III, and IV. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the use of the CyMedica e-vive NMES can reduce pain, improve knee function, and improve&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, located in New York,&#xD;
      New York, and involve a total of 120 patients. All study patients will be evenly divided into&#xD;
      two groups: (a) conductive garment and mobile app with NMES therapy; (b) conductive garment&#xD;
      and mobile app without NMES therapy (sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be evaluated according to the time and events schedule. Clinical&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed from 1 to 10 days before day of intervention and followed up after&#xD;
      intervention over a 24 weeks ± 1 week study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two groups will be analyzed using several outcome measures including validated&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures including Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain level, the Knee&#xD;
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) JR., KOOS ADL, and WOMAC survey. Functional&#xD;
      measures include isometric quadriceps strength, Time Up and Go (TUG), 6 minute walk test,&#xD;
      repeated chair rise test, stair climb test, and number of steps recorded by an Apple Watch&#xD;
      Series 3 or a Samsung watch. Reduction of use of anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) and&#xD;
      narcotics, use of ambulation assist devices, plan for TKA procedure survey, device compliance&#xD;
      use, and patient satisfaction survey will be tracked The primary endpoint for the study is&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain The proprietary app for this product will be used to track&#xD;
      device usage (intensity, duration of session, frequency of use), VAS, WOMAC, and KOOS JR.&#xD;

Patients are also allowed to crossover to the treatment arm if they decide to drop out of the study due to the potential lack of clinical benefits from the sham treatment.</intervention_model_description>
