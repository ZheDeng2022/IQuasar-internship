  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, single-arm, multicenter study is to assess an annular&#xD;
      closure device when used as an adjunct to a primary lumbar limited discectomy, to limited&#xD;
      discectomy alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm case series will enroll 75 patients at select US (approximately 8-10) sites.&#xD;
      Patients that are scheduled for a single-level L4-S1 discectomy and who meet the&#xD;
      pre-operative eligibility criteria will be considered for study participation. Patients that&#xD;
      meet all intraoperative criteria will be enrolled into the study and treated with lumbar&#xD;
      discectomy and additional annular closure device implantation. All enrolled subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for at least 12 months.&#xD;
