  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      death. An overactive sympathetic nervous system in CKD patients is one of the major&#xD;
      mechanisms increasing the cardiovascular risks in this patient population. A potential signal&#xD;
      driving sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) involves accumulation of the endogenous nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase (NOS) inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). ADMA is elevated in CKD and is a&#xD;
      strong, independent predictor of future cardiovascular events in these patients. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine whether overcoming the accumulation of endogenous ADMA&#xD;
      with acute L-arginine infusion reduces SNA in CKD patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis is that accumulation of ADMA constitutes a major mechanism for the&#xD;
      sympathetic overactivity and hypertension in patients with CKD. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine if restoration of NO production with the infusion of L-arginine&#xD;
      reduces SNA and blood pressure. On the experimental day, CKD patients will arrive at the&#xD;
      laboratory fasted with no morning meds, will refrain from caffeine for 12 hours, and alcohol&#xD;
      and physical activity for 24 hours. The collaborating physician Dr. Ashfaq Siddiqui will&#xD;
      review subject medications and advise regarding any withholding of medications. If Dr.&#xD;
      Siddiqui deems that a medication should not be withheld the investigators will proceed with&#xD;
      the patient taking the medication. Prior to any screening/testing, all experimental&#xD;
      measurements and procedures will be explained in detail and subjects will provide written,&#xD;
      informed consent. A medical health history questionnaire will be filled out. Women of&#xD;
      child-bearing age will provide a urine sample for a pregnancy testing prior to any study&#xD;
      procedures. The research nurse will place an intravenous catheter in antecubital or hand&#xD;
      vein. Subjects will be familiarized with the experimental measures and procedures prior to&#xD;
      actual testing. Following this, the subjects will be instrumented with ECG leads, an arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) finger-cuff (Finometer), an arterial BP upper-arm cuff for intermittent&#xD;
      absolute BP values, and a strain gauge pneumobelt placed around the abdomen to monitor&#xD;
      respiratory excursions. After measuring blood pressure and pulse wave velocity using&#xD;
      applanation tonometry, a Doppler ultrasound probe will then be positioned for beat-to-beat&#xD;
      measurements of blood velocity and artery diameter and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) will be&#xD;
      performed. After this, continuous recording of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) will&#xD;
      be obtained from the peroneal nerve of the leg, as described below. Following all&#xD;
      instrumentation, 25 minutes of resting baseline data (continuous heart rate, MSNA, BP,&#xD;
      respiration, and blood flow) will be collected. A blood sample will then be obtained from the&#xD;
      intravenous catheter. Next, systemic intravenous infusion of L-arginine, at a dose of 250-350&#xD;
      mg/kg, or saline will be performed for 30 minutes in a randomized order. During each&#xD;
      infusion, cardiovascular measurements (heart rate, BP and MSNA) will be recorded continuously&#xD;
      and an FMD and cold pressor test performed. The blood draw will be repeated after L-arginine&#xD;
      infusion. A 15-minute recovery period will be provided between infusions. Thus, for this&#xD;
      study, patients will visit the lab once and the visit will take approximately 5 hours.&#xD;

    <description>Multiunit postganglionic MSNA will be recorded using standard microneurographic techniques. Briefly, a unipolar tungsten microelectrode will be inserted into muscle fascicles of the peroneal nerve near the fibular head of the right leg. Neural signals will be amplified, filtered (bandwidth, 700-2,000 Hz), rectified, and integrated (time constant, 0.1 s) to obtain mean voltage neurograms (University of Iowa Bioengineering, Iowa City, IA).</description>
