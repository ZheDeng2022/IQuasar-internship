    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, single oral dose study to assess&#xD;
      the PK of fedratinib in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched&#xD;
      subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score&#xD;
      according to Pugh's Modification of Child's Classification of Severity of Liver Disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Inclusion Criteria for Subjects with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment (Groups 1&#xD;
             and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Each subject with moderate or severe hepatic impairment must also meet all the&#xD;
             criteria listed below for entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has moderate or severe hepatic impairment or cirrhosis due to chronic hepatic&#xD;
             disease and/or prior alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has moderate (Group 1) or severe (Group 3) hepatic impairment as defined by&#xD;
             Child-Pugh Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 1 subjects (moderate hepatic impairment) are required to have documented&#xD;
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of cirrhosis made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or&#xD;
                  imaging study with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 3 subjects (severe hepatic impairment) are required to have documented&#xD;
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of cirrhosis made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or&#xD;
                  imaging study with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If biopsy or laparoscopy is not performed prior to Screening, subjects can be included&#xD;
             only if they have chronic liver disease and objective evidence of portal hypertension&#xD;
             (ascites diagnosis by imaging or varices), or current medication for consequences of&#xD;
             portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects should be enrolled into the group corresponding to the Child-Pugh&#xD;
             classification score that most accurately reflects the most severe hepatic disease&#xD;
             classification within the past 6 months (based on past medical history or physical&#xD;
             examination observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: If a Child-Pugh score was previously calculated and documented in the last 6&#xD;
             months, and it is more severe than the one calculated at Screening, then that previous&#xD;
             value will be used for study entry purposes. If the Screening Child-Pugh score is more&#xD;
             severe, then it will be used. If no score was calculated in the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening, then the score obtained at Screening will be used. Adequate documentation&#xD;
             should be provided to substantiate the Child-Pugh score assigned to each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject must be medically stable for at least 1 month before Screening with clinically&#xD;
             acceptable medical history, PE, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and 12-lead&#xD;
             ECGs consistent with the underlying stable hepatic impairment condition, as judged by&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject must be stable on a concomitant medication regimen (defined as not starting a&#xD;
             new medication[s] or a change in the dosage or frequency of the concomitant&#xD;
             medication[s] within 7 days or 5 half-lives [whichever is longer] before dosing with&#xD;
             fedratinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject may be treated with diuretics for ascites. Subjects with severe ascites at&#xD;
             time of enrollment may be included at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject may have a history of encephalopathy; however, they must be on stable&#xD;
             treatment for at least 1 month prior to Screening, and must not have had an acute&#xD;
             encephalopathic episode in the 1 month prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects must not have history of hepatorenal syndrome or hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at Screening (QTcF ≤ 480&#xD;
             msec).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Subject has liver-related laboratory test results within the respective reference&#xD;
             ranges or judged as clinically acceptable by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject must match a subject in Groups 1 or 3, as needed, with respect to sex, age (±&#xD;
             10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subject is in good health as determined by past medical history, PE, vital signs, ECG,&#xD;
             and clinical laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety tests (ie,&#xD;
             hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be within normal limits&#xD;
             or clinically acceptable as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;

             (including St. John's wort) within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior&#xD;
             to the first dose administration. The Indiana University &quot;Cytochrome P450 Drug&#xD;
             Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine inhibitors and/or inducers of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has any surgical or medical condition(s) possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure. Subjects with&#xD;

             a. If positive drug screen in a subject with hepatic impairment is due to prescription&#xD;
             drug use, the specific drug and dosing regimen of the prescription drug must be&#xD;
             reviewed with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor to ensure lack of interference with the PK&#xD;

             study, including a subject who is unable to communicate or to cooperate with the&#xD;
             Investigator or the clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has a hypersensitivity to ondansetron. 4.3.1. Exclusion Criteria for Subjects&#xD;
             with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment (Groups 1 and 3) The presence of any of the&#xD;
             following will exclude a hepatically-impaired subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has any serious medical condition (excluding hepatic impairment and related&#xD;

             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not&#xD;
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days or 5 drug half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose administration of fedratinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. A subject who has used (or will have used) a prescribed medication less than 30&#xD;
             days prior to (but at least 5 half-lives prior to) fedratinib dosing may be admitted&#xD;
             into the study if such usage is not expected by the Investigator to have persistent PK&#xD;
             effects at the time of fedratinib dosing. Such effects may include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, cytochrome induction or covalent cytochrome inhibition. These cases must&#xD;
             be approved by Sponsor's Medical Monitor. The decision and its rationale will be&#xD;
             documented in the Trial Master File.&#xD;

             a. A subject who has used (or will have used) a nonprescribed medication less than 14&#xD;
             days prior to (but at least 5 half-lives prior to) fedratinib dosing may be admitted&#xD;
             into the study if such usage is not expected by the Investigator to have persistent PK&#xD;
             effects at the time of fedratinib dosing. Such effects may include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, cytochrome induction or covalent cytochrome inhibition. These cases must&#xD;

         28. Subject is known to have a history of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, or have a&#xD;
             positive result to the test for HIV antibodies at screening Note: Subjects who&#xD;
             received hepatitis B vaccination and who test positive for hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antibody and negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody remain eligible for study participation.&#xD;
