  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the relationship between the bile acids, short chain&#xD;
      fatty acids and bacteria within the intestines. The hypothesis is that changes in the&#xD;
      bacterial composition of the stool are associated with the differences in bile acids and&#xD;
      short chain fatty acids in patients having irritable bowel syndrome compared to healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

      The Study involves 3 visits and will in include 3 types of subjects - those who have&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and those&#xD;
      who have no IBS symptoms or diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will read and sign this informed consent after all questions about the study&#xD;
           have been answered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a screening visit and we may determine that volunteers ineligible to continue to&#xD;
           participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will have a medical history taken including demographics, history of symptoms&#xD;
           and illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will be asked about all medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical exam will be performed by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine Pregnancy test may be done for woman in the reproductive age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be provided with a take-home lasagna meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given instructions and supplies for collection, storage and&#xD;
           transportation of stool for the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be provided with instructions for a low fiber, high fat diet which&#xD;
           should be consumed for 2 days before stool collection and during the 2 days of stool&#xD;
           collection. Instructions will also come with materials to allow participants to record&#xD;
           diet intake during these 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be provided a bowel pattern diary to record bowel symptoms over the&#xD;
           course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: this may be the same as Visit 1 or it may be a different day. It will depend upon the&#xD;
      day that participants can make it back to the clinic for the Day 5 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2-4 (at home):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants record stool symptoms and patterns in a diary daily starting from Day 2 to&#xD;
           Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During this time, participants will be instructed to consume a low fiber diet, avoid&#xD;
           alcohol, and start a 4-day 100 g fat diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the evening before Day 5, a standardized, completely digestible, and non-fermentable&#xD;
           meal (lasagna) will be consumed which will be provided to you on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will collect stool at home on Day 4 and 5 and store as per instructions&#xD;
           provided on Visit 1. They will&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 5 (Visit 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants return to the clinic on Day 5 after an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a standard breakfast and lasanga meal with 10 g inulin (Orafti®) powder&#xD;
           and 200 mL of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take-home meals will be provided (white bread sandwich with ham or cheese) to be&#xD;
           consumed at 4 and 8 hours after breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 6 (Visit 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return to the clinic in order to return stool collections and the&#xD;
           daily diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may also submit diaries by fax or email.&#xD;
