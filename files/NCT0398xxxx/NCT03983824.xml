    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of M3814 when given in combination&#xD;
      with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). M3814 may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving M3814 in combination with mitoxantrone, etoposide,&#xD;
      and cytarabine may lower the chance of the acute myeloid leukemia growing or spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability and determine the recommended phase two dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of M3814 in combination with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MEC alone and of M3814 in combination&#xD;
      with MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of M3814 in combination with MEC in patients with&#xD;
      R/R AML as measured by the response rate (complete remission [CR] plus CR with incomplete&#xD;
      count recovery), duration of CR/CRi (DOR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate correlative biomarkers of M3814 target engagement and response. II. To&#xD;
      correlate cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities with response. III. To evaluate the rates&#xD;
      of early mortality and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing&#xD;
      (RNAseq), in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by&#xD;
      which treatment may be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVb. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based&#xD;
      assessment platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of M3814.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive M3814 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2-21, mitoxantrone intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 15 minutes, etoposide IV over 60 minutes and cytarabine IV over 60 minutes on days&#xD;
      1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             may confer with the study doctor to determine if such medications can be discontinued.&#xD;
             These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days or 5 elimination half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             shorter) prior to the first dose of M3814. Patients do not need to discontinue calcium&#xD;
             carbonate or H2 blockers&#xD;
