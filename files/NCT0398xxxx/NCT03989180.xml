  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the performance of Check-Cap Imaging System in healthy volunteers in a variety of&#xD;
      operating scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Back recorder unit is the primary module for evaluation The participants DO NOT ingest a&#xD;
      capsule and the capsules do not have any radioactive source&#xD;

      1. st visit - Subjects will be referred to the study by an advertisement in the local media&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The subjects will receive a preliminary explanation about the study procedure and&#xD;
                required activities. If the subjects agree to participate in the study will be&#xD;
                asked to sign the ICF&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will be screened for eligibility according to the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
                criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The date for their participation will be coordinated at their convenience&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd visit - Subject will arrive to the company R&amp;D lab and will receive detailed&#xD;
           introduction about the procedure and instruction for the daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (The total duration of Check-Cap Imaging System study for each subject is up to 4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will receive detailed instructions (verbally and written) about the normal&#xD;
           operation of the C-Scan System and how to handle it during normal daily routine. They&#xD;
           will be asked to document all their daily activity in a personal diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The C-Scan Track will be attached to their lower back to test its functionality and the&#xD;
           capsule will be attached to their abdomen to test the effect on data transmission during&#xD;
           daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The interference of the back recorder with the cloths (belt, bra etc.) will be monitored&#xD;
           for any discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to complete a personal diary which documents the time and&#xD;
           duration of significant activities during the procedure such as meal times, sleeping&#xD;
           times, physical activities etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some subjects will be instructed to be stationary during short sessions (10-20-30 min)&#xD;
           and may read, watch TV or use the Internet. The localization data will be collected on a&#xD;
           dedicated portable computer via these detectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The monitoring routine for each subject will include but not limited to the following&#xD;
           parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The well-being of the subject, and his/her daily routine: work, meals, driving,&#xD;
                public transportation, mild sport, shower, sleep, other activities&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inquiries about any discomfort caused by the recorder&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inquiries about any discomfort or skin irritation caused by the patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inquiries about the function of the recorder as indicated by the recorder visual &amp;&#xD;
                indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ease of operation of the push buttons positioned on the recorder (reaching to the&#xD;
                lower back with w/out direct vision (mirror)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Responding to auditory and visual indicators position on the recorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some subjects will be asked to continue carrying the back recorder system for few more&#xD;
           days in order to evaluate the effects of the system on their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subjective questionnaire will be filled by the subjects following each phase of the&#xD;
           evaluation in order to solicit immediate feedback regarding any discomfort or complaint&#xD;
           During the current development study the plan is to simulate some of these scenarios and&#xD;
           evaluate the functionality of the back-recorder and communication with the capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will continue their daily routine: work, sleep, shower, driving in car or&#xD;
           public transportation, sit, stand, walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects should refrain from active sport such as jogging, physical exercise in the gym,&#xD;
           swimming, sauna, any ball-games, skiing etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects should refrain from Flights, boat trips or long train travels during the&#xD;
           monitoring procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects should try and stay away from areas with high electromagnetic fields such as:&#xD;
           High voltage elect. Poles, transformation station, radio and TV transmitter station etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects should not be examined by CT or MRI (unless it is an emergency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who are working in an area with high electromagnetic field should not be&#xD;
           examined by the capsule&#xD;
