      According to previous studies, the effect of PRP to patellar tendinopathy could last longer.&#xD;
      However, the type, concentration, time and frequent of injection are still debated。 This&#xD;
      study is to understand the effect of multiple injection of platlet-rich plasma in chronic&#xD;
      patellar tendinopathy and to analyze the relation between efficacy of PRP and the growth&#xD;
      factor in PRP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patellar tendinopathy, also known as jumper's knee，is clinically common characterised by&#xD;
      anterior knee pain, activity-related pain、local tenderness over inferior pole of patella. The&#xD;
      discomfort can result in decreasing athletic performance and be one of the most challenge for&#xD;
      sports medicine doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patellar tendon suffer from repetitive microtrauma，result in reactive patellar&#xD;
      tendinopathy. The overload tendon combining with risk factors of patellar tendinopathy will&#xD;
      not recover timely and progress to chronic patellar tendinopathy. Hence, to reverse the&#xD;
      progression is our aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous studies, several nonsurgical treatment options have been proposed such&#xD;
      as medication, eccentric exercise, corticosteroid injection, shockwave and platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma (PRP). Among all the options, the effect of PRP could last longer. However, the type,&#xD;
      concentration, time and frequent of injection are still debated。Moreover, there is no study&#xD;
      about the relationship between efficacy and the ratio and concentration of growth factor in&#xD;
      the PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to understand (1) The effect of multiple injection of platlet-rich&#xD;
      plasma in chronic patellar tendinopathy. (2) The effect of leukocyte-rich PRP in chronic&#xD;
      patellar tendinopathy (3) Analyze the relation between efficacy of PRP and the growth factor&#xD;
      in PRP.&#xD;
