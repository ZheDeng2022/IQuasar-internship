  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable geographical variation in the rates of compulsion in psychiatric&#xD;
      services within as well as between countries. Reducing the use of compulsion of patients with&#xD;
      severe mental illness is an expressed policy aim, and also a demand from service user&#xD;
      organisations. In Norway, municipalities hold responsibility for primary care and are&#xD;
      therefore central to the delivery of services to people with severe mental illness. This&#xD;
      indicates a potential for intervening at the municipal level to reduce the use of compulsion&#xD;
      where it is high. The Reducing Coercion in Norway study (RECON) will, in collaboration with&#xD;
      municipalities with high compulsion rates, develop a municipal-level intervention (Stage 1)&#xD;
      that will be implemented in a cluster-RCT (Stage 2) to test if it has effect on compulsion&#xD;
      rates.pulsion rates.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway, as in other parts of the Western world, there have been concerns about increase in&#xD;
      the use of compulsory mental health care for patients with severe mental illness. There is&#xD;
      growing public concern, however, despite the explicit instruction from the Norwegian&#xD;
      government that health services should reduce the use of compulsion, rates have not&#xD;
      decreased. The Reducing Coercion in Norway study (RECON) is designed to develop and test an&#xD;
      intervention, at the municipal level, to reduce the use of compulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most referrals to compulsory treatment come from primary care. In Norway, it is the 400+&#xD;
      municipalities who hold responsibility for primary care. This includes multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      municipal mental health teams, substance abuse services, social care and GP services. At the&#xD;
      Specialist level, four Regional Health Authorities Commission a number of Health Trusts to&#xD;
      deliver specialist mental health care through acute hospitals and District Psychiatric&#xD;
      Centres. These centres often collaborate, in different ways, with municipal services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Municipal service providers are often those in most frequent contact with patients with&#xD;
      severe mental illness, and will commonly be those detecting early signs of relapse.&#xD;
      Importantly, municipal services (usually GPs or out of hours emergency services) will serve&#xD;
      as gatekeepers for involuntary admissions, as they refer to specialist services who then may&#xD;
      invoke the Mental Health Act that sanctions compulsion. This suggests a potential for&#xD;
      developing strategies within municipal services to intervene early and possibly prevent some&#xD;
      episodes of compulsion. Very little research has investigated the role municipal services&#xD;
      play in the compulsion or on relevant cross-sectoral collaborations. There is also limited&#xD;
      research on out-patient interventions designed to reduce compulsion. A systematic review&#xD;
      could only include 15 experimental studies internationally. Joint crisis plans, risk&#xD;
      assessments and counselling of staff were identified as promising interventions. However,&#xD;
      most studies had insufficient samples or were of too poor quality to draw conclusions.&#xD;
      Moreover, all included studies were based in specialist out-patient services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Six Core Strategies' intervention, developed to reduce seclusion and restraint in&#xD;
      psychiatric hospitals, has shown positive effects. The six strategies involved are:&#xD;
      structured efforts to improve leadership and organisational change; use of data to inform&#xD;
      practice; workforce development; use of seclusion and restraint reduction tools; involvement&#xD;
      of peers, and; rigorous debriefing techniques. It has been implemented in six countries, with&#xD;
      positive results. No equivalent has been developed for municipal services. Service users and&#xD;
      clinicians in Norway have, however, suggested potential strategies for municipal services to&#xD;
      impact on compulsion rates. These include crisis plans; structured meetings of patients'&#xD;
      networks, spaces for informal contact; key contact persons for patients; improved skills for&#xD;
      early detection of relapse and; improved local collaboration. Given the potential role of&#xD;
      municipalities for reducing the use of compulsion, it seems clear that further research is&#xD;
      needed. RECON takes the Six Core Strategies model as a starting point for developing and&#xD;
      testing a municipality-based intervention for reducing the use of compulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To develop, implement and test the effectiveness of a municipality-based intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the use of compulsion in mental health services, in municipalities with rates of&#xD;
      involuntary treatment episodes above the national average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim will be reached through a two-staged approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND METHODS STAGE 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to facilitate stakeholder input and to ground the research in a thorough&#xD;
      understanding of the structures and processes of municipal service delivery, much of the data&#xD;
      to address Objectives 1-3 will be collected through a mix of qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify and secure the participation of mid-sized municipalities with above average&#xD;
           levels of involuntary treatment episodes Mid-sized municipalities (20-50K inhabitants),&#xD;
           with above average rates of compulsion and motivated to change service delivery to&#xD;
           tackle compulsion, will be recruited to take part in the study. This will take place in&#xD;
           the period June- September 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To map the mechanics of current practice together with local health and social services,&#xD;
           service users, family caregivers and other stakeholders Local current practice will be&#xD;
           mapped regarding what services are available in the intervention sites and how they work&#xD;
           individually and collaboratively with patients with severe mental illness. Particular&#xD;
           focus will be on the processes in municipal services that lead to involvement of GPs and&#xD;
           possible referral for assessment for compulsion, and how patients are cared for after&#xD;
           discharge (some of them subject to outpatient compulsion). Across the five sites&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews and/or focus groups will be conducted with service leads in&#xD;
           municipal mental health and addiction services (outpatient and housing services), GPs,&#xD;
           social services and corresponding services in the local DPCs and focus groups with&#xD;
           service users and family caregivers. These data will be subject to thematic analysis.&#xD;
           Content analyses will be conducted of relevant service plans and other documents&#xD;
           outlining leadership and workforce development, service collaboration, and any relevant&#xD;
           guidelines. This will take place in the period July- December 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop a municipality-based intervention for reducing compulsion in collaboration&#xD;
           with municipalities and service users.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collected will be used in the development of the intervention through mediated&#xD;
           dialogue seminars with services in the intervention sites. Based on the Six Core&#xD;
           Strategies it is likely that themes will include: leadership and organizational change;&#xD;
           using data to inform practice; workforce development; use of seclusion and restraint&#xD;
           reduction tools (in the municipal setting this might include crisis plans, risk&#xD;
           assessment and de-escalation tools); involve peers, and; rigorous debriefing techniques&#xD;
           (most likely after a referral for assessment for detention and/or after discharge from&#xD;
           hospital). This will take place in the period January- March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OBJECTIVES AND METHODS, STAGE 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To implement and study the intervention in five municipalities The intervention&#xD;
           developed in Stage 1 will be implemented by services in five municipalities, supported&#xD;
           by the research team. Regular site visits and contacts will be conducted to monitor&#xD;
           progress and fidelity to the intervention in the intervention sites. This will feed into&#xD;
           a process evaluation that will identify potential facilitating factors and barriers for&#xD;
           successful implementation. This will take place in the period April 2020- April 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To test the effect of the intervention in a cluster-randomised controlled trial The&#xD;
           effectiveness of the intervention will be measured by comparing the change in outcomes&#xD;
           between the intervention and the control group (difference in difference). Outcome data&#xD;
           will be obtained aggregated at municipality level, from the National Patient Registry&#xD;
           and be measured over three time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypotheses are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a larger reduction in prevalence rate of involuntary treatment episodes in&#xD;
           the intervention arm as compared with the control arm during the intervention period&#xD;
           (i.e., Index vs T1) (primary analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a larger reduction in prevalence rate of involuntary treatment episodes in&#xD;
           the intervention arm as compared with the control arm in the longer term (i.e., Index vs&#xD;
           T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators similarly hypothesise that the change in secondary outcomes will be larger&#xD;
      in the intervention arm than the control arm during the intervention period (i.e., Index vs&#xD;
      T1) and in the longer term (i.e., Index vs T2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS Asking municipalities to take part in a research programme by&#xD;
      which they are required to change current practices is likely to be experienced as demanding.&#xD;
      As explained above, research staff will be supporting the municipalities throughout. It is&#xD;
      therefore necessary to keep the number of clusters at a manageable size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because outcome data will be aggregated at municipality level, power calculation at patient&#xD;
      level is precluded. Based on current statistics, a mid-sized municipality has 40-100&#xD;
      involuntary admissions and 12-30 episodes of outpatient compulsion each year. Municipalities&#xD;
      with above average rates of compulsory treatment per 10K population will be targeted, with&#xD;
      the aim to include five municipalities in the intervention arm and five in the control arm.&#xD;
      This should be sufficient to give stable estimates of the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSES Prevalence rates in the intervention and the control arms during the&#xD;
      Index, T1 and T2 periods will be calculated and presented together with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals. Differences between the intervention and the control arm in the change in&#xD;
      prevalence rate from the Index to the T1 period (as primary analysis) and the Index to the T2&#xD;
      period will be assessed by z-test for proportions. Change in overall duration of involuntary&#xD;
      treatment episodes will be compared between the intervention and the control arm by&#xD;
      Independent samples t-test. Even though the available data will be aggregated at municipality&#xD;
      level, knowing the size of each municipality, the number of episodes, mean length of episodes&#xD;
      and standard deviation for those length of episodes will enable the use of the aforementioned&#xD;
      tests. Exploratory analyses comparing outcomes between T1 and T2 periods will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In each cluster, consent to participate will be obtained from the person in charge of&#xD;
           municipal mental health services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All professionals, patients and family carers who participate in qualitative research&#xD;
           activities in Stage 1will provide individual informed consent prior to enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All primary and secondary outcome measures will be collected from the Norwegian Patient&#xD;
           Records and will be aggregated at municipal level. As no research activity will take&#xD;
           place in control sites, no consent will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation of eligible municipalities took place prior to inviting interventions&#xD;
      municipalities to take part as follows. All municipalities that met the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      (n=28) were ranked in descending order of the rates of involuntary admission per 10K&#xD;
      population. In the cases where two or more neighbouring municipalities were on that list&#xD;
      (n=7), the ones with the lowest rate were excluded. This left a list of 21municipalities.&#xD;
      Paired stratification was applied by which paired the first and second municipality on the&#xD;
      list were paired, number 3 and 4, number 5 and 6 etc. Within each pair, one municipality was&#xD;
      drawn at random to take part in the intervention arm and the other was allocated to the&#xD;
      control arm. If a municipality allocated to the intervention arm declines to take part, the&#xD;
      control municipality will not be included. It was important to avoid a large spread in terms&#xD;
      of the rate of involuntary admissions. Therefore, if a municipality allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention arm declines participation and their neighbouring municipality had been&#xD;
      excluded, that neighbour municipality will no longer be ineligible and will be included in&#xD;
      the intervention arm, if willing to participate.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        As we are developing a new intervention, we will target municipalities in the higher 50&#xD;
        percent of rates of involuntary treatment episodes, and of a size that makes it possible to&#xD;
        detect effect. To avoid the effect of the national reorganisation of Norwegian&#xD;
        municipalities that is currently underway, those municipalities involved in a merging&#xD;
        process of their services will not be targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible municipalities are those that:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a population size between 20-50K inhabitants (figures from 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are in the upper half of all municipalities in terms of the rate of involuntary&#xD;
             treatment (figures from 2016-17)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are not affected by a merging process&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Municipalities neighbouring another eligible municipality will not be included to prevent&#xD;
        contamination should one of them be randomised to the intervention group. The municipality&#xD;
        with the lowest rate of involuntary treatment episodes will be removed&#xD;
