    <textblock>
      Improved understanding of the long-time healthcare utilisation of childhood cancer survivors&#xD;
      is relevant as it can be seen as a proxy for the population's morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a historic population-based matched cohort study using Danish&#xD;
      nationwide registry data. Eligible children are children 1.0-17.9 years diagnosed with Acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Denmark from 1994 till 2016. The primary outcome is yearly&#xD;
      contact rates to primary healthcare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most frequent single form of cancer in children&#xD;
      accounting for 40-45 new cases every year in Denmark. Over the past decades, advances in&#xD;
      treatment have led to an increasing number of children who survive cancer and more than 80%&#xD;
      of children with ALL now become long-term survivors. This means a growing population of&#xD;
      childhood ALL survivors. In survivors, the cancer itself and treatment late-effects can lead&#xD;
      to ongoing health care use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Register studies of long-term survivors of childhood cancer have shown an increased risk of&#xD;
      hospitalisation compared to the general population. It is mentioned in many of the studies&#xD;
      that contact rates could be underestimated when looking at hospital contacts only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature about non-hospital-based contacts with a doctor in childhood cancer survivors&#xD;
      is scarce.&#xD;
