  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the uptake of genetic testing among patients&#xD;
      randomized with two different models of genetic services delivery (a patient-directed model&#xD;
      and an enhanced standard of care model) and examine whether the impact on uptake differs by&#xD;
      race/ethnicity and rurality. This study will also compare the effect of these delivery models&#xD;
      on adherence to cancer prevention and screening recommendations and other patient responses.&#xD;

      Patient Screening: A comprehensive screening algorithm will identify patients with family&#xD;
      history data in various sections of the electronic health record (EHR) who meet current&#xD;
      genetic testing criteria. Randomization to study arm (Enhanced Standard of Care or&#xD;
      Patient-Directed Standard of Care) will be at the level of the primary care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced Standard of Care Patients will be offered the opportunity to schedule a pre-test&#xD;
      genetic counseling visit. Pre-test counseling includes review of the family history, risk&#xD;
      assessment, discussion of the purpose of genetic testing and possible outcomes, implications&#xD;
      for insurance coverage, costs, and assessment of psychosocial needs. Patients can opt to&#xD;
      proceed with genetic testing during this session. All test results are returned by a genetic&#xD;
      counselor by phone or in person based on the patient preference. A copy of the results and a&#xD;
      letter with tailored screening recommendations are returned to the primary care provider and&#xD;
      patient via the patient portal or mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Directed Standard of Care The pre-test genetic counseling visit will be conducted&#xD;
      through access to an automated genetics education assistant accessed through the patient&#xD;
      portal of the electronic health record. The automated approach will address all the&#xD;
      components of the pre-test counseling and contains content designed by the genetic counselors&#xD;
      at the University of Utah and NYU (New York University). Patients will have the option to&#xD;
      contact genetic counselors through the patient portal, by phone, or in person but this will&#xD;
      not be required. All results will be reviewed by a genetic counselor. Negative results will&#xD;
      be returned by the automated genetics education assistant. Genetic counselors will return&#xD;
      results for pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance via phone. A copy of&#xD;
      the results and a letter with tailored screening recommendations will be provided to the&#xD;
      patient and primary care provider via the patient portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be offered the option to schedule follow-up appointments in the genetics&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing will be performed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)- certified,&#xD;
      commercial laboratories based on standard clinical practice. Genetic testing will not be&#xD;
      required to participate in the research questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two follow-up questionnaires will be sent via the patient portal following interaction with&#xD;
      genetic counseling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Questionnaire #1: For participant who chose to receive genetic testing, a questionnaire&#xD;
      will be sent approximately 4 weeks after their genetic results are returned. Through this&#xD;
      questionnaire investigators will assess cognitive (i.e., recall, comprehension, uncertainty,&#xD;
      risk perceptions), affective (i.e., test-related distress, positive reactions, decision&#xD;
      regret), communication responses (i.e., family, provider), experience with genetic&#xD;
      counseling, and sociodemographic characteristics. For those who chose not to test, a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be sent approximately 4 weeks after last genetic service contact. In this&#xD;
      questionnaire investigators will assess experience with genetic counseling, reason for not&#xD;
      testing, decision regret, risk perceptions, and sociodemographic characteristics including&#xD;
      numeracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Questionnaire #2: A questionnaire will be administered approximately 12 months after last&#xD;
      genetic services contact. For those who chose to test, this questionnaire will ask about&#xD;
      discussion of their test results with their primary care provider, family members, or others,&#xD;
      and self-reported use of cancer screenings. For those who decide not to receive genetic&#xD;
      testing, investigators will assess the self-reported use of cancer screenings, whether&#xD;
      genetic testing was pursued at another time or through another source, communication with&#xD;
      family members, and whether other relatives had received testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any participants who would like to complete questionnaires by telephone, a genetic&#xD;
      counseling assistant or research coordinator will administer the questionnaire. Calls will be&#xD;
      digitally recorded to allow for analysis of comprehension. Each questionnaire will take about&#xD;
      15 minutes to complete. Participants may also complete the questionnaires by mail if they&#xD;
      choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the questionnaires, investigators will examine screenings, care or health&#xD;
      procedures related to genetic services recorded in the electronic health record to determine&#xD;
      if an impact is made because of participation in genetic services.&#xD;
