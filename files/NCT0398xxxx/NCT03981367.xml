  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of external root resorption and distal caries in mandibular second molars&#xD;
      associated with impacted mandibular third molars will be detected in addition to the&#xD;
      association of the risk factors.&#xD;

      Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be obtained from the data base available at the department of Oral&#xD;
      and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT images will be obtained from Egyptian patients who had CBCT examination as part of their&#xD;
      dental examination, diagnosis or treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Angulation of the third molar according to Winter's classification&#xD;
           (vertical/mesio-angular/disto-angular/horizontal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Position of impacted mandibular third molar according to Pell and Gregory21&#xD;
           classification. (Position A, position B, position C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Data Sources / Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective Data Analysis will be performed after the CBCT images are pooled from the&#xD;
           computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the CBCT examinations will be scanned using CBCT Software (Planmeca Romexis Viewer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT images will be analysed in the 3 planes; the sagittal, coronal and axial sections&#xD;
           in the 3D module, and in the cross-sectional cuts in the dental volume reformatting&#xD;
           module for detection of ERR and/or caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A carious lesion will be considered present when radiolucency can be seen in enamel&#xD;
           and/or dentine in any of the cuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caries will be graded according to severity into:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incipient (less than halfway through the enamel)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Moderate (more than halfway through enamel but does not involve the dentino-enamel&#xD;
                junction (DEJ)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Advanced (to the DEJ but does not extend more than half the distance to the pulp)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severe (more than half the distance to the pulp)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ERR will be diagnosed as clear loss of substance in the root of adjacent second molar&#xD;
           teeth due to direct contact between it and impacted third molar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ERR will be graded according to severity into:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ERR involving less than half the dentine thickness (slight)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ERR involving at least half the dentine (moderate)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ERR involving the pulp cavity (severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of caries and ERR will be correlated to the study variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT images will be interpreted by two dental radiologists with more than 7 years&#xD;
           experience independently; blinded from demographic data of the patients and from the&#xD;
           results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of the radiologists will evaluate the images twice with a period of two weeks&#xD;
           between the two reading sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then inter-observational and intra-observational variability between the observers will&#xD;
           be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No source of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous paper by Tassoker et al.1 2018, conducted in Turkey, the prevalence of&#xD;
      ERR was 21%. Using a precision of 5, a design effect set at 1 with 95% CI (confidence&#xD;
      interval), a total sample size of 255 will be sufficient. The sample size was calculated by&#xD;
      Epi info.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of CBCT scans of Egyptian individuals with ERR and/or distal caries in mandibular&#xD;
      2nd molars associated with mandibular 3rd molars will be counted to estimate their frequency&#xD;
      in the Egyptian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences), version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Numerical data will be described as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation or median and range. Categorical data will be described as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages. Comparisons between male and females for normally distributed numeric variables&#xD;
      will be done using the Student's t-test while for non-normally distributed numeric variables&#xD;
      will be done by Mann-Whitney test. Comparisons between categorical variables will be&#xD;
      performed using the chi square test. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. All tests will be two tailed.&#xD;
