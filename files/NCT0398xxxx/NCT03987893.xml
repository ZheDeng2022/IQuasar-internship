      Therapeutic Efficacy of oral PEG3350 plus Lactulose Versus Lactulose alone in Patients of&#xD;
      Acute on Chronic Liver Failure with Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy: A Single Blind Prospective&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) refers to syndrome observed in patients with cirrhosis exhibiting&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of mild to severe cognitive dysfunction (neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      abnormalities) characterised by alterations in sleep pattern, sudden behavioural changes &amp;&#xD;
      personality changes along with altered cognition, or coma. The basic pathophysiology involved&#xD;
      in development of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities associated with HE&#xD;
      are not clearly understood but ammonia generation by gut microbiota is considered as&#xD;
      significant contributing factor. HE is categorized into overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE)&#xD;
      and minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Previous studies have reported the incidence of OHE&#xD;
      and MHE to be 30-45% and 60-80% respectively in patients suffering from cirrhosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we propose to assess the efficacy of an ammonia reducing therapy&#xD;
      utilisisng PEG 3350 in patients with Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic encephalopathy in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) The syndrome of acute on&#xD;
      chronic liver failure is a recently described clinical entity. The defining criterion for&#xD;
      acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) takes into consideration the existence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (HE) within 4 weeks. In Asia, the following definition has been suggested:&#xD;
      &quot;acute hepatic insult manifesting as jaundice (serum bilirubin level ≥5 mg/dl) and&#xD;
      coagulopathy (international normalized ratio ≥1.5), complicated within 4 weeks by ascites&#xD;
      and/or encephalopathy in a patient with previously diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver&#xD;
      disease&quot; . In the West, experts proposed to define ACLF as &quot;an acute deterioration of liver&#xD;
      function in patients with cirrhosis which is usually associated with a precipitating event&#xD;
      and results in the failure of one or more organs and high short-term mortality&quot;. This&#xD;
      definition is on the basis of the European Association for the Study of the Liver&#xD;
      (EASL)-Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) Consortium Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Cirrhosis&#xD;
      (CANONIC)&quot; study which established diagnostic criteria for ACLF in hospitalized patients who&#xD;
      had an acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis . In ACLF, hyperammonemia, systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory state mediated by various cytokines which includes sepsis/SIRS, bacterial&#xD;
      translocation, insulin resistance resulting in hyperglycemia and oxidant induced injury, in&#xD;
      addition modulation by glutaminase gene alteration along with alterations in cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics appear to be crucial factors in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy.Various&#xD;
      studies have explored the potential of bacterial infections, hyponatremia, alcohol intake and&#xD;
      factors responsible for systemic inflammation in HE. HE is diagnosed after excluding other&#xD;
      causes of altered cognition such as metabolic, neurological and psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
      Clinical features of HE in ACLF patients are very much similar to those with HE in acute&#xD;
      liver failure (ALF). The clear correlation of serum ammonia levels, systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      outcome of HE in ACLF patients is not well understood .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors precipitating, HE, such as constipation, hyponatremia, infections etc. must be&#xD;
      promptly identified and addressed appropriately. Currently Evidence-based medicine approach&#xD;
      for the management of HE is restricted to early bowel evacuation and administration of&#xD;
      non-absorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin. Antibiotics, prebiotics, treatment of diabetes&#xD;
      and other supportive management reduces the systemic inflammation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the therapy regimens in treatment of hepatic encephalopathy are directed towards&#xD;
      reduction of the generation of nitrogenous products, for which gut is the major site of&#xD;
      generation and the organ of accumulation of nitrogenous toxins especially Ammonia in patients&#xD;
      with liver failure and portosystemic shunting Treatment of Hepatic Encephalopathy Lactulose&#xD;
      (beta-1,4-galactosido-fructose) has been used in practice for the management of HE because of&#xD;
      its ammonia lowering effects . The mechanism by which lactulose act still remains&#xD;
      controversial and is hypothesized to be by following methods, first is metabolism of&#xD;
      lactulose by gut bacteria release organic acids which play vital role in trapping ammonium&#xD;
      ions, second is by elimination of ammonia generating organisms and third is by replacing&#xD;
      amminogenic organisms with urease lacking acidophilic bacteria . The role of inhibition of&#xD;
      glutamine followed by decreased ammonia genesis has also been considered. Management and&#xD;
      treatment of patients with OHE is mainly focused on elimination of underlying precipitating&#xD;
      factors, nutritional supports, and lowering ammonemia . Lactulose and rifaximin are the most&#xD;
      widely used medications to lower ammonia generation; however, their exact mechanism of action&#xD;
      is still not well understood .&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVIEW OF LITERATURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Role of PEG 3350 in HE Before the routine use of non-absorbable disaccharides,&#xD;
      simple laxatives were used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy assuming the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of bowel evacuation in resolution of neurocognitive disturbances in liver&#xD;
      diseases. With this principle, there were trials done assessing the clinical benefits of PEG&#xD;
      solution, which is a commonly used laxative is used routinely in bowel preparation for&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Currently there is a significant data showing the beneficial effects of PEG 3350&#xD;
      in overt HE due to underlying cirrhosis, however its efficacy in ACLF remains to be looked&#xD;
      into. Similar to lactulose, polyethylene glycol is unabsorbed from the gut but in addition it&#xD;
      also lacks the unabsorbed carbohydrate load which aids in lowering of stool pH and enhancing&#xD;
      the amount of water lost from the stools. Furthermore, the rate of ammonia excretion via&#xD;
      feces is enhanced with PEG as compared to lactulose. In this study, we propose to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy &amp; safety profile of PEG3350 plus lactulose vs. lactulose alone for treatment of&#xD;
      ACLF. An essential understanding required with PEG usage is to consider that it exerts a&#xD;
      significant cathartic effect and thus may progress to dehydration, hypovolemia,&#xD;
      dyselectrolemia, and even blood gas abnormalities. It's also the most prominently used&#xD;
      preparative agent in patients undergoing colonoscopy, and is thus widely used in human&#xD;
      population worldwide. PEG preparations are easily available and are cost effective. Another&#xD;
      potential benefit of utilizing PEG for OHE is that it may result in decrease in the duration&#xD;
      of hospitalization, depending on the causes of the HE. By accelerating the treatment of&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy, PEG can help patients to return to normal life more rapidly and&#xD;
      decrease the direct and indirect cost of illness caused by hepatic encephalopathy. PEG, which&#xD;
      resolves decreased level of consciousness more effectively and more rapidly in the first 24&#xD;
      hours, can also help physicians to identify the other causes of altered mental status more&#xD;
      quickly and more accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the trials which have compared the efficacy of PEG in management of HE are:&#xD;

      Clinical Trial&quot; &quot;PEG led to more rapid HE resolution than standard therapy&quot;.&#xD;

      Controlled Trial&quot; &quot;The use of PEG along with lactulose in comparison with lactulose alone is&#xD;
      more effective in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cir¬rhosis&quot;.&#xD;
