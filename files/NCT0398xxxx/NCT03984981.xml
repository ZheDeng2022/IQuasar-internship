      The aim of this study is to assess and survey the quality of the process required to diagnose&#xD;
      brain death in adult patients. This study of adult patients diagnosed brain dead or suspected&#xD;
      of having brain death on the ICUs at the University Hospital Basel will be purely&#xD;
      observational.&#xD;

    <time_frame>single time point assessment at baseline (after suspected brain death)</time_frame>
    <description>the local brain death protocol ( = measurement tool) requires 1.) exclusion of the following conditions:&#xD;
shock (mean arterial blood pressure &gt; 60 mmHg, lactate &lt; 4 mmol/l)&#xD;
hypothermia (temperature &gt; 35Â°C)&#xD;
severe acidosis (pH &gt; 7.3)&#xD;
hyperosmolarity (osmolarity &lt; 320 mmol/l)&#xD;
severe electrolyte disorders (sodium &gt; 125 mmol/l, phosphate &gt; 0.3 mmol/l)&#xD;
hypoglycemia (glucose &gt; 4 mmol/l)&#xD;
hyperammonemia (ammonia &lt; 60 mumol/l)&#xD;
uremia (urea &lt; 25 mmol/l)&#xD;
prolonged effects of medication (muscle relaxants, sedatives, recreational drugs)&#xD;
severe hypothyreosis&#xD;
2.) clinical examination confirming:&#xD;
fixed pupils (dilated or mid-dilated bilaterally)&#xD;
absent vestibulo-ocular reflex&#xD;
absent corneal reflex bilaterally&#xD;
no reaction to painful stimulus bilaterally&#xD;
absence of cough and gag reflex&#xD;
absence of spontaneous breathing (apnea test)</description>
