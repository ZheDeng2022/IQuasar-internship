    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      eltrombopag in Chinese subjects with refractory or relapsed severe aplastic anemia (SAA).&#xD;
      Treatment with eltrombopag will be started at 25 mg/day and increased by 25 mg/day every 2&#xD;
      weeks according to the platelet count up to 150 mg/day. The hematological response rate will&#xD;
      be assessed at 3, 6 months and 1 year after starting the study treatment (Week 13, 26 and&#xD;
      52).&#xD;
