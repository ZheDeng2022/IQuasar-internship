      ASL-ADE will evaluate the efficacy of an ASL-interpreted diabetes educational intervention to&#xD;
      the end of improving the health literacy of the target population and addressing their&#xD;
      disparate health outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Georgia Tech's Center for Advanced Communications Policy (CACP) proposes the American Sign&#xD;
      Language Accessible Diabetes Education (ASL-ADE) project in response to the Georgia Center&#xD;
      for Diabetes Translation Research for a pilot and feasibility study on &quot;Type II translation&#xD;
      research in diabetes care and prevention.&quot; ASL-ADE will conduct an efficacy study, in the&#xD;
      Engagement and Behavior Change Core, with the long-term objective of improved health outcomes&#xD;
      for individuals who are Deaf and primarily communicate using ASL. The project will&#xD;
      demonstrate the need for diabetes educational materials to be accessible to people who are&#xD;
      Deaf and rely on ASL for clear and effective communications. ASL is a distinct language used&#xD;
      by individuals of the Deaf community and is grammatically dissimilar to English. Some people&#xD;
      who are Deaf rely primarily on ASL and have limited English proficiency. , Other people who&#xD;
      are deaf are comfortable with written English. Due to the language diversity within this&#xD;
      community, diabetes health education materials are not always accessible. For example, there&#xD;
      are low levels of general health literacy among people who are Deaf which increases risk for&#xD;
      developing chronic illnesses, , , including diabetes. As such, people who are Deaf also have&#xD;
      an increased risk for acute complications associated with diabetes. The low level of health&#xD;
      literacy among the target population is directly related to communication/language barriers,&#xD;
      as much of the health education outreach mechanisms are exclusionary because of their use of&#xD;
      audio and print materials. The hearing population can benefit from incidental learning such&#xD;
      as overhearing conversations and watching the news, even commercials. It is a form of&#xD;
      socialization that is often taken for granted by people who can hear. To address this access&#xD;
      gap, the goals of ASL-ADE are to provide accessible materials to improve health literacy and&#xD;
      (1) impact awareness of risk factors, preventive measures, and diabetes symptoms, and (2)&#xD;
      elicit the desired behavioral response to seek medical care and modify health-related&#xD;
      behaviors. The proposed project will produce a video-based ASL interpreted diabetes&#xD;
      educational intervention, and using a pretest-posttest (immediate) 30-day posttest&#xD;
      quasi-experimental design, evaluate the effect of the educational intervention on knowledge&#xD;
      about diabetes and related health behavior changes. Data will be analyzed along the&#xD;
      dimensions of age and diagnosis status to measure if variance in scores are related to age,&#xD;
      with a specific interest in transition aged (18-30) people who are Deaf with a diabetes&#xD;
      diagnosis compared to their non-diagnosed counterparts; the a priori hypothesis being that&#xD;
      given the communication barriers experienced by people who are Deaf, that no significant&#xD;
      between-group differences will be found on pretest scores based on diagnosis status.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Solomon Four-Group Design will be used to distinguish intervention effects from pretest effects. There will be two intervention groups and two control groups as detailed below:&#xD;
Intervention Group 1 will (a) take the pretest, (b) view the video intervention, (c) immediately following the intervention take the posttest, and (d) 30-days following take the posttest.&#xD;
Control Group 1 will (a) take the pretest (b) view a non-health related video approximately the same length as the video intervention, and (c) take the posttest at the 30-day follow-up posttest.&#xD;
Intervention Group 2 will (a) view the video intervention, (b) immediately following the intervention take the posttest, and (d) 30-days following take the posttest.&#xD;
Group 2 will (a) take the posttest and (b) 30-days following, take the posttest.&#xD;
For those that are assigned to the control groups, at the completion of the study they will be offered the opportunity to view the ASL-ADE intervention</intervention_model_description>
