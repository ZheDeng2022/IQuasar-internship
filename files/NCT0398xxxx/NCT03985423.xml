  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized&#xD;
      by uncontrolled hyperinflammation which may develop on the background of several clinical&#xD;
      conditions (e.g. autoimmune disease, infection, malignancy). Emapalumab (previously referred&#xD;
      to as NI-0501) is a monoclonal antibody neutralizing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a key&#xD;
      cytokine driving the inflammation and tissue damage seen in HLH. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of emapalumab in adult patients with HLH.&#xD;

      Study NI-0501-10 is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, Phase 2/3 interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolls adult patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), specifically&#xD;
      newly diagnosed patients with malignancy-associated HLH (M-HLH), and newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      previously treated patients with non-malignancy-associated HLH.&#xD;
