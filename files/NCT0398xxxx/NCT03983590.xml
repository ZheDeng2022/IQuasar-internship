  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between ANI and pain scores&#xD;
      and the correlation of ANI and anxiety scores in communicative patients in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen event with a risk of pain and/or anxiety is the first bed bath after admission.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives aim to identify ANI score thresholds which would be predictive of&#xD;
      pain and/or anxiety and to figure out some individual factors influencing ANI scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain and anxiety assessments are still challenges for palliative care teams. Anxiolytics and&#xD;
      painkillers are the usual tools but sometimes the symptoms and so the drugs to deliver are&#xD;
      difficult to distinguish. For patients with maintained communication abilities, pain&#xD;
      self-assessment using Visual Analogic Scores are the gold standard. Could pain assessment be&#xD;
      optimised thanks to ANI? ANI is used in anaesthesiology and intensive care. The ANI system is&#xD;
      based on the analysis of intra-cardiac variability. Based as an electrocardiograph with two&#xD;
      electrodes on the patient's chest, it measures the balance between&#xD;
      sympathetic/parasympathetic tones leading to a pain score. This score is predictive of pain&#xD;
      occurrence, leading to an early analgesic treatment and a better control of pain with less&#xD;
      quantity of drugs. However, some studies reported that anxiety and emotions could influence&#xD;
      ANI pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis in palliative care field, this study compares pain and anxiety VAS to&#xD;
      ANI scores before, during and after the bed bath.&#xD;

    <description>ANI scores, pain VAS and anxiety VAS scores are the basic measures which will allow the needed calculations.&#xD;
Significant results will be :&#xD;
the correlation rate of ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) scores and pain Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) scores&#xD;
the correlation rate of ANI scores and anxiety scores After a descriptive study of collected variables, the correlation rates between ANI scores and VAS scores will be calculated. Linear regression or mixt gamma will be used to assess the intra-individual variability (random effect). The effect of individual variables on the ANI scores will be tested (age, sex, diseases, medications) Considering 3 as the significant VAS threshold, ROC curves and Younden indice will be used to identify ANI scores leading to prediction of pain and/or anxiety.</description>
