      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the addition of carvedilol with standard of&#xD;
      care treatment to determine if it will improve progression-free survival in the front line&#xD;
      setting in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In addition, monitoring of&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (qRT-PCR) assay to correlate with the clinical findings.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to assess efficacy of the addition of a non-selective beta-blocker to&#xD;
      standard of care treatment in the front-line setting of glioblastoma multiforme. And to also&#xD;
      evaluate the level of peripheral glioma circulating tumor cells via TeleomeScan assay to&#xD;
      correlate disease response determined by neuro-imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline, on day 1 of cycle 1 and then after on&#xD;
      day 1 of cycle 4 and at the end of cycle 6 of adjuvant chemotherapy. in order to correlate&#xD;
      the biological effects of treatment response. The investigators will evaluate the quantity of&#xD;
      peripheral glioma circulating tumor cells and want to apply the information seen in the&#xD;
      periphery to the status of the cancer on imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will start oral carvedilol at 6.25 mg orally twice daily and will evaluate the&#xD;
      patient and vital status if they tolerate this dose at 1-2 weeks after initiation. If&#xD;
      tolerated well, will increase the dose to the maximum anticipation of 12.5 mg orally twice&#xD;
      daily. Treatment will proceed for 6 cycles and carvedilol will stop at the end of 6 cycles.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored with neuroimaging prior before chemoradiotherapy, before adjuvant&#xD;
      temozolomide and every 2 months on adjuvant temozolomide. Following the completion of 6&#xD;
      cycles of adjuvant therapy, patients will continue to receive neuroimaging on every 3 months'&#xD;
      basis until disease progression based upon standard of care.&#xD;
