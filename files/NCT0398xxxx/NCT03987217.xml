      This trial studies how well resistance training with or without creatine monohydrate&#xD;
      supplement works in improving body composition and health outcomes in patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Resistance training, with or without&#xD;
      creatine monohydrate supplement, may help to improve feelings of tiredness and overall&#xD;
      physical function in patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the change in lean mass with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance&#xD;
      training compared to resistance training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate change in other body composition variables (i.e. fat mass, fat-free mass,&#xD;
      percent body fat, appendicular lean mass) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation +&#xD;
      resistance training compared to resistance training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the change in health outcomes associated with body composition (i.e. physical&#xD;
      function, fatigue, insulin regulation) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance&#xD;
      training compared to resistance training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine associations between creatine supplementation use and changes in biomarkers&#xD;
      linked with prostate cancer progression (prostate specific antigen [PSA] and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the degree of adherence to the creatine supplementation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients complete Personal Optimism with Exercise Recovery (POWER) resistance&#xD;
      training program sessions twice weekly over 30-60 minute each for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients complete POWER resistance training program sessions twice weekly over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes each for 12 weeks and receive creatine monohydrate supplementation orally (PO)&#xD;
      4 times daily during week 1, and then once daily (QD) during weeks 2-12.&#xD;

FACIT-Fatigue Subscale Scoring Guidelines (Version 4)&#xD;
Record answers in &quot;item response&quot; column. If missing, mark with an X&#xD;
Perform reversals as indicated, and sum individual items to obtain a score.&#xD;
Multiply the sum of the item scores by the number of items in the subscale, then divide by the number of items answered. This produces the subscale score.&#xD;
The higher the score, the better the QOL.</description>
