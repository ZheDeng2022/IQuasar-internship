      The objective of the proposed study is to determine the feasibility of an Early Detection&#xD;
      program that aims to: (i) identify college students at clinical high risk (CHR) of psychosis&#xD;
      or with first episode psychosis (FEP), and (ii) efficiently link them to coordinated&#xD;
      specialty care (CSC) services for a 2nd stage screen, a clinical assessment, and appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. Preliminary estimates of effectiveness with respect to the intervention will also&#xD;
      be provided.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: Feasibility of an Early Detection Program for Early Psychosis on a College&#xD;
      Campus Long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated with poor outcomes, including&#xD;
      higher rates of suicide, hospitalization, and overall low functioning.1,2 More widespread use&#xD;
      of effective strategies to decrease DUP are needed to address the substantial discrepancy&#xD;
      between the actual (i.e., on average 2 years) and recommended time (i.e., 3 months) between&#xD;
      the appearance of psychotic symptoms and the initiation of treatment.3 Early detection (ED)&#xD;
      programs aim to decrease DUP by increasing case identification and removal of barriers to&#xD;
      coordinated specialty care (CSC).4 The most studied components of ED programs include: (i)&#xD;
      educational campaigns;5 ED response teams designed to optimize the referral processes to&#xD;
      CSC;6 and to a lesser extent, screening among high-risk groups.7 While results of studies on&#xD;
      individual ED components have been inconsistent, combinations of ED components have had more&#xD;
      success in reducing DUP.8 For example, the Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis ED&#xD;
      program, which included educational campaigns and ED teams, reported an average decrease in&#xD;
      DUP from 1.5 years to 0.5 years pre-post implementation.9,10 The evidence on community-based&#xD;
      ED programs is large and growing but very little is known about the effectiveness of ED&#xD;
      services on college campuses in the United States. This gap in the literature is problematic&#xD;
      because, with the first symptoms of psychosis being most likely to surface among college age&#xD;
      young adults, college campuses are critical locations to identify and refer individuals to&#xD;
      CSC who are at increased risk of first episode psychosis (FEP).11 We aim to address this gap&#xD;
      in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of our program of research is to improve clinical and functional outcomes&#xD;
      among college students with early stages of psychosis by reducing DUP. The objective of our&#xD;
      proposed study is to determine the feasibility of an ED program that aims to: (i) identify&#xD;
      college students at CHR of psychosis or with FEP, and (ii) efficiently link them to CSC&#xD;
      services for a 2nd stage screen and a clinical assessment among those determined eligible.&#xD;
      Students will be referred to treatment based on the results of the assessment (the University&#xD;
      of New Mexico Department of Psychiatry CSC program includes clinical services for both FEP&#xD;
      and CHR). We will also provide preliminary estimates of effectiveness with respect to the&#xD;
      intervention. Our ED program will include two organizational level changes. First, we will&#xD;
      implement universal screening (i.e., the Prodromal Questionnaire Brief12) for psychosis among&#xD;
      college students who are seeking help at a college counseling center. Second, we will&#xD;
      implement a collaborative, person-centered, and rapid referral process (&lt;2 weeks) to CSC.&#xD;
      Person-centered elements of the referral process include shared-decision making and a warm&#xD;
      handoff (i.e., transfer of care between the college counseling center and CSC with the&#xD;
      student present). The organizational-level changes will be facilitated by training, monthly&#xD;
      meetings, and a decision support tool. Our focus on these two components was informed by: (i)&#xD;
      input collected from the existing CSC clinical team, college counseling center staff, and&#xD;
      students through campus-based meetings; (ii) evidence for universal screening7 and processes&#xD;
      that facilitate rapid access to CSC9,10; and (iii) the pathways to care literature showing a&#xD;
      strong link between health system factors and extended DUP.13 We planned our intervention and&#xD;
      will evaluate it based on a combination of two theoretical frameworks: (i) Precede-Proceed&#xD;
      Public Health Model14, and the (ii) RE-AIM15. Mixed methods will be used to attain our&#xD;
      objective and achieve the following two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify whether (i) case identification, and (ii) referral-related barriers to CSC are&#xD;
           important targets for ED programs on college campuses. We will compare number of&#xD;
           referrals from the college counseling center to our CSC program in the preceding three&#xD;
           years to the number received during the 2.5 years of implementation. Also, during the&#xD;
           same time-period we will compare DUP, and pathways and perceived barriers to care&#xD;
           between college students referred from the college counseling center and students&#xD;
           presenting to CSC from other referral sources. We hypothesize that through our two&#xD;
           mechanisms of change the number of college students referred to CSC will increase. We&#xD;
           also hypothesize that, among college students referred to CSC from the college&#xD;
           counseling center compared to those presenting from other referral sources, DUP will be&#xD;
           shorter among those with FEP, and there will be fewer steps and perceived barriers for&#xD;
           students with FEP or at CHR. We will also examine psychosis literacy among referrers&#xD;
           from the counseling center. We hypothesize that psychosis literacy will increase&#xD;
           pre-post implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the feasibility of our ED program from the perspectives of various&#xD;
           stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is innovative because we will be pilot testing an ED program on a college&#xD;
      campus. At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are preliminary&#xD;
      data and knowledge on the feasibility of and effective targets for an ED program on a college&#xD;
      campus. If determined feasible and effective, our proposed ED program has a high potential&#xD;
      for widespread uptake and scale-up given the nominal costs and ease of replication of its&#xD;
      components. The brief screener will be part of the routine intake and the warm handoff/rapid&#xD;
      CSC access will be facilitated by CSC staff posing minimal burden on college counseling&#xD;
      centers. With a diverse target population in terms of ethnicity and race, our findings will&#xD;
      be generalizable to college campuses nationwide and may therefore ultimately impact DUP - a&#xD;
      major public health problem.&#xD;

    <description>Measured among those who meet criteria for first episode psychosis or clinical high risk by the Barriers to Seeking Psychological Help Scale (BSPHS). The self-report scale includes 17 items rated on a five point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Responses corresponding to 5 subscales are summed and range from either 4 to 20 or 3 to 15 with higher scores indicative of higher perceived obstacles. The five subscales include: (1) fear of being stigmatized by society, (2) trust in the mental health professional, (3) difficulties in self-disclosure, (4) perceived devaluation, and, (5) lack of knowledge.
