  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients are often accompanied by infertility. Non-obese&#xD;
      PCOS infertility is more difficult to treat than obese PCOS. The study included non-obese&#xD;
      PCOS patients who had not recovered from regular menstruation after six months of metformin&#xD;
      treatment. Half of the patients were treated with clomiphene for ovulation induction and half&#xD;
      with GnRH pulse therapy.&#xD;

      To investigate whether GnRH pulse therapy of non-obese PCOS women can improve ovulation&#xD;
      rate.The investigators plan to recruit non-obese PCOS women with abnormal GnRH pulse mode not&#xD;
      effective of metformin treatment at childbearing age. By using GnRH pulse therapy and&#xD;
      Clomiphene therapy. the investigators will intervent the participants for 3 months and to&#xD;
      compare outcome in each group.&#xD;
