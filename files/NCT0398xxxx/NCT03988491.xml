  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the last 2 decades, Tanzania made great improvements in the renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy infrastructure and services. However, renal replacement therapy remains a challenge&#xD;
      in the developing world in terms of inadequate renal registries, and limited published&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study will identify predictors of mortality, identify common causes of&#xD;
      infection and hospitalization, their incidences, prevalence, and time-to-event analysis and&#xD;
      analyze short and long-term survival of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on&#xD;
      hemodialysis in two hemodialysis centers in Dodoma, Tanzania. Furthermore, this study will&#xD;
      establish a registry to be called Tanzania Registry for Chronic Renal Failure (TRCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This will be a prospective-observational study (Patient registry). It will be&#xD;
      conducted in Tanzania, a developing world country involving two hemodialysis centers, namely&#xD;
      Benjamin Mkapa Hospital and UDOM Health center, both affiliated with the University of&#xD;
      Dodoma. Data will be collected by accessing patients' records receiving hemodialysis due to&#xD;
      ESRD in the two centers from September 2019 to September 2024. Patients' demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, investigation findings, and hemodialysis adequacy will be extracted as&#xD;
      independent outcomes. In contrast, the outcome (i.e., Death) during the follow-up will be&#xD;
      extracted as a primary dependent outcome. Binary logistic regression will be applied to come&#xD;
      up with statistically significant predictors of deaths. Other outcomes will be incidences,&#xD;
      prevalence, and time-to-event analysis of common causes of infection and re-hospitalization.&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be constructed from statistically significant predictors of&#xD;
      deaths, and patients' survival at 1, 3, and 5 years will be illustrated.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 End-stage renal disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
           End-stage renal disease is the eighteenth cause of deaths worldwide. Despite relatively&#xD;
           stable incidences, the prevalence of End-stage renal disease on renal replacement&#xD;
           therapy has doubled from 1990 to 2010, and the toll is expected to rise further in the&#xD;
           coming decade raising global health concerns. These findings are in line with the&#xD;
           reported increase in the global burden of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, the two&#xD;
           diseases accounting for the majority of etiologies for End-stage renal disease. The&#xD;
           number of diabetes patients worldwide is projected to be 300 million by the year 2025,&#xD;
           from 135 million reported in 1995. By 170%, this increase is projected to be more in the&#xD;
           developing world as compared to a 42% expected increase in the developed world.&#xD;
           Approximately a billion people every year are diagnosed with hypertension, and nearly&#xD;
           7.1 million dies from its complications, including cerebrovascular disease, ischemic&#xD;
           heart disease, and End-stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Renal replacement therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regardless of etiology, patients with ESRD would need renal replacement therapy (RRT)&#xD;
           such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or a kidney transplant. Hemodialysis and&#xD;
           peritoneal dialysis account for initial modalities of renal replacement therapies before&#xD;
           renal transplantation is opted. It is predicted that a decade from now, the number of&#xD;
           patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) to be 5439 million worldwide. Of three&#xD;
           modalities, renal transplantation is reported to be superior in terms of patients'&#xD;
           survival and quality of life. Despite kidney transplant's superiority, hemodialysis is a&#xD;
           widely utilized of three renal replacement therapy modalities. It is estimated that of&#xD;
           all patients who received RRT in 2008, eighty-nine percent (89%) received hemodialysis.&#xD;
           Despite the decrease in the population of ESRD on peritoneal dialysis in developed&#xD;
           countries, the number had doubled in ten years by the year 2008 in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Patients' survival on renal replacement therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite revolutionizing End-stage renal disease treatment, complications associated with&#xD;
           renal replacement therapy, and patients' quality of lives worth consideration.&#xD;
           Cardiovascular diseases and infections account for significant causes of deaths directly&#xD;
           related to dialyzes, while immunosuppression and comorbidities are accounting for&#xD;
           substantial causes of fatalities in ESRD patients undergone renal transplant. Other&#xD;
           factors predicting mortality include demographic factors, comorbidities, ESRD etiology,&#xD;
           nutritional status, and biochemical indices. Caucasians and patients below 45 years have&#xD;
           better survival outcomes. Ongoing evidence of inflammation, increased cardiac enzymes,&#xD;
           extreme potassium levels, low hemoglobin levels, inadequate dialysis, and lower BMI are&#xD;
           associated with poor survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 RRT challenges in developing countries:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Access to renal replacement therapies is by far different in developing from the&#xD;
           developed world. About 80% of ESRD patients receiving renal replacement therapy&#xD;
           worldwide are in developed countries only, meaning it covers only about 12% of the&#xD;
           world's population. Though not impossible, the provision of renal replacement therapy in&#xD;
           developing countries is challenging. The challenges can range from patient factors like&#xD;
           high costs and poor health-seeking behavior, the low budget allocated in&#xD;
           non-communicable diseases to technological complexity out of reach of developing&#xD;
           countries. Challenges are categorized into three levels of factors, i.e., patient&#xD;
           factors; Healthcare and policy and policy factors, and renal registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4.1 Patient' factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adding to the limited coverage of health insurance services, financially constrained&#xD;
           patients who constitute a large population of people in developing countries to find it&#xD;
           overwhelming to afford high costs of RRT. Furthermore, poor health-seeking behaviors,&#xD;
           patients' remoteness, traditional and religious beliefs hinder RRT provision.&#xD;
           Literatures report, about 30% of adults are unaware of having hypertension, more than&#xD;
           40% of people with hypertension have not initiated treatment, while 70% of hypertensive&#xD;
           patients have not had their hypertension controlled. Also, in some countries, renal&#xD;
           transplantation is less often because kidney donation is considered against religious or&#xD;
           traditional beliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4.2 Healthcare system factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In most developing countries, renal replacement therapies are centralized in that they&#xD;
           are provided at tertiary referral hospitals, which are few for the population they&#xD;
           serve, unlike in developed world where satellite hospitals reduce patients load in&#xD;
           tertiary hospitals. In Tanzania, for instance, unevenly distributed three public and&#xD;
           nine private dialysis offering hospitals serving over fifty-five million residents. In&#xD;
           central Tanzania, the first renal replacement facility, UDOM hemodialysis unit was&#xD;
           established in 2013, the first renal transplant was done in 2018, collaborating with&#xD;
           BMH, and only one kidney transplants have been done ever since. Furthermore, developing&#xD;
           countries are still struggling to vaccinate, controlling the spread, and managing past&#xD;
           and newly emerging infectious diseases. Increasing incidences and prevalence of&#xD;
           non-communicable diseases like ESRD further cripple and deem healthcare budget&#xD;
           inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4.3 Renal registries:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only a few African countries have established and organized renal registries. The&#xD;
           majority of countries have not had or have failed to maintain them due to several&#xD;
           reasons, including financial constraints. This hinders auditing of treatment and quality&#xD;
           of care delivery, as well as limiting sources of information and data for researches.&#xD;
           This has led developing countries to depend on information and data obtained from&#xD;
           developed countries to make significant health decisions. International comparisons of&#xD;
           data on ESRD patients and renal replacement therapy may not be correct in terms of&#xD;
           validity due to differences in acceptance of the treatment, patients' demographics,&#xD;
           socioeconomic burdens, and national health care policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 Research Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incidences and prevalence of ESRD have increased in developing countries including,&#xD;
           Sub-Saharan African countries. Of different RRT modalities utilized, hemodialysis&#xD;
           accounts for the majority. Unlike in developed countries, inadequate renal health&#xD;
           facilities, equipment and personnel, insufficient health budget allocation, lack of&#xD;
           renal registries, and few published literature regarding hemodialysis in developing&#xD;
           countries hinder the provision of hemodialysis to ESRD patients. Furthermore, patient's&#xD;
           factors like hemodialysis-treatment costs, poor health-seeking behavior, traditional&#xD;
           beliefs, and residency remoteness, further cripple renal replacement therapy provision.&#xD;
           Taking Tanzania into account, no renal registry is currently available in the country,&#xD;
           leave alone not having any published literature in the region to report short and&#xD;
           long-term survival analysis for ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Data collection and procedure: Patients' information regarding demographics, medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, causes of ESRD, laboratory findings, imaging results, dialysis&#xD;
      adequacy, and follow-up will be sought from electronic and physical patients' files. Other&#xD;
      information not captured by patients' hospital-record files will be collected separately by&#xD;
      the researcher using a separately-designed form. All data will be recorded in a Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel spreadsheet and stored in a registry-office computer as well as a backup in OneDrive&#xD;
      cloud storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Data Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have dependent and independent variables. The main dependent variable will be&#xD;
      death status, classified as nominal (i.e., dead or alive). Other dependent variables were&#xD;
      infection (i.e. nominal), hospitalization (i.e. nominal) and time-to-event (i.e. continuous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables consisted of both nominal and continuous. These were Age, Sex,&#xD;
      ethnicity, smoking status, marital status, education level, health insurance type, residence,&#xD;
      comorbidities, employment status, amount of income, duration of illness before referral,&#xD;
      initial pulse rate, initial blood pressure, BMI, waist-hip circumference ratio and definitive&#xD;
      diagnosis. Other were initial values of Hemoglobin level, total white blood count, platelets&#xD;
      level, thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum thyroxine, serum triiodothyronine, serum&#xD;
      electrolytes (i.e., potassium, sodium, chloride, magnesium, inorganic phosphates,&#xD;
      CO2-combining power, and anion gap), random blood glucose, Liver function tests (Alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferases, Aspartate aminotransferases, Total serum protein, serum albumin, total&#xD;
      bilirubin, and direct bilirubin and Alkaline phosphatase), muscle enzymes (myoglobin, lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase), urinalysis (albuminuria, proteinuria, urine-pH,&#xD;
      glucosuria, urine sedimentation, and 24-hours urine protein). Moreover, initial results for&#xD;
      inflammation indices (procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and&#xD;
      hypersensitive C-reactive protein), coagulation indices (prothrombin activity, prothrombin&#xD;
      time, international normalized ratio, activated partial prothrombin time, thrombin time and&#xD;
      d-dimer), lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein,&#xD;
      lipoprotein-alpha, triglycerides, and total cholesterol). Finally, chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      stage, type of dialysis catheter, and dialysis adequacy will further be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Bias Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias in this study will be addressed in two levels; study level and outcome level. A&#xD;
      potential source of bias foreseen is regarding the patient's record system. UDOM hemodialysis&#xD;
      unit utilizes both electronic (newly established) and physical-paper files, meaning every&#xD;
      patient will have two records. To eliminate typing errors during feeding data into the&#xD;
      electronic system, a registry-officer will extract data from physical-paper files followed by&#xD;
      crosschecking with the electronic database by a second registry-officer, for completeness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve data collection accuracy and efficiency, the two dedicated registry-officers will&#xD;
      receive one-month training before the official opening of participants' enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize reporting biases, STROBE checklist-tool (Strengthening the Reporting of&#xD;
      Observational Studies in Epidemiology) customized for cohort and case-control studies, will&#xD;
      be used in the report write-up of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize publication biases, this protocol is anticipated to be registered to&#xD;
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/, before enrollment of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done according to the objectives in question. Firstly,&#xD;
      predictors of deaths will be identified by binary logistic regression, using death status as&#xD;
      a dependent variable and demographics, medical history, clinical picture, and dialysis&#xD;
      adequacy as independent variables. Comparisons will be made by odds ratio between predictors&#xD;
      and results tested for statistical significance, at 95% using independent t-test. Computer&#xD;
      software SPSS will be used. Independent variables showing significant statistical&#xD;
      significance to be predicting deaths will be utilized to construct survival curves by&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years will be deducted from Kaplan-Meier curves and&#xD;
      reported. Computer software SAS will be used here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis will be conducted to depict common causes of infection and&#xD;
      re-hospitalization, their incidences, and prevalence. Time-to-event analysis for first&#xD;
      infection and rehospitalization will be constructed using Kaplan-Maier survival curves.&#xD;
      Time-to-event comparison between common causes of diseases and rehospitalization will be&#xD;
      compared using the log-rank test. All statistical analyses will be done by computer software&#xD;
      SPSS, using a 95% level of significance.&#xD;
