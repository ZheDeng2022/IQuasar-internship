      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a multiple-dosing regimen of risdiplam (Part 1)&#xD;
      and the effect of risdiplam on the PK of midazolam (Part 2) following oral administration in&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

On Day 3, the 14-day once daily (QD) treatment period with risdiplam began, with single dose administration of 2 mg midazolam again on Day 15 (1 hour after the thirteenth dose of risdiplam). The following treatment sequence was used in Part 2 of the study: Day 1: 2 mg midazolam; Days 3 to 14: 8 mg risdiplam QD; Day 15: 2 mg midazolam and 8 mg risdiplam QD; Day 16: 8 mg risdiplam QD. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were taken at defined timepoints on Day 1 for midazolam administered alone and on Day 15 for midazolam administered in combination with risdiplam.</description>

The following treatment sequence was used in Part 2 of the study: Day 1: 2 mg midazolam; Days 3 to 14: 8 mg risdiplam QD; Day 15: 2 mg midazolam and 8 mg risdiplam QD; Day 16: 8 mg risdiplam QD. Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at defined timepoints on Day 1 for midazolam administered alone and on Day 15 for midazolam administered in combination with risdiplam.</description>
          <population>The PK population consisted of all participants who had received at least 1 dose of study treatment (risdiplam or midazolam), and who had data from at least 1 postdose PK sample. PK parameters were determined based on available data.</population>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
