  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 1 Open-label Two-stage, Safety and Tolerability Study with Cancer&#xD;
      Type-specific Cohorts, Evaluating Subcutaneous Administration of Andes-1537 for Injection in&#xD;
      Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors that are Refractory to Standard Therapy or For Which No&#xD;
      Standard Therapy Is Available. Patients with unresectable solid tumors that are refractory or&#xD;
      have failed standard therapy and are deemed non-eligible or intolerant to further therapy or&#xD;
      for which no standard therapy is available will be included in 5 cancer type-specific&#xD;
      parallel cohorts. The following tumor types will be evaluated for potential inclusion in each&#xD;
      cancer type-specific cohort: gallbladder &amp; biliary tract carcinoma; cervical carcinoma;&#xD;
      gastric carcinoma; pancreatic carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, 9 patients in each cancer type-specific cohort (gallbladder &amp; biliary tract&#xD;
      carcinoma; cervical carcinoma; gastric carcinoma; pancreatic carcinoma, and colorectal&#xD;
      carcinoma) will enter stage 1. These patients will receive a dose of 400 mg of Andes-1537&#xD;
      five times per week for continuous cycles of 4 weeks that will be repeated until the patients&#xD;
      presents drug toxicity requiring treatment discontinuation or disease progression with no&#xD;
      noted clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator. The safety and tolerability&#xD;
      evaluation will be continuous during the study. The efficacy evaluation will be done by&#xD;
      analysis of the clinical objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria after patients complete the first two cycles (8 weeks).&#xD;
      Thereafter, clinical ORR will be assessed every 8 weeks. Additionally, tumor-cell activity&#xD;
      assessment will be performed in biopsy samples after the patients complete the first 2 cycles&#xD;
      (8 weeks). Tumor markers assessment according to the type of tumor will be evaluated every 2&#xD;
      cycles and at the end of study (EOS) visit. Analysis of the tumor metabolic activity through&#xD;
      the PET-CT scan and quality of life of patients through questionnaire will be evaluated every&#xD;
      2 cycles. As predefined and according with the decision of the Study Safety and Steering&#xD;
      Committee (SSC), in those cohorts where minimal clinical response criteria were met or&#xD;
      according to the decision of the SSC based on the risk / benefit analysis, considering&#xD;
      toxicity criteria and observed biological responses, 15 additional patients will be recruited&#xD;
      (total of 24 patients per cohort) for stage 2 of the study. Patients included in stage 2 will&#xD;
      receive the same treatment regimen described for stage 1 and will be followed until the&#xD;
      patients present disease progression or drug toxicity requiring treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
      Patients included in stage 2 will receive the same follow-up as patients in stage 1.&#xD;

                  (NRAS) wild type should have progressed after cetuximab or panitunumab unless&#xD;

          5. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≥ 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Have adequate organ function, confirmed by the following laboratory values obtained ≤&#xD;
             3 days prior to the first treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN (patients with Creatinine &gt; 1,5 x ULN may be&#xD;
                  considered to participate if estimated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 60&#xD;
                  mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 ULN if&#xD;
                  not on anticoagulation therapy (patients receiving anticoagulation therapy must&#xD;
                  be in the therapeutic range and stable for ≥ 4 weeks prior to study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with accessible tumor tissue, susceptible to biopsies through procedures such&#xD;
             as colonoscopy, endoscopy, endocervical biopsy (among others), are required to provide&#xD;
             consent for two biopsies throughout the study, to analyze tumor biomarkers. The first&#xD;
             tumor biopsy will be performed in these patients in a timeframe of 28 days prior to&#xD;
             the initial administration of the investigational product Andes-1537. Alternatively,&#xD;
             pathological archived material may be used, if the biopsy was collected within a&#xD;
             period of two months prior to initiation of treatment and with no anti-cancer&#xD;
             treatment performed since the collection date. The second biopsy will be performed&#xD;
             after 2 cycles (8 weeks) of treatment. If no archival material is available, and only&#xD;
             one lesion is amenable for biopsy (and is the only target lesion), the Medical Monitor&#xD;
             should be consulted for subject eligibility. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival&#xD;
             material must be suitable for biomarker assessment as described in the Laboratory&#xD;
             Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             and be using adequate contraception (defined below) prior to study entry and must&#xD;
             agree to continue to use adequate contraception from study entry through at least 6&#xD;
             months after discontinuation of study drug. Note: Options for adequate contraception&#xD;
             with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year include: tubal ligation, male sterilization,&#xD;
             hormonal implants, established proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g.,&#xD;
             two barrier methods such as a condom and cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use&#xD;
             of a spermicide. Abstinence is acceptable only if it is in line with the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception. Should a female patient or a female partner of a male patient become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in the study or within 6&#xD;
             months following discontinuation of the study drug, the patient should inform the&#xD;
             investigator immediately.&#xD;
