  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see the effect of the diabetes medicine Semaglutide&#xD;
      on a condition called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a narrowing, blockage, or hardening&#xD;
      of the arteries due to a build up of calcium. This study will look specifically at the&#xD;
      arteries involving the heart.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of semaglutide therapy on the morphology and composition of&#xD;
      non-calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque (NCP), including the progression of plaque&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;

             insulin at entry, the PI will consider dose reduction of basal insulin according to&#xD;
             A1c and risk for hypoglycemia. Patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors may be screened but the&#xD;
             agents must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 40 years of age at the time of the initial Screening visit (V1) with a diagnosis&#xD;

             least one cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, high cholesterol, family history&#xD;
             of premature heart disease or past/current smoking) or prior ASCVD (prior stroke, TIA,&#xD;

             mos. of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current Use of SGLT-2 inhibitors within 30 days of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on prandial insulin or using an insulin pump or pramlintide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant malabsorption condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of one or more severe hypoglycemic episodes within 6 months of Screening (V1)&#xD;
             or a severe hypoglycemic episode occurring during the interval between the Screening&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects experiencing a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction or stroke)&#xD;

          -  Subjects with any planned coronary revascularization or peripheral intervention&#xD;
             procedure or other cardiovascular surgery.&#xD;
