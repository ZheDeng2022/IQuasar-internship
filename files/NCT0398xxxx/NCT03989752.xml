  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) use a wheelchair as their primary mode of&#xD;
      locomotion. The prolonged non-active sitting time associated to this mode of locomotion&#xD;
      contributes to development or worsening of numerous adverse health effects affecting&#xD;
      musculoskeletal, endocrino-metabolic and cardiorespiratory health. To counter this vicious&#xD;
      circle, engaging in a walking program with a wearable robotic exoskeleton (WRE) is a&#xD;
      promising physical activity intervention. This study aims to measure the effects of a&#xD;
      WRE-assisted walking program on musculoskeletal, endocrino-metabolic and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) rely on manually propelled wheelchairs as&#xD;
      their primary source of locomotion, leading to increased non-active sitting time, reduced&#xD;
      physical activity and reduced lower extremity (L/E) weight bearing. This contributes to the&#xD;
      development or worsening of complex and chronic secondary health problems, such as those&#xD;
      affecting musculoskeletal (e.g., osteoporosis), endocrine-metabolic (e.g., hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes) and cardiorespiratory (e.g., poor aerobic fitness) health.&#xD;
      Ultimately, these health problems may negatively affect functional capabilities and reduce&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence has shown that engaging in a walking program with a wearable robotic&#xD;
      exoskeleton (WRE) is a promising intervention. In fact, WRE-assisted walking programs promote&#xD;
      L/E mobility and weight bearing (a crucial stimulus for maintaining bone strength in&#xD;
      individuals with SCI), while also soliciting the trunk and upper extremity muscles and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to measure the effects of a WRE-assisted walking program on 1) bone strength,&#xD;
      bone architecture and body composition, 2) endocrino-metabolic health profile and 3) aerobic&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty (20) individuals with a chronic (&gt; 18 months) SCI will complete 34 WRE-assisted&#xD;
      training sessions (1 h/session) over a 16-week period (1-3 sessions/week). Training intensity&#xD;
      will be progressed (i.e., total standing time, total number of steps taken) periodically to&#xD;
      maintain a moderate-to-vigorous intensity (≥ 12/20 on the Borg Scale). All training sessions&#xD;
      will be supervised by a certified physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes will be measured one month prior to initiating the WRE-assisted walking program&#xD;
      (T0), just before initiating the WRE-assisted walking program (T1), at the end of the&#xD;
      WRE-assisted walking program (T2) and two months after the end of the WRE-assisted walking&#xD;
      program (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to report continuous and categorical variables. The&#xD;
      alternative hypothesis, stipulating that a pre-versus-post difference exists, will be&#xD;
      verified using Repeated Mesures ANOVAs or Freidman Tests.&#xD;
