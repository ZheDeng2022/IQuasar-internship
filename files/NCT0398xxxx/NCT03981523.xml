    <textblock>
      Chagas disease (CD) is an endemic zoonotic disease with a significant global impact. Current&#xD;
      approved treatments for CD (benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX)) were developed in the&#xD;
      1970s with regimens and dosing intervals derived from decades-old patient series and with&#xD;
      very limited direct comparisons. Treatment recommendations vary significantly from country to&#xD;
      country and the comparative evidence-base with the current treatment regimens is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported efficacy of both drugs in patients with T. cruzi infection is variable and&#xD;
      depends on the disease stage, the drug dose, the age of patients, and the infecting T. cruzi&#xD;
      strain or genotype. Due to a therapeutic failure of at least 20% after 12 months in chronic&#xD;
      patients and the high rate of adverse events, together with the recent data that suggest that&#xD;
      we may be overdosing patients, we propose to test new dosing regimens of these two old&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lowering the frequency of drug dosing of BZN and NFX, the plasma drug levels of the&#xD;
           drugs within the therapeutic range will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of treatment with BZN or NFX may be related to the effectiveness of these&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood levels of the proposed biomarkers will significantly diminish or became negative&#xD;
           after a relatively short interval after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chagas disease (CD) is an endemic zoonotic disease caused by the protozoan parasite, T.&#xD;
      cruzi. It affects 8-10 million people in Latin America and is a worldwide public health issue&#xD;
      due to migratory flows. CD has a significant economic impact. Recently, a study showed that&#xD;
      the global costs for CD are US$7-19 billion per year, similar or even higher to those of&#xD;
      other important diseases such as rotavirus infection or cervical cancer. Treatment of chronic&#xD;
      CD (CCD) has been hampered, unlike other illnesses, by the paramount importance given to the&#xD;
      autoimmune theory of the disease that prevailed for many years. As a result, several&#xD;
      generations of health professionals were trained in the belief that CCD had no treatment. As&#xD;
      a consequence, currently, most (&gt;99%) chronically infected people are still not treated with&#xD;
      specific antiparasitic drugs, and the research and development for new, more effective drugs&#xD;
      was overlooked for many years, until very recently. Nowadays, the key role of the parasite&#xD;
      persistence in the pathophysiology of CD is recognized, as well as the need for specific&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current approved specific treatments for CD include nifurtimox (NFX) and benznidazole (BZN)&#xD;
      and the recommended dosing regimens are 5 mg/Kg/day divided into two doses (2.5 mg/Kg b.i.d)&#xD;
      given for 60 days for BZN, and 8 mg/Kg divided into three equal daily doses (2.7 mg/Kg&#xD;
      t.i.d.) given for 90 days for NFX. The efficacy of both drugs in patients with T. cruzi&#xD;
      infection is highly variable and depends on the disease stage, the drug dose, the age of&#xD;
      patients, and the infecting T. cruzi strain or genotype. Moreover, the high rate of adverse&#xD;
      events hampers their standard use in the field. Recent studies show that at the current doses&#xD;
      of both drugs, more than 70% of patients suffer mild/moderate reactions and around 10-27%&#xD;
      experience serious ones, forcing patients to stop the treatment and take appropriate&#xD;
      medications for the adverse events. Data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BZN and NFX are&#xD;
      limited and there are no recent data on PK of NFX in adults with chronic CD. Moreover, due to&#xD;
      a lack of early BMKs of therapeutic efficacy, the true efficacy of these drugs remains&#xD;
      unknown. Seroconversion using conventional serology (CS) is often long-term (~10-20 years) or&#xD;
      incomplete, and a reduction in T. cruzi-specific antibody titers often takes many years,&#xD;
      rendering the evaluation of response to treatment insensitive and lengthy, and therefore&#xD;
      impractical in clinical settings. The need for new, safer, and more efficacious drugs against&#xD;
      T. cruzi as well as early BMKS of therapeutic efficacy are the major challenges in the&#xD;
      treatment of CD, particularly in chronic adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, the investigators aim to achieve specific knowledge about the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of new dosing regimens for BZN and NFX. The proposed new regimens for these drugs&#xD;
      are based on recent data that suggest that with half of the dosing frequency the levels of&#xD;
      BZN can be maintained in the therapeutic range of this drug, which could conceivably reduce&#xD;
      the appearance of adverse events while maintaining antiparasitic efficacy. At the same time,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to evaluate whether the drug efficacy will be maintained if the&#xD;
      investigators reduce the length of treatment with BZN or NFX to 30 days. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators also plan to evaluate whether the efficacy of the treatment with BZN or NFX is&#xD;
      improved by increasing its duration to 90 days and to evaluate novel potential BMKs of&#xD;
      response to specific treatment and eventual parasitological cure in CCD patients. The&#xD;
      information obtained in this study would also allow for better-designed clinical trials with&#xD;
      drug combinations, in which NFX and BZN will have a central role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and&#xD;
      reports to the NIH, FDA, and participating institutions. The investigators of this study are&#xD;
      aware of and have agreed to abide by the principles for sharing research resources as&#xD;
      described by NIH in &quot;Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and&#xD;
      Contracts on Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Programs.&quot; Accordingly,&#xD;
      resources developed in this study will be available to the scientific community as soon as&#xD;
      the intellectual property of these resources and/or research tools have been protected or&#xD;
      disclosed in publications. In the event that a specific research tool is requested from the&#xD;
      TESEO investigators and is available, it will be shared with members of the scientific&#xD;
      community. Data sharing not applicable as no datasets have been generated and/or analysed for&#xD;
      this study yet. However, once the datasets resulting from this study are available, they will&#xD;
      be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals, national and international&#xD;
      conferences, and reports to the NIH, FDA, and participating institutions.&#xD;

    <measure>Sustained Parasitological Clearance by qPCR at End of Follow-Up (36 months)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint or measure is a binary 'cured' (success), 'not-cured' (failure) variable based on a total of eight qPCR timepoints from end-of-treatment (EOT) up to 36 months of follow-up. Each of the timepoints includes a total of three sequential qPCR examinations on blood samples collected during one visit. Therefore, for a patient to be considered &quot;cured&quot;, a total of 24 negative qPCR results should be documented.&#xD;
Blood samples to be collected at EOT (30, 60, or 90 days), and at 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months of follow-up (with a window period of +/- 7 days from 4 to 12 months and +/- 14 days from 18 to 36 months).</description>

    <description>Evaluate changes over time in blood parasitic load as measured by qPCR. The unit for the qPCR is parasite equivalents/milliliter of blood (Par. Eq./mL). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for the qPCR assay is 0.69 and 1.5 Par. Eq./mL blood, respectively.&#xD;
Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be drawn to depict the time-to-reappearance of blood parasitic load for patients who have cleared blood parasitic load at EOT (as such this is a time-to-relapse for 'success' patients) across treatment groups. A discrete-time survival model will be used to analyze this event time data.&#xD;
Change in parasite load over time assessed at days 14-17, 59-62, and EOT (30, 60, or 90 days), according to the treatment arm, and months 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 of follow-up (with a window period of +/- 7 days from 4 to 12 months and +/- 14 days from 18 to 36 months), as measured by qPCR.</description>

    <description>Evaluate changes over time in serological titers and incidence of negative seroconversion through conventional serology. Chagas disease serology commercial kit using a parasite antigenic mixture (lysate) will be used to perform this analysis. Serum samples from all timepoints in the study for each patient will be analyzed in the same ELISA plate to avoid bias due to interassay variations.&#xD;
Generalized linear mixed-effects models will be used to evaluate the conventional serological response over time. The dependent variable in both models will be a binary conventional serology parameter. The treatment arm will be included in the model as a fixed effect. The significance of the treatment covariate will be tested at the 0.05 two-sided significance level with Likelihood Ratio Test.</description>

    <description>Evaluate changes over time in the non-conventional serology biomarker (BMK) &quot;Lytic Anti-Œ±-Gal Antibodies&quot; and incidence of negative seroconversion for it, as measured by chemiluminescent (CL)-ELISA using T. cruzi tGPI-mucins as antigens. CL-ELISA unit is the Titer (T). T is the ratio of the relative luminescence units (RLU) of the tested serum to the cutoff value (CV). The CV is calculated by defining the upper prediction limit (as standard deviation, SD), multiplied by a factor according to the number of negative controls (NC) and a confidence interval of 99.5%. For each test plate in which six NC are included, the CV is defined as the NC mean plus 4.355 times the SD. A serum sample is positive when T = or &gt;1.000; negative when T = or &lt; 0.900; and inconclusive when T &gt; 0.900, &lt; 1.000.&#xD;
Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) will define how this BMK affects binary outcomes of parasite clearance. The BMK variable will be included in the model, with repeated measures.</description>

Therapeutic efficacy will imply a continuous and substantial drop in the reactivity after treatment. A substantial decrease has to be at least 40% compared with the reactivity at T0 (before treatment). A slight increase (= or &lt;20%) in the reactivity against the BMK shortly after treatment versus OD at T0 will be allowed.&#xD;

The unit of the aptamer assay is relative fluorescence unit (RFU). A Signal to Cutoff (S/CO) ratio is calculated for each clinical specimen by dividing the RFU value of the test sample by the cutoff (CO). The CO is the highest RFU value obtained from the endemic control specimens included in each run. The S/CO of a positive control included in the same run must meet pre-established acceptance criteria to be valid. A specimen with an S/CO &gt; 1.0 is interpreted as positive for the presence of the BMK (=infected). A specimen with an S/CO &lt; 1 is interpreted as negative (=non-infected).&#xD;

             defined by the inserts of the commercial biochemical kits selected to be used in the&#xD;
             present study. All treatment centers (Chagas Platforms in Cochabamba, Sucre, and&#xD;
             Tarija) are going to use the same biochemical kits. The participating clinical&#xD;
             laboratories at the Platforms (in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija) will use the Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v.5.0;&#xD;
             ttps://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcae_v5_quick&#xD;
