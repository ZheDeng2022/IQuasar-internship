  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some programs do the screening, refraction testing and provision of spectacles to children&#xD;
      entirely in the school setting (&quot;School Model&quot;). One strength of such programs is that most&#xD;
      children at school who need spectacles get them. However, sustainability is poor, because&#xD;
      spectacles cannot be sold in many schools and there may be too few refractionists to cover&#xD;
      all schools in most countries. Other programs provide vision screening at schools but refer&#xD;
      children who fail vision screening to nearby facilities for refraction and distribution/sale&#xD;
      of spectacles (&quot;Referral Model&quot;). This model's strengths include a lower demand for&#xD;
      refractionists and opportunities for the spectacles to be sold. However, a disadvantage is&#xD;
      that most of the referred children do not attend the specialist facility. One way to improve&#xD;
      this might be to enhance the Referral Model and a recent USAID review by Priya Reddy and Ken&#xD;
      Bassett showed that involving teachers in vision screening and family counseling&#xD;
      significantly increases children's use of spectacles. Therefore, at 141 schools in India,&#xD;
      involving over 42,300 children (assuming a minimum of 300 children/school), the investigators&#xD;
      will study an &quot;Improved Referral Model,&quot; with strong teacher involvement, to investigate the&#xD;
      potential benefits of combining the lower costs of the &quot;Referral Models&quot; with the high uptake&#xD;
      of the &quot;School Model&quot;. The investigators will also assess the effects of allowing parents to&#xD;
      purchase enhanced spectacles, rather than having their child use free spectacles. Children&#xD;
      will be randomized by the school to the &quot;School Model,&quot; &quot;(Improved) Referral Model&quot; or the&#xD;
      &quot;(Improved) Referral Model + Cost Recovery (sale of &quot;upgrade spectacles&quot; alongside offering&#xD;
      free spectacles. The main study outcome will be program cost-effectiveness, defined as the&#xD;
      program cost per child identified with correctable refractive error, who receives spectacles,&#xD;
      and wears them at an un-announced visit between 8 to 12 weeks after distribution. Profit on&#xD;
      spectacles sold in the &quot;Referral + Cost Recovery&quot; group will be subtracted from the program&#xD;
      costs in this study group. The groups will be compared, with and without adjustment for&#xD;
      baseline characteristics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need: The leading cause of vision impairment among children in India, and in the world more&#xD;
      widely, is an uncorrected refractive error (URE). For example, the population-based&#xD;
      Refractive Error Studies in Children (RESC) studies found that 61% of vision impairment in&#xD;
      rural children and 89% in urban children in India was due to URE and that as few as 10% of&#xD;
      rural and 35% of urban children who need spectacles actually had them. The impact of this&#xD;
      shortfall in service delivery is highlighted by recent randomized trials in Asia showing that&#xD;
      provision of spectacles significantly improves children's educational outcomes, and the&#xD;
      shortcoming in India is particularly important because India has the highest number children&#xD;
      of any other country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impact: This trial has the potential to impact on at least two of the Sustainable&#xD;
      Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations. Although interventions to prevent myopia, such&#xD;
      as topical anti-muscarinic therapy and increased time outdoors, show much promise, they are&#xD;
      not yet ready for large-scale use. Until then, school vision programs remain the principle&#xD;
      tool to address the problem of URE in India and elsewhere, and thereby improving children's&#xD;
      access to high-quality education (SDG #4) and helping to address unequal access of girls to&#xD;
      healthcare services affecting vision (SDG #5). In fact, the Indian government and many&#xD;
      private entities are already taking a very active role in school vision screening. Since the&#xD;
      onset of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) program in 2002, many millions of&#xD;
      children have undergone school vision screening, but refraction and spectacles distribution&#xD;
      has been limited and much more could be done to help. To sustain and expand these efforts,&#xD;
      more cost-effective approaches are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems with current models: Many non-governmental organization (NGO) and government&#xD;
      spectacle distribution programs in India and elsewhere use school-based vision screening,&#xD;
      refraction, and provision of spectacles. This is particularly true in poorer, rural or other&#xD;
      under-served areas. The greatest strength of such programs is that they deliver refractive&#xD;
      services and spectacles to a large proportion of children requiring them when school&#xD;
      attendance rates are high. However, sustainability is problematic: these programs usually&#xD;
      deliver spectacles for free, because their sale is not permitted in many schools. Further,&#xD;
      this model is very demanding on resources, because refractionists must travel to numerous&#xD;
      schools in their catchment area. Finally, it has been suggested that long-term compliance&#xD;
      with spectacle wear may be higher when families make at least some contribution to spectacle&#xD;
      costs, although evidence for this assertion is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, other programs, particularly those in urban or better-served areas, may&#xD;
      provide vision screening at schools, but then refer children and families failing to screen&#xD;
      to a nearby facility for refraction and distribution or sale of spectacles. The strength of&#xD;
      this model is that it is less demanding of resources (refractionists remain at their base&#xD;
      facility rather than being directly involved in outreach screening) and spectacle sales at&#xD;
      medical facilities are often more acceptable than sales in schools. Therefore, this model may&#xD;
      be more sustainable. However, program experience and research have shown up to two-thirds of&#xD;
      the referred children/families do not attend the facility that they are referred to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential superiority of optimized Referral Models and improvements for vulnerable children:&#xD;
      Recent evidence from a review by Reddy and Bassett and trials by Congdon suggest that various&#xD;
      strategies which increase involvement of teachers in the screening process (parent-teacher&#xD;
      meetings; short message service (SMS), phone call, or handwritten notes in the students diary&#xD;
      from teachers to families who do not complete referrals) can significantly increase the&#xD;
      proportion of families following up for care at an outside eye care facility. Therefore, this&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial will test an &quot;optimized&quot; model of distribution of spectacles,&#xD;
      maximizing teacher involvement, to determine whether this approach can achieve comparable&#xD;
      service uptake to fully school-based models at a greater level of cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
      High-quality, trial-based evidence that showed that optimized Referral models are both&#xD;
      low-cost and high-coverage may provide a strong stimulus to scale up refractive service&#xD;
      programs in India and other low-middle income countries (LMICs). These programs can benefit&#xD;
      millions of low-income children not currently receiving refractive services, thus improving&#xD;
      their access to classroom learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will compare two general screening methods: 1. School model and 2. Referral Model.&#xD;
      A &quot;Cost model&quot;, which is built on the Referral model but includes the sale of spectacles,&#xD;
      will also be included, as a third randomized group. In the School model, refraction occurs at&#xD;
      the school and spectacles are given to children at the school, which may yield a higher rate&#xD;
      of compliance, but is more expensive and may not be sustainable. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      Referral model, where the children are referred to be screened at the vision center or&#xD;
      service center may have lower compliance but be less expensive and more likely to be&#xD;
      sustainable. This study examines the hypothesis that greater teacher involvement in screening&#xD;
      and follow up can improve the compliance of children and families with the examination at the&#xD;
      service center in the Referral model. For this reason, the main outcome of the trial is&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness (amount spent per child who receives spectacles that improve his/her&#xD;
      vision, and which are worn at an un-announced examination visit between 8 to 12 weeks after&#xD;
      distribution). If the teacher intervention can improve compliance in the Referral model, it&#xD;
      will most likely be the more cost-effective model. If the teacher's intervention doesn't&#xD;
      increase compliance in the Referral model, then the School model is likely to be the most&#xD;
      cost-effective. Because money invested in school screening is wasted when families do not&#xD;
      comply with referral to the Vision Centre in the Referral model, compliance with a referral&#xD;
      will be the most important determinant of our main cost-effectiveness outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan Population: School children in the 6th to 10th grades (11-15 years of age)&#xD;
      at public and private, rural and urban schools with a minimum of 300 students and covered by&#xD;
      the Orbis India REACH (Refractive Error Among CHildren) program, including those located&#xD;
      nearer and further from Vision Centers, which will serve as the principle eye care facilities&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Enrolment criteria: Children in randomly-selected 6th to 10th grades in selected&#xD;
      schools with presenting visual acuity (that is, wearing spectacles if spectacles are owned at&#xD;
      baseline) &lt;= 6/9.6 (0.2 LogMAR) in either eye. Children who already own spectacles will be&#xD;
      requested to bring their spectacles on the day of screening, and children whose vision with&#xD;
      existing spectacles meets study criteria will be eligible. Exclusion criteria: Parents&#xD;
      returning the form indicating they do not wish their child to participate; no Vision Center&#xD;
      within 50 km of the child's home (a rare occurrence in the REACH network). If the child is&#xD;
      incapable of completing visual acuity screening in both eyes for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: At a refractive error prevalence of 3%, with minimum of 200 children/school, 95%&#xD;
      of children receiving spectacles in the School Model, 40% of children wearing them in both&#xD;
      the School Model and Referral Model groups at un-announced visit between 8 to 12 weeks , a&#xD;
      cost of US$1.30 per child screened in the School Model and US$0.80 in the Referral Model (all&#xD;
      assumptions based on REACH Program data), if 58.5% of families accept referral to receive&#xD;
      refraction and spectacles in the Referral Model, this would reach the same cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      as the School Model. A total of 162 schools (54 in each of three groups) across three&#xD;
      participating hospitals would be sufficient to detect significantly better cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the Referral Model if 65% of families accept referral for refraction/spectacles, which is&#xD;
      the target in our hypothesis; with a power of 90%, an alpha-error of 0.05, and an&#xD;
      intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) (a measure of how similar children are to one&#xD;
      another within schools: &quot;clustering&quot;) of 0.20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: An independent statistician having no contact with participants will generate&#xD;
      the randomization sequence using a computer system that is inaccessible until after the&#xD;
      school has agreed to join the trial. Schools will be stratified into two groups as Public and&#xD;
      private. The schools in each stratified group will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      intervention (referral models) or control group (school model) in a 1:1:1 ratio with a block&#xD;
      size of three to ensure balance. After randomization, the schools and the children in them&#xD;
      will not be masked to their allocated intervention but staff assessing data for the main&#xD;
      outcome will not know a child's group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be acquired at baseline: Child: Age, gender, spectacles ownership, presenting and&#xD;
      best corrected visual acuity in both eyes; refractive error in both eyes; the distance of&#xD;
      child's home from nearest Vision Center; brief spectacle attitude questionnaire; brief family&#xD;
      Socio-Economic Status (SES) questionnaire. Teacher: Brief questionnaire on attitudes and&#xD;
      knowledge towards spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program: Survey of all program costs for screening and distribution for each model. Our&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be from the Program rather than the societal perspective,&#xD;
      but the investigators will capture referral patient's travel cost information from&#xD;
      experienced field workers, in order to perform a sensitivity analysis of the impact of&#xD;
      including these costs. Regarding programs costs, in the School model, where the optometrist&#xD;
      team does the screening at school, the program cost will be calculated by taking the cost of&#xD;
      the primary and secondary screening, cost of the spectacles, and cost of delivering them. In&#xD;
      the Referral model, the investigators will include the cost of primary screening, secondary&#xD;
      screening at the vision centers and the cost of spectacles. In the Cost recovery model, the&#xD;
      cost recovered by selling the spectacles (the difference between retail price and cost of&#xD;
      spectacles to the hospital) will be subtracted from the program cost. School: Urban versus&#xD;
      rural, public versus private, size of the school, SES of community, and distance of the&#xD;
      school from nearest Vision Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up schedule and follow-up data: Self-reported and observed spectacle wear to be&#xD;
      ascertained at an un-announced follow-up at school between 8 and 12 weeks after distribution&#xD;
      of spectacles. The first and second participating hospitals will do 12 weeks follow-up and&#xD;
      the third participating hospital can only do 8 weeks compliance due to slower delivery to&#xD;
      their largely-rural schools. Follow-up time will be recorded and analyzed as a potential&#xD;
      factor affecting our main outcome. Additionally, the following the data for the Referral&#xD;
      groups will be collected from the referral center and verified from the children in a random&#xD;
      sample of 10% of children: Did they visit the referral center? Did they receive free&#xD;
      spectacles? Did they elect to purchase upgrade spectacles? (in the Cost Recovery group).&#xD;
      Children in the Referral groups not having received spectacles at the referral centers will&#xD;
      receive them now, and so their visual acuity with spectacles and refractive power in each eye&#xD;
      will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: An experienced project coordinator will be responsible for data collection&#xD;
      and follow-up. The project coordinator will be thoroughly trained on the completion of the&#xD;
      data collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Plan: The baseline data will be entered and stored in the database&#xD;
      (&quot;Reachsoft&quot;), which is password protected. Other data for the study will be collected and&#xD;
      entered by an external data entry operator and sent to the project manager to store it in a&#xD;
      password-protected system. The collected data will be analyzed in de-identified fashion by&#xD;
      the study statistician in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the final study data will be shared with Queen's University Belfast (QUB) under the&#xD;
      data sharing and protection outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding. The final dataset will&#xD;
      be stored in the QUB database under QUB custody. The study team will have access to the data&#xD;
      for research and analyses purposes only. Data will be stored for 5 years after the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analytic Plan: Data will be analyzed using STATA 15. The primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared between the three randomized groups using an intention to treat approach&#xD;
      with and without adjustment for the baseline child, school and teacher factors listed above.&#xD;
      Our primary outcome is cost-effectiveness (cost per child identified needing spectacles, who&#xD;
      gets and is still wearing them 8 to 12 weeks later). The investigators have two hypotheses&#xD;
      about this primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: The improved Referral models which involves teachers contacting families&#xD;
      will sufficiently improve uptake that the Referral model will be more cost-effective than the&#xD;
      School model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed analysis: Cost per child identified needing spectacles (program perspective, as&#xD;
      above), who gets and is still wearing them 8 to 12 weeks s later, compared between School and&#xD;
      Referral model. Both the referral models, where children will be referred to hospital for&#xD;
      detailed examination, will be combined and compared with the school model, where children&#xD;
      will be examined and receive spectacles at the school site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: Cost recovery from the Referral + Cost Recovery Model will make this&#xD;
      more cost-effective than either of the other models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed analysis: Cost per child identified needing spectacles, who gets and is still&#xD;
      wearing them 8 to 12 weeks later, compared between the Referral + Cost Recovery and other&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also do a stratified analysis comparing the main outcome between&#xD;
      groups at each of the 3 participating hospitals. Additional stratified analyses/balancing of&#xD;
      the main outcome between groups will be done for public versus private schools and rural&#xD;
      versus urban schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be using Latent class regression analysis and Finite mixture models to&#xD;
      analyze the main outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring: A dedicated Project Manager, Ms. Priya Reddy, will be responsible for the overall&#xD;
      planning, implementation, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation in the project. She&#xD;
      will recruit a local project assistant at each site to coordinate all activities at the&#xD;
      community level and at the base hospital and Vision Centers; ensure that appropriate planning&#xD;
      is done for organizing and implementing screening activities; and coordinate availability of&#xD;
      trained manpower, equipment, and facilities. Ms. Reddy will interact with Orbis India Project&#xD;
      Managers for the REACH program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research advisors Congdon, Gogate, and Bassett each has decades of familiarity with&#xD;
      refractive error research in children, and all have engaged in multiple research projects in&#xD;
      India. Additionally, Congdon has worked with Orbis since 2009 and is now its Director of&#xD;
      Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: Ethical approval has been received from two of the partners in India&#xD;
      and Queen's University Belfast and will be sought from the additional partner. In the two&#xD;
      Referral model groups, children who need to go to the facility to get spectacles but do not&#xD;
      do so within the 8 to 12 weeks period will receive free spectacles at closeout, so that no&#xD;
      child requiring treatment will be left untreated.&#xD;
