  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized split mouth study intended to evaluate the healing and&#xD;
      health of peri-implant mucosal tissue following placement of titanium abutments with or&#xD;
      without laser-etching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive two implants. Following placement of the two 4.2mm diameter&#xD;
      implants, one implant will receive (by randomization) a laser-etched abutment ('Laser-Lok').&#xD;
      The other implant will receive a standard, non-etched healing abutment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      sequentially subdivided into four groups (n=5) and scheduled for a biopsy of the peri-implant&#xD;
      tissues of both implants at either 8 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 weeks or 1 week after implant surgery.&#xD;
      These biopsies, about the size of a grain of rice, will be analyzed using immunohistochemical&#xD;
      and RNASeq techniques to identify molecular changes in response to laser etching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At approximately 8 weeks after implant surgery, subjects will have abutments removed from&#xD;
      both implants and digital impressions taken for final crown fabrication. At approximately&#xD;
      11-12 weeks after implant surgery, final crowns will be placed. Subjects return to clinic at&#xD;
      approximately 1 year post surgery for a final study visit to assess the peri-implant mucosa&#xD;
      surrounding both implants as measured by bleeding upon probing, probing depth and peri-apical&#xD;
      radiography.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A dental implant is an artificial &quot;root&quot; for a missing tooth made out of surgical grade&#xD;
      metals, usually titanium, which is placed in the jaw. An implant is designed to provide a&#xD;
      strong foundation for an artificial replacement tooth, also called a &quot;crown&quot;. An abutment is&#xD;
      a medical grade connector, usually made of titanium, which is placed on top of the implant,&#xD;
      and is designed to hold and connect the crown to the implant. A crown, also called a &quot;dental&#xD;
      cap&quot; is an artificial tooth, generally made of porcelain or surgical grade metals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osseointegration is defined as the fusion of a dental implant and abutment with the&#xD;
      surrounding jaw bone and is a critical step during implant therapy. During this process, the&#xD;
      titanium and bone need to become one solid structure (without any intervening inflammatory&#xD;
      mucosal tissue in between) for optimum strength and viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that use of an abutment whose surface has been etched with a laser&#xD;
      (&quot;laser-etched&quot;) will enhance the attachment of the abutment to the surrounding bone and&#xD;
      mucosal tissue and optimize healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to compare, by split mouth design, the healing process of&#xD;
      peri-implant mucosal tissue adjacent to a standard healing abutment (not laser-etched) versus&#xD;
      mucosal tissue healing adjacent to a laser-etched abutment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive two implants. One implant will receive (by randomization) a&#xD;
      standard titanium healing abutment that is not laser-etched. The other implant will receive a&#xD;
      laser-etched (&quot;Laser-Lok&quot;) abutment. Subjects will be sequentially subdivided into 4 groups&#xD;
      (n=5) and scheduled for a biopsy of peri-implant tissue at both implant sites at either 8&#xD;
      weeks, 4 weeks, 2 weeks or 1 week after implant surgery. The biopsies, about the size of a&#xD;
      grain of rice, will be analyzed using histological and molecular techniques to identify&#xD;
      cellular changes in response to laser-etching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 8 weeks after implant placement, subject will have abutments removed and&#xD;
      digital impressions taken for final crown fabrication. At approximately 11-12 weeks post&#xD;
      implant placement, final crowns will be placed. Subjects return to clinic at approximately 1&#xD;
      year post surgery for a final study visit to assess the peri-implant mucosa around both&#xD;
      implants as measured by bleeding upon probing, probing depth and peri-apical radiography.&#xD;
