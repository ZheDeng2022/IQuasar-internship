      After a screening, which consists of biopsy, physical examination, initial diffusion-weighted&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) or body computed tomography (CT) scan, blood tests and&#xD;
      case analysis on Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meeting, a patient will receive the&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy 10x 3.25 Gy with regional hyperthermia (twice a week) within&#xD;
      two weeks. The response analysis in CT or DWI-MRI and toxicity assessment will be performed&#xD;
      after at least 6 weeks. At the second MDT meeting, a final decision about resectability of&#xD;
      the tumor will be made. In case of resectability or consent for amputation, if required, a&#xD;
      patient will be referred to surgery. In case of unresectability or amputation refusal, the&#xD;
      patient will receive the second part of the treatment which consists of 4x 4 Gy with&#xD;
      hyperthermia (twice a week).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of standard treatment of unresectable and marginally resectable sarcomas.&#xD;
      Results of commonly used approaches are unsatisfactory, especially in patients who are not&#xD;
      candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to poor performance status, comorbidities,&#xD;
      radioresistant pathology or disease progression on the commonly used chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
      The addition of regional hyperthermia to irradiation and in the prolonged gap between the end&#xD;
      of hypofractionated 10x 3.25 Gy radiotherapy and surgery may allow obtaining the long-term&#xD;
      local control with the maintenance of a good treatment tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionation represents a variation of radiotherapy fractionation in which the total&#xD;
      dose is divided into fewer fractions with an increased fraction dose. Such treatment may lead&#xD;
      to additional biological effects when compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
      (eg. vascular damage, increased immunogenicity, and antigenicity). The main advantages of&#xD;
      hypofractionation are those related to the decreased overall treatment time which is more&#xD;
      convenient for both patients and physicians, increased compliance and makes the treatment&#xD;
      more cost-effective. Intriguing, such an approach may provide an additional benefit when&#xD;
      treating non-radiosensitive tumors with a low alpha/beta ratio (eg. sarcomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperthermia is a method of increasing the temperature in the tumor to damage cancer cells&#xD;
      with minimum injury to the normal cells. It should be combined with another treatment&#xD;
      modality (radio- or chemotherapy) rather than used alone. Its efficacy was proven in clinical&#xD;
      trials. The treatment tolerance is usually very good.&#xD;
