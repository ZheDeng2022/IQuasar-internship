  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare Diabetec® Fibre Grains (FIbre Grains) in a mixed meal&#xD;
      setting with Jasmine rice. This is to see whether partial replacement of white rice with&#xD;
      Fibre Grains can reduce postprandial blood glucose control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle modification, in particular adopting an appropriate dietary pattern, is generally&#xD;
      accepted as the cornerstone for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes. Consumption of&#xD;
      low GI food has shown to improve glycemic control, lipid profile and reduce systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. However, there are few dietary intervention studies attempting to change the GI&#xD;
      of food by changing the staple carbohydrates. In this study, formulated rice with special&#xD;
      fibre enrichment, Fibre Grains, was used to replace rice as the staple carbohydrates in one's&#xD;
      diet. This fibre enriched rice has been previously tested to have a lower GI than normal rice&#xD;
      while still able to preserve all the sensory characteristics of normal rice. With rice being&#xD;
      a staple to Asians, this specially formulated fibre enriched rice offers a lower GI&#xD;
      alternative to the conventional rice without affecting the people dietary preference.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in satiety rating</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale (VAS) will be presented to the participants at 0, min, 30 min, 60 min , 90 min and 120 min, to indicate how they feel in response to 4 given statements by marking an &quot;X&quot; on a 100-mm line.&#xD;
At time T=15 min, palatability of the treatment was assessed by five characteristics, from bad (0 mm) to good (100 mm). These characteristics were visual appeal, smell, taste, texture, and overall pleasantness of the meal given. Scores were determined by measuring the distance (in mm) from the let starting point of the line to the intersection of the &quot;X&quot;. Subjects did not discuss their ratings.The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC) for responses on the VAS calculated using the trapezoidal rule.</description>

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>FreeStyle ® Libre™ Flash glucose monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Singapore) was used for continuous glucose monitoring. During the study time frame, subjects were supplied with frozen meals for lunch and dinner to bring home. They were randomized to consumed 6 different combinations of food at 3 replacement levels for the rice: control (0%), 15% or 30% Fibre Grains. On day 14, subjects returned to the study facility to remove the flash glucose monitoring sensor and return the flash glucose monitoring reader. Subsequently, data was extracted from the reader by the study personnel. Glucose values were exported into Microsoft excel for visualization of the glucose trend over 14 days.</description>
