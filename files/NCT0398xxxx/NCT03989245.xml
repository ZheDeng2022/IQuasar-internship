      The purpose of this muliticentric non-interventional study is to compare the rate of&#xD;
      re-hospitalization in relation to a disruptive behaviour disorder between patients receiving&#xD;
      care in Cognitive Behavioural Unity UCC (target arm) and those who have received care in&#xD;
      Geriatric Care Unit and Rehabilitation SSR (Control arm ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Inclusion (Month 0) : Inclusion of patients admitted in UCC or in geriatric SSR units for&#xD;
      less than 8 days after obtaining of their non opposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data: Socio-educational Level, somatic and psychiatric comorbidities,&#xD;
      classification of the type of dementia, evolution of nutritional status, biology (hemoglobin,&#xD;
      creatinine, albuminemia), cognitive evaluation, treatment, pain assessment, assessment of&#xD;
      disruptive behaviour disorders, discharge modalities, assistance plan, legal protection&#xD;
      (before and after hospitalization), types of restraints, measurement of fall rates and their&#xD;
      consequences, pathology and/or symptoms observed ( incidents) during hospitalization and&#xD;
      vital status will be collected at inclusion and follow-up (1, 3 and 6 months ).&#xD;
