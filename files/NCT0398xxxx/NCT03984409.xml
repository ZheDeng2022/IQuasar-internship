  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potassium Citrate (kcit) has long been utilized by physicians to combat stone formation in&#xD;
      patients with hypocitraturia or aciduria. The most common obstacle to patient compliance with&#xD;
      this medication has historically been dosing frequency, pill size, dyspepsia, and its&#xD;
      familiar unpleasant taste. However, rampant increases in drug pricing by pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies, that have achieved market control of the drug supply, are triggering&#xD;
      non-compliance in the subset of stone patients who depend on potassium citrate therapy to&#xD;
      prevent stone recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that certain commercially available beverages contain alkali&#xD;
      citrate, of which orange juice (OJ) has the highest reported concentrations of potassium&#xD;
      citrate based on ion chromatography. Unfortunately, the high sugar content of orange juice&#xD;
      excludes its potential use as a dietary alternative to prescription potassium citrate.&#xD;
      Recently, major beverage companies (Pepsi, Coca Cola) have release low calorie beverages with&#xD;
      equivalent citrate content but with 50% less sugar. In early 2018 the investigaotrs performed&#xD;
      ion-chromatography on various consumer beverages and validated that low calorie orange juice&#xD;
      provided equivalent alkali citrate and malate to standard orange juice. The&#xD;
      ion-chromatography also showed that the total amount of alkali/liter was greater in low&#xD;
      calorie orange juice compared to crystal light lemon flavored. Currently, crystal light lemon&#xD;
      is recommended as the next best option to water for recurrent stone formers with low urine&#xD;
      volume production and hypocitraturia or aciduria&#xD;
      (https://kidneystones.uchicago.edu/price-of-potassium-citrate/). However, there is a concern&#xD;
      that the citrate within lemon based beverages is predominantly in an acidic form and thus has&#xD;
      less potential to provide clinically affective levels of alkali despite a favorable alkali&#xD;
      profile on ion chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since low calorie orange juice was identified as a potential sources for citrate and alkali,&#xD;
      the investigators wanted to show that consumption of the beverages resulted in desirable&#xD;
      changes in urinary pH and citrate levels without negatively affecting patient well-being. Ten&#xD;
      (10) volunteers drank standardized quantities of water, crystal light lemon juice, and two&#xD;
      low calorie orange juices. After 7 days of beverage consumption the participants performed a&#xD;
      24 hour urine collection which was performed by an independent laboratory. The participants&#xD;
      also maintained a diary of dietary (both food and drink) intake in addition to the trial&#xD;
      beverages. The data from the study is very promising with desired changes in urinary pH and&#xD;
      citrate levels with consumption of the low calorie orange juice. Minimal side effects were&#xD;
      noted from consuming the low calorie orange juice except with Tropicana50 based on journals.&#xD;
      It was determined that the artificial sweetener in TRP50 was the causative agent for GI&#xD;
      symptoms and headaches. The preferred brand based on volunteer diaries was a generic brand by&#xD;
      Kroger® low calorie orange beverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our data suggests that low calorie orange juice has the potential to improve compliance rates&#xD;
      with alkali therapy amongst recurrent stone formers. Stone prevention is key to reducing&#xD;
      long-term sequelae of repeat surgical intervention such as iatrogenic genitourinary&#xD;
      strictures, infections, and end organ damage. Additionally, there is a large cost savings&#xD;
      potential with stone prevention by reducing hospital stays, surgical procedures, and missed&#xD;
      work days due to stone disease. While daily low calorie orange juice may not completely&#xD;
      supplant prescription potassium citrate therapy, it may be a favorable adjunct to reduce cost&#xD;
      associated with potassium citrate and increase compliance rates by reducing the dose required&#xD;
      to clinically relevant alkalization of the urine. Our hypothesis, is that patients with&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis and evidence of hypocitraturia or aciduria who would otherwise be started on&#xD;
      potassium citrate, can achieve similar urine alkalization with 500-1000 mL of daily low&#xD;
      calorie orange juice consumption.&#xD;
