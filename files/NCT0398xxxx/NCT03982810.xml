      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) continues to be a major challenge for the health&#xD;
      care system since it incurs a substantial toll on public health and significantly inflates&#xD;
      health care costs. SSIs are now the leading cause of health care related infections,&#xD;
      complicating about 2-5 % of all surgeries(1-3). SSIs affects about 125,000 cases annually&#xD;
      accounting for nearly a million excess hospital days and just under $1.6 billion in&#xD;
      additional health care costs(4). It is estimated that half of the SSIs are preventable(5) and&#xD;
      not surprisingly, the prevention of health care-associated infections has been a priority&#xD;
      objective of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)(6) over the past several&#xD;
      years. Public reporting of SSI outcomes is now mandatory and reimbursement for management of&#xD;
      SSIs is being reduced or denied(7,8) in an effort to curb its incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the institution of stringent measures and surveillance programs, surgical registries&#xD;
      continue to show SSI rates of about 2-5%(9,10) and SSIs remain a key cause of prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, morbidity and death. The continued health care burden caused by SSI calls&#xD;
      for closer scrutiny of the current clinical practices especially pertaining to perioperative&#xD;
      antibiotic coverage. Although the institution of timely perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      is now a National Quality Anesthesia Care Measure(11), much remains to be known about&#xD;
      antibiotic redosing, weight based adjustments and completion of antibiotic infusion prior to&#xD;
      skin incision(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will seek to describe current practice of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      among MPOG institutions, and in the subset of MPOG centers contributing NSQIP data, to&#xD;
      identify the effect of appropriate guideline-based perioperative antimicrobial coverage -&#xD;
      specifically regarding selection, timing, weight-based dose adjustments, and redosing - on&#xD;
      SSI. The applicable guidelines against which adherence will be assessed are those of the&#xD;
      Infectious Disease Society of American (IDSA). To understand the effects of IDSA guideline&#xD;
      adherence, the investigators propose to utilize the American College of Surgeons - National&#xD;
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) data collection methodology, and to&#xD;
      integrate these prospectively collected outcome data from 6 centers within MPOG with&#xD;
      intraoperative anesthesia electronic health record (EHR) data available within MPOG. Beyond&#xD;
      the descriptive aim to describe current practice, our primary inferential hypothesis is that&#xD;
      adherence to IDSA guidelines regarding appropriate antibiotic selection, timely antibiotic&#xD;
      redosing, weight based dose adjustments, and appropriate timing of infusions to ensure&#xD;
      completion of administration prior to skin incision will be associated with a lower incidence&#xD;
      of SSIs when considered both individually and as a basket of practices, while controlling for&#xD;
      common confounders available within the MPOG and NSQIP datasets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Approval has been obtained from the Yale IRB for this multicenter, observational&#xD;
      retrospective study. Data have previously been collected under an umbrella IRB protocol&#xD;
      within the University of Michigan. The ACS-NSQIP methodology has been described in detail&#xD;
      elsewhere(12). For the NSQIP/MPOG portion of the study, data collected from 01/01/2011 to&#xD;
      07/04/2018 will be extracted. Since the IDSA guidelines were proposed in 02/2013, for the&#xD;
      descriptive portion of the study looking at predictors of guideline adherence, data from&#xD;
      01/01/2014 to 07/04/2018 will be extracted from the MPOG database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population All patients equal or greater than 18 years of age undergoing non-emergent&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgical procedures involving a skin incision will potentially be included in the&#xD;
      study. For the NSQIP/MPOG portion of the study, patients with conditions that could confound&#xD;
      the analysis of SSI risk factors including emergency surgery, open wound with or without&#xD;
      infection, current active infection, ongoing preoperative antibiotic therapy, missing&#xD;
      perioperative antibiotic/medication documentation, ventilator dependence within 48 hours of&#xD;
      surgery, ophthalmic surgeries, organ transplants, prior operation within 30 days, Organ&#xD;
      harvesting surgeries, and ASA 5 or 6; will be excluded. A complete list of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria from ACS-NSQIP variables is documented in Supplement 1. For the descriptive study of&#xD;
      MPOG antibiotic practices, exclusions are listed in Supplement 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following MPOG and ACS-NSQIP preoperative clinical variables will be evaluated for its&#xD;
      relationship with the occurrence of SSI in the primary inferential analyses (parentheses&#xD;
      indicate the source database): age (MPOG), male sex (MPOG), body mass index (MPOG), diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (NSQIP, current smoker within 1 year (NSQIP), severe COPD (NSQIP), congestive heart&#xD;
      failure within 30 days (NSQIP), history of myocardial infarction (NSQIP), hypertension&#xD;
      (NSQIP), history of peripheral vascular disease (MPOG), ongoing dialysis requirements&#xD;
      (NSQIP), transient ischemic attacks or stroke (NSQIP), disseminated cancer (NSQIP), loss of&#xD;
      10% of body weight in 6 months (NSQIP), steroid use for a chronic condition (NSQIP),&#xD;
      chemotherapy within 30 days (NSQIP), and ASA physical status (MPOG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body mass index will be transformed into categorical variables based upon the clinically&#xD;
      relevant World Health Organization classification scheme (&lt; 20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40,&#xD;
      40-50, and &gt; 50 kg/m2). ASA physical status will be transformed into three categorical dummy&#xD;
      variables: ASA 1, 2, 3 or 4. Diabetes mellitus will be transformed into two dummy variables:&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus requiring oral hypoglycemic treatment without insulin (NSQIP), and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus requiring insulin treatment with or without oral hypoglycemic (NSQIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative variables including hypotension, hypothermia, transfusion volume, the need for&#xD;
      vasopressor / inotrope infusion, median fiO2 and surgery duration will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intraoperative variables, hypotension will be calculated as the time in minutes below MAP&#xD;
      55mmHg. Transfusion volume will be calculated as the number of pRBC units transfused between&#xD;
      surgery start and surgery end. The need for infusions of vasopressors and/or inotropes will&#xD;
      be coded as yes/no based on the intraoperative anesthetic record and including only the need&#xD;
      for infusions without regard for isolated bolus dosing. Duration of surgery will be&#xD;
      calculated as the period of time from incision to surgery end. Median FiO2 utilized during&#xD;
      the surgeries will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are a number of studies reporting the effect of hypothermia on SSI after&#xD;
      certain surgeries, a consensus on a metric to measure the magnitude of hypothermia associated&#xD;
      with SSI is lacking. In addition, intraoperative temperature measurement is subject to&#xD;
      numerous artifacts such as dislodgment of the temperature measuring device from the patient.&#xD;
      To minimize this, the investigators will utilize the artifact reducing algorithm. After&#xD;
      artifact removal, the median temperature will be calculated for use in the relevant models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point to which the investigators will attempt to associate guideline-adherent&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis will be occurrence of a NSQIP-adjudicated SSI during the period from&#xD;
      01/01/2011 to 07/04/2018. SSIs will be a composite of superficial (only skin or subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue of the incision), deep (deep soft tissues), and organ space (any part of the anatomy&#xD;
      other than the incision, which has been opened and manipulated during the operation), as&#xD;
      provided by NSQIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition for appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis will be used per the Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and American Society of&#xD;
      Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines(13). Data on timing, dose, redosing and choice of&#xD;
      antibiotics will be obtained from MPOG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choice of antibiotics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IDSA guidelines will be utilized to assess choice of antibiotics (Supplement 3).&#xD;
      Appropriate antibiotics will be decided a priori for all the CPT codes based on these&#xD;
      guidelines. Patients will then be classified into 2 groups based on the &quot;choice of&#xD;
      antibiotics.&quot; Under certain patient/hospital-based scenarios, the guidelines recommend&#xD;
      additional antibiotics or a preference towards a certain class among the listed antibiotics&#xD;
      in the category. The plan is to consider the antibiotic choice as appropriate if any&#xD;
      antibiotic from the listed procedural category is utilized for the surgery. In case more than&#xD;
      one antibiotic is administered, at least one antibiotic or a combination of antibiotics&#xD;
      should match the recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of antibiotics with respect to surgical incision will be coded in two ways, first as a&#xD;
      continuous variable to assess the nonlinear association between antibiotic timing and&#xD;
      SSI(14). Second, timing of antibiotics will be dichotomized whether it fits in the time&#xD;
      period of existing guidelines and assessed as a categorical variable for its association with&#xD;
      SSI. For antibiotic infusions, the start of antibiotic will be considered as time of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing with respect to weight adjustment will be considered in reference to the same&#xD;
      guidelines and considered adherent if the dose of the appropriate antibiotics meets the&#xD;
      minimum requirement for weight-based adjustment. For antibiotics with weight based guidelines&#xD;
      in mg/kg (example vancomycin), dosing up to 10% below the calculated dose will be considered&#xD;
      as guideline adherent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Redosing will be considered in a dichotomous fashion and will be coded as adherent if the&#xD;
      surgical duration necessitated a guideline-indicated redosing interval and such a dose was&#xD;
      administered prior to that interval. In cases in which more than one redosing episode should&#xD;
      have occurred, redosing adherence will be considered in an all-or nothing fashion whereby a&#xD;
      lack of any timely guideline-adherent redosing will be coded as non-adherent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trends in guideline-adherent antibiotic usage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also investigate the trends in guideline-adherent antibiotic practices&#xD;
      within the MPOG database including those institutions not contributing NSQIP data as per&#xD;
      exclusions in supplement 2. This analysis will consider within-institution temporal trends&#xD;
      and will examine the possible association of candidate patient-level and institution-level&#xD;
      factors. More specifically, the rates of guideline-adherent antibiotic practices will be&#xD;
      modelled using the mixed-effects multiple logistic regression method that include fix effects&#xD;
      such as time (and polynomial terms of it if non-linearity is confirmed), institution-level&#xD;
      factors (e.g., institution type, size, etc.) and patient-level variables, and random&#xD;
      institution effect. The significance (i.e., p &lt; 0.05) of coefficient for the time variable&#xD;
      will be indicative of a significant overall trend effect. The estimates of adherence rate and&#xD;
      their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). A two-sided p-value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant, if not otherwise noted. Appropriate&#xD;
      effect sizes (e.g., odds ratio), and their corresponding 95% confidences intervals (CIs) will&#xD;
      be reported. Descriptive statistics (means, medians, frequencies) will be calculated to&#xD;
      characterize demographics and all extracted clinical variables. Histograms and box plots will&#xD;
      be constructed to evaluate distributions of continuous variables and identify potential&#xD;
      outliers. Each outlier will be reviewed carefully and verified. Categorical items with more&#xD;
      than two categories that do not exhibit sufficient variability across response levels will be&#xD;
      dichotomized accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the descriptive aim in parallel with the above analysis, practice patterns across MPOG&#xD;
      institutions in relation to antibiotic selection, dosing, redosing, and timing will be&#xD;
      examined. The distribution of adherence to these practices will be examined, and patient,&#xD;
      provider, and institution level predictors of adherence to these practices, individually and&#xD;
      as a bundle will be examined. Box-plots, caterpillar plots, and funnel plots will be&#xD;
      generated to visualize the patterns/variability of SSI rates and potentially point out&#xD;
      unusual performers at both local (i.e. institution) and national levels. In a typical funnel&#xD;
      plot, the institution-specific rates can be plotted against the institution case volume with&#xD;
      95% and 99% confidence limits (corresponding to 2 and 3 standard deviations) superimposed&#xD;
      around the rates. Institutions and providers with rates out of these limits will be marked as&#xD;
      &quot;outliers&quot; and subject to further scrutinization to under the reason for the abnormal&#xD;
      variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary inferential aim, univariate analyses will be first performed using Pearson&#xD;
      Chi-Square, Fisher's Exact Test, Student's t-test, and Mann Whitney U Test as appropriate to&#xD;
      investigate the association of all preoperative and intraoperative variables with the outcome&#xD;
      of NSQIP-adjudicated SSI. Generally, only the factors with p 0.1 from univariate analysis&#xD;
      will be included in the multivariable regression model. However, Clinical variables with&#xD;
      shown evidences affecting the risk of SSI will also be included in the model. Collinearity,&#xD;
      the linear assumption, and the additivity assumption of the predictors will be checked, and&#xD;
      nonlinear modeling of continuous predictors (e.g., infusion time) will be investigated. If&#xD;
      necessary, highly correlated groups of predictors will be examined and dimensionality will be&#xD;
      reduced either by subject matter knowledge (i.e., principal components), or by simple point&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After examining the prevalence or patterns of SSI by different center or surgery types, four&#xD;
      distinct clustered or mixed-effects multiple logistic regression models to will be developed&#xD;
      using SAS GLIMMIX procedure to associate the SSI outcome with each component of&#xD;
      intraoperative antibiotic management domains: choice, redosing interval, weight-based&#xD;
      adjustment, and time of administration criteria. Specifically, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that correct antibiotic choice, timely antibiotic dosing, redosing,&#xD;
      weight-based dose adjustments in accordance with guidelines, appropriate timing of infusions&#xD;
      to ensure completion of administration prior to skin incision will be independently&#xD;
      associated with a lower incidence of SSIs while controlling for significant confounders.&#xD;
      Random effects for hospitals and anesthesia providers will be included to address the&#xD;
      clustering of different surgical cases. The investigators will examine the modification&#xD;
      effects of other specific factors, adding them into the model as fixed factors, which include&#xD;
      patient level demographics such as age, health of patient (ASA class), BMI, gender,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, and ACS-NSQIP preoperative and other operative variables. In addition to&#xD;
      p-values, as the measures of effect sizes, the investigators will also report adjusted odds&#xD;
      ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each independent variable in the final model,&#xD;
      comparing the likelihood of SSI among patients with and without the risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dummy variable will be created that is coded as 'Yes' if adherence to guidance for all four&#xD;
      intraoperative antibiotic management domains are met or 'No' otherwise, then the association&#xD;
      of this dummy variable with the likelihood of SSI will be tested. This would help quantitate&#xD;
      a composite effect for adherence to guidance on the SSI. Finally, an overall model&#xD;
      incorporating all domains, preoperative and operative ACS-NSQIP variables, and the surgical&#xD;
      complexity score will be developed using the same methodology described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of model performance diagnosis, the amount of variability in the SSI outcome&#xD;
      that is explained by each regression model will be quantified by the adjusted-R2 statistic,&#xD;
      and the discrimination performance of the model will be assessed by C-statistic (i.e. AUC).&#xD;
      The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit (GOF) test will be used to check if the final model fits&#xD;
      the data well. A GOF P-value &gt; 0.05 will generally indicate whether a model is a good fit or&#xD;
      well-calibrated. The model will be internally validated using a resampling bootstrap&#xD;
      technique to assess for the possibility of overfitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is worth noting that there were approximately 9.3 million unique cases in MPOG as of June&#xD;
      2018 (and growing monthly), with adequate numbers of patients to develop a descriptive&#xD;
      regression model with a number of variables. Given the rule of thumb of maintaining at 10&#xD;
      events per variable (EPV) in the multivariable logistic regression model, the investigators&#xD;
      will have more than sufficient numbers to precisely estimate up to hundreds of predictors&#xD;
      (when applicable, different categories for a discrete variable is counted as a predictor) in&#xD;
      the final model. That is, overfitting will likely not a concern in the current study.&#xD;
      However, the investigators will closely evaluate the issue when developing our models. If EPV&#xD;
      &gt;= 10 can't not seem to be guaranteed, the investigators will choose to use the penalized&#xD;
      method-the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for variable (feature)&#xD;
      selection to first create a subset of potential important predictors, which then will be&#xD;
      subject to our standard variable selection procedure described above to select the final&#xD;
      specification of list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this is an observational analysis that does not involve recruitment of patients, a&#xD;
      power analysis to establish that the database can detect a clinically meaningful and&#xD;
      statistically significant difference is important. Previous SSI prevention interventions such&#xD;
      as normothermia, antibiotic prophylaxis, and chlorhexidine surgical prep have demonstrated&#xD;
      relative risk reduction rates ranging from 40% to 70%. For purposes of this power analysis,&#xD;
      it will be assumed that a conservative benefit of only 20% for each of the intraoperative&#xD;
      interventions, or the group as a &quot;bundle.&quot; Review of literature demonstrates a composite SSI&#xD;
      incidence of about 4%. A 20% relative reduction would result in an observed SSI rate of 3.2%.&#xD;
      Assuming the rate of &quot;appropriate antibiotic usage&quot; is 92%, a chi square test with a 0.05&#xD;
      two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between these two&#xD;
      rates when a total sample size is 55,637. In aggregate, the institutions presented in this&#xD;
      proposal already offer sufficient ACS-NSQIP cases with integrated anesthesia EHR data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prespecified sensitivity analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted in which an attempt to create a&#xD;
           propensity-score matched cohort of patients receiving vs. not receiving guideline&#xD;
           adherent antibiotic prophylaxis to measure the possible association of such adherence to&#xD;
           the same SSI outcome as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this sensitivity analysis, instead of regression covariate adjustment in our primary&#xD;
           analysis, the investigators will use the propensity score method for covariate&#xD;
           adjustment of potential confounding. The propensity scores will be developed to predict&#xD;
           those receiving vs. not receiving guideline adherent antibiotic prophylaxis to address&#xD;
           potential issues of selection bias. Propensity scores will be developed using logistic&#xD;
           regression models to predict exposure group using a dichotomous outcome indicator&#xD;
           variable for exposure (1= receiving guideline-based antibiotics, 0 = not receiving&#xD;
           guideline based antibiotics). The investigators will select a non-parsimonious set of&#xD;
           covariates as listed in the primary analytic modelling description. Then, patients in&#xD;
           two exposure groups will be matched, first via exact matching by institution, patient&#xD;
           age in years, and anesthesia CPT code, followed by propensity score matching using the&#xD;
           greedy method implemented in the %GMATCH SAS macro (Mayo Clinic, Rochester,&#xD;
           Minnesota),or a similar algorithm based on the proximity of individual propensity&#xD;
           scores. To assess whether appropriate balance on covariates has been achieved between&#xD;
           each grouping, standardized difference (d) for each covariate will be calculated. If&#xD;
           this meets a threshold value &lt; 10%(15) the covariates will be considered to be generally&#xD;
           well balanced. If residual imbalance exists and is deemed significant, iterative&#xD;
           recalculation of propensity scores with additional candidate covariates will be&#xD;
           considered. Last, simpler mixed-effects multiple logistic regression models of the SSI&#xD;
           outcome with the fixed effect of exposure variable will be fit. If exact matching within&#xD;
           institution causes diminution of successfully matched samples, the investigators will&#xD;
           consider removing it from the exact match and including a random institution effect&#xD;
           within the final propensity-score matched analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Considering the issue of diminution of sample size during matching, another sensitivity&#xD;
           analysis will be conducted in which the method of the inverse probability of treatment&#xD;
           (exposure) weighting using derived propensity scores will be used to compare the SSI&#xD;
           outcome between two groups (1= receiving guideline-adherent antibiotic prophylaxis, 0 =&#xD;
           not receiving), as the weighting method will enable us to include all patients into the&#xD;
           final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the case of a significant association between guideline adherent antibiotic&#xD;
           administration and SSI, we will explore how prevalent and powerful an unmeasured&#xD;
           confounder would have needed to be able to erase the observed difference. That is, model&#xD;
           the robustness of an observed association in the face of a hypothetical unmeasured&#xD;
           confounder as described by Lin, et al(16). For this analysis a model of the&#xD;
           characteristics of a hypothetical unmeasured binary confounder that could have accounted&#xD;
           for observed differences in odds of SSI between patients with adherent vs. non-adherent&#xD;
           antibiotic dosing, using a broad range of plausible values for the effect size and&#xD;
           prevalence of such an unmeasured confounder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. As mentioned above, for antibiotics with weight-based guidelines in mg/kg (example&#xD;
           vancomycin), dosing within 10% of the calculated dose will be considered as guideline&#xD;
           adherent. To assess the correlation of dosing of these antibiotics on SSI, also a&#xD;
           sensitivity analysis will be performed by categorizing patients within 25% of the&#xD;
           calculated dose in guideline adherent group.&#xD;

        Data will be accessed from the international consortium known as the Multicenter&#xD;
        Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), which consists of 44 active sites from the US and&#xD;
        Europe that is based out of the University of Michigan where primary IRB oversight exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The present project will also include the analysis of data from the MPOG consortium of data&#xD;
        from some participating institutions' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program&#xD;
        (NSQIP). Those data have been merged with MPOG data. The population will be limited to&#xD;
        datasets for subjects undergoing general vascular surgery for the last 7 years.&#xD;
