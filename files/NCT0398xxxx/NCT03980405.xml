      Combination Therapy with Drug and Diet for Induction of Remission in Mild to Moderate Active&#xD;
      Pediatric Ulcerative colitis: A Single Blinded, International Randomized Controlled Trial&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 12 week, single blinded Randomized controlled trial (RCT) in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with mild to moderate Ulcerative Collitis (UC) comparing 5ASA (recommended dosing&#xD;
      60-75 mg/kg/day; minimum 2.5 maximum 4 grams/day) with fiber restriction for 6 weeks followed&#xD;
      by free diet (Group 1) to 5ASA with Ulcerative Collitis Diet (UCD) for 6 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      the step down UCD for the next 6 weeks. Inclusion criteria will include children weighing&#xD;
      &gt;30kg, Pediatric Ulcerative Collitis Activity index (PUCAI) 10-45, no treatment with 5ASA&#xD;
      (treatment naïve or treated with thiopurines for example) or currently treatment with 5ASA&#xD;
      but &lt;2 grams/day, ages 10-19 years, with disease extent E2-E4 by the Paris Classification.&#xD;
      Patients on thiopurines may continue existing dose if dose is stable for at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are Patients with acute severe colitis (ASC) in the previous year,&#xD;
      requiring oral or intravenous steroids in the previous 3 months, or patients treated with&#xD;
      Anti- Tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFa) regimens. Importantly, there is no placebo arm and&#xD;
      both groups will be treated with the same currently recommended drug at currently recommended&#xD;
      doses; the only difference between groups being their diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be remission defined as PUCAI&lt;10 at week 6; Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be response defined as a drop in PUCAI of 10 or remission at week 6, sustained steroid&#xD;
      free remission week 12 and improvement in mucosal healing by Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic&#xD;
      Index of Severity (UCEIS) at week 12 as well as safety and tolerance. Intolerance will be&#xD;
      defined as patients stopping the diet because of refusal to continue diet. Patients will be&#xD;
      seen at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 12. PUCAI will be assessed at every visit; fecal calprotectin will&#xD;
      be assessed at baseline, week 6 and 12. Sigmoidoscopy to assess mucosal healing will be&#xD;
      performed at week 12 in patients who had a baseline colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
      Sigmoidoscopies to evaluate healing will be voluntary and patients will not be excluded if&#xD;
      they do not consent to have a follow up sigmoidoscopy.&#xD;
