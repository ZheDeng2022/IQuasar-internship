  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical bleeding is a major source of morbidity in cancer patients, and ramifications&#xD;
      can include need for transfusion, increased length of hospital stay, unexpected return to the&#xD;
      operating room, or even death. Current guidelines support that all cancer patients who&#xD;
      require surgical procedures receive post-operative blood thinners to minimize risk for blood&#xD;
      clots in the legs or lungs, known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), but these medications have&#xD;
      an unfavorable risk/benefit relationship among patients at low risk for VTE. The proposed&#xD;
      work will pilot a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to critically examine&#xD;
      the role of de-implementation of current guidelines that mandate blood thinning medications&#xD;
      among cancer patients at low risk for VTE who require surgical procedures; the pilot trial&#xD;
      will allow optimization of the design of a future pragmatic multicenter trial, which&#xD;
      ultimately would maximize patient safety after surgical procedures for cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-operative bleeding is a major source of morbidity in cancer patients who require&#xD;
      surgery. Bleeding is a primary concern for oncology providers because of its short and long&#xD;
      term implications, including unanticipated transfusion, increased length of hospitalization,&#xD;
      unexpected return to the operating room, or even death. Despite these risks, current&#xD;
      guidelines for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients support&#xD;
      provision of anticoagulant medications to all post-operative patients. New data shows that&#xD;
      current practice has an unfavorable risk/benefit relationship for the majority of cancer&#xD;
      patients who need surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer and need for a surgical procedure are two recognized risk factors for VTE-this has&#xD;
      created the perception that post-operative anticoagulants are appropriate for all cancer&#xD;
      patients. Current VTE prevention guidelines are largely geared toward the &quot;average&quot; cancer&#xD;
      patient who requires surgery, based on aggregate data from large groups of surgical patients&#xD;
      who have similar procedures. Emerging data demonstrates that the 2005 Caprini score, a&#xD;
      patient-centric VTE risk calculator, can identify a 15-fold variation in post-operative VTE&#xD;
      risk among the overall surgical population. Data from our National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network (NCCN) center support that the Caprini score is valid specifically in oncologic&#xD;
      surgery patients, and that 50% of cancer patients have Caprini scores ≤6 with an expected&#xD;
      90-day VTE rate of less than one percent. Our preliminary data show that low risk Caprini ≤6&#xD;
      patients have a substantial increase in bleeding (3.8% vs. 1.8%) but have no demonstrable VTE&#xD;
      risk reduction when post-operative anticoagulants are provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines that mandate chemical prophylaxis for cancer patients who have surgical&#xD;
      procedures require a strategy that has no proven benefit and may produce a bleeding-related&#xD;
      harm. The proposed work will utilize current paradigms of individualized VTE risk&#xD;
      stratification to identify cancer surgery patients at low risk for VTE and will examine the&#xD;
      impact of de-implementation of chemical prophylaxis in this low risk population The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled pilot trial at the&#xD;
      Huntsman Cancer Institute, which is an NCCN site. The trial will identify surgical patients&#xD;
      at low risk (Caprini score ≤6) for post-operative VTE and will randomize them to standard of&#xD;
      care (enoxaparin 40mg once daily) versus placebo for the duration of inpatient stay. The&#xD;
      trial will generate critical, real world data from an NCCN site that quantifies patient&#xD;
      eligibility &amp; patient and provider willingness to randomize as well as expected 90-day&#xD;
      attrition and event rates. This pilot study would generate trial-specific infrastructure and&#xD;
      experience while providing data necessary for sample size calculations for a larger pragmatic&#xD;
      trial to fully examine the impact of chemical prophylaxis de-implementation in cancer surgery&#xD;
      patients at low risk for VTE.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        The five most common cancers in the United States, based on National Cancer Institute data,&#xD;
        include breast, lung, urologic (prostate and bladder), colorectal, and melanoma. As such,&#xD;
        we will conduct our work in these patient populations to make our results as generalizable&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Expected post-operative stay will be at least 23 hours (these are the patients for&#xD;
             whom current guidelines mandate provision of chemical prophylaxis, but for whom&#xD;
             current clinical practice demonstrates equipoise.)&#xD;
