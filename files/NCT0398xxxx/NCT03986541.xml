      Observational study investigating the relationship between tumour amphiregulin, epiregulin&#xD;
      and epithelial growth factor receptor expression and response to anti-EGFR agents in advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-EGFR agents, cetuximab and panitumumab are approved by NICE for the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of patients with RAS wild-type (RAS-wt) advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC). However&#xD;
      RAS-wt status is not sufficient to guarantee anti-EGFR benefit. Differential tumour&#xD;
      expression of the EGFR ligands, amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG), as well as the&#xD;
      EGFR receptor itself, are putative predictive biomarkers for response to anti-EGFR agents and&#xD;
      may therefore help better identify patients who will benefit from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the utility of tumour AREG, EREG and/or EGFR expression, alone or&#xD;
      in combination, as predictive biomarkers for response to anti-EGFR agents in aCRC. The&#xD;
      investigators will develop a scoring system and categorical cut off points to differentiate&#xD;
      AREG/EREG/EGFR positive and negative cases and correlate these with response to therapy as&#xD;
      assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Progression Free Survival (PFS) Secondary endpoints: Overall Survival (OS),&#xD;
      Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) Finally, the investigators will&#xD;
      utilise digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to automate as far as&#xD;
      possible the process of evaluating AREG/EREG/EGFR status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the investigators will monitor the costs of implementing the test and time&#xD;
      taken to derive test results in order to facilitate cost-effectiveness calculations and&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of delivering the test in future routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentre UK observational cohort study (retrospective and prospectively recruited&#xD;
      cohorts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with RAS-wt aCRC who received or are receiving standard care palliative treatment&#xD;
      with an anti-EGFR agent and chemotherapy of physician's choice. Within the retrospective&#xD;
      cohort, patients who received single agent anti-EGFR therapy under previous Cancer Drugs Fund&#xD;
      criteria will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy proven advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma at time treatment commenced (either&#xD;
           inoperable metastatic disease at diagnosis or inoperable recurrent disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged 18 or over at time treatment commenced&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient has received or has consented to receive treatment with cetuximab or&#xD;
           panitumumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage I, II or III colorectal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RAS mutant disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible for potentially curative surgery (prospective cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underwent cancer surgery subsequent to anti-EGFR therapy (retrospective cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unable to provide informed consent (with the exception of patients in the retrospective&#xD;
           cohort who have passed away)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is observational and does not involve participants undergoing any study-specific&#xD;
      investigations or treatments. Results of routine investigations and outcomes from standard&#xD;
      care with an anti-EGFR agent will be collected from medical notes and, for the prospective&#xD;
      cohort, during routine clinic appointments. Date of death will also be recorded. Initial and&#xD;
      follow-up radiological and clinical assessments will occur as per local standard practice.&#xD;
      Previously obtained pathological specimens will be retrieved for immunohistochemical analysis&#xD;
      of tumour AREG, EREG and EGFR expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment During Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will observe outcomes from standard first line palliative treatment of RAS-wt&#xD;
      aCRC. In line with current NICE guidelines, such treatment will involve physician's choice of&#xD;
      panitumumab or cetuximab in combination with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) Where RAS mutation status is only&#xD;
           available after commencement of treatment and the anti-EGFR agent is therefore commenced&#xD;
           in cycle two, patients may still be recruited to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that most patients in the retrospective cohort will have received current&#xD;
      standard first line palliative treatment of RAS-wt aCRC as above. However, patients who were&#xD;
      treated with single agent anti-EGFR therapy under previous Cancer Drugs Fund criteria may&#xD;
      still be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from 480 patients will be collected for the retrospective cohort and 480 patients will&#xD;
      be recruited to the prospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS will be calculated from date of commencing treatment to date of progression or death from&#xD;
      any cause (whichever is sooner). Time of progression will be determined clinically or&#xD;
      radiologically by the participant's treating oncologist. Where the anti-EGFR agent was&#xD;
      commenced in cycle 2, the definition of the start of treatment will remain cycle 1 day 1 of&#xD;
      palliative chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key secondary endpoint analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS will be determined from date of commencing treatment to death. ORR is the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with documented radiological complete or partial response on first follow-up imaging&#xD;
      whereas DCR is the proportion of patients with either radiologically stable disease or a&#xD;
      response. For the purpose of these analyses, those without follow-up imaging will be assumed&#xD;
      to have progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AREG/EREG/EGFR expression will be assessed as a continuous variable and using dichotomous&#xD;
      classifiers ('high' and 'low') for each marker individually and in combination. Subgroup&#xD;
      analyses will be performed for BRAF mutation positive tumours, primary tumour location (right&#xD;
      versus left colon, and rectum) and previous surgery (primary excised versus in situ). Within&#xD;
      the retrospective cohort, those who received single agent anti-EGFR therapy under previous&#xD;
      Cancer Drugs Fund criteria will be analysed separately.&#xD;
