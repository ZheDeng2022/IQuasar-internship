    <description>For patients who present with discrete measurable lesions&#xD;
ORR = number of patients who achieve CR or PR divided by the total number response-evaluable patients&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).&#xD;
PFS is defined from date on treatment to the earliest date of progression, death, or last follow-up and progression or death are events of interest for PFS.</description>
