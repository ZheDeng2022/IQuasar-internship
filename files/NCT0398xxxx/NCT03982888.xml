  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and possible effectiveness of deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens in children with autism spectrum disorder and&#xD;
      treatment-refractory, repetitive self-injurious behavior. Six (6) patients will be recruited&#xD;
      and enrolled in this pilot study and study duration for each patient will be one (1) year.&#xD;
      All will undergo surgical implantation of the Medtronic DBS system and will receive&#xD;
      stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (2 electrodes per patient).This will be an open,&#xD;
      non-blinded, non-randomized, pilot, phase I trial.Expected study duration is 36 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, non-blinded, non-randomized, pilot trial for safety and efficacy of deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation for medically-refractory, repetitive self-injurious behaviours in children&#xD;
      with ASD (i.e. secondary stereotypies). The trial will be conducted in compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be identified and recruited the&#xD;
      Neurosurgical Clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children. The study will proceed according to&#xD;
      the schedule laid out below, and both patients and treating team will be aware of all&#xD;
      treatment parameters at all times. Six (6) subjects will be enrolled in this study and study&#xD;
      duration for each patient will be one (1) year. Previous phase I trials of DBS in psychiatric&#xD;
      and Alzheimer's Disease populations have utilized 6 subjects per surgical target. Such a&#xD;
      number is sufficient to demonstrate initial safety, as well as feasibility and clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R; Bodfish, Symons, Parker &amp; Lewis, 2000) will be used to measure changes in repetitive behaviour pre and post intervention. The following sub-scales will be used:&#xD;
Steretyped behaviour subscale&#xD;
Self-injurious behaviour subscale&#xD;
Compulsive behaviour subscale&#xD;
Ritualistic behaviour subscale&#xD;
Sameness behaviour subscale&#xD;
Restricted behaviour subscale&#xD;
All subscales are scored from 0-3 as follows:&#xD;
0 = behaviour does not occur&#xD;
behaviour occurs and is a mild problem&#xD;
behaviour occurs and is a moderate problem&#xD;
behaviour occurs and is a severe problem Where a higher number indicates increased repetitive behaviour.&#xD;
Subscores are totaled and then an overall score is calculated.&#xD;
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

0= not relevant&#xD;
somewhat relevant&#xD;
very relavant Where a higher number indicates increased self-injurious behaviour. Questions are scored and totaled.&#xD;
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

0= not at all a problem&#xD;
the behaviour is a problem but slight in degree&#xD;
the problem is moderately serious&#xD;
the problem is severe in degree Where the higher number indicates the behaviour is problematic. Questions are scored and totaled.&#xD;
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman, Price, Rasmussen,1989) will be used to measure changes in the amount of interference of unwanted ideas, images, or impulses pre and post intervention. The scale is scored from 0-4, where 0 represents minimal interference and 4 represents substantial interference. Questions are scored and totaled.&#xD;
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>

    <description>The Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL v. 4.0) will be used to measure changes in self-reported quality of life pre and post intervention. The statements are scored from 0-4 as follows:&#xD;
0= it is never a problem&#xD;
1 = it is almost never a problem 2= it is sometimes a problem 3 = it is often a problem 4= it is almost always a problem Where a higher score indicates the statement is a problem. All items are scored and totaled.&#xD;
Measure will be completed at baseline (pre-surgery), weekly from weeks 2-6 post-surgery, bi-weekly from weeks 7-10 post surgery, monthly from weeks 11-51 post-surgery, and 1 year post surgery.</description>
