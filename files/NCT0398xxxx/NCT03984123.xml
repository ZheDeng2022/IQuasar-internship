      The investigators are going to examine 270 patients within 48h of STEMI with primary&#xD;
      percutaneuous intervention. The investigators utilise either a double -with a 15- min&#xD;
      intervening interval-, or a single ischemic stimulus by brachial cuff inflation of both arms&#xD;
      at 200mmHg for 5 min to cause remote conditioning (RIC) or no cuff inflation. Each ischemic&#xD;
      stimulus is followed by a vascular function assessment, with a final assessment 25 minutes&#xD;
      after the second cuff deflation. All patients utilising a cuff inflation procedure also&#xD;
      undergo a sham cuff inflation. The investigators measure: a) the perfusion boundary region&#xD;
      (PBR-micrometers) of the sublingual arterial microvessels as a marker of endothelial&#xD;
      glycocalyx thickness to assess vascular permeability, b) the carotid-femoral pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity (PWV). At baseline (T0) and the last vascular assessment (T3) The researchers also&#xD;
      measure microRNA-144,-150,-499 (cardioprotective action), -21, and -208 (remodeling stimuli)&#xD;
      expression, nitrate- nitrite (NOx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) plasma levels. Moreover, the&#xD;
      investigators are going to perform an echocardiographic study at 1 and 2 years after the&#xD;
      recruitment to investigate whether the left ventricular function differs among the 3 study&#xD;
      arms (2 RIC protocols and no intervention)&#xD;

      The present study is a prospective, randomized trial conducted at the Second University&#xD;
      Department of Cardiology in Attikon University Hospital. A two hundred seventy patients with&#xD;
      STEMI , within 48 hours after primary PCI are randomized in two remote conditioning (RIC)&#xD;
      protocols or no intervention other than standard treatment (control group). The first&#xD;
      protocol utilizes two ischemic stimuli by brachial cuff inflation of both arms at 200 mmHg&#xD;
      for 5 minutes, separated by 15 minutes, after a baseline vascular function assessment (T0).&#xD;
      Each ischemic stimulus is followed by a vascular function assessment (T1, T2), with a final&#xD;
      assessment 25 minutes after the second cuff deflation (T3). The second protocol is identical&#xD;
      with the first, except for the omission of the second ischemic stimulus. Both protocols are&#xD;
      preceded by a sham conditioning procedure, by way of cuff inflation omission after their&#xD;
      placement around the ordinary brachial position. The RIC protocol will be also performed in&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers. Blood samples are drawn at baseline (T0) and at the termination of&#xD;
      each protocol (T3). All patients are in sinus rhythm, while exclusion criteria include Killip&#xD;
      class&gt;2 during the index event, administration of nitrates, history of previous known&#xD;
      coronary artery or other cardiovascular disease, previous PCI or coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      surgery (CABG), as well chronic inflammatory and systemic disease. Furthermore, The&#xD;
      investigators are going to conduct a two - year follow up in order to asess a) changes in&#xD;
      left ventricular contractility via estimation of Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume( LVESV)&#xD;
      by echocardiography study b) changes in endothelial glycocalyx and arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness is assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) using arterial&#xD;
      tonometry (Complior, Alam Medical, Vincennes, France); normal values &lt;10 m/s. PWV is&#xD;
      calculated as the distance between the carotid and femoral arterial pulse palpation site,&#xD;
      divided by the transit time between waves (m/s). All measurements are performed by the same&#xD;
      examiner, who is blind to the ischemic protocol exploited (intra-observer variability=5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perfusion boundary region (PBR) of sublingual arterial microvasculature (diameter span&#xD;
      from 5 to 25 μm) is measured using Sidestream Darkfield imaging (Microscan, Glycocheck,&#xD;
      Microvascular Health Solutions Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The PBR is the cell-poor&#xD;
      layer, resulting from the phase separation between the flowing red blood cells (RBC) and&#xD;
      plasma on the microvessel luminal surface. The PBR includes the component of glycocalyx that&#xD;
      does allow cell penetration. Thus, an increased perfused boundary region (PBR) is consistent&#xD;
      with deeper penetration of erythrocytes into glycocalyx, indicating a loss of glycocalyx&#xD;
      barrier properties and is a marker of reduced glycocalyx thickness. This constitutes a&#xD;
      standardized, reproducible, operator-independent method of assessing arterial glycocalyx, and&#xD;
      is thus proposed as a means to endothelial integrity evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malondialdehyde (MDA) is determined spectrophotometrically with a commercial kit (Oxford&#xD;
      Biomedical Research, Rochester Hills, Mich, colorimetric assay for lipid peroxidation;&#xD;
      measurement range 1-20 nmol/L; 3.39% and 4.75% intra-assay and inter-assay variability&#xD;
      respectively). IL-6 is measured by a high-sensitivity immunoassay [human IL-6 Quantikinine&#xD;
      (high sensitivity)], that detects values as low as 0.094 (intra-assay variability &lt;5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (Mirs) are small, single stranded, non-coding RNA molecules comprising 19-25&#xD;
      nucleotides that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression in response to cellular or&#xD;
      environmental stimuli [38]. Their non-invasiveness and stability in serum allows prompt&#xD;
      estimation of their expression using archived serum samples. Specific MiRs have been&#xD;
      implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and IRI. MiR-144 serves as a pivotal&#xD;
      RIC mediator, while miR-150 and miR-499 inhibit apoptosis and fibrosis in the setting of&#xD;
      animal models of myocardial IRI [40, 41]. In addition, miR-21 has been demonstrated to reduce&#xD;
      infarct size and early left ventricular (LV) remodelling after IRI in rats. On the contrary,&#xD;
      miR-208 exerts deleterious effects by way of hypertrophy and adverse remodelling induction .&#xD;
      Serum miRNA are obtained from samples using the NucleoSpin miRNA Plasma Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL&#xD;
      GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Duren, Germany) according to instructions of the manufacturer. The expression&#xD;
      patterns of the miRNAs tested and a housekeeping gene, U6sn, were quantitatively assayed&#xD;
      using reverse transcription and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (RT-PCR). Stem-loop complementary DNAs (cDNAs) are synthesized using looped reverse&#xD;
      transcription primers specific for each miRNA. Reverse transcription and quantification is&#xD;
      performed with the Mir-X™ MicroRNA Quantification Kit (Clontech Laboratories, USA) according&#xD;
      to the instruction of the manufacturer using Roche Light Cycler Fluorescence Quantitative PCR&#xD;
      System (ABI, USA). All the samples are amplified in triplicate and each experiment was&#xD;
      repeated three times to confirm reproducibility. The fold change in expression level is&#xD;
      calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. The primers for PCR are:&#xD;

      by-products of NO metabolism, nitrate (NO¬3-) and nitrite (NO2-) have recently been shown to&#xD;
      function as recycling substrates in a process of NO regeneration , which is independent of&#xD;
      the classic L-arginine-NO-synthase (NOS) pathway. This is of particular importance in the&#xD;
      setting of myocardial ischemia, as the latter cascade is progressively deactivated in hypoxic&#xD;
      environments. Thus, the nitrate-nitrite (NOx) pool should be perceived as a reservoir of NO&#xD;
      bioactivity that complements NOS in states of low-oxygen tension. The concentration of&#xD;
      nitrate/nitrite in blood plasma is determined using Griess reaction with a commercially&#xD;
      available kit (Cayman's Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit 780001) as we have described&#xD;
      previously. Each plasma sample is ultrafiltered through a 10kDa molecular weight cut-off&#xD;
      filter (Pall Nanosep® centrifugal device with Omega membrane, Sigma Aldrich: Z722065). The&#xD;
      filters are pre-rinsed with Ultrapure water prior to ultrafiltration of the plasma. Then,&#xD;
      500μL of plasma is centrifuged for 30 minutes at 14.000xg at 4οC. 40μL of the filtrate are&#xD;
      used for the determination of nitrate/nitrite , the Griess reagents are added and the&#xD;
      absorbance of each well was measured at 540nm using the reader Infinite 200 PRO series&#xD;
      (Tecan). The concentration of nitrate/nitrite is determined with a nitrate/nitrite standard&#xD;
      curve respectively using Graph Pad prism version 7 (Graph Pad Software, Inc.) according to&#xD;
      the manufacturer's instructions. The results are expressed in μmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators are going to perform an echocardiographic study at 1 and 2 years&#xD;
      after the recruitment to investigate whether the left ventricular function differs among the&#xD;
      3 arms of the study (2 RIC protocols and no intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATA v.11 and SPSS v.22 are used to analyse the data. The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to&#xD;
      examine whether the data are normally distributed, whereas the Levene test is used to examine&#xD;
      the homoscedasticity of the data. All non-parametric variables are compared using the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test for comparisons between baseline and post-intervention values and are&#xD;
      transformed into ranks for multivariate analysis. In all analyses, the researchers use two&#xD;
      tailed tests with p&lt;0.05. The investigators use parametric (Pearson r) and non-parametric&#xD;
      (Spearman rho) correlation coefficients to examine cross-sectional associations. Analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) for clinical and biological data is performed to test the differences among&#xD;
      groups and all non-parametric variables are transformed into ranks before entering the&#xD;
      analysis using a previously published methodology . ANOVA (general linear model, SPSS 22,&#xD;
      SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) for repeated measurements is applied for (a) measurements of the&#xD;
      examined vascular function and biochemical markers (at T0, T1, T2, and T3 for the former and&#xD;
      at baseline and termination of protocol for the latter) with the parameter of time used as a&#xD;
      within-subject factor, and (b) to test differences among the 2 RIPost protocols (single-&#xD;
      versus double-inflation) and sham procedure using a model including age, sex, BMI,&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension, concomitant medical treatments, MI location,&#xD;
      myocardial enzymes, and number of diseased coronary vessel (&gt;70% stenosis) as covariates. The&#xD;
      interaction between the study groups and the covariates included in the model are also&#xD;
      examined, while the F and p values of the interaction between time of measurement of the&#xD;
      examined markers and study groups are also calculated. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction is&#xD;
      used when the sphericity assumption, as assessed by Mauchly's test, is not met. Post hoc&#xD;
      comparisons are performed with Bonferroni correction. A p-value of&lt;0.05 is considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant. Inter- and intra-observer variabilities (%) of vascular and&#xD;
      biochemical markers are calculated as the SD of the differences between the first and second&#xD;
      measurements, and are expressed as a percentage of the average value in 30 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
