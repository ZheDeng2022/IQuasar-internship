      The objective of this clinical evaluation is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to&#xD;
      36 months) outcome of the MOTIV™ Bioresorbable Scaffold (Reva Medical) in a controlled&#xD;
      prospective investigation for the treatment of patients with rest pain or minor tissue loss&#xD;
      (CLI) due to the presence of lesions of max 100mm in length at the level of the&#xD;
      below-the-knee arteries.&#xD;
