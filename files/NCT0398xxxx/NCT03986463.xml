  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observation study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      starting either cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. It will assess changes in&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the days following the initiation of treatment, as well as&#xD;
      longitudinal monitoring, to assess the dynamics and value of ctDNA in stage III-IV NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of three cohorts of patients initiating a new treatment for their NSCLC.&#xD;
      The cohorts of (1) patients starting concurrent chemotherapy and radiation for stage III&#xD;
      NSCLC (2) patients with advanced NSCLC starting cytotoxic chemotherapy (with or without&#xD;
      pembrolizumab) (3) patients with advanced NSCLC starting palliative radiation therapy. This&#xD;
      study aims to study the changes in ctDNA levels following a new treatment in lung cancer&#xD;
      patients and to explore if the diagnostic utility of ctDNA testing is improved immediately&#xD;
      following treatment when tumour cells are actively dying. It will also examine the changes in&#xD;
      ctDNA levels and mutational analysis longitudinally.&#xD;
