    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of alemtuzumab when given together&#xD;
      with itacitinib in treating patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Itacitinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with alemtuzumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving itacitinib and alemtuzumab may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia compared to standard of&#xD;
      care treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of itacitinib in combination with alemtuzumab in&#xD;
      patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the event free survival (EFS) in patients (pts) with T-PLL treated with&#xD;
      itacitinib in combination with alemtuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate response complete remission (CR), complete remission without blood count&#xD;
      recovery (CRi), or partial remission (PR) (CR/CRi or PR) of itacitinib in combination with&#xD;
      alemtuzumab in patients with T-PLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the single-agent activity of itacitinib in pts with T-PLL. IV. To assess the&#xD;
      time to response, response duration, and overall survival (OS) in pts with T-PLL treated with&#xD;
      the combination of itacitinib and alemtuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the effect of itacitinib on STAT5 phosphorylation in pts with T-PLL II. To&#xD;
      explore the association of pretreatment somatic mutations and the dynamics of STAT5&#xD;
      phosphorylation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYCLE 1: Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and alemtuzumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27 in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYCLE 2 AND BEYOND: Patients receive itacitinib PO QD on day 1-28 and alemtuzumab IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients who achieve a response (CR/CRi or PR) may receive itacitinib for up to&#xD;
      8 additional cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the latest version of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The number and percent of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized according to intensity and drug relationship, and categorized by System Organ Class and preferred term by dose level/Part. All reported AEs that occur after signing informed consent will be included in the analysis of all reported AEs. Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation of study drug will be tabulated. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, and range as appropriate. Categorical values will be summarized using the number of observations and percentages as appropriate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate (complete remission[CR], complete remission without blood count recovery [CRi], or partial remission [PR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The response rate (CR/CRi or PR) will be estimated for all patients along with the 95% confidence interval. Patients with missing or no response assessments will be classified as non-responders. The association between response and patient and clinical characteristics will be examined by Wilcoxon's rank sum test or Fisher's exact test. The response rate will be compared between different subgroups (e.g. mutation types) by Fisher exact test.</description>

    <measure>Time to response</measure>
