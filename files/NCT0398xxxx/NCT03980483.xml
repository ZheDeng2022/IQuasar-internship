    <textblock>
      This study [contRAst 1 (201790: NCT03980483)] is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double&#xD;
      blind study to assess the safety and efficacy of GSK3196165, in combination with methotrexate&#xD;
      (MTX), for the treatment of adult participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to MTX. The study will consist of a&#xD;
      screening phase of up to 6 weeks followed by a 52-week treatment phase in which participants&#xD;
      will be randomized in a ratio of 6:6:3:1:1:1 to receive GSK3196165 150 milligrams (mg)&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) weekly, GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, tofacitinib capsules (cap) 5 mg twice a&#xD;
      day or placebo (three arms, each placebo arm will have 12 weeks placebo followed by 40 weeks&#xD;
      active treatment) respectively, all in combination with MTX. Participants who, in&#xD;
      investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with GSK3196165, may be&#xD;
      included in the long-term extension study [contRAst X (209564: NCT04333147)]. For those&#xD;
      participants who do not continue into the long term-extension study, there will be an 8 week&#xD;
      safety follow-up visit following the treatment phase.&#xD;
