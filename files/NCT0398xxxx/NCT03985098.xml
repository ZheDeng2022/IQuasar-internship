      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a telephone motivational&#xD;
      interviewing intervention by pharmacy students in enhancing adherence to angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (ACE/ARBs) among&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and hypertension in a Medicare advantage plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are&#xD;
      highly recommended for patients with both diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN), and their&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing macrovascular and microvascular complications of DM is well-documented.&#xD;
      Poor adherence remains a significant barrier to achieving full effectiveness and optimal&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. This study aims to develop innovative group-based trajectory models to&#xD;
      identify patients with similar ACE/ARB medication filling behavior among patients with&#xD;
      co-morbid HTN and DM. The proportion of days covered (PDC), often used as an adherence&#xD;
      measure, reduces complex patterns of longitudinal observations into a single value that&#xD;
      cannot adequately depict different adherence experiences. Group based trajectory models are&#xD;
      designed to identify patients with similar longitudinal patterns while capturing the dynamic&#xD;
      nature. A motivational interviewing (MI) pharmacy student telephone intervention will then be&#xD;
      customized by the identified trajectories and tested to demonstrate effectiveness in&#xD;
      enhancing adherence. In pilot work, the investigator's team has demonstrated improvements in&#xD;
      adherence through a pharmacy student telephone MI intervention. Pharmacy students have the&#xD;
      knowledge base and training to provide comparable services to pharmacists at a lower cost. MI&#xD;
      fosters behavior change by setting desired goals and promoting self-efficacy in a supportive,&#xD;
      collaborative way. The objectives are to 1. Develop group-based trajectory models to identify&#xD;
      patients with similar medication filling behavior patterns among patients enrolled in a&#xD;
      Medicare advantage plan and 2. Customize an MI pharmacy student telephone intervention by the&#xD;
      adherence patterns identified, and demonstrate the benefit of the customized intervention in&#xD;
      improving adherence. Phase 1 of the project will be a retrospective analysis of 12 month&#xD;
      refill data to determine patient adherence patterns. Phase 2 will be a prospective study&#xD;
      among non-adherent patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the customized intervention&#xD;
      (n=500). The students will contact patients assigned to the intervention group and follow a&#xD;
      protocol using the Ask-Provide-Ask approach of MI given the patient adherence pattern for a&#xD;
      tailored education. Monthly follow-up calls will be carried out for 6 months. Adherence&#xD;
      during the 6 and 12 months post-intervention will be evaluated for the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups as PDC as well as a categorical variable. Chi-square and t-tests will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate the intervention effect. Multivariable multiple and logistic regression will be&#xD;
      carried out in case of any significant differences in baseline characteristics. Implementing&#xD;
      this project will provide students a unique MI training as a new way of communicating with&#xD;
      patients. The training is further strengthened by PhD students trained in research design and&#xD;
      statistical analyses to assist in the automated data analysis. The project will formulate a&#xD;
      strong adherence research team at University of Houston that will be instrumental in&#xD;
      implementing customized innovative interventions to improve medication adherence and&#xD;
      subsequent health outcomes.&#xD;
