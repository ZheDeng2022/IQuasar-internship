    <textblock>
      This study was designed to identify high platelet reactivity (HPR) who might have in-stent&#xD;
      thrombosis in unruptured aneurysm with intracranial stent placement with light transmittance&#xD;
      platelet aggregometry (LTA). For HPR patients, higher ischemic stroke rate maybe occurred,&#xD;
      and we hypothesis that dose adjustment of aspirin and clopidogrel based on LTA monitoring&#xD;
      maybe reduces the rate of ischemic stroke compared to a standard strategy after intracranial&#xD;
      stent implantation at early periprocedural period and 1 month follow-up period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the patients of unruptured intracranial aneurysms with stent placement, standard&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy (100mg aspirin + 75mg clopidogrel) is considered to be the most&#xD;
      effective antiplatelet regimen in reducing ischemic complications. However, despite the use&#xD;
      of standard antiplatelet therapy, a number of patients continue to have ischemic events. A&#xD;
      hypothesis is that high platelet reactivity (HPR) patients identified by platelet function&#xD;
      test have higher ratio of the ischemic events, and dose adjustment of HPR patients reduces&#xD;
      the rate of the ischemic complications at early periprocedural period and follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The study aim to evaluated the superiority of the strategy of platelet function&#xD;
      test(Monitoring Arm) with the modified strategy in HPR patients compared to the standard&#xD;
      strategy (Conventional Arm) whether reduce the primary endpoint after intracranial stent&#xD;
      implantation at early periprocedural period (7 days) and 1 months follow-up period.&#xD;
