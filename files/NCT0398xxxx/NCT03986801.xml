  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Created in 1998, PASS departments are mostly intrahospital structures providing primary care&#xD;
      to vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the project will be to measure the impact of a multidisciplinary PASS&#xD;
      benefiting from outpatient pharmaceutical interviews on the rate of unplanned&#xD;
      rehospitalization of patients in precarious situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the implementation of such a device will also be measured on other indicators&#xD;
      of major interest in the course of care of the precarious patient: average lengths of stay,&#xD;
      emergency room, improved continuity of treatment, quality of life of the patient related to&#xD;
      his health, medication compliance, effective accessibility to social rights, qualitative&#xD;
      improvement in the use of care, medico-economic efficiency of the intervention compared to&#xD;
      existing practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be multicenter: 6 centers spread throughout France (Marseille, Paris, Nice,&#xD;
      Toulouse, Poitiers and Bayonne).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Created in 1998, PASS ( Permanence d'Accès aux Soins de Santé) departments are mostly&#xD;
      intrahospital structures providing primary care to vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This facility allows medico-social care for people in precarious situations, for a return to&#xD;
      the common health system. However, the individual difficulties to resort to care, complicated&#xD;
      by a system of health sometimes excluding, and the dissociation of the activity of dispensing&#xD;
      treatments from the action of the PASS can lead to breaks of treatments, can cause&#xD;
      pathological complications, or cause re-hospitalization. More particularly, the methods of&#xD;
      dispensing drugs and medical devices for outpatients in precarious situations are very&#xD;
      heterogeneous depending on the institutions and the geographical distance of the PASS or the&#xD;
      PUI: discharge with orientation towards the PUI and PASS; dispensing via the unitcare by a&#xD;
      doctor or social worker; discharge without medication, without orientation and only with a&#xD;
      prescription,... Actually, in some cases, it is highlighted the question of the renewal of&#xD;
      treatments and the rupture of these and therefore the breakdown of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of original and innovative practices, including pharmaceutical maintenance and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary monitoring (social, medical and pharmaceutical) until the social rights are&#xD;
      obtained, is therefore necessary to promote a reliable and effective system for the care of&#xD;
      precarious patients, but also to reassure the patient in his care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the project will be to measure the impact of a multidisciplinary PASS&#xD;
      facility, integrating pharmaceutical interviews, for outpatient, on the rate of unscheduled&#xD;
      rehospitalization of patients in precarious situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the implementation of such a facility will also be measured on other indicators&#xD;
      of major interest in the care pathway of the precarious patient: average lengths of stay,&#xD;
      emergency room, improved continuity of treatment, quality of life of the patient related to&#xD;
      his health, medication compliance, effective accessibility to social rights, qualitative&#xD;
      improvement in the use of care, medico-economic efficiency of the intervention compared to&#xD;
      existing practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized between a non-interventional group (standard management&#xD;
      of patients according to hospital) or interventional group (setting up a PASS pharmaceutical&#xD;
      interview on the day of discharge from hospital and multidisciplinary follow-up until social&#xD;
      rights are obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist in the overall medico-social care of the patient in precarious&#xD;
      situation by the Multidisciplinary PASS facility, at discharge, including a specialized&#xD;
      pharmaceutical interview (PI) while dispensing the treatments; then monthly PI, concomitantly&#xD;
      with medical consultations and social follow-up until the end of the study or opening of&#xD;
      social rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the non-interventional group, the discharge of the precarious patient will be implemented&#xD;
      according to the usual methods of each hospital: the unitcare will have the mission of&#xD;
      refering the patient towards the medico-social PASS, and of ensure that the patient is in&#xD;
      possession of the necessary documents for the dispensing of the treatments; but this one will&#xD;
      not benefit from PI.&#xD;
