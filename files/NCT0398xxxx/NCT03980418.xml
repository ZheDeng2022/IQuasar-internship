  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The semiconductor (cadmium-zinc-telluride, CZT) cameras significantly increase detection&#xD;
      sensitivity in Single Photon Emission Computer Tomoscintigraphy (SPECT)(1) . The clinical&#xD;
      routine applications of these cameras are today mainly limited to myocardial tomoscintigraphy&#xD;
      with CZT dedicated cameras. Several studies whose one was done in Hospital of Nancy, made it&#xD;
      possible to demonstrate a good diagnosis agreement between conventional cameras and&#xD;
      semiconductor cameras in this indication, with better image quality obtained with&#xD;
      semiconductor cameras (2). Today, so-called &quot;wide field&quot; semiconductor cameras are available&#xD;
      in the clinic and allow for any type of SPECT examination. A comparative study between&#xD;
      conventional and semiconductor cameras has been conducted for bone scintigraphy, and shows&#xD;
      diagnostic superiority with this new type of camera (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the new VERITON-CT ™ (Spectrum Dynamics Medical) camera has 12 mobile CZT-based&#xD;
      detectors positioned around the patient allowing tomographic acquisitions and focusing the&#xD;
      acquisition on the organ studied. This camera has a sensitivity of detection higher than that&#xD;
      of conventional cameras and thus reduces the activity injected into the patient and / or the&#xD;
      recording time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study has compared the two types of cameras in nuclear neurology and in&#xD;
      particular, for the SPECT DaTSCAN ™ imaging of the pre-synaptic dopaminergic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DaTSCAN ™ exam is used in clinical routine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or related diseases when in doubt with an&#xD;
           essential tremor (4) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if suspicion of Lewy body disease, if in doubt with Alzheimer's disease (5). If the&#xD;
           interpretation of DaTSCAN ™ exam is first visual, the quantification may increase&#xD;
           accuracy diagnosis (6). Also, the database creation specific to each type of camera is&#xD;
           recommended(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostically relevant informations and the&#xD;
      quantitative analysis provided by the DaTSCAN™ SPECT, recorded on the conventional camera and&#xD;
      recorded on the semiconductor camera VERITON-CT™&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study is monocentric, interventional, non randomized, with minimal risk and&#xD;
      constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients going to the nuclear medicine department for a DaTSCAN exam will be able to&#xD;
      participate in this study if they understood study informations given by the physician and if&#xD;
      they signed the inform consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In first, patients will have a DaTSCAN™ SPECT on a conventional camera and after, they will&#xD;
      have DaTSCAN™ SPECT on VERITON-CT™ camera with two records: one in focus striatum mode and&#xD;
      the second in focus brain mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attenuation correction will be made with the computer tomography (CT) recorded at the&#xD;
      same time as the SPECT (SPECT/CT)&#xD;
