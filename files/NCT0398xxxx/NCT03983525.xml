      Objective: To evaluate the effects of goji berry intake for three months on macular pigment&#xD;
      ocular density (MPOD) between 45 and 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if goji berry intake for 90 days, 5 times per week, will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  result in favorable changes in macular pigment optical density (MPOD), as measured using&#xD;
           heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP), in adults aged from 45 to 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impact the carotenoid distribution in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will change the fermentation capacity of the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the intake of 28 grams of goji berry for 90 days, 5 days&#xD;
      per week will significantly increase MPOD after three months, compared to baseline values. In&#xD;
      contrast, the investigators hypothesize that a dietary supplement of lutein and zeaxanthin&#xD;
      will not alter MPOD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prior to enrollment, all volunteers that meet the initial inclusion and exclusion based on a&#xD;
      telephone interview will be asked to participate in a clinical screening visit, which will&#xD;
      assess the subject's overall health, and whether the individual meets the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. To determine normal eye health, subjects will provide a statement from&#xD;
      their optometrist verifying normal functioning. The study will be conducted in the Ragle&#xD;
      Human Nutrition Research Center on the UC Davis campus. The participants will be consented&#xD;
      into the study. For those who are not familiar with goji berry, a sample tasting will be&#xD;
      provided. In addition, each volunteer will be asked to complete a diet and health habits&#xD;
      questionnaire. The first study visit will begin on the same day after the screening visit is&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, controlled, parallel arm design with two groups: goji berry&#xD;
      or lutein/zeaxanthin (L/Z) supplement. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      two groups using a block design that will place an approximately similar number of males and&#xD;
      females in each group. The randomization will be conducted by an online tool called Research&#xD;
      Randomizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include three study visits over a 90 days period, with study visit one (SV1)&#xD;
      occurring at day 0, SV2 conducted at day 45, and SV3 conducted at day 90. The first study&#xD;
      visit will occur immediately after consent is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on group assignment, the participant will be provided with either a 45-day supply&#xD;
      of goji berries or L/Z supplements which contains 6 mg of lutein and 4 mg of zeaxanthin and&#xD;
      will be asked to consume the given items five days per week. After the 45-day intake period,&#xD;
      the participants will return to the lab for SV2 and then be given a new 45-day supply of&#xD;
      items to consume until the end of the 90 day test period (SV3). Participants will complete a&#xD;
      log in order to verify compliance. Dietary recall will be collected by using the Automated&#xD;
      Self-Administered 24-hour dietary assessment (ASA24) web-based tool between each SV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPOD measurement - MPOD will be assessed by the psychophysical method of HFP technology&#xD;
      (Macular Metrics, Providence, RI). Participants will watch a 20 minutes long video of a&#xD;
      description of HFP. After adapting to the dark for seven minutes, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to rest their head on a chin rest and look at a blue background field for three minutes.&#xD;
      Prior to each test, the light intensity from each wavelength will be calibrated with a&#xD;
      photodiode. The flicker frequency is selected for each subject based on preliminary tests of&#xD;
      flicker sensitivity. The observer's task is to eliminate or minimize the flicker by turning a&#xD;
      dial that changes the intensity of the 460-nm light. They will be asked to do this when&#xD;
      looking directly at the flickering light and also when looking at a fixation point so that&#xD;
      the stimulus can be presented in the periphery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin carotenoid measurement - the carotenoid content in the skin will be measured through a&#xD;
      finger-scanning device using reflection spectroscopy (this process does not capture&#xD;
      fingerprints) called the Veggie Meter (VM). This noninvasive method of measuring skin&#xD;
      carotenoid levels has been validated to reflect plasma carotenoid concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath Hydrogen measurement - the participant will be asked to do one short exhalation (about&#xD;
      2-3 seconds) into a collection tube. Their breath sample will be analyzed for hydrogen and&#xD;
      methane that are produced by fermentation of carbohydrates (including fiber) in the digestive&#xD;
      tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance will be assessed verbally and through self-reported logs indicating consumption of&#xD;
      the product. Dietary recall will be collected by using the Automated Self-Administered&#xD;
      24-hour dietary assessment (ASA24) web-based tool during each study arm, and a weekly log&#xD;
      book of digestive tract symptoms, which will record a typical symptom such as bloating, gas,&#xD;
      intestinal cramps, and loose stools.&#xD;
