    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study. Part 1 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab plus&#xD;
      carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab versus placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel&#xD;
      followed by placebo; and Part 2 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab plus&#xD;
      carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab plus niraparib versus placebo plus&#xD;
      carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by placebo in participants with recurrent or primary advanced&#xD;
      (Stage III or IV) endometrial cancer. Part 1 has completed enrollment, and Part 2 is open for&#xD;
      enrollment. Both Parts consist of a Screening Period, Treatment Period, an End of Treatment&#xD;
      (EOT) Visit, a Safety Follow-up Visit, and a Survival Assessment Period. In Part 2,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:2 to receive either carboplatin/paclitaxel/placebo or&#xD;
      Dostarlimab/carboplatin/paclitaxel followed by Dostarlimab/niraparib or placebo iv/oral&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
