      This study evaluates whether intravitreal autologous CD34+ stem cell therapy is safe,&#xD;
      feasible and potentially beneficial in eyes with vision loss from central retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion (CRVO). Half of the participants will receive immediate cellular therapy followed&#xD;
      by sham therapy 6 months later, while the other half will receive immediate sham therapy&#xD;
      followed by cellular therapy 6 months later. Participants will be followed for a total of 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase I/II prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-masked clinical&#xD;
      trial is to determine whether intravitreal autologous CD34+ stem cell therapy is safe,&#xD;
      feasible and potentially beneficial in eyes with vision loss from central retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion (CRVO). Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) is a leading retinal vascular cause of vision&#xD;
      loss in the elderly. CD34+ stem cells in human bone marrow are mobilized into the circulation&#xD;
      in response to tissue ischemia for tissue revascularization and repair. Since local delivery&#xD;
      of CD34+ stem cells benefits ischemic tissue, intravitreal delivery of CD34+ stem cells may&#xD;
      benefit vision and retinal ischemia in eyes with RVO. A pilot clinical trial has shown no&#xD;
      major safety or feasibility concerns using intravitreal autologous CD34+ bone marrow stem&#xD;
      cells. In this proposed expanded phase I/II study, 20 participants (20 eyes) with persistent&#xD;
      vision loss from CRVO will be enrolled and followed for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to immediate cell therapy/deferred sham therapy or&#xD;
      immediate sham therapy/deferred cell therapy. At month 6, the cell treated eye will receive&#xD;
      sham treatment and the sham treated eye will get cell therapy. The cellular therapy involves&#xD;
      bone marrow aspiration, isolation of CD34+ cells from the aspirate under Good Manufacturing&#xD;
      Practice (GMP) conditions, and intravitreal injection of isolated CD34+ cells. The sham&#xD;
      therapy involves a sham bone marrow aspiration with penetration of the skin but no&#xD;
      penetration of the bone and a sham intravitreal injection without penetrating the eye. The&#xD;
      participant, examining ophthalmologist, visual acuity examiner, photographers and OCT,&#xD;
      perimetry, and electroretinography (ERG) technicians will remain masked to study treatment&#xD;
      assignment for study duration. A comprehensive eye examination with ETDRS best-corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA),&#xD;
      autofluorescence, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, microperimetry, and&#xD;
      electroretinography will be performed at baseline and serially. A subset of participants with&#xD;
      good fixation on microperimetry and clear media on exam and commercial-grade OCTA and who&#xD;
      give consent will have ultra-high resolution cellular retinal imaging using research-grade&#xD;
      OCT and OCTA and adaptive optics-OCT at baseline. Participants with high quality images will&#xD;
      have repeat imaging at 1 month after stem cell treatment, with at least 2 of the participants&#xD;
      randomized to the deferred cellular therapy arm also having imaging 1 month after sham&#xD;
      therapy. For all participants in whom at least 1.5 million CD34+ cells are harvested, about&#xD;
      200,000 cells will be set aside for post-release flow cytometry characterization to determine&#xD;
      the composition of the CD34+ enriched final product in terms of hematopoietic versus&#xD;
      angiogenic stem cells based on cell surface markers (i.e., CD133(+)/CD45(+)/CD34(+) vs&#xD;
      CD31(+)/VEGFR-2(+)/CD45(-)/CD34(+)). The long-term objective is to determine whether&#xD;
      intravitreal autologous CD34+ cell therapy can minimize, or reverse vision loss associated&#xD;
      with retinal ischemia without compromising safety.&#xD;

    <description>Mean change from baseline of visual acuity letter score at Month 6. The measure is calculated by subtracting the baseline visual acuity letter score from the month 6 visual acuity letter score. The participant is refracted for best corrected vision, and then reads single letters from the ETDRS charts using a visual acuity light box at a 4 meter distance (or 1 meter for participants with sufficiently reduced vision) according to a specific algorithm. A letter score is provided that ranges from 0 (unable to ready any letters) to 100. A visual acuity letter score of 85 corresponds to a visual acuity of 20/20 as a Snellen equivalent.</description>
