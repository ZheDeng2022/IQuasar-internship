  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of supplementation with two different probiotic&#xD;
      products (Lactobacillus reuteri strains) on the intestinal barrier function, gut health and&#xD;
      stress symptoms in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete screening&#xD;
      procedures to evaluate their eligibility for the study (visit 1). Study participants will&#xD;
      undergo two baseline visits (visits 2 and 3, 3 weeks apart) to account for individual&#xD;
      variations, and will then be randomly assigned to 6-week intake of one of two Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri strains, or placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1 (stratified by sex). Participants will attend&#xD;
      a study visit three weeks into the intervention (visit 4) and at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      (visit 5, week 6). The intestinal permeability will be assessed using a standardized&#xD;
      multi-sugar test at visit 2, visit 3, visit 4, and at end of intervention (visit 5). Blood,&#xD;
      saliva and faecal samples will be collected at visit 2-5. In addition, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms will be recorded at those visits (using Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-IBS,&#xD;
      GSRS-IBS; IBS severity scoring system, IBS- SSS). Quality of life using the 5Q-5D-5L and&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores will also be recorded at those visits. In&#xD;
      addition, at visit 3 and visit 5, the IBS-Quality of life (IBS-QoL) and the Perceived Stress&#xD;
      Scale (PSS) will be completed. In a daily diary, participants will record stool frequency and&#xD;
      consistency from visit 2 until end-of-study visit 5. Dietary habits of the patients will be&#xD;
      assessed via a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 3-day food diary before the&#xD;
      intervention (between visit 2 and 3).&#xD;
