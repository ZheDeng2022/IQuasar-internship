  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rational : A lot of people in the province of Quebec suffer from Parkinson's disease and they&#xD;
      are mostly vulnerable because they gradually lose their autonomy with the worsening of the&#xD;
      disease. Physiotherapy was proven to be an effective treatment method for these patients.&#xD;
      However, accessibility to care remains a major issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This project aims to establish the clinical feasibility of a Tai chi&#xD;
      rehabilitation program through tele rehabilitation to patients suffering of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology : This pilot study will be conduct with a pre/post-test device. Therefore, to&#xD;
      reach the objective, an evaluation will be done before the intervention and directly after&#xD;
      the end of the 12 weeks program. Also, the obstacles encountered during the interventions&#xD;
      will be noted in a logbook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: This is a priority research because its aim is to develop a care system that is&#xD;
      efficient and accessible for a target population. The results of this study will confirm the&#xD;
      possibility to put in place a telerehabilitation program who could reach, on a larger scale,&#xD;
      more patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
