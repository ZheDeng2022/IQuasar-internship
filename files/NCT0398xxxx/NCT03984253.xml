  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases. Asthma is characterized by chronic airway&#xD;
      inflammation and associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow&#xD;
      obstruction. The variability of airway obstruction is triggered by different factors that&#xD;
      lead to a variety of different asthma phenotypes and subtypes. The various classification&#xD;
      options for asthma (e.g. severity, by the predominantly existing inflammation or according to&#xD;
      triggers), reflect its heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite improved therapeutic methods, the prevalence and morbidity of asthma has increased&#xD;
      worldwide in the last years. Asthma is a serious and growing global health problem with&#xD;
      around 300 million people affected, independent of age or sex. Estimated 250'000 people die&#xD;
      prematurely each year due to their asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the SAPALDIA-study, the prevalence of Asthma in Switzerland is approximately 2-8%.&#xD;
      Asthma is considered as a major factor in healthcare cost with up to CHF 1.2 billion per&#xD;
      year. Asthma is not only a financial burden to a system; it affects the individual Quality of&#xD;
      life negatively. Often health care professionals and patients underestimate the severity of&#xD;
      the disease and overestimate asthma control. Severe asthma should not be equated with&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma. To reach a satisfying asthma control numerous factors need to be taken&#xD;
      into consideration. Severe asthma is often associated with a high risk of frequent, severe&#xD;
      exacerbations, which can even lead to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several severe asthma cohorts and registries already exists and are reported in the&#xD;
      literature. The aim of such registries is in general data collection and a better&#xD;
      understanding of the disease. So far, most epidemiological studies on severe asthma are&#xD;
      cross-sectional with no follow up measures. Only a few studies did repeated measures using&#xD;
      the same methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5% of all Asthma Patients suffers from severe asthma. These patients require&#xD;
      systematic assessment and specialist care in dedicated respiratory centres. These centres&#xD;
      have a key role in improving the outcome for severe asthma patients. At the same time they&#xD;
      act as gatekeepers to ensure appropriate access to new, expensive therapies, this includes&#xD;
      antibody treatment and interventional methods such as thermoplasty. These treatments require&#xD;
      careful monitoring. It is important to ensure that they are given to the right population.&#xD;
      Special assessment to monitor the efficacy and to prevent inappropriate prescribing, exposure&#xD;
      of patients to unnecessary risks and excessive costs is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the mentioned reasons a Swiss Severe Asthma Register and a collaboration with an&#xD;
      already existing register is needed to prospectively collect data about severe asthma in&#xD;
      Switzerland.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to establish a clinical register for patients with severe asthma.&#xD;
      Since the number of patients with severe asthma at a single center is usually low, it will be&#xD;
      important to collect data in a multi-center system to optimize the diagnostic evaluation and&#xD;
      treatment of patients with severe asthma. So far, there is little reliable information about&#xD;
      the frequency, phenotype and therapy of patients with severe asthma. The construction of a&#xD;
      clinical register should close this gap. The primary objective is to show changes in symptoms&#xD;
      control during follow up period and at study end by using the Asthma Control Test (ACT).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are to collect data to better understand asthma's natural history in&#xD;
      patients with severe asthma. The examination will be based on the assessment of the&#xD;
      parameters specified under &quot;outcomes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to participating study center (pulmonologists in private practice or in&#xD;
      pulmonary departments in hospital within Switzerland) with severe asthma will be asked to&#xD;
      take part in this study when corresponding to the eligibility criteria. All patients with&#xD;
      severe asthma will be included in the register only after detailed information and written&#xD;
      consent. After four months (for specific therapies) and after 12 months, patients should be&#xD;
      re-evaluated for up to 15 years. These follow-up data will also be recorded in the register.&#xD;
      During the follow-up visits, the same parameters will be collected as during the initial&#xD;
      Baselineexamination (some parameters will be omitted, for example, therapy received or&#xD;
      requested for the defined period of the last 12 months, etc.). Severe asthma patients&#xD;
      receiving a new specific therapy, e.g. obtained with antibodies, but who cannot be included&#xD;
      in the register with the complete parameter profile due to time or capacity reasons of the&#xD;
      centers, should be recorded at least with defined basic data and a reduced number of&#xD;
      parameters in the register. These parameters include according to the specific asthma&#xD;
      approved specific therapies, socio-demographic data, lung function values, laboratory values,&#xD;
      parameters of asthma control, smoking status and add-on- therapy. This should make it&#xD;
      possible to record a subgroup of severe asthmatics that are suitable for antibody therapy and&#xD;
      at the same time offer the attending physician the opportunity to adequately document these&#xD;
      complex and expensive therapies by recording the defined parameters. In these patients, an&#xD;
      evaluation of the therapy response should be carried out after four months and documented in&#xD;
      the register. Thereafter, there is an annual follow-up. At any time, these patients can be&#xD;
      transferred to the full version of the register by entering the missing parameters. Patients&#xD;
      for whom only the basic data is available (basic version) as well as patients with complete&#xD;
      parameter profile in the register are kept in the same database and can be evaluated&#xD;
      together. In general, no register-specific examinations will be carried out, but only&#xD;
      parameters anyway recorded routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a cohort study, no sample size calculation can be calculated. Evaluations are&#xD;
      carried out continuously. The collective of the data should be described by descriptive&#xD;
      statistics concerning the basic data as well as the data of the function diagnostics.&#xD;
      Subentities of severe asthma should be identified by a cluster analysis.&#xD;
