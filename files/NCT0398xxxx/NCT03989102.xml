      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is a disease spread by mosquitos. Pregnant women are highly susceptible to malaria.&#xD;
      This can lead to poor health outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. Researchers want&#xD;
      to test a malaria vaccine in women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) and pregnant women.&#xD;
      This has not been done before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of PfSPZ vaccine in healthy Malian WOCBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women ages 18 38 who live in Ouelessebougou, Mali, and surrounding villages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple-choice test about malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 3 injections by needle into a vein of the study vaccine or a placebo.&#xD;
      All 3 will be within 1 month. They will not know whether they receive the vaccine or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive treatment to prevent malaria. This will be about 2 weeks before the&#xD;
      first and third injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the third injection, participants will be followed for about 1 year. They will be&#xD;
      tested to see if the vaccine is safe and protects against malaria infection. They will have&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants get a rash or injection site reaction, photos of the site may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any women who become pregnant during the trial will be followed through the end of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Babies and their mothers will be followed through the first year of life&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, leading to&#xD;
      substantial maternal, perinatal, and infant mortality. While malaria vaccine development has&#xD;
      made significant progress in recent years, no trials of malaria vaccines have ever been&#xD;
      conducted in only women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) or in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine (Sanaria, Inc) is an advanced malaria candidate being developed for use in&#xD;
&#xD;
      pregnant women, owing in part to its highly favorable safety profile. The vaccine is&#xD;
      comprised of aseptic, metabolically active, non-replicating, purified, cryopreserved P.&#xD;
      falciparum sporozoites. In multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, there have been&#xD;
      no differences in adverse events between vaccinees versus controls. PfSPZ Vaccine induces&#xD;
      immune responses to the sporozoite and liver stages of parasite development in the human host&#xD;
      and prevents progression to blood stage parasitemia as well as averting disease sequelae; a&#xD;
      compelling rationale to test PfSPZ Vaccine for its benefits in this proposed population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sanaria has already achieved vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterogenous parasite&#xD;
      populations in endemic areas following three doses of PfSPZ Vaccine in several studies with&#xD;
      9.0x10^5 and 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine and has explored accelerated regimens, such as 1, 8, 29&#xD;
      days. Accelerated PfSPZ Vaccine regimens such as this could induce protection earlier in&#xD;
      pregnancy, minimizing the period at risk and improving pregnancy outcomes over the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this, the Malaria Research and Training Center, the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology&#xD;
&#xD;
      and Vaccinology National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Sanaria, Inc.&#xD;
      propose to initiate testing of the day 1, 8, and 29 dosing regimen of PfSPZ Vaccine in WOCBP,&#xD;
      and in subsequent studies, in pregnant women, using doses of 9.0x10^5 and 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ&#xD;
      Vaccine. This will be the first step in a clinical development plan for PfSPZ Vaccine in&#xD;
      WOCBP and pregnant women: 1) safety and efficacy studies in non-pregnant WOCBP (this trial),&#xD;
      2) studies of the safety and efficacy of a primary immunization series in all trimesters, and&#xD;
      3) studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of boosting during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnancy registry study (#17-I-N018) has been ongoing in Mali since 2017 to gain&#xD;
&#xD;
      background data on maternal/fetal outcomes in the target population in anticipation of this&#xD;
      study. Women who become pregnant during the course of this study, and their offspring, will&#xD;
      be followed for maternal clinical outcomes and malaria infection.&#xD;
