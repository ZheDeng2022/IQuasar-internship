  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study. The main purpose of this&#xD;
      research is to test the safety and measure the immune response of the trivalent vaccine&#xD;
      against invasive Salmonella disease. The vaccine will be tested over a range of doses.&#xD;
