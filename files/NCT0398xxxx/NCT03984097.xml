  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this original study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      TAK-079 when administered to participants with NDMM in combination with the backbone&#xD;
      treatment regimen. The purpose of the safety/access cohort is to provide continued access to&#xD;
      TAK-079 to participants previously enrolled to a TAK-079 parent study and to evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term safety profile of TAK-079.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment phase drug being tested in this study is called TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) when added to 1 of 2&#xD;
      standard backbone regimens (LenDex or VRd) with newly diagnosed NDMM for whom stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (SCT) is not planned as initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 36 participants. Participants will be non-randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups in the original study or Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-079 and LenDex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-079 and VRd&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled participants will have the opportunity to complete the treatment therapy and&#xD;
      then enter the Extension study for as long as participants continue to derive benefit. Safety&#xD;
      Extension Phase participants who have previously received and tolerated TAK-079-based parent&#xD;
      study will continue to the extension study. The study will also evaluate the long-term safety&#xD;
      profile of TAK-079. Participants will continue to receive TAK-079 and, if applicable, SOC&#xD;
      backbone therapy as per the parent study.&#xD;

         11. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a QT interval corrected by Frederica's&#xD;
             formula (QTcF) &gt;470 milliseconds. If a machine reading is above this value, the ECG&#xD;
             should be reviewed by a qualified reader and confirmed on a subsequent ECG.&#xD;

             carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder cancer, asymptomatic prostate cancer (Gleason&#xD;
             score &lt;=6 without known metastatic disease and with no requirement for therapy, or&#xD;
             requiring only hormonal therapy and stable prostate-specific antigen for &gt;=1 year&#xD;
