    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of stage IV NSCLC. MPE caused by&#xD;
      lung cancer accounts for about 1/3. According to statistics, the number of MPE cases per year&#xD;
      in the United States exceeds 150,000. At the same time, with the development of&#xD;
      three-dimensional radiotherapy technology, the wide application of comprehensive treatment&#xD;
      concept, and the understanding of the relationship between different metastatic state and&#xD;
      survival of stage IV NSCLC, prospective and retrospective studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      systemic therapy combined with primary tumor three-dimensional radiation Treatment is more&#xD;
      conducive to improving symptoms and prolonging survival than medication alone. Retrospective&#xD;
      results and prospective findings have been reported from the single center of the study group&#xD;
      [Chinese Journal of Radiation Oncology, 2011, sixth issue and the first issue of 2012],&#xD;
      taking local three-dimensional radical radiotherapy for chemotherapy, two Complementary&#xD;
      technological advantages can significantly prolong survival and improve quality of life,&#xD;
      enabling some patients to achieve long-term survival. However, most of the above studies&#xD;
      excluded patients with malignant pleural effusion. For stage IV NSCLC of malignant pleural&#xD;
      effusion, whether the primary tumor radiotherapy can bring survival benefits, has not yet&#xD;
      formed a unified norm and conclusion, and needs further development. the study.&#xD;
