  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-part trial will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of&#xD;
      AXER-204 administered by lumbar puncture and slow bolus infusion. Part 1 will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of AXER-204. Part 2 will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeated doses AXER-204&#xD;
      in comparison to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AXER-204 is a human fusion protein that acts as a soluble decoy/trap for the&#xD;
      myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal growth known as Nogo-A, MAG, and OMgp. AXER-204 and a&#xD;
      surrogate protein used in early preclinical studies have been found to promote axon growth&#xD;
      and recovery of function in animal models of spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the trial is a multicenter, open-label, single ascending dose study in participants&#xD;
      with chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Four cohorts of 6 participants each are planned,&#xD;
      with participants within each cohort expected to receive the same dose of AXER-204.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study in&#xD;
      chronic cervical spinal cord injury participants. Approximately 32 participants will be&#xD;
      randomized (ratio 1:1) to receive repeated doses of AXER-204 or placebo (a phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline formulation). The dose level and dose frequency will be dependent upon outcomes from&#xD;
      Part 1.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 Post-dose to 28-days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is a life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in a significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly, or is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Change in International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) Upper Extremity Motor Score (UEMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 169 and Day 253</time_frame>
    <description>The ISNCSCI scale includes a Motor and Sensory examination for each side of the body (left/right). The Sensory examination involves 'light touch' and 'pinprick' for each dermatome (28) on both sides of the body (total 56). A score of 0, 1 or 2 can be given to each dermatome resulting in a total max. of 112 points. The Motor level is determined by examining the muscle function within each of the 10 myotomes on each side of the body (20 myotomes in total). A score ranging from 1 to 5 can be given to each myotome tested resulting in a maximum score of 100 (50 for upper extremity and 50 for lower extremity). Higher values indicate better function with the maximum scores corresponding to normal function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensation and Prehension (GRASSP) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 169 and Day 253</time_frame>
    <description>The GRASSP is a clinical impairment measure for the upper limb for use after tetraplegia. The measure includes domains which are important in describing hand function: Strength with scores from 0-50 for each side, Sensory testing with scores ranging from 0-12 for each hand, Prehension ability with scores 0-12 for each hand, and Prehension performance with scores from 0-30 for each hand. Higher subscores indicate better function.</description>

    <measure>Change in version III of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) self-care and mobility domain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 169 and Day 253</time_frame>
    <description>The SCIM III is a questionnaire that assesses activities of daily living (ADL) regarding self-care, mobility, respiration, and sphincter management. The self-care and mobility domains have scores ranging from 0-20 and 0-40 respectively. Higher scores correspond to better ability to carry out ADL.</description>
