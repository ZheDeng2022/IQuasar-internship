  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess 1) the safety and 2) efficacy of combining&#xD;
      Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with palliative radiation therapy in patients with Stage IV Merkel&#xD;
      Cell Carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study is that local radiation therapy (RT) can be safely used in&#xD;
      combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This combination therapy may have the potential to&#xD;
      enhance the induction of systemic anti-Merkel cell carcinoma immune responses, which will&#xD;
      inhibit growth and kill Merkel cell tumor cells in sites of established metastases outside of&#xD;
      the local radiation therapy field.&#xD;

    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor Response at both irradiated &amp; unirradiated sites will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Basic RECIST response will be assessed by the criterion below.&#xD;
Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR) = ≥0% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions.&#xD;
Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria.&#xD;
RECIST v1.1 immune-related response will be assessed by the criterion below.&#xD;
Immune-related CR (irCR) = Disappearance of all target lesions. Lymph nodes &lt;10 mm in short axis.&#xD;
Immune-related PR (irPR) = ≥30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions.&#xD;
Immune-related SD (irSD) = Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPR.&#xD;
The outcome is reported as the number of lesions with each of the different levels of clinical response, a number without dispersion.</description>

             have a total bilirubin of less than 3.0 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-clinically significant laboratory abnormalities such as lipase elevation would not&#xD;
             be an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C, or active&#xD;

             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after&#xD;
             the last dose of investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy&#xD;
             is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and on hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
                  (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal&#xD;
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products&#xD;
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile&#xD;
             (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. WOCBP must&#xD;
             have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or&#xD;
             equivalent units of HCG) within 1 week prior to the start of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for&#xD;
             the entire study and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;

             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on any other systemic therapy for cancer, including any other experimental&#xD;
             treatment within 2 weeks of scheduled first dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody if treatment failure was due to AEs.&#xD;
             If a subject was discontinued from the prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment due to an&#xD;
             Adverse events (AE) or Serious adverse events (SAE), regardless of the type of event,&#xD;
             that discontinuation constitutes an exclusion criterion. If AEs were serious enough to&#xD;
             require a subject's withdrawal from prior treatment, the subject should be excluded&#xD;
             from this study. The exception to the above are non-clinically significant&#xD;
             immune-related laboratory abnormalities - these are not automatic exclusions - e.g.&#xD;
             asymptomatic elevated amylase; responsiveness to steroids. In situations above - e.g.&#xD;
             non-clinically significant immune-related laboratory abnormalities, each case will be&#xD;
             considered individually and a decision made by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of AEs with prior IL-2 or Interferon will not preclude subjects from&#xD;
             entering the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease: Poorly controlled autoimmune disease is excluded. Well controlled&#xD;
             autoimmune disease (e.g. well controlled RA) will be assessed by the study team and a&#xD;
             decision made regarding eligibility based on the degree of immunosuppression and&#xD;
             severity of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject who has a life-threatening condition that requires high-dose&#xD;
             immunosuppressant(s). Steroid doses greater than 20 mg/day will exclude the patient&#xD;
             from participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of known hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, regardless of control on&#xD;
             antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have another active, concurrent, malignant disease are not eligible, with&#xD;
             the exception of subjects with adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other cancers that are&#xD;
             in remission/not measurable. Patients will be excluded if they have any known&#xD;
             additional malignancy that requires active treatment while on treatment for Merkel&#xD;
             Cell Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin/total bilirubin 3 or more X ULN unless conjugated bilirubin is less than or&#xD;
             equal to the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of symptomatic interstitial lung disease or symptomatic active, noninfectious&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease&#xD;
             such as unstable angina/uncompensated heart failure, uncontrolled symptomatic&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic T-cell immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic or current active infectious disease requiring systemic antibiotics,&#xD;
             antifungal, or antiviral treatment. This exclusion does not include prophylactic&#xD;
             antibiotics or topical antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody, which cannot be controlled with&#xD;
             standard measures (e.g. antihistamines and corticosteroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior immune related AEs not meeting the conditions above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with acute or poorly controlled psychiatric illness or subjects who are&#xD;
             compulsorily detained for physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness, with the&#xD;
             exception of patients that are well supported and able to participate (e.g. paraplegia&#xD;
             from a motor vehicle accident).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could make the administration of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 hazardous or could&#xD;
             obscure the interpretation of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any live vaccine therapy for up to 4 weeks before or after any dose of immunotherapy&#xD;
             on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any investigational agents within 2 weeks of scheduled first dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;

        <description>Tumor Response at both irradiated &amp; unirradiated sites will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Basic RECIST response will be assessed by the criterion below.&#xD;
Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR) = ≥0% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions.&#xD;
Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria.&#xD;
RECIST v1.1 immune-related response will be assessed by the criterion below.&#xD;
Immune-related CR (irCR) = Disappearance of all target lesions. Lymph nodes &lt;10 mm in short axis.&#xD;
Immune-related PR (irPR) = ≥30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions.&#xD;
Immune-related SD (irSD) = Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPR.&#xD;
The outcome is reported as the number of lesions with each of the different levels of clinical response, a number without dispersion.</description>
