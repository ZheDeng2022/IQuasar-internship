  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For chronic hemodialysis patients, the creation of a well-functioning arteriovenous (AV)&#xD;
      fistula is critical for ensuring that patient receive adequate hemodialysis. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the primary failure rate for AV fistulas after surgery is about 40%, and this percentage has&#xD;
      not changed despite a number of trials of pharmaceutical agents and biologic agents. A key to&#xD;
      success in the development of a useable AV fistula is an adequate arterial and venous&#xD;
      diameter in the access forearm. Although exercise is commonly used to increase vessel&#xD;
      diameter after AV fistula placement, Investigators are unaware of published studies that&#xD;
      report on the effect of exercise prior to AV fistula placement to assist with the maturation&#xD;
      of a newly created AV fistula. In this pilot trial, the Principal Investigator will evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and possible benefits of pre-surgical exercise on forearm AV fistulas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to determine if a pre-surgical exercise program will improve the&#xD;
      likelihood of a useable forearm AV fistula. In this pilot study, the feasibility of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention will be assessed in terms of both patient acceptability and patient&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, results from this feasibility study will be used to help determine&#xD;
      power calculations for a full-scale trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible for this pilot clinical trial if scheduled for placement of an&#xD;
      elective forearm AV fistula for chronic hemodialysis access. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      using a random number generator to either the intervention or the control group. The&#xD;
      intervention group will be instructed in the use of hand grip with built in digital counter.&#xD;
      These instructions will include the use of the hand grip on a daily basis with an increasing&#xD;
      number of hand grip squeezes to be performed each week up until the time of fistula&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will not receive any pre-surgical instructions for exercise in&#xD;
      the access arm. In both groups, patients will be provided with post-surgical instructions on&#xD;
      the use of a squeeze ball on a daily basis once the steri-strips from the surgical site have&#xD;
      fallen off.&#xD;
