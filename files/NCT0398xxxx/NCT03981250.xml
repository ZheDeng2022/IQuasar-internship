  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of one minute of resistance exercise per day on muscular&#xD;
      strength in adults. Half of the participants will undergo a 12-week home-based resistance&#xD;
      exercise programme, while the other half will continue their usual lifestyle behaviour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A resistance training programme can lead to a variety of health benefits including increases&#xD;
      in muscle size and strength. Other potential health benefits of resistance training include&#xD;
      reduction of body fat, increased metabolic rate, improve insulin sensitivity, blood glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and blood lipid profiles. Meta-analyses indicate that while performing resistance&#xD;
      exercise two or more times per week of resistance exercise per muscle group appears to be&#xD;
      optimal to maximise strength gains, a single set of resistance exercise per muscle group per&#xD;
      week, if performed to failure is sufficient to induce substantial strength changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current physical activity guidelines recommend undertaking muscle strengthening&#xD;
      activities involving major muscle groups two days a week or more, as well as undertaking at&#xD;
      least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity (or 75 minutes per week of&#xD;
      vigorous intensity physical activity). However, only small portion of the population achieves&#xD;
      the muscle strengthening aspect of the guidelines. As lack of time is often cited as a reason&#xD;
      not to engage in physical activity, this study is seeking to investigate a low&#xD;
      time-commitment approach to resistance exercise which could increase muscular strength. To&#xD;
      address this, the present study will to split a typical single session of resistance exercise&#xD;
      involving several exercises across different muscle groups into separate 1-minute&#xD;
      micro-sessions where a different muscle group is exercised on each day of the week. The aim&#xD;
      is to determine the effects of a one-minute-per-day home-based resistance exercise training&#xD;
      on muscular strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized control trial in which the control group will continue their&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviour and will be asked not to increase their physical activity levels and the&#xD;
      exercise group will perform a 12-week home-based resistance exercise programme, involving&#xD;
      doing one minute of resistance exercise per day on six days of the week, with a different&#xD;
      exercise performed on each day. All participants will be measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 8&#xD;
      weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
