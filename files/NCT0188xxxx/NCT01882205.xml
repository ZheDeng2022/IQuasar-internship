  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for colon cancer in patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis exceeding the&#xD;
      rectum is increased and therefore patients should be enrolled in a surveillance program eight&#xD;
      years after the diagnosis. Until today, official international guidelines for endoscopic&#xD;
      screening in patients with ulcerative colitis advise to take 4 biopsies every 10 centimeters&#xD;
      (with a minimum of 32) and of each suspected visible lesion. These guidelines are merely&#xD;
      based on consensus during expert opinion meetings rather than evidence based. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that chromo-endoscopy guided biopsies significantly reduced the number of biopsies&#xD;
      for each procedure and detected more neoplastic lesions. Chromo-endoscopy is therefore&#xD;
      considered the gold standard in this study in which we want to compare it to the performance&#xD;
      and efficiency of new endoscopic imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) selectively uses certain wavelengths of the visible light leading&#xD;
      to a shift in the excitation spectrum towards blue light. The first studies with NBI showed&#xD;
      that the additional value of NBI in the detection of neoplastic lesions is comparable to&#xD;
      chromo-endoscopy, but time saving and easier to perform. The Fujinon Intelligent&#xD;
      Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE) system uses a similar theoretical principal as NBI but this is&#xD;
      achieved via the use of post hoc computer algorithms, applying different filters to the&#xD;
      stored endoscopic images and enabling a theoretically endless number of combinations of&#xD;
      filters that can be used. The Pentax I-scan system also allows post hoc modification of the&#xD;
      images. On the one hand, surface enhancement enables to better highlight mucosal changes.&#xD;
      Spectral modification allows to apply different modes in analogy with to FICE system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new imaging techniques have a theoretical advantage which is extendedly used for sales&#xD;
      purposes but has however so far not been proven in ulcerative colitis patients. We want to&#xD;
      test their clinical use in the screening for neoplastic lesions in patients with long&#xD;
      standing ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

      The risk for colon cancer in patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis exceeding the&#xD;
      rectum is increased and therefore patients should be enrolled in a surveillance program eight&#xD;
      years after the diagnosis. Surveillance endoscopies are advised 8 to 10 years after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. The first decade every 3 years, the second decade every 2&#xD;
      years and thereafter every year Until today, most official international guidelines for&#xD;
      endoscopic screening in patients with ulcerative colitis advise to take 4 random biopsies&#xD;
      every 10 centimeters (with a minimum of 32) and of each suspected visible lesion using&#xD;
      standard white light endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These guidelines are merely based on consensus during expert opinion meetings rather than&#xD;
      evidence based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some studies have shown that the sensitivity for the detection of dysplasia during&#xD;
      colonoscopy in patients with ulcerative colitis can significantly be enhanced by using&#xD;
      chromo-endoscopy. These studies used methylene blue or indigo carmine as a contrast agent&#xD;
      with or without high magnification endoscopy. Chromo-endoscopy guided targeted biopsies&#xD;
      significantly reduced the number of biopsies for each procedure and detected more neoplastic&#xD;
      lesions. It was therefore concluded that colonoscopy with chromo-endoscopy guided biopsies is&#xD;
      more efficient and cost saving. Chromo-endoscopy with targeted biopsies is an alternative to&#xD;
      white light endoscopy with random biopsies every 10cm. The European Crohn and Colitis&#xD;
      association now suggests that the use of methylene blue or indigo carmine chromoendoscopy is&#xD;
      an alternative to random biopsies for appropriately trained endoscopists and is superior to&#xD;
      random biopsies in the detection rate of neoplastic lesions In this study we want to compare&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies as the gold standard with new new endoscopic image&#xD;
      techniques called virtual chromoendoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2005 new endoscopic imaging modalities have been commercialized and are now generally&#xD;
      available to gastroenterologists. They all claim a theoretical advantage in comparison to&#xD;
      standard white light high resolution video endoscopy. These new techniques are called virtual&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy (VC). There are three different systems developed by the three major&#xD;
      competitors of endoscopic equipment: Olympus, Pentax and Fujinon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) is developed by Olympus inc. and selectively uses certain&#xD;
      wavelengths of the visible light leading to a shift in the excitation spectrum towards blue&#xD;
      light. The intensity of the blue bandwidth is also enhanced. This leads to a more superficial&#xD;
      penetration of the emitted light into the mucosa of the intestine and enhancement of more&#xD;
      superficial structures (e.g. irregularities, small flat lesions or polyps) and small&#xD;
      superficial mucosal vessels (indicative of neoplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first studies using NBI in Barrett's esophagus demonstrated that the additional value of&#xD;
      NBI in the detection of neoplastic lesions is comparable to chromo-endoscopy (Kara et al.,&#xD;
      2005). However NBI is time saving and easier to perform than chromo-endoscopy because there&#xD;
      is no need to additionally spray dye onto the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a standard population screening study, NBI has shown to aid in the detection and&#xD;
      characterization of polyps in the colon. In particular the presence of a brownish meshed&#xD;
      capillary network has a high diagnostic value in the prediction of the neoplastic nature of a&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a very recent tandem study in which white light endoscopy was compared with NBI in 48&#xD;
      patients with longstanding UC there was no additional benefit of NBI. In the 25 patients who&#xD;
      were first endoscoped with white light 8 dysplastic lesions were found. After NBI imaging&#xD;
      another 7 lesions were found. In the 23 patients which were first imaged with NBI 7 lesions&#xD;
      were found and an additional 8 after white light endoscopy (Van den Broek FJ et al 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE) system uses a similar theoretical principal&#xD;
      as NBI but this is achieved via the use of post hoc computer algorithms, applying different&#xD;
      filters to the stored endoscopic images and enabling a theoretically endless number of&#xD;
      combinations of filters that can be used. Currently 10 different spectrum filters can be&#xD;
      used. There are predefined settings for visualization of the colonic mucosa. There are no&#xD;
      previous data comparing white light endoscopy and FICE in the detection of dysplasia in&#xD;
      longstanding ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Pentax released a new high definition endoscopy system in 2007, the I-scan system,&#xD;
      which also allows post hoc modification of the images. On the one hand, surface enhancement&#xD;
      enables to better highlight mucosal changes. Spectral modification allows to apply different&#xD;
      modes in analogy with to FICE system. For instance the p-mode for pattern recognition helps&#xD;
      to accentuate epithelial features. The TE-mode helps to assess the vasculature of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal mucosa. Recently new filters were developed such as the colon mode,&#xD;
      specifically designed for the colon. In one study VC with I-scan TE-mode was compared to CE&#xD;
      and standard white light endoscopy in 69 patients. In both the VC and CE mode 11 dysplastic&#xD;
      lesions were found (Hoffman et al 2010). Data about the improvement of detection of dysplasia&#xD;
      are lacking until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjustment of the light spectrum is usually combined with a better and higher image&#xD;
      resolution of the new generation endoscopes. Fujinon and Pentax use a so called super-CCD to&#xD;
      increase the pixel resolution of the scope to 1.300.000 and 1.400.000 respectively and&#xD;
      combined it with a DVI output signal. Olympus opted for an improved video resolution by&#xD;
      incorporating high definition television (HDTV) in the latest processors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new imaging techniques have a theoretical advantage which is extendedly used for sales&#xD;
      purposes but has however so far not been proven in ulcerative colitis patients. We want to&#xD;
      test their clinical use in the screening for neoplastic lesions in patients with long&#xD;
      standing ulcerative colitis. The scientific and clinical relevance of this study is clear. If&#xD;
      NBI and/or FICE and/or I-scan have a better detection rate than chromo-endoscopy, the latter&#xD;
      can be replaced by virtual chromo-endoscopy. Even if the detection by NBI and/or FICE and/or&#xD;
      I-scan is not statistically different from standard chromo-endoscopy, they still can replace&#xD;
      the latter because it is technically easier to use. If however these techniques have a lower&#xD;
      adenoma detection rate than classical chromo-endoscopy we will be able to show that there is&#xD;
      no place for these techniques in the detection of UC related neoplasia, despite the&#xD;
      theoretical advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the multicenter character of the study, and the availability of only one system in&#xD;
      most hospitals, we will test the differences between all three modalities and classical&#xD;
      chromoendodoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopic procedure as such is not much different from a standard endoscopic procedure&#xD;
      that patient should be advised to undergo according to good clinical practice. The bowel&#xD;
      preparation is similar as in a normal colonoscopy, and can be performed either at home or in&#xD;
      the endoscopy department. The endoscopes used in the study include the H180Q series of&#xD;
      Olympus, the 5000 series of Fujinon and the HD series of Pentax. They are not different in&#xD;
      terms of design or size compared to standard colonoscopies and are all commercially&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized between one of the following techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chromo-endoscopy with methylene blue 0,1% (groups A-C-E) An Olympus spray catheter is&#xD;
           used through the biopsy channel of the endoscope to apply the dye, a saline solution&#xD;
           with methylene blue in a concentration of 0.1%. This technique was already validated in&#xD;
           previous studies. Besides the extra time needed for dying the entire colon mucosa, no&#xD;
           other manipulations are needed for this technique. Moreover, the time needed to dye can&#xD;
           be recovered because only chromo-endoscopy guided biopsies will be taken instead of&#xD;
           random biopsies throughout the colon, which normally also requires a considerable amount&#xD;
           of time. Previous studies using chromo-endoscopy versus conventional screening&#xD;
           colonoscopy did not show a significant difference in total procedure time. The&#xD;
           endoscopes used do not differ from the ones used in the other randomization arms and&#xD;
           include either an Olympus H180Q colonoscope, Fujinon EC 590 ZW/M colonoscope or a Pentax&#xD;
           3890i colonoscope. All three endoscopes are CE approved and are commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Narrow band imaging with HDTV (Group B) This technique involves an Olympus H180Q&#xD;
           colonoscope that is CE approved and commercially available. The procedure involves a&#xD;
           normal white light endoscopy during progression of the scope. Once the caecum is reached&#xD;
           the entire procedure will be performed in NBI modus. This has no influence or side&#xD;
           effects for the patients because NBI modus is switched on by pushing a button on the&#xD;
           scope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fujinon Intelligent Color Enhancement (FICE) with super CCD chip (Group D) This&#xD;
           technique involves a Fujinon EC 590ZW/M colonoscope that is CE approved and commercially&#xD;
           available. The procedure involves a normal white light endoscopy during progression of&#xD;
           the scope. Once the caecum is reached the entire procedure will be performed in FICE&#xD;
           modus n° 4. This has no influence or side effects for the patients because FICE modus is&#xD;
           switched on by pushing a button on the scope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. I-scan with High Definition colonoscope (group F) This technique involves a PENTAX&#xD;
           EC3890Fi colonoscope that is CE approved and commercially available. The procedure&#xD;
           involves a normal white light endoscopy during progression of the scope. Once the caecum&#xD;
           is reached the entire procedure will be performed in the TE- modus (Tissue enhancement&#xD;
           mode) with surface enhancement on medium (range low-medium-high). This has no influence&#xD;
           or side effects for the patients because the c- modus is switched on by pushing a button&#xD;
           on the scope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only targeted biopsies of visible mucosal abnormalities during chromo-endoscopy, NBI, FICE or&#xD;
      I-scan endoscopy will be taken. This is in concordance with the standard approach during&#xD;
      chromo-endoscopy directed screening colonoscopy for ulcerative colitis. The disposable biopsy&#xD;
      forceps are commercially available (Boston Scientific) and do not differ from the ones used&#xD;
      during normal endoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was performed to detect a statistical significance between group A and B,&#xD;
      group C and D and between group E and F. In a previous study dysplasia was found three times&#xD;
      more often using CE compared to white light endoscopy: 32/84 versus 10/81 patients. This wil&#xD;
      give an increase from approximate 10 to 30 percent. It is expected that in both study groups&#xD;
      the percentage of dysplasia equals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of 67 patients in each group will allow to detect a 20% increase of dysplasia from&#xD;
      10 to 30% compared to white light endoscopy with a power of 80% (beta error 0.2; alpha error&#xD;
      0.05). We expect to include a total of (67 x 6 =) 402 patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Co-variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors will be used as co-variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Existence of PSC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mesalazine/Sulfazalazine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thiopurines&#xD;
