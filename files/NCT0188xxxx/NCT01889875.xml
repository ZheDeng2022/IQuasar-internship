  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of pollen allergies can be roughly divided into symptomatic treatment (e.g.&#xD;
      antihistamines, steroids) and potentially curative immunotherapy. Immunotherapy can be&#xD;
      delivered using subcutaneous or oral (mucosal) routes, with similar clinical outcome. The&#xD;
      study seeks to compare immunological changes during subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual tablet&#xD;
      (AIT) immunotherapy of grass pollen allergy (hayfever).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, more than 400 million people have allergic rhinitis, and sick-leave due to this&#xD;
      condition costs societies billions of dollars annually1. Allergic rhinitis is most commonly&#xD;
      treated with oral antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids2. For moderate-severe&#xD;
      rhinitis with poor control on topical treatment, immunotherapy should be considered3.&#xD;
      Allergen immunotherapy is the only disease-modifying treatment available for IgE mediated&#xD;
      allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy is most commonly administered with subcutaneous injections of SQ-standardized&#xD;
      allergen extracts (SCIT) and to a lesser extent, as sublingual drops (SLIT). However, other&#xD;
      options now exist with the newly developed sublingual allergen immunotherapy tablets (AIT).&#xD;
      The clinical effect of AIT4 and SCIT5 against grass pollen allergy has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      large double-blind-placebo-controlled registration trials. These studies report significant&#xD;
      reductions of symptom scores (AIT 30%, SCIT 32%) and seasonal rescue medication scores (AIT&#xD;
      38%, SCIT 41%) when compared with placebo4,5, persisting several years after withdrawal4,6.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy may prevent new sensitizations and progression of rhinitis to asthma7-11.&#xD;
      Allergen immunotherapy is generally well tolerated with few side effects, although a&#xD;
      potential risk of anaphylactic reactions exists 12. A review of recent parallel meta-analyses&#xD;
      on immunotherapy for grass pollen rhinitis suggests that the safety profile of AIT is&#xD;
      superior to that of SCIT13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended length of immunotherapy with both SCIT and AIT is 3-5 years2, although the&#xD;
      route of administration and the doses of allergen differ substantially. SCIT involves an&#xD;
      up-dosing phase lasting 12-15 weeks with one or more weekly injections of increasing doses of&#xD;
      allergen followed by a maintenance dose every 6-10 weeks. AIT starts with the daily&#xD;
      maintenance dose, resulting in high cumulative doses. It is largely unknown whether the&#xD;
      immunological mechanisms involved in the clinical effect are the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in immunology have been extensively investigated for SCIT, and the most&#xD;
      pronounced patterns are: 1) the induction of blocking antibodies, 2) a shift in Th1/Th2&#xD;
      balance towards Th1, and 3) induction of regulatory T cells. Similar mechanisms seem to be in&#xD;
      play for AIT 14-16. Increases in allergen-specific non-IgE antibodies have been demonstrated&#xD;
      in large trials of both SCIT and AIT treatment17,18, and studies have demonstrated that serum&#xD;
      antibodies can reduce in vitro reactions mimicking allergic responses, such as IgE binding to&#xD;
      allergen, IgE facilitated antigen presentation and basophil activation19-22, suggesting that&#xD;
      both humoral and cellular effects play a role23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of AIT and SCIT on antibody titers&#xD;
      (IgE and IgG4), on allergen-IgE interaction in competition assays (IgE-blocking factor and&#xD;
      FAP inhibition) and on effector cell activation (BAT). Nasal challenges were included to&#xD;
      assess the changes in nasal response to grass pollen allergen.&#xD;
