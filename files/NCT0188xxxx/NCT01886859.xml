      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together&#xD;
      with ibrutinib in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide&#xD;
      together with ibrutinib may work better in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when&#xD;
      used in combination with ibrutinib in adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate and response duration in relapsed and refractory CLL/SLL&#xD;
      patients with ibrutinib and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between ibrutinib and&#xD;
      lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore whether pharmacogenetic studies can predict response, resistance or toxicity&#xD;
      to ibrutinib and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the ability of ibrutinib to occupy its targets (Bruton's tyrosine kinase [BTK]&#xD;
      in B-cells and interleukin-2 inducible kinase [ITK] in T-cells), and whether&#xD;
      co-administration with lenalidomide influences this binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the early and late immunologic consequences of combining ibrutinib with&#xD;
      lenalidomide in relapsed and refractory CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the impact of ibrutinib and lenalidomide on ras homolog family member H (RhoH)&#xD;
      expression and whether baseline RhoH expression predicts outcomes with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib. VIII. To explore the influence of&#xD;
      traditional and new CLL/SLL clinical and laboratory prognostic factors on response to&#xD;
      ibrutinib and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a run-up cycle of ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Patients then&#xD;
      receive ibrutinib PO and lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 cycles, patients who&#xD;
      have achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodular&#xD;
      partial remission (PR), partial remission with persistent lymphocytosis, partial remission,&#xD;
      or who have stable disease discontinue lenalidomide and continue ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus are unknown; lenalidomide is&#xD;
             likely to be teratogenic; therefore, females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) performed once&#xD;
             before ibrutinib and a total of two negative tests before initiating lenalidomide; a&#xD;
             FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point; 2) has not undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal&#xD;
             (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at&#xD;
             least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24&#xD;
             consecutive months); the pre-ibrutinib pregnancy test will be initiated at enrollment;&#xD;
             the first pre- lenalidomide test will be performed within 10-14 days of starting&#xD;
             lenalidomide (cycle 0, day 15), and the second pre-lenalidomide test (3rd total test)&#xD;
             will be within 24 hours of the first dose of lenalidomide; the patient may not receive&#xD;
             lenalidomide until the study doctor has verified that the results of these pregnancy&#xD;
             tests are negative; pregnancy tests (if applicable) are then to be conducted weekly&#xD;
             during the first month, and monthly thereafter in women with a regular menstrual&#xD;
             cycle, as well as at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following study&#xD;
             discontinuation; if menstrual cycles are irregular, pregnancy testing will be&#xD;
             conducted weekly for the first month, and then every 14 days while on the study, at&#xD;
             study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug discontinuation;&#xD;
             pregnancy testing and counseling are to be performed if a patient misses her period or&#xD;
             if there is any abnormality in menstrual bleeding; should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately; further, FCBP must either commit to continued&#xD;
             abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth&#xD;
             control: one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME&#xD;
             TIME, at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; FCBP must also agree to ongoing&#xD;
             pregnancy testing; men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a&#xD;
             FCBP, even if they have had a successful vasectomy; male and female patients must&#xD;
             agree to use highly effective methods of birth control (e.g. condoms, implants,&#xD;
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices [IUDs], complete&#xD;
             sexual abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the period of therapy and for 90 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug; all patients must be counseled by a trained&#xD;
             counselor every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure&#xD;

             antagonists (e.g.: phenprocoumon) within 28 days of the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ibrutinib and lenalidomide have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
