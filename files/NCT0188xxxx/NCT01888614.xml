  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate etCO in patients with HbSS, HbSC, and HbS-beta&#xD;
      thalassemia during routine clinic visits, and longitudinally. Our goal is to know whether&#xD;
      etCO differs amongst subjects with different sickle cell syndrome genotypes, and whether it&#xD;
      is a stable marker of hemolytic rate, as reflected in routine labs obtained for clinical care&#xD;
      (including total hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and, when sampled,&#xD;
      total and direct bilirubin). We hope to establish whether this inexpensive and non-invasive&#xD;
      test faithfully reflects hemolytic parameters in sickle cell syndromes.&#xD;

      This is an observational study of sickle cell patients with the aim to measure exhaled carbon&#xD;
      monoxide levels and to correlate with genotype and standard clinical markers of hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment and at each subsequent visit, if acceptable to the patient, each subject will&#xD;
      undergo measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide utilizing a hand held carbon monoxide monitor,&#xD;
      MicroCO/Smoke check. Subsequent evaluations may be obtained during a routine visit, while&#xD;
      hospitalized for a vasocclusive crises (VOC) episode, or when evaluated in the acute care&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal study objective is to assess if exhaled carbon monoxide levels are a&#xD;
      non-invasive marker of hemolysis in subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study objective is to assess exhaled carbon monoxide levels serially in&#xD;
      subjects with SCD, relative to vasocclusive crises, transfusion requirements, and pain&#xD;
      syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one inclusion criteria is for all adult sickle patients presenting for follow up at the&#xD;
      outpatient sickle cell clinic who are capable of following simple instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are a recent (2 week) history of lung infection, asthma, acute chest&#xD;
      syndrome, or COPD exacerbation and/or a significant pulmonary dysfunction in the recent (3-6&#xD;
      month) past.&#xD;
