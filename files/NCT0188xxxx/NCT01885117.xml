  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent, surface&#xD;
      antigen, inactivated influenza vaccine in 2 age cohorts: 18 to ≤60 years and ≥61 years and&#xD;
      the antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen, as measured by Single Radial&#xD;
      Hemolysis (SRH) or Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) at approximately 21 days post&#xD;
      immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine composition will be based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended&#xD;
      influenza strains for the 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study are intended to support the use of this vaccine in future influenza&#xD;
      seasons if the recommended vaccine composition remains the same, in compliance with the&#xD;
      requirements of the current European Union (EU) recommendations for clinical trials related&#xD;
      to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines.&#xD;

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups with SRH areas ≥25mm2 against each of the three vaccine strains, three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.&#xD;
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving post vaccination SRH areas ≥ 25mm2 is &gt;70% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;60% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase by SRH area against each of the three vaccine strains ,three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.&#xD;
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area ≤4mm2 achieving a post vaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area &gt;4mm2 achieving at least 50% increase in post vaccination SRH area.&#xD;
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if the percentage of subjects achieving post vaccination SRH areas ≥ 25mm2 is &gt;40% for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and &gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years.</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of TIVf.&#xD;
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a post vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer ≥10 to at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination HI antibody titers.&#xD;

        <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase by SRH area against each of the three vaccine strains ,three weeks after receiving one dose of TIVf.&#xD;
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area ≤4mm2 achieving a post vaccination SRH area ≥25 mm2. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination SRH area &gt;4mm2 achieving at least 50% increase in post vaccination SRH area.&#xD;

        <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects in both age groups achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of TIVf.&#xD;
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a post vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre vaccination HI titer ≥10 to at least a 4-fold increase in post vaccination HI antibody titers.&#xD;
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if&gt;40 % for adults aged 18 to ≤60 years and&gt;30% for subjects aged ≥61 years achieve seroconversion or significant increase in post vaccination HI titers.</description>
