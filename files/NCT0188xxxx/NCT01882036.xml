      The focus of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which bariatric surgery acutely&#xD;
      improves insulin sensitivity. Our central hypothesis is that drastically reduced caloric&#xD;
      intake early after Bariatric surgery improves the pro-inflammatory profile of macrophages,&#xD;
      which in turn improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery quickly improves tissue specific insulin sensitivity. Changes in glucose&#xD;
      metabolism are seen within days after surgery, prior to any significant weight loss--raising&#xD;
      the question of a difference between dietary restriction and early food intake after surgery.&#xD;
      A major factor in the development of insulin resistance is obesity. It has been noted that by&#xD;
      3 months following Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery in obese patients with (T2DM), fasting&#xD;
      glucose and insulin levels are improved independent of weight loss, insulin resistance in&#xD;
      muscle is lowered, and that the pro-inflammatory profile of resident microphages is lowered&#xD;
      improving insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which bariatric surgery improves&#xD;
      impacts insulin sensitivity. Our long-term goal is to correlate these changes with direct&#xD;
      measures of adipose tissue insulin resistance to develop novel immunotherapies towards&#xD;
      reducing insulin resistance without surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that gastrointestinal rearrangement by various mechanisms impacts&#xD;
      adipose tissue and improves the pro-inflammatory profile of macrophages improving insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we propose the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Recruit a patient population and measure insulin sensitivity using&#xD;
      homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) to measure insulin resistance (IR), cytokines, incretins,&#xD;
      and serum adipokines in morbidly obese patients • prior to and 7-10 days following bariatric&#xD;
      surgery while on a hypocaloric diet (surgery group) and •prior to and 7-10 days while&#xD;
      following hypocaloric diet similar to bariatric surgery (diet group). Subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to the two arms; subjects assigned to the hypocaloric diet may be offered bariatric&#xD;
      surgery after completion of the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Profile inflammatory macrophages, T cells and secreted factors in subcutaneous and&#xD;
           visceral adipose tissue of patients prior to and following RYGB and hypocaloric diet&#xD;
           treatments. • prior to and 7-10 days following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prior to and 7-10 days following hypocaloric diet similar to bariatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the effects of bariatric surgery on ROS (reactive oxygen species) production,&#xD;
      expression of transcription factors and enzymes of mitochondrial biogenesis, tissue FABP4,&#xD;
      and biomarkers of oxidative stress and protein carbonylation in patients prior to and&#xD;
      following surgery and in control diet subjects maintained on hypocaloric diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the impact of bariatric surgery on lipolysis and the role of TLQP-21 (a genetically&#xD;
      derived peptide that increases energy expenditure and prevents the early phase of&#xD;
      diet-induced obesity).&#xD;
