      The purpose of this study is to determine if Leukine (sargramostim) can be safely&#xD;
      administered to Parkinson's disease patients for an extended period of time (56 days) and&#xD;
      restore immune deficits seen in Parkinson's patients compared to controls. The development of&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a monitoring tool for PD will also be explored. At enrollment&#xD;
      and repeating again at two 4-week intervals, whole blood from PD patients and controls will&#xD;
      be obtained for analyses and the results will be used to calculate immune response profiles&#xD;
      as a baseline for comparison after drug treatment. Physical examinations and motor&#xD;
      assessments will also be performed on PD patients. After the 8-week baseline data collection,&#xD;
      control participation will end and drug treatment of PD patients will begin. PD patients will&#xD;
      be randomized, and half will receive drug and half will receive placebo. Leukine at a dosage&#xD;
      of 6 µg/kg or saline as placebo will be administered by subcutaneous injection daily for 56&#xD;
      days (8 weeks). During drug treatment, PD patients will be monitored every two weeks by&#xD;
      physical examinations, motor assessments, and blood analyses. As follow-up, four weeks after&#xD;
      drug administration has stopped, subjects will again have physical examinations, motor&#xD;
      assessments, and blood analyses. MEG will be performed on PD patients and controls at the&#xD;
      start of drug treatment, and on PD patients at the end of the drug treatment period and 4&#xD;
      weeks after drug is stopped. In addtion, at the second cohort of 8 PD subjects, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the potential Leukine-induced motor control and mobility improvements. Also, levels&#xD;
      of the neurotransmitters glutamate, glutamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, GABA, norepinephrine&#xD;
      and epinephrine in serum/plasma will be analyzed to correlate with changes in motor function&#xD;
      and drug treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and disabling neurological disorder involving the&#xD;
      nigrostriatum and for which no cure is known. Evidence suggests that inflammation&#xD;
      contributes, significantly, to the cause and/or progression of the disease. Studies in&#xD;
      postmortem human brain, animal models, and human peripheral blood support the idea that the&#xD;
      frequency and function of particular circulating T cell subsets are abnormal and worsen as&#xD;
      disease progresses. This abnormality is linked specifically to increases in numbers of T&#xD;
      effector neurodestructive cells (Teff) and to dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Treg) that&#xD;
      control Teff. This imbalance tips the homeostatic balance to a pro-inflammatory profile with&#xD;
      limited control. Nonetheless, whether such T cell deficits are a cause of PD or a reaction to&#xD;
      it remains unknown. If these deficits are causal or exacerbative, then correcting the deficit&#xD;
      could have significant positive effects on disease progression and could ameliorate&#xD;
      nigrostriatal degeneration or its sequelae. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (GM-CSF) is a potential immunomodulatory therapeutic for PD to increase Treg numbers or&#xD;
      function and reduce or transform proinflammatory Teff responses, leading to neuroprotection&#xD;
      of the nigrostriatum and improved clinical outcomes for disease. Recombinant human GM-CSF&#xD;
      (sargramostim) is available as Leukine®. The purpose of this study is to determine if Leukine&#xD;
      (sargramostim) can be safely administered to Parkinson's disease patients for an extended&#xD;
      period of time (56 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study conducted at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) using&#xD;
      samples of whole blood, PD patients showed differences from caregiver controls according to&#xD;
      results from complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell (WBC) differential,&#xD;
      fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for T cell markers, and Treg functional&#xD;
      assays. These immune aberrations correlated with motor dysfunction as determined by&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III assessments. In this pilot study, the&#xD;
      effect of Leukine treatment on immune deficits in PD patients will be monitored. Immune cell&#xD;
      analyses of whole blood, motor assessments, and physical examinations and blood analyses for&#xD;
      safety, will be conducted before, during, and after Leukine or placebo treatment of PD&#xD;
      patients, and using healthy controls during baseline data collection before drug treatment.&#xD;
      Initially, 16 PD patients and 16 controls will be recruited. Subjects will be drawn from the&#xD;
      previous study. Enrollment will be supplemented as needed with patients from Neurology&#xD;
      Consultants of Nebraska-PC, UNMC Neurological Sciences, or recruitment through the American&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Association. Enrollment will be staggered, and additional subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited as needed to replace any withdrawing participants, with the goal of 32 subjects,&#xD;
      16 PD patients and 16 controls, completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment and repeating again at two 4-week intervals, whole blood from PD patients and&#xD;
      controls will be obtained percutaneously using standard sterile techniques. CBC with WBC&#xD;
      differential, FACS analysis for T cell markers, and Treg functional assays will be performed&#xD;
      and used to calculate immune response profiles as a baseline for comparison after drug&#xD;
      treatment. Blood chemistries will be analyzed including liver enzymes, electrolytes, blood&#xD;
      urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin and bilirubin levels, and anti-GM-CSF&#xD;
      antibodies will be assessed in PD patients. PD patients will be evaluated by physical and&#xD;
      clinical examinations, including UPDRS part III assessments for evaluation of motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD patients will then be randomized into two groups, placebo (n=8) and Leukine (n=8), and&#xD;
      participation of the controls will end. Patients entered into the study will not have any&#xD;
      noted co-morbid conditions including infection, inflammatory or cancerous diseases and will&#xD;
      not be taking immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive medicines. Patients will continue to&#xD;
      take medicines prescribed for the general treatment of PD, including, but not limited to,&#xD;
      dopamine or dopamine agonists. There will be no history of prior surgeries linked to PD&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will receive training for self-injection, and the treatment group will&#xD;
      self-administer Leukine (6 µg/kg) by subcutaneous injection daily for eight weeks. The&#xD;
      placebo group will self-administer saline as placebo. Every two weeks after the start of&#xD;
      treatment and again 4 weeks after cessation of administration, all PD patients, receiving&#xD;
      drug or placebo, will be evaluated by physical and clinical examinations, including UPDRS&#xD;
      part III assessments. Every 2 weeks during Leukine treatment and again 4 weeks after&#xD;
      cessation of drug, whole blood from PD patients will be obtained percutaneously using&#xD;
      standard sterile techniques. At weeks 2, 4 and 8, results from CBC with WBC differential,&#xD;
      FACS analysis for T cell markers, and Treg functional assays will be used to calculate immune&#xD;
      response profiles and compared with baseline values. CBC with WBC differential, total T cell&#xD;
      count, and blood chemistries will be analyzed every 2 weeks for evidence of potential&#xD;
      toxicities, as well as 4 weeks after termination of Leukine treatment. Levels of anti-GM-CSF&#xD;
      antibodies will be assessed for PD patients at enrollment and at 4 weeks intervals during&#xD;
      drug treatment and 4 weeks after termination. Optional video recordings will be made at&#xD;
      baseline, end of drug/placebo treatment and at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional component of the study includes the development of magnetoencephalography (MEG)&#xD;
      as a monitoring tool for PD. MEG provides a non-invasive method to study brain activity.&#xD;
      Currently, there are not adequate assessment tools for monitoring disease progression or&#xD;
      treatment protocols in PD. In preliminary experiments on PD patients and their caregivers,&#xD;
      MEG data have indicated strong beta synchronization during rest in PD and milder beta&#xD;
      desynchronization during movement preparation compared to age- and sex-matched controls. In&#xD;
      this study, the amplitude of this pathological beta synchronization/desynchronization will be&#xD;
      monitored to evaluate improvements in cortical brain function of PD patients treated with&#xD;
      Leukine. MEG will be performed on PD patients and controls at the start of drug treatment,&#xD;
      and on PD patients at the end of the drug treatment period and 4 weeks after drug is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the first 8 patients enrolled in the study, we have observed unexpected and&#xD;
      statistically significant changes in the unified PD rating scale part III (UPDRS part III)&#xD;
      clinical evaluations for motor function in half of the patients tested. This test, however,&#xD;
      is viewed as subjective. To more objectively and analytically score motor functions,&#xD;
      biomechanical assessments of the subject's mobility, postural balance, upper extremity motor&#xD;
      control and resting state tremor will be performed on the remaining eight PD patients&#xD;
      receiving Leukine or placebo. These assessments will occur at baseline, between 7 and 8 weeks&#xD;
      of drug treatment, and at 4-5 weeks after cessation of drug treatment. Motor function tests&#xD;
      are designed to provide an objective, computer generated score as measured by patient&#xD;
      performance on each test. To investigate a possible mechanism for changes in motor function&#xD;
      observed within two weeks of therapy, testing for plasma/serum neurotransmitters will be&#xD;
      performed to include glutamate, glutamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA), norepinephrine and epinephrine. These measures will be performed on the last cohort&#xD;
      of PD patients of the study before initiation of treatment, 8 weeks after treatment is&#xD;
      initiated and at 4 weeks after cessation of drug treatment. The tests will be evaluated by&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by ultra-performance liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (UPLC). A decision on which assay will be done for which neurotransmitter will be based on&#xD;
      sensitivity and standard curve measures. Relationships between neurotransmitter levels and&#xD;
      motor function will be determined. These tests are in addition to current ongoing and&#xD;
      approved laboratory tests. Eligibility requirements are unchanged from those currently&#xD;
      imposed. Measures of motor function and serum/plasma neurotransmitter concentrations will&#xD;
      also be completed 4-5 weeks after cessation of treatment. The notion of exploring&#xD;
      neurotransmitters in this study is based on role in motor function that include fatigue,&#xD;
      bowel, sexual dysfunction and mood changes that are also observed in PD as well as that&#xD;
      GM-CSF has been shown to affect neurotransmitter levels (96). This range of listed&#xD;
      neurotransmitters was not investigated in the first part of this study and will require&#xD;
      limited additional blood and assay resources for the last part of the investigation.&#xD;
