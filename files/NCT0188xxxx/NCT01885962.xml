  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the feasibility of iSHIFTup (Internet Skin Health&#xD;
      Intervention For Targeted Ulcer Prevention) for adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) to&#xD;
      prevent serious pressure ulcers (PrUs) and promote protective health behaviors. This protocol&#xD;
      is Phase 2 of a three phase project. In Phase 1, the investigators developed iSHIFTup. In&#xD;
      Phase 2, the investigators will test the intervention by partnering with Woodrow Wilson&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center (WWRC) to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 18&#xD;
      participants. In Phase 3, the investigators will focus on optimizing the intervention based&#xD;
      on our outcome findings and feedback, sustaining the program at WWRC, and seeking future&#xD;
      funding for a larger RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct an RCT of up to 18 participants (9 participants in treatment&#xD;
      as usual (TAU) group, 9 participants in TAU + iSHIFTup intervention group) (18 participants&#xD;
      are needed to obtain statistically significant results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will meet with potential participants in-person to complete the informed&#xD;
      consent process and confirm eligibility. Participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group will use the&#xD;
      program during the study period. Participants randomized to TAU will have usual treatment&#xD;
      during the study period and an opportunity to use the program following trial participation.&#xD;
      The investigators will collect information from participants at two times during the study,&#xD;
      at enrollment and post-intervention at 6-weeks (42 days). The investigators will also collect&#xD;
      qualitative information from participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group, during an optional&#xD;
      focus-group setting, to learn users' experiences with the program. The investigators expect&#xD;
      participants in the TAU+iSHIFTup group as compared to the TAU group, to display greater&#xD;
      awareness of personal risk for pressure ulcers; increased preventive behaviors; and increased&#xD;
      skin care self-efficacy and knowledge.&#xD;
