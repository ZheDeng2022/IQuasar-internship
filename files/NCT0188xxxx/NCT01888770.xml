  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether exposure to hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy and/or a preterm birth results in alterations in the cardiovascular system during&#xD;
      infancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the incidence of cardiovascular disease has reduced dramatically, coinciding with&#xD;
      favourable changes in risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the single largest cause&#xD;
      of mortality and premature mortality in the United Kingdom. Identification of novel&#xD;
      biological pathways that underlie disease susceptibility raises the potential for new early&#xD;
      primary prevention strategies to complement classical management. There is particular&#xD;
      interest in the role of early environment in 'programming' risk of cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      later life and growing evidence that various early life exposures impact cardiovascular&#xD;
      health in the longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have therefore designed the EPOCH study to investigate whether those&#xD;
      individuals born to hypertensive pregnancies and/or to a preterm birth demonstrate&#xD;
      differences in the cardiovascular phenotype at birth, or whether they develop any differences&#xD;
      over the first three months of life and whether this varies with other perinatal factors.&#xD;
      This study also allows investigation of the short term impact of perinatal interventions used&#xD;
      in this cohort. Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measures of cardiovascular&#xD;
      structure and function allow precise quantification of cardiovascular phenotype in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
