      Developing an MRI protocol at 1.5 T allowing quantification of the hematopoietic, fatty and&#xD;
      trabecular moieties of marrow. An ideal protocol would differentiate red marrow from&#xD;
      neoplastic cellular infiltration, and detect loss of trabecular bone. This study assesses the&#xD;
      feasibility of a multiple gradient echo sequence for differentiation of water and fat&#xD;
      constituents of marrow, combined with T2* mapping to interrogate the trabecular component The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that these techniques will allow better identification of lesion&#xD;
      type than routine MR sequences, and can be used to quantitatively characterize myelomatous&#xD;
      marrow replacement, with iliac crest biopsy (which is routinely performed in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      myeloma) as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)/PET CT imaging can detect FDG uptake in active myeloma and is&#xD;
      obtained routinely for certain cohorts of patients with myeloma. PET/CT is commonly used in&#xD;
      both initial whole body assessment and in monitoring remission. PET has been found to be&#xD;
      about 59% sensitive and 75% specific for detection of myeloma .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myelomatous lesions are detected on MRI by the replacement of marrow fat. Routine MRI however&#xD;
      is limited by scope/field of view, usually evaluating marrow in a single anatomic region&#xD;
      (such as an extremity, the pelvis or spine). To assess the diffuse marrow involvement in MM,&#xD;
      whole body MRI imaging potentiates near global assessment of the marrow, which aids in&#xD;
      evaluating tumor burden, and may be useful in staging.&#xD;

      Imaging of the pelvis and bilateral femora at 1.5 Tesla in a 30 minute research time &quot;slots&quot;&#xD;
      at NYU-FPO MRI, Tisch Hospital, NYU Medical Center, Department of Radiology, HCC basement.&#xD;
      This protocol utilizes routine, Dixon sequences and multi-echo MR &quot;spectroscopic&quot; sequences,&#xD;
      allowing quantization of the fat water and trabecular moieties of marrow. The opposed phase&#xD;
      portion of a Dixon sequence can aid differentiation between dense red marrow and a metastatic&#xD;
      deposits by assaying for intravoxel fat. Diffusion sequences may also potentially improve&#xD;
      specificity by assessing mobility of water in hypercellular and hypocellular portions of&#xD;
      marrow, and will be added to the protocol if scan time permits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new sequences conform to FDA safety regulations regarding static magnetic field, time&#xD;
      varying magnetic fields, specific absorption rate, and acoustic noise levels. However, since&#xD;
      they have not been fully validated for diagnostic accuracy, the resulting images will be&#xD;
      analyzed for research purposes only and will not be used in the patient's diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
