    <textblock>
      The study involves recording response to discomfort following different forms of exercise. We&#xD;
      think that there will be a increased pain tolerance following exercise but are unsure if&#xD;
      there will be a difference between exercises.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Known changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as well as other&#xD;
      neurotransmitter systems, lead to alteration of peripheral and central nociception during&#xD;
      acute and chronic stress. Exercise is one example of such physiologic stress. Exercise, in&#xD;
      various forms, has been shown to exert effects on pain attenuation. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated post-exercise reduction in pain ratings, increased pain threshold as well as&#xD;
      attenuation of pain-related increases in motor evoked potentials. This phenomenon is referred&#xD;
      to as exercise-induced analgesia (EIA) or, perhaps more accurately, exercise-induced&#xD;
      hypoalgesia (EIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise at higher intensities and longer durations have the most robust evidence supporting&#xD;
      their role in EIH. This is true of both long-duration aerobic training as well as&#xD;
      high-intensity anaerobic training. This type of activity, however, may not be the most&#xD;
      practical type of activity prescribed in a clinical population, especially in people with&#xD;
      painful conditions, due to decreased conditioning and tolerance. Beyond long-duration and/or&#xD;
      high-intensity aerobic exercise, there is growing evidence supporting the use of other forms&#xD;
      and intensities of exercise that may induce EIH. Alternative forms of exercise, such as&#xD;
      isometric stabilization, have been shown to decrease pain in a population of patients with&#xD;
      low back pain. Koltyn and Arbogast investigated acute effects of exercise on pain perception&#xD;
      and found that a single bout of resistance exercise at 75% of maximum intensity produces&#xD;
      significant increases in pain thresholds and reductions in pain ratings.11 EIH can also occur&#xD;
      during and following short duration (e.g., 1.5-5 min) and lower intensity (e.g., 15-50% max)&#xD;
      isometric exercise. Along with high-intensity training, long-duration/low-intensity isometric&#xD;
      contractions also have been found to produce an analgesic response. Studies have suggested&#xD;
      different post-exercise pain responses in chronic pain populations compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls, however questions still remain over the influence of various exercise intensities,&#xD;
      protocols or types of contractions. Slater, et al examined the effects of eccentric exercise&#xD;
      versus combined concentric-eccentric exercise at an intensity of 30% of max voluntary&#xD;
      contraction (MVC) showed a significant increase in pain thresholds for both exercise&#xD;
      protocols. Their study highlighted the need for further research to examine if changes also&#xD;
      occur in response to single exercise modes. To date, no studies have compared EIH produced by&#xD;
      isometric and concentric exercises at similar intensities and duration. Furthermore, little&#xD;
      research in EIH has compared various forms of exercise to non-exercising controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to EIH induced by aerobic exercise, the relationship of anaerobic exercise with&#xD;
      hypoalgesia indicates a common mechanism that may be related to the augmentation of the&#xD;
      central and peripheral nervous system through modulation of descending inhibition as well as&#xD;
      the release of pain-relieving substances. There is possibly an orchestra of overlying and&#xD;
      inter-related physiologic, social and psychologic mechanisms that contribute to hypoalgesia&#xD;
      response to exercise. Because of confounding effect of various processes of all of these&#xD;
      possible processes, it is important to evaluate specific exercise regimens that may provide&#xD;
      most pain relief within the context of clinical practice. Although there is good evidence&#xD;
      that long-duration aerobic, and high-intensity exercises modulate pain, these strategies may&#xD;
      be difficult to apply in a clinical setting due to the disabling nature of painful&#xD;
      conditions. Patients with such conditions may be more apt to comply with shorter duration&#xD;
      exercises at lesser intensity. No studies to date have specifically addressed differences in&#xD;
      pain response when comparing the EIH following anaerobic exercises using concentric and&#xD;
      isometric training bouts as well as to a non-exercising control condition. Investigation of&#xD;
      EIH in this study will improve understanding of nociceptive changes following therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine changes in pain following two different types of exercise (isometric versus&#xD;
      concentric contractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Pain will be significantly lower following both types of exercise in&#xD;
      comparison to the non-exercising control condition. Currently, it is unclear whether pain&#xD;
      responses will differ between the two exercise conditions since no previous research has been&#xD;
      conducted in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine whether men and women differ in pain responses following each exercise&#xD;
      type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: There will be no sex differences in the EIH responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose testing for EIH in healthy subjects by measuring potential differences in pressure&#xD;
      pain intensity ratings with isometric versus concentric contractions as well as a control&#xD;
      condition. This study seeks to determine if each of the two exercises produce EIH to same&#xD;
      extent or are there differences in hypoalgesic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: Pain intensity ratings: Subjects will rate pain intensity using a 0 (no&#xD;
      pain) to 100 (most intense pain imaginable) pain rating scale before and after application of&#xD;
      a validated pressure stimulator immediately prior to, and after exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Pain thresholds: Subjects will press a button attached to a timer out of&#xD;
      view of the subject when the pressure stimulus first becomes painful. This will utilize a&#xD;
      protocol recognized as a validated measurement of pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to examine the effect of exercise-induced hypoalgesia in healthy subjects. We will&#xD;
      utilize a three-treatment randomized design where all subjects will undergo two exercise&#xD;
      protocols as well as a control protocol on different dates. In order to essentially eliminate&#xD;
      carry-over effect, we have elected to use a washout period of &gt;48h to ensure adequate time&#xD;
      for relief of any muscle pain or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will first be tested for their one repetition voluntary maximum contraction (MVC)&#xD;
      for the type of exercise being tested that day. Subjects will then be allowed to rest for&#xD;
      10-15 minutes while we review with them the exercise protocol and have them fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires including demographics, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale. Immediately prior to exercise testing, we will record baseline pulse rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure readings. Pain ratings and thresholds for pressure stimuli, as described below, will&#xD;
      then be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then begin the exercise trial. Testing will be randomized so that subjects will&#xD;
      perform protocols of either; a non-exercising control, concentric exercise or isometric&#xD;
      exercise testing using all possible treatment sequences. Stratification for random sampling&#xD;
      will be done using a block randomization scheme. For concentric testing, subjects will&#xD;
      perform 5 sets of 20 reps at 30% MVC. When undergoing isometric exercise, subjects will&#xD;
      perform 5 sets of sustained muscle contraction using the same duration of time it took to&#xD;
      complete one set of 20 reps (as determined in pilot studies prior to initiation of this&#xD;
      study). There will be a one-minute rest period between sets. Concentric testing will utilize&#xD;
      a dumbbell with elbow flexion exercise. Isometric testing will be performed using a hand-grip&#xD;
      dynamometer. Each exercise will be performed with the dominant arm/hand. Following exercise,&#xD;
      subjects will also rate their perceived exertion and perceived muscle pain using the Borg&#xD;
      Scale and Cook Scale, respectively. These are widely accepted and validated measures of&#xD;
      perceived exertion and muscle pain. The control condition will consist of quiet rest for the&#xD;
      same duration as the exercise conditions. At the end of the session, subjects will fill out&#xD;
      two questionnaires: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Situational Catastrophizing Scale.&#xD;
      The validated questionnaires chosen to be completed at intake and post-testing will help to&#xD;
      identify any confounding emotional or behavioral traits that may influence pain threshold and&#xD;
      ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain testing will be conducted using a Forgioni-Barber pressure-pain stimulator to deliver&#xD;
      3000-gm force to the middle digit of the non-dominant middle finger for up to 120 seconds.&#xD;
      During stimulation, subjects will press a button attached to a timer when the pressure&#xD;
      stimulus first becomes painful (pain threshold) and will also rate their perceived pain&#xD;
      intensity using a 0-100 numeric pain rating scale at 20 second intervals during the 2 minute&#xD;
      exposure to the pressure stimulus. This validated protocol has been used in previous research&#xD;
      by investigators in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will insert the middle forefinger into the chute of the Forgioni-Barber pain&#xD;
      stimulator where a non-fixed Lucite edge will contact the finger with a constant application&#xD;
      of pressure from a 3 kg weight. This device creates a stimulus that is easy to apply and&#xD;
      produces a distinct pain sensation with rapid onset and offset. It produces no tissue damage&#xD;
      or psychological or physical health risk, and the subject is able to stop the stimulus at any&#xD;
      time. The pain intensity is repeatable and readily discriminable throughout the stimulus&#xD;
      application. Previous research has demonstrated that the Forgioni-Barber pressure-pain&#xD;
      stimulator device, using the described procedure, is a safe device that produces a painful&#xD;
      stimulus but does not cause tissue damage or injury. No significant adverse or side effects&#xD;
      have been experienced or are expected from the exercise or pain stimulus. Temporary&#xD;
      discomfort is expected during application of the pain stimulus, however this should resolve&#xD;
      upon removal of the stimulus. There are no permanent consequences expected of this testing&#xD;
      procedure. If the subject experiences excessive discomfort at any time during pain testing,&#xD;
      we will immediately remove the stimulus. The subjects may withdraw from testing at any time&#xD;
      during the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With exercise, there is a slight risk of muscle soreness or strain. We will mitigate risk of&#xD;
      muscle strain by instructing the subjects to stop the exercise if they feel they are&#xD;
      over-straining or begin to feel discomfort when performing the activity. The investigators&#xD;
      will also be immediately available to assist, if needed, if the subject experiences&#xD;
      discomfort during the exercise session. It is well known that repetitive contractions have a&#xD;
      possibility of inducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). This is known to occur most&#xD;
      often with eccentric exercises. Previous research has shown that there was no effect from&#xD;
      DOMS using the intended protocol described and that a washout period of 24 hours was adequate&#xD;
      with eccentric loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      32 healthy normotensive males and females in the age range 18 to 40 years will be recruited&#xD;
      from the community.&#xD;
