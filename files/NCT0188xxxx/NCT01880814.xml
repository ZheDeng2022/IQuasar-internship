      The purpose of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a pilot SMART (Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized) study with the&#xD;
           long-term goal of developing a personalized treatment for child depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect pilot data on ways to personalize treatment for child depression using&#xD;
           cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), caregiver-child treatment, or both.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child depression is among the most prevalent and impairing pediatric conditions and&#xD;
      constitutes a major public health concern. Unfortunately, treatment benefits are relatively&#xD;
      modest and short-lived with sizeable percentages of children who maintain depressive symptoms&#xD;
      following treatment. This problem may be addressed in part by personalizing treatment,&#xD;
      including determining which children will benefit from CBT, which children will benefit from&#xD;
      caregiver-child treatment, and which children will benefit from both. The goal of the current&#xD;
      study is to pilot test an innovative experimental design called Sequential, Multiple&#xD;
      Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART), which is used for development of personalized&#xD;
      treatments, collect pilot data, and assess the acceptability and feasibility of using this&#xD;
      design, in preparation for a full-scale SMART in a larger clinical trial and for the&#xD;
      development of personalized treatment.&#xD;
