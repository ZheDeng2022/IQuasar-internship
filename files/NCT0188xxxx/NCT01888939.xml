      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some studies in adults have found that insulin and glucose blood levels are lower when a&#xD;
      long period of sitting is broken up with walking, compared to sitting without breaks. This&#xD;
      means that the body can better process sugars when there are walking breaks during the day.&#xD;
      Researchers want to know if this is also true for children. Some studies have found that&#xD;
      children s attention and memory might be better after exercise. Researchers want to know if&#xD;
      short walking breaks have the same effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand if breaking up sitting with walking helps children s bodies better use sugars&#xD;
      and improves children s concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy children ages 7 to 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, exercise test,&#xD;
           picture vocabulary test, and medical tests including blood tests and X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for two 7-hour visits. In the month before the visits, they&#xD;
           will wear a physical activity monitor for one week so researchers know how active they&#xD;
           are. Once they will take the sitting only test and once the sitting breaks test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the sitting only test, participants will sit for 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the sitting breaks test, they will sit for 3 hours with 3-minute walking breaks&#xD;
           every 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both days, they will drink sugar water. Then the participants will have blood drawn from&#xD;
           a needle that is kept in place, and they will wear a heart monitor. They will take&#xD;
           attention and working memory tests on a computer and answer questions about how they&#xD;
           feel. They will eat a meal at the end of the test day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevention of pediatric obesity and its complications are U.S. public health priorities.&#xD;
      Promoting physical activity has been proposed as an intervention strategy. Apart from&#xD;
      reducing excessive weight, physical activity improves cardiovascular fitness, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, and academic performance. However, emerging evidence in adults suggests that&#xD;
      increased physical activity may not entirely counteract the negative health effects of a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary behavior is defined as a set of low-intensity activities involving limited body&#xD;
      movement (e.g.: TV viewing, prolonged sitting). TV viewing is associated with lower cognitive&#xD;
      functioning and depressive symptoms. Some studies found higher levels of childhood sedentary&#xD;
      behavior predicted higher body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol in adulthood, suggesting that&#xD;
      negative health consequences may begin early. Dunstan et al. conducted the first lab-based&#xD;
      study in adults investigating interrupting prolonged sedentary behavior with physical&#xD;
      activity breaks. The authors found that for overweight adults, adding 2-minute&#xD;
      moderate-intensity walking breaks every 20 minutes reduced postprandial insulin and glucose&#xD;
      responses by 23.0% and 29.6%, respectively. Thus, interrupting sedentary behavior may be an&#xD;
      intervention strategy to reduce health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children, cross-sectional observational studies indicate that sedentary behavior patterns&#xD;
      characterized by short bouts of activity are not associated with increased cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk. However to date, no in-lab studies have manipulated sedentary behavior in children.&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized crossover pilot feasibility study to assess&#xD;
      whether interrupting sedentary behavior influences metabolic and executive function,&#xD;
      attention, mood, anxiety, and dietary intake. Children, ages 7-11 years, will complete two&#xD;
      conditions in random order: 3 hours of prolonged sitting and 3 hours of sitting interrupted&#xD;
      with 3 minutes of moderate-intensity walking every 30 minutes. The specific aim of this&#xD;
      project is to investigate whether interrupting sedentary behavior improves metabolic&#xD;
      parameters and changes executive function, attention, mood, anxiety, and dietary intake. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that postprandial insulin incremental area under the curve (iAUC) will&#xD;
      be lower in the interrupted sitting vs. the prolonged sitting condition. The exploratory&#xD;
      secondary hypotheses are that glucose iAUC, executive function, attention, mood, anxiety, and&#xD;
      dietary intake will differ between the two conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate if interrupting sedentary time affects potential negative&#xD;
      health consequences of sedentary behavior in children. If interrupting sedentary time in&#xD;
      short bouts has beneficial effects among children, interventions examining the frequency,&#xD;
      duration, and intensity of such interruptions could be developed. Thus, these results have&#xD;
      the potential to provide insight into novel behavioral intervention targets in youth.&#xD;
