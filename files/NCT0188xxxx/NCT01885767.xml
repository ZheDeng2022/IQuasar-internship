      The NF Registry is a database of patient-reported symptoms, treatments, and experiences with&#xD;
      their neurofibromatosis disease. It is a contact registry to relay clinical trial&#xD;
      opportunities to targeted patient subgroups, and to supply de-identified disease data to&#xD;
      researchers. It has the potential to become a natural history resource.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients and parents of patients will be made aware of the Neurofibromatosis (NF) Registry&#xD;
      through various non-commercial information sources such as the Children's Tumor Foundation&#xD;
      (CTF) website, CTF-affiliated NF clinics, social media, CTF educational and fundraising&#xD;
      events, and other nonprofit organizations and foundations such as the National Organization&#xD;
      for Rare Diseases (NORD) and social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NF Registry will be accessed by individual adult (over age 18) subjects via a web-based&#xD;
      patient portal. The portal contains an IRB-approved informed consent form. Following consent,&#xD;
      the registrant creates an account which is activated after email confirmation. An account can&#xD;
      be created by an adult patient with the disorder, or by the parent or guardian of a child&#xD;
      with the disorder. Account creators are required to enter identifiable contact and&#xD;
      demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the account is created, the account owner enrolls themselves or a minor family member&#xD;
      (or both) and completes an on-line survey. There are separate surveys for NF1, NF2, and&#xD;
      Schwannomatosis. The surveys ask about about the affected individual's medical and family&#xD;
      history of the disease, testing and diagnosis, clinical manifestations (e.g., tumor types and&#xD;
      locations) interventions and therapies, and quality of life. The account holder chooses&#xD;
      whether to receive emails from the Registry with information about relevant clinical trials&#xD;
      and studies for which they may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's responses are used to compile charts and graphics of de-identified aggregate&#xD;
      data. Registered patients may view this data. Researchers may apply to our Data Use Committee&#xD;
      for access to de-identified data or for subject recruitment emails to be sent to specific&#xD;
      patient subgroups. Data capture and security for the NF Registry is done under contract by&#xD;
      OpenApp (Dublin, Ireland), a web-based patient opt-in registry provider.Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to update their information at least once a year. Their information will be stored in&#xD;
      the NF Registry for an indefinite period of time. This longitudinal study is intended as a&#xD;
      resource for patients and researchers. There is no specific outcome measure or anticipated&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
