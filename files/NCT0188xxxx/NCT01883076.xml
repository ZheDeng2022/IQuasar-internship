  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of injections of autologous&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells into the right ventricle of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome&#xD;
      (HLHS) children undergoing a scheduled Glenn surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if autologous stem cells from the&#xD;
      individual's own umbilical cord blood can be used to strengthen the muscle of the right side&#xD;
      of their heart. This will help determine the safety and feasibility of using cell-based&#xD;
      regenerative therapy as an additional treatment for the management of HLHS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I trial to determine the safety of autologous mononuclear cells (MNC)&#xD;
      derived from umbilical cord blood for intramyocardial delivery into the right ventricle&#xD;
      during a planned and non-emergent Stage II surgical palliation in subjects with HLHS. This is&#xD;
      the first critical step towards applying autologous MNC therapy as an add-on regenerative&#xD;
      intervention for congenital heart disease management. The choice of HLHS as the target&#xD;
      disease for regenerative therapies in congenital heart disease management is multi-factorial&#xD;
      and includes the following considerations: 1) Severity of of this incurable disease, 2)&#xD;
      palliative nature and burden of long-term outcomes with a single right ventricular system, 3)&#xD;
      three stages of planned surgical procedures that provide time points to adjunctively&#xD;
      intervene, and 4) prenatal diagnosis enabling planned collection of UCB. An emerging goal for&#xD;
      cardiac regeneration includes the application of cell-based technology to congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, which is a favorable substrate due to the lack of fibrotic scaring, and the presence&#xD;
      of a microenvironment that is expected to support ongoing cardiac proliferation and growth&#xD;
      for functional remuscularization. This Phase I safety study will determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      collection, processing, and delivery of autologous cells as used in adult cardiac&#xD;
      regenerative protocols in the setting of HLHS surgical management.&#xD;
