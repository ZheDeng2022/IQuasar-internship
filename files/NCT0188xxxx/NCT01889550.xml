      The research aims at generating new knowledge about ways to inform pregnant women about&#xD;
      prenatal screening for Downs syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this project is to increase pregnant women's knowledge of prenatal&#xD;
      screening for Downs syndrome, and thereby an option to make an informed choice. The project&#xD;
      is planned as a research into whether the use of an eHealth solution (in this project an&#xD;
      interactive website) may be an appropriate intervention for pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal screening and diagnosis is testing for diseases or rare conditions in the fetus&#xD;
      before birth. The aim is to assist the pregnant women to make their own decisions, and&#xD;
      neutral and adequate counseling is a prerequisite during prenatal diagnosis. To make an&#xD;
      informed choice, the pregnant women must be informed about the benefits and potential&#xD;
      disadvantages of prenatal diagnosis and with this background be able to make a comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation, where ethical values will have a high impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this project is to increase pregnant women's knowledge of prenatal&#xD;
      screening for Downs syndrome, and thereby an option to make an informed choice. The project&#xD;
      is planned as a research into whether the use of an eHealth solution (in this project an&#xD;
      interactive website) may be an appropriate intervention for pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part one consists of an identification of the problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part two consists of developing a website with relevant information about prenatal screening&#xD;
      for Downs syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part three is an effect measurement. The effect of the intervention is measured through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trail in which the essentials of the measurement will be the pregnant&#xD;
      women's knowledge and behavior in relation to prenatal diagnosis. Twice 300 pregnant women&#xD;
      will be included in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research aims at generating new knowledge about ways to inform pregnant women about&#xD;
      prenatal diagnosis and prenatal screening. The expected results are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher knowledge about prenatal diagnosis for the pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less difficulty in making an informed choice for the coming parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy access to high quality information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Equity in access to high quality information.&#xD;
