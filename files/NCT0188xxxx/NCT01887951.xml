      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice in Singapore Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) includes the use of analgesia&#xD;
      delivered via inhalation Enthanox (Nitrous Oxide). However there are difficulties&#xD;
      administering Enthanox on-scene due to the added weight of carrying bulky cylinder tanks. It&#xD;
      is common for a delay in administration of analgesia. Inhaled methoxyflurane (Penthrox) is a&#xD;
      potential agent for early administration of analgesia by Singapore Civil Defense Force (SCDF)&#xD;
      EAS. It is extensively used in the pre-hospital setting in Australia. However data on its use&#xD;
      as an analgesic agent in general are limited and there are few published controlled trials of&#xD;
      methoxyflurane in an analgesic role. Intramuscular (IM) tramadol is a common medication used&#xD;
      in the hospital setting for analgesia. It is well proven, simple to deliver and is not a&#xD;
      controlled drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Penthrox and Tramadol in the treatment of acute pain in patients transported by&#xD;
      the SCDF EAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 400 eligible patients over 1 year (200 Penthrox and 200 tramadol).&#xD;
      Patients managed by SCDF EAS for treatment of acute pain and who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be recruited into the study. Half of SCDF's 30 ambulances (15 ambulances), will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned, equipped and trained to carry the new medication (Penthrox). The other&#xD;
      half (15 ambulances), will be trained and equipped with tramadol. Allocation will be on a per&#xD;
      station level. After 6 months, they will cross over to Penthrox and tramadol respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paramedics will be trained to use both medications, pain scales and Ramsey scores, and&#xD;
      will record patient's pain, sedation scores and patient satisfaction as part of routine&#xD;
      clinical practice. All patients will be followed up by a review of their Emergency Department&#xD;
      and hospital records for any medication related adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with acute pain (pain score ≥3), presenting to&#xD;
      the ambulance service with musculo-skeletal trauma (limbs or back); pain relief by inhaled&#xD;
      methoxyflurane will be equivalent to IM tramadol, as assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after start of the study treatments.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice in Singapore Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) includes the use of analgesia&#xD;
      delivered via inhalation Enthanox (Nitrous Oxide). However there are difficulties&#xD;
      administering Enthanox on-scene due to the added weight of carrying bulky cylinder tanks. It&#xD;
      is common for a delay in administration of analgesia. In addition, there are problems with&#xD;
      storage, leakage, maintenance and occupational exposure of the EAS crew members. Therefore,&#xD;
      there is a need for better standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled methoxyflurane (Penthrox) is a potential agent for early administration of analgesia&#xD;
      by EAS. It is extensively used in the pre-hospital setting in Australia. However data on its&#xD;
      use as an analgesic agent in general are limited and there are few published controlled&#xD;
      trials of methoxyflurane in an analgesic role. Intramuscular (IM) tramadol is a common&#xD;
      medication used in the hospital setting for analgesia. It is well proven, simple to deliver&#xD;
      and is not a controlled drug. We intend to conduct a clinical evaluation trial comparing the&#xD;
      use of inhaled Penthrox with IM Tramadol for early pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective &amp; Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Penthrox (methoxyflurane) and Tramadol in the treatment of acute pain in patients&#xD;
      transported by the Singapore Civil Defense Force (SCDF) EAS with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain Score assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 5,10, 15 and 20 min after start of&#xD;
           the study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time arrived at scene to delivery of first analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to onset of analgesia (arrive at scene to ≥ 3 point reduction in pain score&#xD;
           assessed by VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand patients' perception of pain, satisfaction in pain management, and the use&#xD;
           of the analgesic inhaler compared with IM tramadol in the treatment of acute pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand staff satisfaction with pain management, and the ease of use of the&#xD;
           analgesic inhaler compared with IM tramadol in the treatment of acute pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Ramsay sedation scores at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after start of the study&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (i.e. Respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and GCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phased, prospective, non-randomised, before-after evaluation study comparing Penthrox&#xD;
      (Methoxyflurane) and Tramadol in patients with acute pain managed by SCDF EAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 400 eligible patients over 1 year (200 Penthrox and 200 tramadol). 200&#xD;
      samples of Penthrox will be provided free of charge by Medical Developments International&#xD;
      (MDI), an Australian company, for evaluation during the trial. Patients managed by SCDF EAS&#xD;
      for treatment of acute pain and who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited into the&#xD;
      study. Intramuscular tramadol will be purchased by SCDF for this implementation trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of SCDF's 30 ambulances (15 ambulances), will be randomly assigned, equipped and trained&#xD;
      to carry the new medication (Penthrox). The other half (15 ambulances), will be trained and&#xD;
      equipped with IM tramadol. Allocation will be on a per station level. After 6 months, the two&#xD;
      separate cohort of ambulances will cross over to administer Penthrox and Tramadol and&#xD;
      respectively. This is done in order to minimize any potential patient selection bias and&#xD;
      ambulance crew operator bias arising in the two 6-monthly time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paramedics will be trained to use both medications, the pain scales and Ramsey scores,&#xD;
      and will record patient's pain, sedation scores patient and staff satisfaction as part of&#xD;
      routine clinical practice. In the case when one or both study drugs are used up before the&#xD;
      cross-over period, or the patient is ineligible for either drug, SCDF ambulances will still&#xD;
      carry Enthanox as a back up analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGH will be submitting an ethics application to Centralised Institutional Review Board (CIRB)&#xD;
      on behalf of SCDF to recruit all cases presenting to SCDF, irrespective of destination&#xD;
      hospital. This is because SCDF does not have its own IRB. All patients will be followed up by&#xD;
      a review of their Emergency Department and hospital records for any medication related&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of Patients Patients will be given the treatment if all eligibility criteria are&#xD;
      met and treatment is indicated by protocol. For patients who do not meet inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for either of the new treatments, Enthanox will still be kept on&#xD;
      ambulances during the study period for back up analgesia. No written consent will be sought&#xD;
      as this will be part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Team members Contribution SCDF staff members will be enrolling eligible participants and&#xD;
      administer the study drugs. The SGH study team will provide clinical input into protocols,&#xD;
      physician oversight, training for paramedics, data quality control, analysis of data and&#xD;
      interpretation of results etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include the following specific elements for quality assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of standard protocols to perform all data collection and follow-up&#xD;
           activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development and adherence to a detailed Standard Operation Procedures (SOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of standardized forms and uniform criteria for patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardized data processing, editing and generation of edit statements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular communications between the study investigators to resolve questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internal and external monitoring of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional steps to ensure data quality include: range checks and verification built into the&#xD;
      data entry system and a sequence of logic checking and examination of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Subjects Instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A formal education and training program will be conducted for all paramedics who will be&#xD;
      administering both treatments to patients. This will include didactic and practical training&#xD;
      sessions, and competency certification before they will be allow to administer the treatment.&#xD;
      Paramedics will also be taught how to monitor patients, watch for adverse effects and how to&#xD;
      treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A formal education and training program will be conducted for all investigators who will be&#xD;
      conducting surveys to reduce the risks regarding confidentiality. All subjects' identifiers&#xD;
      will be removed from the database to protect subjects' confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of Penthrox and Tramadol will help to advise which drug can be used as a&#xD;
           standard drug in the EAS for treatment of acute pain patients. This study has the&#xD;
           potential to change practice in Singapore and beyond, and allow patients earlier relief&#xD;
           of pain and suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation Plan - No compensation will be provided to the patients or any family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Apply for waiver of consent for this study. Only collecting patients' pain scale&#xD;
      information from SCDF EAS. Therefore, it poses no additional risks to the patients. All&#xD;
      patient identifiers will be subsequently removed from the dataset.&#xD;
