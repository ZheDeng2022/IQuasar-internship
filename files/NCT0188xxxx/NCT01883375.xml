  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dying patients and their families face many challenges near the end-of-life. Not only do&#xD;
      patients often experience physical distress, but they also have feelings of loss of dignity,&#xD;
      isolation, and uncertainty. Family members also face many challenges. They bear witness to&#xD;
      the suffering of loved ones, and they face uncertainty, loss, and at times a mounting sense&#xD;
      of helplessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to introduce and evaluate a new intervention called Dignity&#xD;
      Talk, meant to enhance end-of-life experience for both patients and their families. Dignity&#xD;
      Talk is based on a set of questions by which terminally ill patients and their family members&#xD;
      can engage in meaningful conversations with each other. It is intended to lessen feelings of&#xD;
      loss and helplessness and enhance feelings of connectedness by facilitating conversations&#xD;
      that tap into a sense of meaning and purpose, sharing of memories, wishes, hopes, and giving&#xD;
      guidance to those who will soon be left behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, 20 patients and family members will help finalize the method and Dignity Talk&#xD;
      question framework (is it easy to understand, do the investigators have the right questions,&#xD;
      and is the wording sensitive). In Phase 2 of the study the investigators will ask 100&#xD;
      patient-family pairs for feedback about Dignity Talk: what influence it had on their&#xD;
      palliative care experience, whether it works well, and whether this intervention should&#xD;
      become a regular part of palliative care. The investigators will also ask for feedback from&#xD;
      health-care providers in both phases. We are requesting approval for an amendment to the&#xD;
      healthcare provider feedback focus group questions. Will add those documents when they are&#xD;
      approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four to six months after the death of their loved one, the investigators will contact the&#xD;
      family member to ask their thoughts about Dignity Talk, how it shaped their experience of&#xD;
      their grief and bereavement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the study will show that Dignity Talk can be an effective,&#xD;
      highly accessible palliative care intervention, which will enhance the end-of-life experience&#xD;
      for palliative patients and the families who support them.&#xD;
