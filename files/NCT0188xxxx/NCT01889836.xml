    <textblock>
      Clinical trial phase I, randomized, double blind, where 30 individuals will receive the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine while 30 other volunteers will receive a meningococcal C conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine already licensed in Brazil and available in the National Immunization Program for&#xD;
      children less than 12 months of age. The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety profile of the vaccine under test, which should allow its application in humans.&#xD;
      Secondly, the investigators will study its immunogenicity from the evaluation of the&#xD;
      correlates of seroprotection for meningococcal, defined by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO).&#xD;

      Study design - This is a clinical study Phase I, randomized, double blind with 60&#xD;
      individuals. 30 individuals will receive the experimental vaccine by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz&#xD;
      and 30 individuals will receive a meningococcal C conjugated vaccine used in the National&#xD;
      Immunization Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location of Study - Clinical Trials Unit for Immunobiology by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective - Evaluate the safety of the meningococcal C vaccine by&#xD;
      Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz for use in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the meningococcal C vaccine by&#xD;
      Bio-Manguinhos in young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the frequency / intensity of adverse events occurring up to 30 days after&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the seroconversion defined as pre-immunization serum nonreactive (negative)&#xD;
           and post-immunization reactor (positive) antigens, with getting titles 8 (rabbit&#xD;
           complement) to the target strain used in the test of bactericidal power of the sera from&#xD;
           immunized volunteers, a 4-fold increase in titers following vaccination compared to&#xD;
           pre-vaccination and antibody titers after immunization.&#xD;
