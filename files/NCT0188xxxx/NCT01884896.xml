      This is an open Label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover,&#xD;
      balanced, single dose pivotal study. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      bioequivalence between Test Product and the corresponding Reference Product under fasting&#xD;
      condition in healthy adult human subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:&#xD;
      Metoprolol Succinate 200 mg Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the corresponding Reference&#xD;
      Product: TOPROL-XL® (Metoprolol Succinate) extended release Tablets 200 mg of Astrazenica LP,&#xD;
      USA under fasting condition in healthy adult human subjects in a randomized crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted with 48 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 200 mg&#xD;
      dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization&#xD;
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 11 days including washout period of at&#xD;
      least 7 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.&#xD;
