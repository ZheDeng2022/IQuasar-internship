    <textblock>
      The study comprises a Phase I component during which the optimal dose of DCVax-Direct for the&#xD;
      treatment of solid tissue tumors will be identified, followed by a Phase II component to&#xD;
      determine if the injection of DCVax-Direct into selected solid tissue tumors has the ability&#xD;
      to reduce tumor growth.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria (summary):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18 and 75 years (inclusive) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 70 or higher or Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
             Group (ECOG) 0-1 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a histological or cytopathological confirmed diagnosis of a locally&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancy for which primary treatment is no longer&#xD;
             effective or does not offer curative or life-prolonging potential per clinician&#xD;
             judgment, with the understanding that DCVax-Direct is not intended as a treatment of&#xD;
             last resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not eligible for complete resection due to either tumor location, physician's&#xD;
             assessment or subject's choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have completed at least one recent treatment regimen in the metastatic or&#xD;
             advanced setting in the disease currently under treatment to reduce tumor burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any steroid therapy &gt;2 mg dexamethasone or equivalent dose should be stopped or have&#xD;
             been tapered down 2 weeks prior to the leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable tumor mass, i.e. a lesion that can accurately be measured by&#xD;
             CT/MRI in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 1 cm, that is accessible for&#xD;
             injection either with or without imaging (CT/ultrasound) guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate blood coagulation parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectation of &gt;3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (Summary):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive HIV-1, HIV-2, or Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II) tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of current or prior (within the last two years) active clinically significant&#xD;
             malignancy other than the tumor type for which DCVax-Direct treatment is considered,&#xD;
             and except for primary tumor in the case of metastases and adequately treated basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heavily pretreated (HP) subjects are not eligible for this study, unless treatments&#xD;
             have occurred more than 1 year in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of brain metastases, unless treated surgically and/or irradiated and&#xD;
             clinically stable off steroids or on low dose (&lt; 2 mg per day) steroids for ≥ 14 days,&#xD;
             or presence of leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immunodeficiency or unresolved autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement for ongoing immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
