    <textblock>
      The proposed research will develop, demonstrate the feasibility of, and pilot test in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial a prescription opioid taper support intervention. This&#xD;
      intervention aims to prevent opioid misuse and adverse events among patients receiving&#xD;
      chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain without evidence of current substance&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will yield information essential to planning a future, larger-scale RCT designed&#xD;
      to evaluate: 1) the efficacy of the intervention in preventing prescription opioid abuse,&#xD;
      misuse, overdose and other adverse events among patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for&#xD;
      chronic non-cancer pain, 2) the effects of the intervention on opioid use, pain, pain related&#xD;
      activity interference, and mood. Participants in our pilot study will be limited to those&#xD;
      without current opioid abuse or other substance abuse, but past substance abuse will be&#xD;
      allowed. This will provide a sample of patients at risk for opioid abuse, misuse and&#xD;
      overdose, but who may be able to taper their opioids successfully. Hypothesis: Patients&#xD;
      receiving chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain who are randomized to the opioid&#xD;
      taper support intervention, as compared with patients randomized to usual opioid prescribing&#xD;
      care, will have lower opioid average daily doses at 22 and 34 weeks.&#xD;
