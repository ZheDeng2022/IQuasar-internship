    <textblock>
      Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, like many other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, may&#xD;
      be associated with discomfort. Although upper endoscopy is usually of shorter duration and&#xD;
      better tolerated by patients, most trials investigating the influence of analgesia and&#xD;
      sedation have been performed on patients undergoing this procedure. Some patients may&#xD;
      tolerate colonoscopy without sedation, but various techniques are used to limit discomfort&#xD;
      and pain. Selection and dosing of sedatives depends on the patient's emotional state, the&#xD;
      intensity of pain during examination, foreseeable technical difficulties, the endoscopist's&#xD;
      experience, the presence or absence of anesthesia personnel, and hospital-specific&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conscious sedation is a popular technique for colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy. The combination of an opioid and a benzodiazepine is known to provide good&#xD;
      analgesic and sedative conditions during endoscopy. This combination of opioid and&#xD;
      benzodiazepine, however, also increases the risk of respiratory depression. Therefore,&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents which may provide adequate sedation without respiratory depression are&#xD;
      of great interest to clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative and analgesic&#xD;
      effects. Compared with clonidine, it is more selective for the α 2 adrenoceptor and acts as a&#xD;
      full agonist in most pharmacologic test models. Potentially desirable properties include&#xD;
      decreased requirements for other anesthetics and analgesics, a diminished sympathetic&#xD;
      response to stress and the potential for cardioprotective effects against myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia. When compared with conventional sedatives such as opioids or benzodiazepines, its&#xD;
      lack of respiration depression is a distinct advantage. Previous studies using&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine for sedation has been promising with maintenance of respiratory function.&#xD;
      Patients are readily arousable. With intravenous slow bolus administration, there is a&#xD;
      minimal increase in blood pressure initially, followed by a slight decrease in blood&#xD;
      pressure. Lower dose ranges, avoidance of rapid bolus injection, and a slow rate of&#xD;
      administration tend to decrease these circulatory side effects. Many clinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that it can be well and safely used intravenously, intramuscularly and transdermally.&#xD;
      Although not an officially technique, there are also reports of intranasal administration&#xD;
      resulting in fairly predictable onset in both adults and children.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate sedative effects using intranasal dexmedetomidine in upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy, side effects and&#xD;
      acceptability of sedation using intranasal dexmedetomidine by patients and endoscopist for&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blind randomized prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning to detect not less than 30% decrease of rescue propofol consumption when&#xD;
      using intranasal dexmedetomidine. Assuming the average propofol consumption for the upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy to be 40mg with SD=15mg, the required sample size with 80% power&#xD;
      of test is 25 per group at the 0.05 level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be randomly allocated to one of the following study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: Intranasal dexmedetomidine 1.5mcg/kg; Group P: Intranasal saline (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, rescue sedation will be provided by a patient-controlled sedation using&#xD;
      propofol/ alfentanil in both groups. Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) has been shown to&#xD;
      provide safe and effective sedation for the individual patient by allowing the patient to&#xD;
      decide whether he or she requires sedation and to determine the amount required. PCS has been&#xD;
      used for various procedures performed under local and regional anesthesia. PCS with propofol&#xD;
      and alfentanil has been used for sedation of patients during endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Written consent will be signed. No sedative premedication will be prescribed. The&#xD;
      patients will be fasted for 6 hours before the procedure. Then patients will be sent to the&#xD;
      endoscopy room about 1 hour before the procedure. A nasal catheter is positioned to deliver&#xD;
      oxygen if oxygen is needed. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 and&#xD;
      respiratory rate will be recorded. After obtaining baseline hemodynamic data (NIBP, HR) and&#xD;
      respiratory data (SpO2, RR), the patients will be asked to evaluate their baseline levels of&#xD;
      anxiety using a numerical rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intranasal study drugs will be administrated according to a code on a piece of folded&#xD;
      paper drawn randomly from a box. The patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups and sedation will be performed 1 hour before the procedure as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P) Placebo (0.015ml/kg); D) Intranasal dexmedetomidine 0.015ml/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before study drug administration, patients gently blow their noses. After baseline testing,&#xD;
      an investigator who is blind to the study medication will administers the study drug to each&#xD;
      naris and the patient remains in a semi-recumbent position with the head of the bed elevated&#xD;
      at a 20-40 angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After which, measurements including HR, NiBP, SpO2, RR will be recorded every 5 minutes while&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale of anxiety every 15 minutes. Sedation is evaluated by investigator&#xD;
      using Observer Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (OAA/S]) scale every 15 minutes. Both the&#xD;
      investigators and the subjects are blinded to the study medications. The patient will be&#xD;
      shown 2 cards of picture about 1 hour after the study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula will be inserted then. The degree of the cannulation pain will be&#xD;
      assessed as using NRSpaincannulation. The intravenous cannula is connected to a 50 mL syringe&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia pump containing 200 mg (20 mL) propofol and 0.5 mg (1 mL)&#xD;
      alfentanil, which will be provided as the rescue sedative medications. The drugs are&#xD;
      delivered in response to pressure on a hand-held button. Each bolus dose of 0.5 mL delivered&#xD;
      contained 4.8 mg propofol and 12 μg alfentanil. No loading dose was used and the lock out&#xD;
      time was set at zero. Despite the zero lock out time, a few seconds were required for the&#xD;
      pump to deliver the preset bolus. The PCA pump was programmed to deliver a bolus dose of 0.5&#xD;
      ml at 200 ml/h on patient's demand and the pump took 9 s to deliver the bolus, during which&#xD;
      time it would not respond to a further demand. Thus, the effective lockout time was 9s.&#xD;
      Patients are instructed in the use of the hand-held button before upper endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the cannulation, local anesthetic spray will be administered to the oropharynx or&#xD;
      rectum. 10 minutes after the local anesthesia, patient may start to push the button. When the&#xD;
      first dose of propofol and alfentanil is infused, patient will be asked whether there is any&#xD;
      pain of infusion, and the degree of the pain will be assessed as Numerical Rating Scale of&#xD;
      pain due to infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be started once the patients feel that they are relaxed. Vital signs&#xD;
      including NIBP, SpO2, HR, RR, and OAA/S will be monitored throughout the sedation and&#xD;
      procedure process every 5 minutes. If the patient becomes totally unresponsive or any adverse&#xD;
      event occurs, the procedure will be stopped. If the SpO2 falls to below 90% for more than 10&#xD;
      seconds, the endoscope will be removed and the patient's vital signs observed, and O2&#xD;
      administered as required by the attending anesthesiologist until the patient becomes&#xD;
      responsive again. Once the patient starts responding to command, the procedure will continue.&#xD;
      Duration of unresponsiveness would be recorded. The time of start of procedure and duration&#xD;
      of procedure and the frequencies of interruption due to patient events will be noted. The PCS&#xD;
      propofol and alfentanil will be terminated and disconnected from the patient when the&#xD;
      endoscopist indicates that the operative procedure is completed, and the dose consumption&#xD;
      recorded. The endoscopist will determine the operating conditions by evaluating the ease of&#xD;
      insertion and the patient's lack of motion and ability to obey commands, using&#xD;
      NRSsatisfactionendoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be transferred to the recovery room for monitoring for 30 minutes. The&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, RR and SpO2, and OAA/S) will be continued every 5 min.&#xD;
      When the patients are fully recovered, they will be asked if there is any pain and discomfort&#xD;
      and their severity will be assessed as NRSpain and NRSdiscomfort during the procedure.&#xD;
      Discomfort is defined as 'a feeling of uneasiness that interfered with the patient's ability&#xD;
      to relax'. They will also be asked if they remember any of the following events: the pictures&#xD;
      shown to them, the insertion of the endoscope, the discomfort and pain during the&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge criteria will be assessed as postanaesthesia discharge score hourly. When the&#xD;
      patients are fully recovered, defined as an OAA/S score of 5 and the postanaesthesia score is&#xD;
      more than 9, they are fit for discharge. Satisfaction evaluation of sedation will be graded&#xD;
      by the patients on NRS in satisfaction patient. They will be questioned on whether they think&#xD;
      that they have received an adequate amount of sedation, too little or too much, whether they&#xD;
      are relaxed and whether they will undergo the same procedure again.&#xD;
