      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma which is refractory&#xD;
             to curative therapy or established treatments. Histologic confirmation of the original&#xD;
             primary tumor is required. Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell&#xD;
             types are eligible: endometrioid adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least&#xD;
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional&#xD;
             techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT, and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by&#xD;
             spiral CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this&#xD;
        protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1 (Section 11.1). Tumors within a previously irradiated&#xD;
        field will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a&#xD;
        biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of&#xD;
        radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a documented FGFR2 activating mutation either on primary, recurrent&#xD;
             or metastatic biopsy. Over 90% of FGFR2 mutations occur at 7 codons. Activating&#xD;
             mutations are defined as the known FGFR2 hotspots at S252W, P253R, S373C, Y376C,&#xD;
             C383R, N550K, N550H, K660E.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received one or two prior regimen must have a GOG Performance Status&#xD;
             of 0, 1, or 2. Patients who have received three prior regimens must have a GOG&#xD;
             Performance Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;

             endometrial carcinoma. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation&#xD;
             as a radio-sensitizer will be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen. Patients may&#xD;
             have received prior anti-angiogenic compounds (i.e., bevacizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to two additional&#xD;

&#xD;
        Participating institutions will not exclude potential subjects from participating in this&#xD;
        or any study solely on the basis of ethnic origin or socioeconomic status. Every attempt&#xD;
