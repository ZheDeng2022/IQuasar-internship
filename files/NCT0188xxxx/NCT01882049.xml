      This study is to investigate the use the adjustable gastric band for the treatment of obesity&#xD;
      in adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss is related to the amount of energy or fuel obtained from the kinds and amounts of&#xD;
      food eaten. When the amount of exercise and dieting uses less fuel than the amount taken in,&#xD;
      the excess is stored as fat. The Adjustable Gastric Band used in this study is a tool to help&#xD;
      the participant loose weight along with healthy eating, diet and exercise. This study&#xD;
      involves minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery to place the adjustable band around the&#xD;
      upper part of the stomach to make a smaller stomach or pouch about the size of a golf ball.&#xD;
      One end of the band ends with a flat balloon that goes around the upper part of the stomach.&#xD;
      The opening from this small stomach can be changed to allow more or less food into the&#xD;
      intestine depending on the amount eaten and the amount of weight lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other end of the of the band ends in a filling port through which saline solution is&#xD;
      pumped with a needle through an attached tube to inflate or deflate the balloon. The filling&#xD;
      port is attached to the wall of the abdomen under the skin. Because the flow of food is&#xD;
      regulated by the band, most people feel full faster. This is how the appetite for food is&#xD;
      controlled and the why the person is likely to eat less with the band in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food is digested through the normal digestive process.&#xD;
