      A. Background Plantar fasciitis is the most common foot complaint in America, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 10% of people during their life time.9 It can be a painful and debilitating&#xD;
      condition which appears in both sedentary and active populations. A survey performed by the&#xD;
      Foot and Ankle Special Interest Group of the Orthopedic Section, APTA, found that 100% of&#xD;
      therapists reported PF as the most common foot condition seen in their clinic. 9&#xD;
      Approximately one million patients visit physicians for the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis.10 Chronic plantar fasciitis, previously thought to be an inflammatory&#xD;
      condition caused by repetitive microtearing of the plantar fascia, is now thought to be a&#xD;
      degenerative condition.5 The plantar aponeurosis, or fascia, functions to provide static&#xD;
      support of the longitudinal arch and dynamic shock absorption. It consists of 3 bands:&#xD;
      lateral, medial, and central. The central band originates from the medial tubercle of the&#xD;
      calcaneus and travels across the metatarsal heads to the phalanx of each toe.9 In the acute&#xD;
      stage, pain is commonly localized to the origin of the medial and central bands at the&#xD;
      plantar surface of the calcaneus.6 This pain is usually classified as a sharp or knife-like&#xD;
      pain upon initial standing. The pain occurs after a period of non-weight bearing and is often&#xD;
      the worst in the morning. Those in the chronic stages may report pain as being dull and achy.&#xD;
      Pain in this stage may also extend beyond the medial tubercle, extending into the central and&#xD;
      lateral bands. Pain at this stage does not usually subside after a few minutes of walking as&#xD;
      seen in the acute phase.6 Many factors contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis.&#xD;
      Anatomy, biomechanics and environment are factors which contribute to the development of this&#xD;
      condition.6 Pes planus, pes cavus feet, limited dorsiflexion, tight Achilles tendon, tight&#xD;
      hamstrings and obesity fall beneath anatomical causations. Biomechanical factors include weak&#xD;
      plantar flexor muscles and excessive subtalar joint pronation. Environmental factors include&#xD;
      weight bearing activities, foot wear and trauma.6 Certain diseases also place an individual&#xD;
      at increased risk. These may include diabetes, peripheral vascular neuropathy, Paget's&#xD;
      disease, Reiter's syndrome, and other autoimmune and neurologic disorders.8 Diagnosis is&#xD;
      mostly made upon clinical assessment and findings for classifying a patient with heel pain&#xD;
      into the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems&#xD;
      category of plantar fasciitis and associated International Classification of Functioning&#xD;
      Disability and Health impairment based category of heel pain.9 To date, there is no specific&#xD;
      treatment of choice for patients with plantar fasciitis. Multiple studies have been conducted&#xD;
      on various conservative treatment techniques but according to Crawford et al's Cochrane&#xD;
      Review, &quot;There is limited evidence upon which to base clinical practice.&quot; 1 The options&#xD;
      include: modalities, manual therapy, stretching, taping, night splints, steroid injections&#xD;
      and orthotic devices. Of all the previous interventions, there is strong evidence to support&#xD;
      the use of orthotic devices to provide temporary relief of symptoms.9 Traditional orthotic&#xD;
      devices are designed and casted with the subtalar and midtarsal joints in a neutral position.&#xD;
      They are hypothesized to limit excessive pronation, optimize biomechanical loading of the&#xD;
      foot, and off load the plantar fascia.10 Additionally, custom orthotics are costly and may&#xD;
      require the specialty services of an orthotist to cast the individual. Despite the cost and&#xD;
      time-intensive manufacturing process, custom orthotics are often worn for life and may prove&#xD;
      to be ineffective after 3 months.9 A recent pilot study proposed the benefit of temporary&#xD;
      foot orthoses casted in equinos position for plantar fasciitis treatment.2,3 As opposed to&#xD;
      the traditional casting method of subtalar and midtarsal joints in neutral, the equinos&#xD;
      position places the patient's foot in full plantar flexion and inversion. This casting&#xD;
      position is hypothesized to put the plantar fascia in a slackened position, therefore&#xD;
      reducing weight-bearing on the damaged tissue.2 Consequently, the aim of this randomized&#xD;
      control trial is to identify the possible effectiveness of the temporary use of an&#xD;
      inexpensive custom-made plantar fascia orthotic (PFO), fabricated in equinos position of the&#xD;
      foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Project Description Prior to study commencement a training session will be provided to&#xD;
      educate and ensure all investigators are able to perform examination, casting and accurately&#xD;
      provide instruction to all participants. All investigators will also be trained in&#xD;
      distribution and analysis of all outcome measures to be used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with subjects completing a medical screening questionnaire. All subjects&#xD;
      will then go through a formal physical examination that is conducted by one of the&#xD;
      investigators. Subjects meeting the criteria for admission and consenting to participate in&#xD;
      the study, will sign an informed consent form, and be included in the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to a control or experimental group via a random number generator. Subjects will then&#xD;
      complete two outcome measures to collect baseline data, the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure&#xD;
      (FAAM) and a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The FAAM has been shown to be a valid and&#xD;
      reliable self-reported outcome measure of lower leg, ankle, and foot function of a range of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders in a physical therapy setting. The FAAM asks patients to rate level&#xD;
      of difficulty in several activities of daily living and in sport specific activities. The&#xD;
      NPRS asks patients to rate the intensity of first step heel pain on scale of 0-10, with 0&#xD;
      equal to no pain and 10 equal to worst pain ever experienced. Additionally, a GRC has been&#xD;
      shown to be a valid and reliable method of assessing changes in quality of life over time. A&#xD;
      Global Rating of Change (GRC) will be collected throughout the study (baseline, two weeks,&#xD;
      four weeks, twelve weeks, and six months). Upon initial evaluation, researchers will also&#xD;
      complete a Foot Posture Index (FPI-6) for each subject to classify static foot posture in a&#xD;
      standing position. The FPI-6 looks at multiple bony landmarks of the foot in a full&#xD;
      weight-bearing position and gives each landmark a score based on its position during&#xD;
      standing. A total score is produced to describe the patient's foot type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following collection of baseline data, one of the researchers will begin fabricating the&#xD;
      individuals in the experimental group for a custom-made PFO. The custom-made PFO will be&#xD;
      completed by placing subject's foot in the equinos (plantar flexed and inverted) position.&#xD;
      The custom-made PFO will be created from Aqua-Plast casting material. After heating the&#xD;
      Aqua-Plast material, researchers will drape the material over their forearm to ensure that it&#xD;
      isn't too hot for the subject. When the orthosis is hardened, the subject will place it in&#xD;
      his/her shoe (after removing any shoe liners). Researchers will trim, stretch, or pad the&#xD;
      orthosis as needed to make sure it is completely comfortable. If the orthosis is rubbing or&#xD;
      is otherwise found to be uncomfortable, the rough edges will be reheated and smoothed with a&#xD;
      finger or a grinder will be used to taper the edges. Subjects will be told to come in at any&#xD;
      time to make any needed changes. Full instructions for construction of the custom-made PFO&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group subjects will be asked to wear a faux orthotic that will be constructed of a&#xD;
      soft material that will cushion, but not support, the plantar fascia. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to wear either the PFO or faux orthotic at all times while weight bearing for a two week time&#xD;
      frame during the initial treatment period. An exception will be made for showering, in which&#xD;
      the subjects will be instructed to weight-bear on the lateral side of the foot to avoid&#xD;
      pronation and pulling on the plantar fascia. After two weeks, subjects will be weaned off of&#xD;
      the orthotic for one week. Weaning includes wearing orthotic 8 hours per day, following a&#xD;
      stretching program that includes a Windlass (plantar fascia) stretch with soft tissue&#xD;
      mobilization and calf stretch, and ankle range of motion exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plantar fascia stretch will consist of the patient sitting and placing his/her affected&#xD;
      foot crossed over the opposite knee and then using his/her hand to pull the toes and ankle&#xD;
      back towards the anterior surface of the lower leg. Once in position the patient will&#xD;
      continue to hold the stretch and apply deep pressure to the plantar fascia from heel to toe&#xD;
      with his/her fingers, thumbs, or knuckles. This activity will be carried out for three&#xD;
      minutes.2 For the gastrocnemius and soleus stretch, the patient will stand 46-61cm away from&#xD;
      a wall, place his/her hands on the wall at shoulder level, and then bend the knee of the&#xD;
      uninvolved leg, while extending the leg of the involved side so that the foot is about 30cm&#xD;
      back. Keeping the back knee straight, the patient will lean slowly in to the wall while&#xD;
      maintaining his/her heel on the floor and hold this stretch for 30 seconds. This stretch will&#xD;
      be repeated four times per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle range of motion exercises will be completed prior to the patient getting out of bed&#xD;
      each morning and will consist of the patient: dorsiflexing and plantar flexing his/her ankle&#xD;
      on the involved side, with the knee straight and with the knee bent, ten times in each&#xD;
      position; and performing clockwise and counter-clockwise ankle circles ten times in each&#xD;
      direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's outcome indicators will be recorded at the end of two weeks, four weeks, twelve&#xD;
      weeks, and six months following casting. The following outcome measures will be used: NPRS,&#xD;
      FAAM, FPI-6, and GRC. Subjects will be seen in the clinic for the initial exam, two, four,&#xD;
      and twelve week follow-up intervals, with the final six month follow-up conducted via e-mail,&#xD;
      telephone, and postal mail, per the subject's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Subject Recruitment Convenience sampling will be implemented in selecting up to 60&#xD;
      subjects from a population of individuals with chronic plantar fasciitis who have either&#xD;
      received, or not received treatment in the previous three months for the same condition.&#xD;
      Following IRB approval, clinical sites, running stores and university campus will be&#xD;
      solicited for recruitment of participants. Inclusion for our sample will include: age 18&#xD;
      years or older, able to tolerate the physical examination and treatment procedures, symptoms&#xD;
      greater than four weeks, able to read, write, and speak sufficient English to be able to&#xD;
      complete the outcome tools, plus two of three of the following: symptom reproduction with&#xD;
      palpation of the proximal plantar fascia insertion and/or mid substance of plantar fascia,&#xD;
      positive Windlass test and/or first step pain after period of inactivity. A positive Windlass&#xD;
      test consists of symptom reproduction when the first metatarsophalangeal joint is placed into&#xD;
      passive extension while the patient is in a standing position. Exclusion criteria for our&#xD;
      sample will include: current symptoms consistent with a lumbar radiculitis, radiculopathy, or&#xD;
      myelopathy, history of foot or ankle fracture with or without the presence of hardware from&#xD;
      an open reduction internal fixation, positive tarsal tunnel syndrome test, known or suspected&#xD;
      pregnancy, and systemic Rheumatic disease, or those undergoing litigation for any medical&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Confidentiality of Data The subjects will be carefully screened so as to eliminate any&#xD;
      possible risks from the protocol. The screening, evaluation and treatment will be performed&#xD;
      by physical therapists or senior physical therapy students fully trained to perform all&#xD;
      procedures under their scope of practice. As is the standard of practice, the investigator&#xD;
      will communicate with the subject during the entire process to ensure that each subject is&#xD;
      informed throughout the treatment protocol. All records will be kept confidential per HIPAA&#xD;
      and university operating procedures. No personal identifying information about any subject in&#xD;
      the study will be released to anyone. Data will be secured in locked rooms and on computers&#xD;
      that are password-protected and only accessible to the investigators in the study. In the&#xD;
      unlikely event of an adverse response to treatment, subjects will be provided appropriate&#xD;
      physical therapy and medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Risk to Subjects The effect of custom-made orthotics fabricated with Aquaplast for the&#xD;
      treatment of plantar fasciitis is not well documented in the literature. However, this is a&#xD;
      non-invasive, patient-directed treatment with minimal known risks, and considered safe and&#xD;
      ethical practice. A faux orthotic is also a low-risk treatment method that does not pose any&#xD;
      risk to the health of control subjects. Risks would include blisters and abrasions from the&#xD;
      orthotic rubbing on the foot and soreness or pain associated with the changes of joint&#xD;
      alignments due to the orthotic. The subjects will be instructed to return immediately, or&#xD;
      call the researchers, if there is any pain associated with the wear of either orthotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Benefits Experimental participants will benefit from this study by receiving treatment&#xD;
      that will attempt to eliminate, or significantly reduce, heel pain associated with plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis, which may yield an effective, non-invasive, treatment strategy to eliminate the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis. Upon completion of the study subjects in the&#xD;
      control group will be offered the PFO, if results show significant improvement for the&#xD;
      experimental group. All subjects in the experimental group will be able to keep their PFO's.&#xD;
