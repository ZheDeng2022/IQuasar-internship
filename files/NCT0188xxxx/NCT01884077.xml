      Specific Aim: To compare early postoperative pain relief in patients over the age of 70 who&#xD;
      undergo either Total Shoulder Arthroplasty or Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty in treatment of&#xD;
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Early postoperative pain relief will be greater in those undergoing Reverse&#xD;
      Shoulder Arthroplasty.&#xD;

      The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the human body with a complex arrangement of&#xD;
      structures working together to provide the movement necessary for daily life. Great mobility&#xD;
      comes at the expense of stability. Several bones and a network of soft tissue (ligaments,&#xD;
      tendons, and muscles) work together to produce shoulder movement. They also interact to keep&#xD;
      the joint in place while it moves through extreme ranges of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BONES The glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) is a multiaxial, synovial ball and socket joint&#xD;
      and involves articulation between the shoulder blade and the head of the humerus (upper arm&#xD;
      bone). This makes it the most mobile joint of the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFT TISSUE The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize&#xD;
      the shoulder. The four muscles of the rotator cuff are over half of the seven scapulohumeral&#xD;
      muscles. These tendons can become torn following a trauma to the shoulder or it can occur&#xD;
      through the &quot;wear and tear&quot; on tendons, most commonly the supraspinatus tendon found under&#xD;
      the acromion. To be considered an equal candidate for both implants the rotator cuff must be&#xD;
      grossly intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARTHRITIS Glenohumeral (shoulder) arthritis is a common source of pain and disability that&#xD;
      affects up to 20% of the older population. Damage to the cartilage surfaces of the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint (the shoulder's &quot;ball-and-socket&quot; structure) is the primary cause of&#xD;
      shoulder arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHOULDER REPLACEMENTS There are two types of total shoulder replacement systems: the&#xD;
      conventional Total shoulder and the Reverse shoulder. The reverse was originally developed&#xD;
      for use in patients with advanced high loss of shoulder function in conjunction with a&#xD;
      damaged rotator cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOTAL In a conventional Total shoulder, the arthritic surface of the ball is replaced with a&#xD;
      metal ball with a stem that is press fit in the inside of the arm bone (humerus) and the&#xD;
      socket is resurfaced with a component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVERSE In a Reverse Total shoulder the ball is located on the shoulder blade (glenoid) and&#xD;
      the socket is located on the arm bone (humerus), exactly the opposite of the situation in a&#xD;
      conventional total shoulder. The ball (glenosphere) is screwed to the bone of the shoulder&#xD;
      blade. The cup (humeral sock¬et) is fixed to a stem that is cemented down the inside of the&#xD;
      arm bone (humerus). This configuration provides sta¬bility because the muscles around the&#xD;
      shoulder compress the ball and socket together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES Randomization to either a total or reverse shoulder replacement Review of&#xD;
      medical records and imaging related to patient's shoulder arthritis and surgery Range of&#xD;
      motion and strength testing at enrollment and two years post op Completion of American&#xD;
      Shoulder &amp; Elbow Survey and WOOD at enrollment and two years post op&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are clear clinical indications for the use of the total and reverse shoulder&#xD;
      replacements in patients younger than 70 years old and they are based on cuff integrity and&#xD;
      shoulder function. However, the decision to use the total shoulder implant or the reverse&#xD;
      total shoulder implant in patients over 70 yrs old with end-stage glenohumeral (shoulder)&#xD;
      arthritis and an intact rotator cuff is based on surgeon's preference. There are no studies&#xD;
      comparing pain relief for these two implants in this patient population. So this study will&#xD;
      randomize 34 patients to either total or reverse shoulder replacements. These individuals&#xD;
      must meet the clinical criteria to be a candidate for either implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty has revolutionized the management of complex shoulder pain&#xD;
      and dysfunction due to rotator cuff tear arthropathy since its FDA approval in 2003. The&#xD;
      indications for the use of the Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty continue to expand and early&#xD;
      results are encouraging for patients with arthritis in the setting of a massively torn&#xD;
      rotator cuff. However, the role of the Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty to manage pain secondary&#xD;
      to osteoarthritis of the shoulder in the setting of an intact rotator cuff with underlying&#xD;
      age-related rotator cuff degeneration is not clear and remains a challenging clinical&#xD;
      question. This question continues to gain significance as the number of patients with&#xD;
      shoulder arthritis is rapidly growing as is the number of arthroplasty procedures performed&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glenohumeral (shoulder) arthritis occurs when the normally smooth joint surfaces of glenoid&#xD;
      and the humeral head are damaged by congenital, metabolic, traumatic, degenerative, vascular,&#xD;
      septic or aseptic inflammatory factors. The prevalence of Glenohumeral arthritis increases&#xD;
      with age.1-3 Several studies have evaluated for the prevalence of Glenohumeral arthritis and&#xD;
      found that it can be found in up to 16% of the elderly population.4-7 Arthritis of the&#xD;
      shoulder has been reported to be a source of severe disability and limitation of the quality&#xD;
      of life of those who experience it.8, 9&#xD;
&#xD;
      End stage shoulder arthritis is reliably treated with shoulder arthroplasty. The shoulder is&#xD;
      the third most common joint in the body that is replaced. The incidence of shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty procedures (including hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty) is increasing steadily in the United States.10 In 1998 approximately&#xD;
      19,000 shoulder arthroplasty procedures were performed. In 2008 approximately 47,000 shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty procedures were performed. The incidence of total shoulder arthroplasty has&#xD;
      steadily outpaced that of hemiarthroplasty as the preferred choice for management of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. The Reverse shoulder arthroplasty was approved by the FDA in 2003 and since&#xD;
      then has steadily gained in popularity. As the elderly population continues to grow and&#xD;
      arthroplasty techniques evolve, the number of shoulder arthroplasty performed annually is&#xD;
      expected to continue to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total shoulder arthroplasty relies on an intact and functioning rotator cuff in order to keep&#xD;
      the prosthetic head centered on the prosthetic glenoid. Rotator cuff deficiency has been&#xD;
      associated with early glenoid component loosening after total shoulder arthroplasty resulting&#xD;
      in shoulder pain, dysfunction and revision arthroplasty surgery.8, 11 Rotator cuff&#xD;
      degeneration is also associated with advancing age.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenario of age-associated rotator cuff degeneration in conjunction with chronic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis is a common clinical presentation. The shoulder with chronic osteoarthritis in&#xD;
      the setting of a degenerative or atrophic rotator cuff presents a challenging clinical&#xD;
      question. From a management standpoint the question arises of whether the patient would be&#xD;
      best served with a total shoulder arthroplasty or a reverse shoulder arthroplasty. A total&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty is the gold standard arthroplasty option but requires an intact and&#xD;
      functional rotator cuff to function properly and an elderly patient is more likely to have&#xD;
      rotator cuff degeneration and dysfunction. Rotator cuff dysfunction may be revealed early&#xD;
      after undergoing a total shoulder arthroplasty and range of motion improves. Secondary&#xD;
      rotator cuff dysfunction after total shoulder arthroplasty is becoming an increasingly&#xD;
      recognized entity and clinical challenge.13 Conversely, a reverse shoulder arthroplasty does&#xD;
      not require a functional rotator cuff and has been noted to have promising results but is an&#xD;
      arthroplasty option with less predictable outcomes and less clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been published that discuss patient outcomes after shoulder arthroplasty.8,&#xD;
      14-17 These studies are limited by small patient populations, limited follow-up, and&#xD;
      heterogeneity of patient populations and surgical indications. No study has compared Total&#xD;
      Shoulder Arthroplasty with Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty in the treatment of osteoarthritis&#xD;
      in the population older than 70 years of age. The Shoulder and Elbow service at Washington&#xD;
      University is uniquely qualified to conduct a study of this type given the exceptionally&#xD;
      large surgical volume of shoulder arthroplasty (over 350 shoulder arthroplasty cases&#xD;
      performed annually), access to Ultrasonography for imaging of all study participants and a&#xD;
      robust and well-organized research infrastructure that can execute established research&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
