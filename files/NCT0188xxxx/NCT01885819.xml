    <textblock>
      Autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) injected at 8 and 10 days after extraction is safe&#xD;
      and useful procedure in inducing remission of RA in patients resistant to standard DMARD&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of&#xD;
      autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells administered to 20 patients with disease&#xD;
      modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-resistant Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have been&#xD;
      nonresponsive to at least one course of one DMARD selected from a group comprising of: gold&#xD;
      salts, leflunomide, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of safety will be defined as freedom from treatment associated adverse&#xD;
      events for the period of one year. The secondary objective of efficacy will include&#xD;
      evaluation at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3 and 6 of efficacy endpoints of CRP, ESR,&#xD;
      anti-citrulline antibody, RF, Quality of Life Questionnaire, 28-joint disease activity score&#xD;
      (DAS28), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and immunological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
