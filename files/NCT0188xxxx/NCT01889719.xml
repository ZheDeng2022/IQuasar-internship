      This trial will investigate whether immunizations with an MVA recombinant HIV vaccine are&#xD;
      safe and whether they will boost immune responses generated by immunizations with a dendritic&#xD;
      cell (DC) targeted protein vaccine, DCVax-001, plus poly ICLC in healthy HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

      This trial will investigate whether immunizations with an MVA recombinant HIV vaccine are&#xD;
      safe and whether they will boost immune responses generated by immunizations with a dendritic&#xD;
      cell (DC) targeted protein vaccine, DCVax-001, plus poly ICLC in healthy HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      volunteers. Investigators propose to assess the quality of immunity elicited by immunizations&#xD;
      with MVA-CMDR only or by booster immunizations with MVA-CMDR in volunteers previously&#xD;
      immunized with a DC-targeted HIV vaccine. This vaccination regimen can provide the&#xD;
      proof-of-concept that DC targeted protein vaccines can prime strong immune responses and&#xD;
      therefore be valuable in combination with other vaccine modalities against HIV or other&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
