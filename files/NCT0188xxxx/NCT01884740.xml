  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) malignancies are the second most common malignancy and the most&#xD;
      common solid tumor of childhood, including adolescence. Annually in the United States,&#xD;
      approximately 2,200 children are diagnosed with CNS malignancy and rates appear to be&#xD;
      increasing. CNS tumors are the leading cause of death from solid tumors in children. Survival&#xD;
      duration after diagnosis in children is highly variable depending in part on age at&#xD;
      diagnosis, location of tumor, and extent of resection; however, most children with high grade&#xD;
      glioma die within 3 years of diagnosis. All patients with high grade glioma experience a&#xD;
      recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy&#xD;
      are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently&#xD;
      used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have shown in&#xD;
      previous phase I trials that a single Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI)&#xD;
      of Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab is safe for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) in adults, and we are currently evaluating the efficacy of this treatment.&#xD;
      Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that we&#xD;
      seek to test the hypothesis that intra-arterial Cetuximab and Bevacizumab is safe and&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of relapsed/refractory glioma in patients &lt;22 years of age. We&#xD;
      expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI&#xD;
      Cetuximab and Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma in patients &lt;22 years of age and may&#xD;
      alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.&#xD;

      The experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol&#xD;
           25%; 10 mL over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique&#xD;
           has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of&#xD;
           chemotherapy for malignant glioma. We have used this without complication in our&#xD;
           patients from our Phase I protocols as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To treat patients &lt;22 years of age with recurring or relapsing glioma with a single&#xD;
           intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of Cetuximab and Bevacizumab. Our Phase I trials have&#xD;
           demonstrated the safety of SIACI delivery of these drugs in adults. This trial will&#xD;
           focus on the safety and efficacy in patients &lt;22 years of age.&#xD;

        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients, under 22 years of age, with a documented histologic diagnosis&#xD;
             of relapsed or refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA),&#xD;
             fibrillary astrocytomas (FA), pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PXA), oligodendroglioma, or&#xD;
             anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AOA), or radiologically diagnosed brainstem glioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *A confirmed tumor site is one in which is biopsy-proven with the exception of&#xD;
             brainstem glioma which will be eligible with radiographic diagnosis. NOTE:&#xD;
             Radiographic procedures (e.g., Gd-enhanced MRI or CT scans) documenting existing&#xD;
             lesions must have been performed within three weeks of treatment on this research&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a Karnofsky or Lansky performance status 70%. Karnofsky is used for&#xD;
             patients older than or equal to the age of 16 years and Lansky for those under 16&#xD;
             years old and an expected survival three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No chemotherapy for three weeks prior to treatment under this research protocol and no&#xD;
             external beam radiation for eight weeks prior to treatment under this research&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have adequate hematologic reserve with absolute neutrophils greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 1000/mm3 and platelets greater than or equal 100,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pre-enrollment chemistry parameters must show: bilirubin less than 1.5X the&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal (IUNL); AST or ALT less than 2.5X IUNL and&#xD;
             creatinine less than 1.5X IUNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pre-enrollment coagulation parameters (PT and PTT) must be less than 1.5X the IUNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concomitant Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Growth factor(s): Must not have received within 1 week of entry onto this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Steroids: Systemic corticosteroid therapy is permissible in patients with CNS tumors&#xD;
             for treatment of increased intracranial pressure or symptomatic tumor edema. Patients&#xD;
             with CNS tumors who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose&#xD;
             for at least 1 week prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients of reproductive age must agree to use a medically effective method of&#xD;
             contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A&#xD;
             pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing&#xD;
             potential immediately prior to entry into the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients or their parents/guardians must be able to understand and give written&#xD;
             informed consent. Informed consent must be obtained at the time of patient screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Because of known concerns with Avastin and wound healing, craniotomy patients are&#xD;
             eligible for the treatment if they have had a craniotomy greater than two weeks prior&#xD;
             to IA therapy. Craniotomy or major procedure after SIACI Avastin therapy should wait 4&#xD;
             weeks. Minor surgeries may be performed after two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous treatment with Avastin and Cetuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females of childbearing potential and fertile men will be informed as to the potential&#xD;
             risk of procreation while participating in this research trial and will be advised&#xD;
             that they must use effective contraception during and for a period of three months&#xD;
             after the treatment period. If they do not agree, they will be ineligible for the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with significant concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would&#xD;
             place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with&#xD;
             treatment or post-treatment clinical monitoring.&#xD;
