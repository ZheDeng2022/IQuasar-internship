    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TXA127 to reduce the incidence&#xD;
      (Grade II-IV) of acute Graft-vs.-Host Disease (aGVHD) in adult subjects undergoing allogeneic&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The study will also evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of TXA127 on incidence, severity and duration of mucositis; neutrophil engraftment and&#xD;
      platelet recovery; platelet transfusion requirements; immune reconstitution; and duration of&#xD;
      corticosteroid use. TXA127 has shown to be well tolerated by patients and appears to induce&#xD;
      rapid production of neutrophils and platelets in the bloodstream, as well as increase the&#xD;
      immune system components. TXA127 has also been shown reduce the severity of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is increasingly used as an&#xD;
      effective treatment for malignant disease. The three most common sources for stem cells used&#xD;
      in HSCT are bone marrow (BM), umbilical cord blood (UCB), and peripheral blood stem cells&#xD;
      (PBSC). In a retrospective review of 1,525 adults with acute leukemia receiving allogeneic&#xD;
      transplants between 2002 and 2006, UCB accounted for 10.8%, PBSC for 58.2%, and BM for 31% of&#xD;
      the population (Eapen et al., 2010). PBSC as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for&#xD;
      transplantation has advantages over bone marrow in terms of donation ease and comfort and&#xD;
      over cord blood in terms of adequate cell dose. However, PBSC transplantations are associated&#xD;
      with an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Based on current literature&#xD;
      acute GVHD (aGVHD) is reported in 48-80% of PBSCT recipients (Eapen et al., 2010, Ferrara et&#xD;
      al., 2009). Additionally, the myeloablative conditioning regimens used for these transplants&#xD;
      often result in mucositis which can be debilitating to patients. TXA127 is&#xD;
      pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7, a non-hypertensive derivative of angiotensin II.&#xD;
      TXA127 has multilineage effects on hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and in vivo. The&#xD;
      hematopoietic properties demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies support the&#xD;
      investigation of TXA127 to reduce the incidence of aGVHD and mucositis in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <description>Time to initial neutrophil engraftment is defined as the number of days from PBSC transplant to the first of 3 consecutive days of an ANC ≥0.5 × 10^9/L. Time to initial platelet recovery is defined as the number of days from PBSC transplant to the first of 3 consecutive platelet count measurements tested on different days with a count ≥20 × 10^9/L with no platelet transfusion in the prior 7 days.</description>
