  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (n=60) of&#xD;
      limited duration (12 weeks), and found that compared with placebo, oral mirtazapine, an&#xD;
      FDA-approved antidepressant, significantly reduced meth use in those receiving mirtazapine,&#xD;
      as determined by reduction in meth-positive urines. Sexual risk behaviors also declined&#xD;
      significantly in the mirtazapine arm compared to placebo. Mirtazapine decreased meth use&#xD;
      despite low adherence: by medical event monitoring system (MEMS) caps, only 48.5% of daily&#xD;
      doses were taken. All participants received weekly substance use counseling and monthly,&#xD;
      brief clinician-delivered adherence counseling. The investigators propose expanding upon&#xD;
      these results by lengthening the treatment period to 24 weeks, with adherence reminders added&#xD;
      to the counseling, and determining if efficacy is sustained up to 12 weeks after drug&#xD;
      discontinuation. The sample size for this 9-month study is 120.&#xD;
