  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study human recombinant placental alkaline phosphatase (hRESCAP) will be&#xD;
      investigated. Alkaline Phosphatase is naturally present in the body and reported to use&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharde (LPS, bacterial endotoxins) and extracellular nucleotides leaking from&#xD;
      damaged and ischemic cells as physiological substrates. The LPS-substrate prevalence makes&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase an interesting novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of LPS-mediated&#xD;
      diseases. A bovine homologue of this protein (bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase, BIAP)&#xD;
      has previously been investigated for treatment of acute inflammatory responses such as&#xD;
      sepsis, and was shown to be safe in humans. hRESCAP, which will be investigated in the&#xD;
      current study, is expected to have a longer half-life in humans than the previously&#xD;
      investigated BIAP, due to the fact that it is more sialylated. The possibility to increase&#xD;
      the t1/2 to days instead of minutes enables treatment of chronic diseases.&#xD;

      In the current study the peak plasma concentration (pharmacokinetics/elimination) of&#xD;
      [14C]-labelled hRESCAP in healthy volunteers will be investigated at increasing single doses&#xD;
      (up to anticipated therapeutic dose), with a microdose (≤30 nmol) as a safe starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: To assess the peak plasma concentration of a single microdose (≤30 nmol) of a&#xD;
           recombinant human protein (hRESCAP), administered intravenously, as a suitable technique&#xD;
           to predict the pharmacokinetics in humans at pharmacologically relevant doses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: To determine the safety and tolerability of single dose of hRESCAP up to 5300 µg&#xD;
           in healthy male volunteers administered intravenously;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the peak plasma concentration of hRESCAP in healthy male volunteers within&#xD;
           a pharmacologically relevant dose-range and compare this with BIAP pharmacokinetics with&#xD;
           emphasis on half-life (t1/2).&#xD;
