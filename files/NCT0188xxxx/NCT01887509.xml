  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This innovative study will involve the use of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, a&#xD;
      new medical imaging technology never used for surgical indications to date. Virtual biopsies&#xD;
      (pCLE images) will be compared to histopathology analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the evaluation of rectal tumor margins. The hypothesis is that pCLE&#xD;
      will allow identification of rectal tumor margin, comparable to that of histopathology. In&#xD;
      the future, decision of resection margin could rely on intraoperative pCLE exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a feasibility study, first in the indication of rectal cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Defining the limits of resection of rectal tumors is often imprecise. The identification of&#xD;
      the banks of a tumor becomes critical when it comes to the decision to potentially sacrifice&#xD;
      the sphincter during the surgical resection. Currently tumor margins are identified by direct&#xD;
      examination by the surgeon, or using flexible endoscopy. Endoscopy and confocal microscopy&#xD;
      could provide precise images of tumor enabling the reliable definition of resection margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There would be a direct benefit for the patient, whom sphincter could be preserved. pCLE&#xD;
      (probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy) has already been widely used for colorectal&#xD;
      lesions, and its value proposition has been demonstrated and validated in several studies.&#xD;
      This study is the first using pCLE intraoperatively. Study results may lead the use of pCLE&#xD;
      to validate surgical procedure decision (resection margin) and to a revision of patient&#xD;
      management for colorectal cancer, by adapting neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to the patient's&#xD;
      responder status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to identify tumor margin (lower pole) to optimize the resection margin, and to&#xD;
      limit resection of healthy rectal tissue for optimal anal sphincter preservation. Moreover,&#xD;
      determining the optimal date of surgery following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in rectal&#xD;
      cancer is being discussed and no consensus has been reached. Therefore, to date, there is no&#xD;
      formal evaluation of tumor response. This is partly due to the lack of information on tumor&#xD;
      state and tumor evolution over time, between the end of radiochemotherapy and surgery.&#xD;
      Histological follow up of tumor would provide supporting information to fill this gap.&#xD;
      However, frequent tumor biopsies are not possible. Alternatively, probe-based confocal laser&#xD;
      endomicroscopy (pCLE) could allow for a sequential analysis of tumor response. Response to&#xD;
      treatment could be assessed and used to define optimal date of surgical resection, depending&#xD;
      on patient responding status to treatment. Responding patients would undergo surgery at a&#xD;
      later date than non-responders, in whom surgery could be performed earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the study lay in the more accurate definition of resection margins, with its&#xD;
      associated potential therapeutic impact of the anal sphincter preservation and in the&#xD;
      definition of the optimal date of rectal tumor resection, based on response status to&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interests are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microscopic structure of tumor will be analyzed at the cellular and microvascular levels&#xD;
           and compared to healthy mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of response during and following radiochemotherapy will be assessed, and will&#xD;
           help classify patients as responders/non responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pCLE results will be compared to histopathology results on pre-treatment and resection&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Images gathered through the imaging modalities (WLE, pCLE, EUS) along with&#xD;
           histopathology results will be combined to create an atlas and database of rectal&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
