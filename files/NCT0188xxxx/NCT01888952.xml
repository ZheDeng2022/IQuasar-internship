      This is a Phase 0/1 open-label, non-randomized, biomarker and pharmacodynamic study in&#xD;
      patients with advanced B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM), Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), mantle cell lymphoma, follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have failed at least one prior therapy&#xD;
      and for whom no standard curative therapy exists. Patients with advanced stage disease are&#xD;
      those whose disease is resistant or refractory to standard chemotherapy or biological&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;

      This pilot study will evaluate whether the administration of roflumilast inhibits the&#xD;
      activity of PDE4 and results in the modulation of AKT/mTOR pathways in patients with B-cell&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for the purpose of&#xD;
      determining the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers as related&#xD;
      to GC resistance. Samples are obtained at baseline prior to starting study treatment, on Day&#xD;
      8 before the administration of the Day 8 study drugs (prednisone and roflumilast), and on Day&#xD;
      15. If a bone marrow biopsy is also performed prior to study treatment or at any time during&#xD;
      treatment, a sample will be sent for analysis. Normal PBMC (and bone marrow when it is&#xD;
      obtained) will be examined for changes in key targets related to the inhibition of PDE4 and&#xD;
      potential reversal of glucocorticoid resistance. Biomarker blood samples will be analyzed in&#xD;
      order to characterize the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast alone and in combination with&#xD;
      prednisone on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers, such as phospho-AKT, phosphorylation levels of&#xD;
      mTOR targets.&#xD;
