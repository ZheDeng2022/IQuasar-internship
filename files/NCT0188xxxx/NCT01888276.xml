  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of compulsive disorders as gambling could be close to behavior problems&#xD;
      encountered in Parkinson's disease associated with a hyperactivity of the motivational&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to the words generation test, which reflects the cortico-subcortical loop functioning,&#xD;
      involved in motivation, we want to evaluate and compare using tools (words generation and&#xD;
      behavioral tests) the motivational functioning of gamblers and healthy volunteers that we can&#xD;
      then compare to that of Parkinson's patients with and without behavioral hyperdopaminergic&#xD;
      disorders which were explored in another study.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate performance during words generation in&#xD;
      gamblers and healthy volunteers compare to those of PD patients with and without&#xD;
      hyper-dopaminergic behaviors collected during another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 groups of subjects will be recruited for the study: 20 compulsive gamblers and 20 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will realize twice each test during 2 sessions with one hour in between :&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the session 1 :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test of words generation, which is to produce action verbs in response to 40 nouns,&#xD;
           and noun in response to verbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test of Stroop that assesses selective attention&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the session 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test of words generation, which is to produce action verbs in response to 40 nouns,&#xD;
           and noun in response to verbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The task of the casino (Iowa Gambling Test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The task of landing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test of Stroop&#xD;
&#xD;
      We supposed that the performance of compulsive gamblers in words generation test will be&#xD;
      higher than those of healthy volunteers, themselves superior to those of PD patients with a&#xD;
      hyper-dopaminergic behavior, themselves superior to those of PD patient without&#xD;
      hyper-dopaminergic behavior.&#xD;
