      This is a phase I, open-label, multicentre study of AZD8186 administered orally in patients&#xD;
      with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), squamous non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (sqNSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and known PTEN-deficient/mutated or PIK3CB&#xD;
      mutated/amplified advanced solid malignancies. The study design allows an escalation of dose&#xD;
      with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 parts to this study: Part A, monotherapy dose escalation, Part B, monotherapy&#xD;
      expansion cohort(s) in PTEN deficient patients at the monotherapy intended therapeutic&#xD;
      dose(s) and schedule(s), Part C, AZD8186 added to abiraterone accetate (with prednisone)&#xD;
      treatment - dose/ schedule finding followed by expansion phase in PTEN-deficient/mutated or&#xD;
      PIK3CB mutated mCRPC and Part D, AZD8186 in combination with AZD2014 (a novel dual mTORC1/2&#xD;
      inibitor) dose/schedule finding followed by expansion phase in PTEN-deficient/mutated or&#xD;
      PIK3CB mutated TNBC.&#xD;
