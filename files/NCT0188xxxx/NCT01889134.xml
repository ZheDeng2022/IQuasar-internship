      The purpose of this study is to determine whether osteoprotegerin and RANKL (receptor&#xD;
      activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand) are involved in bone remodeling in patients with&#xD;
      primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), and whether alendronate may be useful in treatment of the&#xD;
      patients with PHPT who are not treated with parathyroidectomy.&#xD;

      Study background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL) and its decoy receptor&#xD;
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) play key roles in regulating bone turnover. They are involved in the&#xD;
      mechanism of &quot;crosstalk&quot; between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. After binding with RANK, RANKL&#xD;
      induces bone loss, whereas OPG prevents RANKL-RANK interaction and increases bone mass and&#xD;
      strength. The expression of RANKL has been found on the surface of many cell types including&#xD;
      cells of the osteoblast lineage, osteocytes, activated T cells and vascular endothelial&#xD;
      cells. RANK is a cell bound receptor for RANKL. Its expression has been detected mainly on&#xD;
      cells of the macrophage/monocytic lineage, including pre-osteoclastic cells. OPG is produced&#xD;
      and secreted by many different cell types including osteoblasts and vascular cells. The&#xD;
      OPG/RANKL/RANK system is regulated by many hormones and cytokines among which parathormone&#xD;
      (PTH) is one of the most important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterized by sustained secretion of PTH from the&#xD;
      parathyroid glands which is excessively disproportionate to calcium levels. This leads to&#xD;
      enhanced bone turnover, predominantly resorption, resulting in low bone mass, hypercalcemia,&#xD;
      hypercalciuria and hypophosphatemia. Successful parathyroidectomy (PTX) reverses these&#xD;
      pathological conditions and is the treatment of choice in PHPT. Alternatively, the bone&#xD;
      disease in PHPT may be treated pharmacologically by using bisphosphonates which are able to&#xD;
      diminish bone turnover. The mechanism by which PTH exerts its effects in bone and the&#xD;
      mechanism of bone loss in PHPT in humans have not been fully explained. PHPT with enhanced&#xD;
      PTH seems to be a suitable model to observe possible relationships between PTH, OPG and&#xD;
      RANKL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the serum Osteoprotegerin/sRANKL&#xD;
      (soluble RANKL) ratio in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who will be treated with&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy or with alendronate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of parathyroidectomy or treatment with alendronate on bone mineral&#xD;
           density (BMD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of parathyroidectomy or treatment with alendronate on PTH serum&#xD;
           concentration and other biochemical indices of PHPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects (at least 50) will be recruited from among patients diagnosed with primary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism while hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology of Wroclaw Medical&#xD;
      University. Before including them in the research they will be thoroughly investigated both&#xD;
      in terms of the symptoms of PHPT and other diseases, in particular other hormonal disorders,&#xD;
      liver and kidney function during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic disease or this who meet surgery criteria will be proposed to&#xD;
      undergo a selective PTX. Surgery criteria are generally as follows: a serum calcium&#xD;
      concentration &gt;1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min,&#xD;
      BMD &gt;2.5 standard deviation below standard reference values for sex-matched peak bone mass at&#xD;
      any site (T-score &lt;-2.5), age &lt;50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent previously unsuccessful parathyroidectomy, who do not meet the&#xD;
      criteria for surgery or be unsuitable or unwilling undergo PTX will be treated with&#xD;
      alendronate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of generally healthy volunteers (at least 50) corresponding to&#xD;
      the age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) of the patients with PHPT. They should not suffer&#xD;
      from bone disease or use medications that could affect BMD and PTH or calcium levels. Healthy&#xD;
      people will be used as controls because for many examined parameters the standards of&#xD;
      concentrations in serum are not established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will sign the informed consent form before entering study. Subjects will have&#xD;
      the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to&#xD;
      their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism will be destined for PTX (as above) or to&#xD;
      treatment with alendronate (Sedron 70 mg once a week taken orally) for one year. From PTX&#xD;
      group only patients after successful parathyroidectomy will be followed-up during next 12&#xD;
      months of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have at least 4 visits: before and after month 3, 6 and 12 during treatment&#xD;
      with alendronate or after PTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMD at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), distal third (F-D) and ultradistal (F-UD)&#xD;
      sites of the forearm, and of the total body (T) will be measured by dual-energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) every six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood samples as well as 24-h urine specimens will be taken before and after 3, 6 and&#xD;
      12 months of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group blood, urine and BMD examination such as in the PHPT group will be&#xD;
      carried out once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum and urinary solutes (calcium, phosphate, creatinine) PTH and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#xD;
      will be assayed in fresh samples. Additionally serum samples will be preserved at -70°C&#xD;
      before further hormone and cytokine estimations. The laboratory evaluations will include, but&#xD;
      not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calcium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin -18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-1 beta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteocalcin (OC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osteoprotegerin (OPG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parathormone (PTH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phosphate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soluble RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy and completeness of data will be verified by comparing registered data with&#xD;
      medical records and paper case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical adverse events reported by the subject or observed by the Investigator,&#xD;
           including physical examination at all study visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abdominal ultrasound examination every six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laboratory evaluation of serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine at every visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum pregnancy test, if applicable, done at every visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  regular telephone contact with study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient misses Sedron administration, he should take the drug next day morning and next&#xD;
      dose after one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed using Statistica 10 (StatSoft Inc.). Categorical data will be&#xD;
      presented by absolute and relative frequencies (n and %). Continuous data will be summarized&#xD;
      by the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The pairwise deletion will be&#xD;
      used for missing data. The statistical significance of differences between paired data will&#xD;
      be calculated using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to&#xD;
      compare values between different sample groups. Correlation coefficients will be determined&#xD;
      using Spearman's rank correlation. The results will be presented as the mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation. Statistical significance is defined as p&lt;0.05&#xD;
