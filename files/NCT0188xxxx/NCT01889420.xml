  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to test the possibility that a combination of three drugs,&#xD;
      pomalidomide and everolimus with dexamethasone, may improve patient responses when compared&#xD;
      with use of either drug alone, with dexamethasone in refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that pomalidomide is an FDA approved drug for patients with relapsed or progressive&#xD;
      myeloma, and everolimus has been shown to have single agent activity in relapsed myeloma, it&#xD;
      seems reasonable to combine these two active drugs in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      disease. Given that low dose dexamethasone dramatically improved the response rate of&#xD;
      pomalidomide, this drug will be added to the combination.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dosage (MTD)(Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined by first identifying the dose level at which &gt;= 30% of patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, over a 28 day cycle. DLT will be defined based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5, non-hematological adverse events experienced within the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) for each combined dosage scheme. The MTD will be defined as one dosage level below which DLT was observed in &gt;= 30% of patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicity profile will be described by specific adverse event rates among patients experiencing &gt; grade 3 hematologic events (lasting &gt;7 days) or grades 3-5 non-hematologic adverse events, according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, over a 28 day cycle. Specific events will be described as the numbers of patients experiencing them within each treatment cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anti-tumor Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-tumor effect will be assessed based on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) of the monoclonal protein (M-protein) and plasma concentrations of K/L free light chains (FLC) after each 28-day cycle. Descriptive statistics will be used for this measurement.&#xD;
Complete response (CR): disappearance of any M-protein and FLC as measured by SPEP and/or FLC. Pre-existing plasmacytomas must have completely resolved.&#xD;
Partial response (PR): &gt;50% reduction in M-protein and &gt;50% reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC. Any plasmacytoma must have decreased in size by &gt;50%.&#xD;
Stable disease: not meeting criteria for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD). PD: &gt;25% increase from baseline in serum or urine M-protein (serum M-protein must increase by &gt; 0.5 gm/dl; urine M-protein must increase by &gt;200 mg /24 hr); or development of new plasmacytomas or new lytic bone lesions; or a measurable increase in the size of these lesions; or hypercalcemia (&gt;11.5 mg/dl) attributed to MM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the percentage of patients with a &gt; Partial Response (PR). Response is assessed based on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) of the monoclonal protein (M-protein) and plasma concentrations of K/L free light chains (FLC) after each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
Complete response (CR): disappearance of any M-protein and FLC as measured by SPEP and/or FLC. Pre-existing plasmacytomas must have completely resolved.&#xD;
PR: &gt;50% reduction in M-protein and &gt;50% reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC. Any plasmacytoma must have decreased in size by &gt;50%.&#xD;

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dosage (MTD)(Phase I)</title>
        <description>The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined by first identifying the dose level at which &gt;= 30% of patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, over a 28 day cycle. DLT will be defined based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5, non-hematological adverse events experienced within the first 4 weeks (1 cycle) for each combined dosage scheme. The MTD will be defined as one dosage level below which DLT was observed in &gt;= 30% of patients.</description>
        <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
        <population>There was only one patient enrolled. The MTD could not be calculated based on one patient.</population>

Complete response (CR): disappearance of any M-protein and FLC as measured by SPEP and/or FLC. Pre-existing plasmacytomas must have completely resolved.&#xD;
Partial response (PR): &gt;50% reduction in M-protein and &gt;50% reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC. Any plasmacytoma must have decreased in size by &gt;50%.&#xD;
Stable disease: not meeting criteria for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD).
