  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to see if taking a small sample from the lining of the womb (the 'scratch')&#xD;
      before starting in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment can influence the chance of getting&#xD;
      pregnant and having a healthy, term baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also aims to explore why an embryo is not accepted or indeed rejected by the&#xD;
      lining of the womb. This will be analysed by carefully looking at the sample taken from the&#xD;
      lining of the womb under the microscope and analysing the levels of natural killer (NK)&#xD;
      cells. These cells are thought to regulate the implantation process and to be altered in some&#xD;
      women with infertility and miscarriage.&#xD;

      Following consent, participants will be randomised to one of the two trial interventions&#xD;
      (endometrial biopsy, or ultrasound scan only = no intervention) by a member of the research&#xD;
      team. The procedures will be scheduled for luteinising hormone (LH) day +7 to +9 of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle directly preceding commencement of down-regulation medications. A urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be performed before the studied procedure. Just prior to the biopsy and&#xD;
      directly following it, a transvaginal ultrasound scan will be performed to assess the length&#xD;
      of the uterine cavity and endometrial parameters, including blood flow characteristics using&#xD;
      power Doppler imaging. Endometrial sample will be obtained using standard sampling procedure&#xD;
      by appropriately trained clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to treatment arm will undergo an endometrial biopsy procedure using&#xD;
      Pipelle endometrial sampler (Pipelle de Cornier, Laboratoire CCD, Paris, France) or Wallace/&#xD;
      Wallach endometrial sampler as an alternative device on cycle day LH+7 to LH+9 of the cycle&#xD;
      directly preceding commencement of down-regulation prior to IVF or ICSI treatment. The&#xD;
      endometrial sampling will be repeated a maximum of four times (all during the same&#xD;
      appointment on day LH+7 to LH+9 of menstrual cycle) to assure a sufficient sample is&#xD;
      obtained. If following the first two attempts, the endometrial sample is sufficient,&#xD;
      procedure will be deemed complete. The Pipelle sampler will be introduced up to the uterine&#xD;
      fundus (based on clinical touch technique and ultrasound measurements), and attempts will be&#xD;
      made to obtain samples from all four walls of the endometrial cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to control group will also be supplied with home LH testing kits&#xD;
      after informing the unit of the will to participate. Once the ovulation test is positive, the&#xD;
      participant will contact the unit to arrange the ultrasound appointment on day LH+7 to LH+9&#xD;
      of the cycle directly preceding commencement of IVF/ICSI treatment. 48 to 72 hours later and&#xD;
      additional appointment will be scheduled for ultrasound scan and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomised to one of the two treatment arms based on a computer&#xD;
      generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, created&#xD;
      by the University of Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). As a pilot feasibility study, the&#xD;
      randomisation will not be stratified by any factors. Allocation to treatments will be in the&#xD;
      ratio 1:1. The corresponding treatment allocation will be transmitted to the unblinded&#xD;
      clinician, who will arrange the appropriate appointments for study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the study, no blinding of participant or researchers is possible.&#xD;
