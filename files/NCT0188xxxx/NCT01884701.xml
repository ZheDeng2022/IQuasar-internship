      The current study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, multi-center study to&#xD;
      evaluate the outcome of the ENABLER-P Catheter System for crossing chronic total occlusions&#xD;
      during endovascular intervention for femoral-popliteal occlusive disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation from a previous attempt OR a concurrent reasonable attempt (at least 5&#xD;
             minutes) during this procedure, demonstrating resistance to conventional guidewire&#xD;
             crossing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have objective evidence of lower extremity ischemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Totally occlusive lesion in a native femoropopliteal artery classified&#xD;
             angiographically as absolute (100% occlusion with no flow), where no antegrade filling&#xD;
             beyond the occlusion is visible;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target occlusion length is &gt;1cm and ≤ 30 cm;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's reference vessel diameter is ≥ 4.0 mm and ≤6.0 mm (by visual angiographic&#xD;
             estimation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for PTA, peripheral artery bypass surgery or&#xD;
             peripheral artery stent implantation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within&#xD;
             48 hours prior to the study procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have been informed of the nature of the study, agree to its provisions,&#xD;
             and provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is ≥ 21 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, Plavix or&#xD;
             radiographic contrast agents which cannot be adequately pre-medicated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient requires immediate treatment in more than one occluded vessel, in any&#xD;
             combination of grafts or native vessels;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has planned femoropopliteal intervention scheduled within 30 days after index&#xD;
             procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device trial&#xD;
             that may conflict with study data collection and has not completed the entire&#xD;
             follow-up period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has no collateral flow distal to the occlusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's target occlusion has a dissection that occurred within the past 30 days&#xD;
             caused by a guidewire attempt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diatheses, coagulopathy or will refuse blood&#xD;
             transfusion in cases of emergency;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient suffered recent (within the past 6 months) significant gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
             bleeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's target lesion or the vessel proximal to the target lesion reveals&#xD;
             significant ectasia, dissection, aneurysm or thrombus;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has other medical illnesses (i.e., cancer or congestive heart failure) that&#xD;
             may cause the patient to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data&#xD;
             interpretation or is associated with life-expectancy less than 1 year.&#xD;
