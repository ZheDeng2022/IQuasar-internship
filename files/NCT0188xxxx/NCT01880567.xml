  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and rituximab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      mantle cell lymphoma that has come back or has not responded to treatment or older patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      rituximab, may find cancer cells and help kill them. Giving ibrutinib and rituximab may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate of ibrutinib plus rituximab in patients with relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and response rate of ibrutinib plus rituximab in elderly patients&#xD;
      (&gt; 65) with newly-diagnosed, untreated MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further evaluate the toxicity profile of the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed and/or refractory MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR); (partial response [PR] or better), the&#xD;
      response duration (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory MCL; clinical benefit&#xD;
      response (CBR) = (minimal response [MR] + ORR) will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the response duration, PFS, time to progression (TTP), and OS in elderly&#xD;
      patients (&gt; 65) with newly-diagnosed, untreated MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate detected gene mutations and changes in gene and/or protein expression with&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and rituximab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1; on day 1 of courses 3-8; and on day 1 of&#xD;
      every other course for all subsequent courses. Treatment with rituximab repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Courses&#xD;
      with ibrutinib repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
