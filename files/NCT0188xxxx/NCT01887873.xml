  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the safety of Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o. implant in patients&#xD;
      with primary open angle glaucoma undergoing a combined phacoemulsification - non penetrating&#xD;
      deep sclerectomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o. will be implanted during a combined surgery of&#xD;
      cataract and non - penetrating deep sclerectomy in a group of 16 patients with primary open&#xD;
      angle glaucoma and clinically significant cataract. Given that a considerable number of&#xD;
      glaucoma patients also suffer from cataract, it is reasonable to test Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o.&#xD;
      during a combined procedure of phacoemulsification and deep sclerectomy. This is also of&#xD;
      importance because a combined procedure avoids the need of a second operation in this group&#xD;
      of patients. Finally, it has been shown that combined phacoemulsification - deep sclerectomy&#xD;
      does not induce a further risk compared to deep sclerectomy alone(open phase I study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments will be performed at every visit and efficacy analysis will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects at each study time point which will need additional IOP lowering&#xD;
           drug therapy to achieve an IOP reduction to values &lt; 21 mmHg. If a subject needs more&#xD;
           than one drug to achieve target IOP, the number of drugs needed to achieve adequate IOP&#xD;
           reduction will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects at each time point which will need Neodymium:YAG goniopuncture to&#xD;
           achieve an IOP reduction to values &lt; 21 mmHg.&#xD;
