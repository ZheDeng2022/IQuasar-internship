      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - We are studying people s psychological experiences and how these relate to the way people&#xD;
      respond have when they see information communicated in different ways. We are testing&#xD;
      multiple research questions in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn about how to design future research studies. Also to learn about how to best give&#xD;
      people information about health topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women with a Body Mass Index of 25 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the study visit, participants will answer some questions online about themselves,&#xD;
           their experiences, and their thoughts about their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study visit, participants will watch a short scene from a movie, and then&#xD;
           answer questions about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a simulated doctor visit with a computerized, virtual reality&#xD;
           doctor. They will answer more questions about themselves, their experiences, and their&#xD;
           thoughts about their weight. Then they will answer questions with researchers.&#xD;
