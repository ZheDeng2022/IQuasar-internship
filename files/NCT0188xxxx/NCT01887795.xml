      1. Verify the effect of Erlotinib concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy as ﬁrst-line&#xD;
           treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer to&#xD;
           compare with WBRT alone.&#xD;

      All patients will be randomized to receive WBRT or Erlotinib concurrent WBRT. Erlotinib&#xD;
      concurrent WBRT, patients were given a loading dose of erlotinib 150mg per day for 6 days,&#xD;
      after which all patients received erlotinib 150mg per day concurrently with WBRT. Dose&#xD;
      reduction was allowed for intolerable adverse effects (grade ≥3) such as rash or diarrhea in&#xD;
      50 mg increments down from 150mg to 100 mg and then to 50 mg if needed. Radiation therapy was&#xD;
      delivered in 2.0 Gy fractions once per day 5 days per week to a total dose of 40Gy (20&#xD;
      fractions). Radiation was delivered as opposed lateral 8-MV beams with a Sweden precise&#xD;
      linear accelerator.&#xD;
