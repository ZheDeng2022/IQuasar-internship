      The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with MEK162&#xD;
      demonstrates sufficient efficacy in select pathway-activated solid tumors and/or hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies to warrant further study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with&#xD;
      MEK162 in patients with a diagnosis of select solid tumors or hematological malignancies that&#xD;
      have been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have activations of the RAS/RAF/MEK&#xD;
      pathway and whose disease has progressed on or after standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic profiling is becoming more accessible to patients and their physicians. This is a&#xD;
      signal-seeking study to match patients with mutations in RAF, RAS, NF1 or MEK to the&#xD;
      ATP-noncompetitive MEK 1/2 inhibitor, MEK162. Pre-identification of these mutations or&#xD;
      activations in the pathway will be performed locally at a CLIA certified laboratory prior to&#xD;
      screening for participation on the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has been identified, treating physicians who are qualified investigators may&#xD;
      contact Novartis to consider enrollment in this study. For the purpose of this study, genomic&#xD;
      profiling is not considered part of screening. Informed consent must be signed before any&#xD;
      screening activities take place. Once eligibility (screening criteria met) has been confirmed&#xD;
      by Novartis, the patient will initiate therapy with single agent MEK162. The patient may not&#xD;
      receive any additional anti-cancer therapy during treatment with MEK162.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression (assessed by&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematologic response criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or&#xD;
      discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.g., withdrawal of consent, start&#xD;
      of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise known&#xD;
      as End of Treatment. All patients who discontinue from study treatment due to disease&#xD;
      progression must have their progression clearly documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease assessment (per RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematological response criteria) will be&#xD;
      performed every 8 weeks (±4 days) after first dose of study drug (Day 1 of every odd cycle),&#xD;
      until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever occurs first. The frequency of&#xD;
      disease assessment may be reduced to every 12 weeks for patients who have at least 4&#xD;
      post-baseline disease assessments and are clinically stable (except AML and MM patients).&#xD;
      Scans will be assessed locally by the investigator. After discontinuation of treatment,&#xD;
      patients, regardless of reason for treatment discontinuation, will be followed for safety for&#xD;
      30 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for survival status every 3 months for 2 years after the last&#xD;
      patient has enrolled in the study regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if&#xD;
      consent is withdrawn or patient is lost to follow-up.)&#xD;

        <description>Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, severity was graded as Grade 1: asymptomatic/mild symptoms, clinical/diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: moderate, minimal, local/noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3: severe/medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as new or worsening events that were collected from first study treatment date to last treatment date +30 days. AEs of all grades were reported.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Graded According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03</title>
          <description>Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, severity was graded as Grade 1: asymptomatic/mild symptoms, clinical/diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: moderate, minimal, local/noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3: severe/medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as new or worsening events that were collected from first study treatment date to last treatment date +30 days. AEs of all grades were reported.</description>

Hematological parameters included neutrophils, platelets, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, INR, fibrinogen. Number of participants with hematological abnormalities by grades (as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03) were reported. Grade 1= mild; Grade 2= moderate; Grade 3= severe and Grade 4= life-threatening or disabling.
