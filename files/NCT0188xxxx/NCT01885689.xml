  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well clofarabine and melphalan before a donor stem cell&#xD;
      transplant works in treating patients with a decrease in or disappearance of signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of myelodysplasia or acute leukemia (disease is in remission), or chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia. Giving chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and melphalan, before a&#xD;
      donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the&#xD;
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells&#xD;
      from a donor are infused into a patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem&#xD;
      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Giving clofarabine and melphalan&#xD;
      before transplant may help prevent the cancer from coming back after transplant, and they may&#xD;
      cause fewer side effects than standard treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, determine the anti-tumor activity of clofarabine given&#xD;
      in combination with high-dose melphalan as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression and&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Summarize toxicities/complications by organ and severity, including acute and chronic&#xD;
      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -9&#xD;
      to -5 and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -3, patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) and&#xD;
      sirolimus PO once daily with taper per City of Hope standard operating procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up once weekly for 60 days, at&#xD;
      100, and 180 days, at one year, and then yearly for up to 5 years.&#xD;
