      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of medical ozone in&#xD;
      treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of 439 patients with chronic hepatitis B were divided according to patients' intention&#xD;
      into two arms. 173 patients in arm I were treated with medical ozone therapy with humares&#xD;
      which was made in Germany for at least 12 weeks.266 patients in arm II were treated with&#xD;
      conventional interferon-α for at least 24 weeks.Patients in both groups were followed-up for&#xD;
      24 weeks.Virology response, biochemistry response and hepatitis B viral serological response&#xD;
      will be studied at 12 weeks after the treatment, at the end of treatment and after 24 weeks&#xD;
      of follow-up.&#xD;
