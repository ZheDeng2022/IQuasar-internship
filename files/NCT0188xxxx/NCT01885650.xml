  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder of altered ion transport across cell membranes&#xD;
      which is characterised by the production of thickened bodily secretions, affecting the&#xD;
      function of organs such as the pancreas and the lungs. Within the lungs, thickened sputum is&#xD;
      very difficult to clear, which can results in recurrent chest infections, which can lead to&#xD;
      lung damage. therefore it is important to optimise the removal of sputum to try and prevent&#xD;
      these complications. Traditionally, a variety of approaches are usually combined including&#xD;
      inhaled medications to thin or hydrate secretions, and chest physiotherapy to mobilise&#xD;
      secretions and improve sputum clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many chest physiotherapy or airway clearance techniques (ACT) available including&#xD;
      breathing methods such as the Active Cycle of Breathing Techniques (ACBT) or Autogenic&#xD;
      Drainage (AD) and adjuncts such as Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP), High Frequency Chest&#xD;
      Oscillation (the &quot;Vest&quot;), or oscillatory devices such as the Flutter or Acapella. When people&#xD;
      with CF have an infection or have severe disease often the effectiveness of ACTs can decrease&#xD;
      due to fatigue, shortness of breath or having an overwhelming amount of sputum. At this time&#xD;
      it is necessary to re-assess ACTs and the addition of positive pressure to airway clearance&#xD;
      techniques has been shown to be helpful in decreasing fatigue during chest physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present no research studies have reported an increase in sputum cleared with the addition&#xD;
      of positive pressure, however it is thought that the ability to take a deeper breath when&#xD;
      using positive pressure would help to improve sputum clearance. With clinical experience of&#xD;
      the use of NIV with adult CF patients, the investigators aim to explore this objectively in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the addition of non-invasive ventilation (Breas, I-Sleep 25) as supplementary positive&#xD;
      pressure to normal airway clearance techniques improve sputum clearance in stable adult&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of non-invasive ventilation in addition to a patient's normal airway clearance&#xD;
      technique will lead to improvements in subjective ease of clearance and work of breathing&#xD;
      during airway clearance and objectively increase sputum clearance, as well as being well&#xD;
      tolerated in patients as an adjunct to airway clearance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder of altered ion transport across cell membranes&#xD;
      which is characterised by the production of thickened bodily secretions, affecting the&#xD;
      function of organs such as the pancreas and the lungs. Within the lungs, thickened mucus&#xD;
      alters normal mucocillary clearance mechanisms resulting in airway obstruction, mucus&#xD;
      plugging and recurrent infections. The cycle of recurrent infections and subsequent&#xD;
      inflammation is thought to be the major mechanism towards damage to lung tissue and the&#xD;
      occurrence of fibrosis, which decreases lung function, lowers tissue oxygenation and&#xD;
      eventually leads to respiratory failure and death. Optimisation of the removal of airway&#xD;
      secretions is therefore an integral part of the management of CF in order to try and prevent&#xD;
      these complications. Traditionally, a variety of approaches are usually combined including&#xD;
      mucolytic or hydrator therapy to make the secretions less viscous, and chest physiotherapy to&#xD;
      mobilise secretions and improve airway clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many chest physiotherapy or airway clearance techniques (ACT) available including&#xD;
      breathing methods such as the Active Cycle of Breathing Techniques (ACBT) or Autogenic&#xD;
      Drainage (AD) and adjuncts such as Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP), High Frequency Chest&#xD;
      Oscillation (the &quot;Vest&quot;), or oscillatory devices such as the Flutter or Acapella. Research&#xD;
      has shown there to be no difference in effectiveness between techniques, as long as they are&#xD;
      performed correctly and regularly, and therefore choice of ACT depends upon assessment of the&#xD;
      patient by a trained physiotherapist and discussions with the individual. With advancing&#xD;
      disease or infections, often the effectiveness of ACTs can decrease due to patient fatigue,&#xD;
      shortness of breath or overwhelming amount of secretions. At this time it is necessary to&#xD;
      re-assess ACTs, and the addition of positive pressure to airway clearance techniques has been&#xD;
      shown to decrease patient fatigue and respiratory rates during clearance. One of these&#xD;
      studies also demonstrated improvements in oxygenation and respiratory muscle strength after&#xD;
      the use of positive pressure with ACT. While no studies have reported an increase in sputum&#xD;
      expectorated with the addition of positive pressure, the ability to augment greater tidal&#xD;
      volumes through positive pressure is thought to be a mechanism which could improve sputum&#xD;
      clearance. Clinical experience at the Royal Brompton hospital has indicated that with&#xD;
      alterations in pressure and flow rates from resting settings, sputum clearance appears to be&#xD;
      easier and more effective; the investigators aim to explore this observation objectively in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
