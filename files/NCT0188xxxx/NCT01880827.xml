    <textblock>
      Obesity is a worldwide problem and leads to multiple metabolic and endocrinological problems,&#xD;
      including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In T2DM, body is unable to response to circulating&#xD;
      insulin levels, which ultimately destroys pancreatic β-cells, leading to chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia with ensuing consequences&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestine is able to produce endocrinologically active substances, which affect to body's&#xD;
      intermediary metabolism. One of these substances in glucose-dependent insulinotrophic&#xD;
      polypeptide (GIP, part of the incretin family), which potentiates the release of insulin&#xD;
      postprandially. However, recent evidence suggests, that GIP may have more harmful than&#xD;
      beneficial role in the pathogenesis: it has been shown that GIP participates in the&#xD;
      development of insulin resistance, the key defect in the process of metabolic dysfunction.&#xD;
      GIP may also regulate postprandial redistribution of splanchnic blood flow which might act in&#xD;
      the body's nutrition handling [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgeries are a growing field as a treatment choice for morbid obesity (BMI &gt; 35&#xD;
      kg/m2). Most established of these procedures is a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), where&#xD;
      duodenum and proximal jejunum is bypassed. Clinical and research evidence shows that shortly&#xD;
      (before any significant weight loss) after RYGB, T2DM resolves with improving glucose&#xD;
      tolerance. Foregut hypothesis behind bariatric surgeries postulate, that bypassed portions of&#xD;
      intestine contain a substance, that acts as an anti-incretin¬, ie. to counteract&#xD;
      metabolically favourable incretins. In view of the recent studies, it may be that GIP is&#xD;
      really the anti-incretin behind this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a modern imaging technique, which can be used to study&#xD;
      perfusion and metabolism of different organs non-invasively. When radiowater measurement is&#xD;
      combined with [15O]CO, both tissues specific perfusion and blood volume can be measured,&#xD;
      respectively. When coupled with magnetic imaging (ie. PET-MRI), the volumes-of-interests can&#xD;
      be accurately drawn to the desired organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is conducted to investigate the vasoactive roles of the GIP. We aim to show&#xD;
      that GIP is the major contributor to the blood flow and tissue blood volume observed in&#xD;
      postprandial state. Moreover, we hypothesize that the elimination of GIP-effect has a central&#xD;
      role in the improved intermediary metabolism observed after bariatric surgery procedures, and&#xD;
      that part this change is mediated by changes in splanchnic circulation. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      investigate the effect of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1, another member of incretin family)&#xD;
      on splanchnic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study intestinal, hepatic and pancreatic blood flow and volume are measured&#xD;
      using [15O]H2O- and [15O]CO radiotracers and PET-MRI imaging in healthy normal weight&#xD;
      volunteers (n = 20, BMI ≤ 27 kg/m2) and in morbidly obese T2DM patients (n = 30, BMI ≤ 35&#xD;
      kg/m2) before and after the bariatric surgery operation. The PET imaging will be performed at&#xD;
      fasting state but also separately either during 1) mixed meal solution (MMS), 2) GIP-, or 3)&#xD;
      GLP-1-infusion. Also abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, intestinal and&#xD;
      hepatic tissue samples will be collected.&#xD;
