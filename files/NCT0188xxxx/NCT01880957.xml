      The primary aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding potential (BP) in vivo in bipolar&#xD;
           disorder patients (BPD) during a major depressive episode (MDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HT1A BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the effect of lamotrigine treatment of bipolar disorder on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the effect of lithium treatment of unipolar depression on 5-HTT BP.&#xD;

      PET and MRI imaging will be used to investigate the aims described above in patients who have&#xD;
      bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and are currently experiencing a depressive episode.&#xD;
      Both healthy controls and depressed participants with bipolar disorder or unipolar depression&#xD;
      will be recruited. Patients who are on medication before enrolling in the study will have a&#xD;
      three week washout. At baseline, healthy controls and patients will have an MRI consisting of&#xD;
      both structural and functional sequences. Psychological measures will also be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline. Within one week of the MRI, both patients and healthy controls will have one CUMI&#xD;
      and one DASB PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline PET scans, patient participants will begin medication treatment with&#xD;
      either lithium or lamotrigine, based on the clinical judgement of the treating psychiatrist.&#xD;
      Psychological measures will be obtained every 2 weeks. After 6 weeks of medication treatment&#xD;
      at a therapeutic dose, patients will be assessed for remission (defined as a 50% decrease in&#xD;
      the HDRS score from baseline). If this criteria is met, patient participants will then have&#xD;
      follow-up PET scans (one CUMI and one DASB). If this criteria is not met, the patient will be&#xD;
      switched to the other medication under study and will be reevaluated after an additional 4&#xD;
      weeks of medication treatment. Patients who still do not demonstrate a 50% decrease in their&#xD;
      HDRS will be considered non-responders and will have repeat CUMI and DASB scans.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score obtained at baseline; participants must have an HDRS score of at least 15 to be eligible. After 6 weeks of medication treatment, the HDRS score will be reevaluated. Participants who have a 50% or greater decrease in their HDRS score will be considered responders and will proceed to the repeat PET scans.</description>
