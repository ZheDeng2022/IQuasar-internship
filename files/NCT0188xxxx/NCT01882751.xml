  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A better understanding of knee joint kinematics is important to explain the premature&#xD;
      polyethylene wear failures within total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and to help design a&#xD;
      prosthesis that most closely approximates the normal knee. Previously, most experimental&#xD;
      studies of knee kinematics have involved cadaveric, in vitro analyses, or have not tested the&#xD;
      knee in a weight-bearing mode. Others have used exoskeletal linkages and skin markers that&#xD;
      permit error due to undesired motions between markers and the underlying bone. More recently,&#xD;
      fluoroscopy has been used to assess in vivo kinematics for subjects having a TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ConforMIS has attempted to follow a clearly different path than the major orthopaedic&#xD;
      companies. They have chosen to offer patients a personalized knee implant based off of each&#xD;
      patient's femoral and tibial bone geometry. The hypothesis is that these subjects will&#xD;
      experience a more normal-like kinematic pattern, eliminating paradoxical anterior sliding&#xD;
      during weight-bearing knee flexion. Therefore, the objective for this study is to analyze the&#xD;
      in vivo kinematics for 25 patients implanted with a personalized ConforMIS TKA and 25&#xD;
      patients implanted with a traditional TKA design to determine if there are any kinematic&#xD;
      differences between these TKA designs.&#xD;

      Each subject will be asked to perform five activities in one continuous sequence: (1) stand&#xD;
      up from a chair, (2) walk up stairs, (3) walk down stairs, (4) level walking, and (5) a deep&#xD;
      knee bend. Subjects will be video recorded from the waist down while performing the&#xD;
      activities. The speed level of each trial will be based on the comfort level of the patient.&#xD;
      The fluoroscopic images will be stored digitally for subsequent analysis on secure servers&#xD;
      and workstations at the University of Tennessee.&#xD;
