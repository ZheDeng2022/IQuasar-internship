      This research protocol &quot;Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of peginterferon&#xD;
      Bacterial Intravenous Protein 48 kilodaltons (BIP48) and 40 kilodaltons (40kDa) in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&quot; This is a Phase I clinical trial which will compare pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic parameters, and safety of two products: peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS ®) and&#xD;
      BIP48. It will be a double-blind, randomized crossover with a rest period (wash-out) of 4&#xD;
      weeks. The study population will be 32 healthy male volunteers to whom will be administered a&#xD;
      single dose of 180 microgram of each product, subcutaneously. The study will have a total&#xD;
      duration of 14 days in each treatment step. The serum concentration of PEG-interferon for&#xD;
      both products, measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and by antiviral activity of&#xD;
      PEG-interferon, is the main variable.For this purpose 15 samples of each volunteers will be&#xD;
      needed. Clinical and laboratory variables, useful as pharmacodynamics parameters Beta-2&#xD;
      microglobulin (β2M) - 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase - oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)- and&#xD;
      neopterin) and safety evaluation, will be measured.&#xD;

      Double-blind study, ie, the volunteers and the study team will not be aware of the product&#xD;
      administered. As the presentations of the two products are different, only the professional&#xD;
      who will administer the injections will not be blinded, and will not have contact with&#xD;
      volunteers or members of the study team after applying the medication.&#xD;
