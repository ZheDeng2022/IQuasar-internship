      Background of the study: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death&#xD;
      world wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients presenting with early disease (stage I-III) can be cured, prognosis varies&#xD;
      from 90% in stage I to 50-80% in stage II and III. Therefore, prevention of metastases after&#xD;
      early disease is of utmost importance. Derepression of Wnt targets may provide a novel target&#xD;
      for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to assess in patients with primary colon&#xD;
      cancer whether short-course pre-operative treatment with decitabine can increase Wnt target&#xD;
      gene expression as measured in resected tumors compared to pretreatment biopsies. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of the study is to assess in patients with primary colon cancer whether&#xD;
      short-course pre-operative treatment with decitabine can revert CpG methylation and induce&#xD;
      more favorable tumor characteristics as measured in resected tumors compared to pretreatment&#xD;
      biopsies. The tertiary objective is to compare changes in Wnt target gene expression, CpG&#xD;
      methylation and tumor characteristics for Wnt methylated and nonmethylated tumors as measured&#xD;
      in resected tumors compared to pretreatment biopsies and identify new stratification markers.&#xD;

      Rationale: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death world wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patients presenting with early disease (stage I-III) can be cured, prognosis varies&#xD;
      from 90% in stage I to 50-80% in stage II and III. Therefore, prevention of metastases after&#xD;
      early disease is of utmost importance. Extensive studies of the Wnt signal cascade have&#xD;
      elucidated its role in colorectal cancer development and proliferation. Several well-known&#xD;
      targets of the Wnt-cascade, like DKK1, APCDD1 and AXIN2, serve as feedback inhibitors and&#xD;
      likely prevent pathway hyperactivation. Therefore, loss of these control mechanisms, for&#xD;
      example due to repression of Wnt targets by CpG island methylation, serves as a potent&#xD;
      proliferative signal. Recently, we identified a subset of colon cancers that are typified by&#xD;
      CpG island methylation of specific Wnt target genes and have a poor prognosis. Moreover, in&#xD;
      preclinical studies we showed that derepression of Wnt-targets by the demethylating agent&#xD;
      decitabine resulted in tumor growth suppression. Thus, derepression of Wnt targets may&#xD;
      provide a novel target for therapy. Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      assess in patients with primary colon cancer whether short-course pre-operative treatment&#xD;
      with decitabine can increase Wnt target gene expression as measured in resected tumors&#xD;
      compared to pretreatment biopsies. The secondary objective of the study is to assess in&#xD;
      patients with primary colon cancer whether short-course pre-operative treatment with&#xD;
      decitabine can revert CpG methylation and induce more favorable tumor characteristics as&#xD;
      measured in resected tumors compared to pretreatment biopsies. The tertiary objective is to&#xD;
      compare changes in Wnt target gene expression, CpG methylation and tumor characteristics for&#xD;
      Wnt methylated and nonmethylated tumors as measured in resected tumors compared to&#xD;
      pretreatment biopsies and identify new stratification markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &gt; 18 yr old with histopathologically proven or high suspicion of colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In patients with proven colon cancer, five extra biopsies will be taken from&#xD;
      the tumour during endoscopy to determine CpG methylation of Wnt target genes in fresh tumor&#xD;
      samples. Next, these patients will pre-operatively receive decitabine as a single intravenous&#xD;
      infusion at a dose of 45 mg/m2 over 6 hr. After resection, Wnt target gene expression and CpG&#xD;
      methylation of Wnt target genes will again be determined in fresh tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: The primary study parameter is Wnt target gene expression (APCDD1,&#xD;
      AXIN2, DKK1, LGR5 and ASCL2). Secondary study parameters are Wnt target and CIMP gene&#xD;
      methylation, beta-catenin localization, proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (TUNEL and M30&#xD;
      assay) and tumor differentiation.&#xD;
