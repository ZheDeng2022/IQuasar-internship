  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical study for patients with platinum resistant (does not respond to&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy) high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer. Prior to the main treatment, patients will receive cyclophosphamide by vein. Patients&#xD;
      will then receive an infusion (given by vein) of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes&#xD;
      (TILs) which will first be taken from the patient, then be stimulated with certain substances&#xD;
      called autologous dendritic cells (DCs) and OKT3 (anti-CD3 antibody), and then given back to&#xD;
      the patient as an infusion. This is believed to make the TILs work better. TILs are a type of&#xD;
      white blood cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to&#xD;
      break down. After infusion of TILs, low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy will be given.&#xD;

             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral salpingectomy. Women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are&#xD;
             still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, ovarian suppression or any other reversible&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             be defined by RECIST 1.1 or CA125 as defined by the modified GCIG criteria (See&#xD;
             Section 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject cannot have any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other&#xD;
             active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system,&#xD;
