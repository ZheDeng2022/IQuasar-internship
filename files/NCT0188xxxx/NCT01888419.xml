      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer in women with more than 4700 new&#xD;
      cases annually. Unfortunately, up to 60% of women who are treated surgically for breast&#xD;
      cancer, will experience chronic pain as a consequence of the treatment. This state of chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain is termed &quot;Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome&quot; or PBTPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether transplantation of fat cells&#xD;
      (lipotransplantation) to the pain affected mastectomy area, could have an analgesic effect in&#xD;
      women who have developed PBTPS. Secondary, we wish to investigate if lipotransplantation has&#xD;
      a beneficial effect on the quality of the skin and the scar in the area where the&#xD;
      transplanted fat cells are placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipotransplantation to the area under the scar tissue and the area under the&#xD;
           pain-afflicted area reduces the pain in women with PBTPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The neuropathic pain in PBTPS is correlated to the number of free nerve endings crossing&#xD;
           the border between the dermis and the epidermis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipotransplantation have a beneficial effect on the scar tissue structure and improves&#xD;
           the skin quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently developed PBTPS. A&#xD;
      total of 32 patients with PBTPS will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either lipotransplantation or no active&#xD;
      treatment. At three follow-up visits, the perceived pain of the patient and the skin and scar&#xD;
      quality will be scored. In addition, a 3-mm biopsy will be taken from the skin on both the&#xD;
      missing and the healthy breast, and from the mastectomy scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scoring of the perceived pain and the quality of the skin and the scar, allows us to&#xD;
      investigate if the lipotransplantation have an effect on pain, and skin/scar quality.&#xD;
      Additionally, the skin and scar biopsies will be examined on a microscopic level, in order to&#xD;
      investigate why lipotransplantation has these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the results of this project could help to increase our understanding of why some&#xD;
      patients develop chronic neuropathic pain after mastectomy and radiotherapy. It is our hope&#xD;
      that our results may contribute to the development of better and more effective treatment&#xD;
      that will be beneficial for the project participants and future patients.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer in women with more than 4700 new&#xD;
      cases annually. All patients are treated according to national guidelines developed by the&#xD;
      Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). Treatment primarily consists of surgical&#xD;
      removal of all or parts of the breast and simultaneous removal of one-or lymph nodes in the&#xD;
      ipsilateral axilla. Subsequently, there may be a need for additional treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiation and / or anti-hormonal therapy, in order to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60% of women who are treated surgically for breast cancer, will experience chronic pain&#xD;
      as a consequence of the treatment. This condition was previously referred to as &quot;Post&#xD;
      Mastectomy Pain Syndrome&quot;, but because the condition is also seen after less extensive forms&#xD;
      of breast cancer surgery, the condition is now termed &quot;Post Therapy Breast Pain Syndrome&quot;&#xD;
      (PBTPS). PBTPS is defined as a neuropathic pain condition with pain localized to the axilla,&#xD;
      the medial part of the upper arm, chest and or chest wall of the side of surgery, lasting&#xD;
      more than three months after surgery and / or the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011 Caviggioli et al. published a study where lipotransplantation to the mastectomy area&#xD;
      was found to have a significant analgesic effect. The aforementioned study is to date the&#xD;
      only published study in the field. However, it is not a randomized study. In order to obtain&#xD;
      further evidence of the apparent beneficial effect of lipotransplantation on pain, the&#xD;
      present study has been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipotransplantation is a fast and relatively non-invasive technique which is described in&#xD;
      detail by Coleman et al.. Additionally, in a study from 2008, Klinger et al. found that&#xD;
      lipotransplantation to burn scars in the face resulted in a significant improvement in the&#xD;
      patient's skin and scar quality and also reduced pain in the treated areas. The theoretical&#xD;
      basis for the scar and skin modifying effects of lipotransplantation has not yet been finally&#xD;
      understood. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have systematically investigated and&#xD;
      analysed the effects of lipotransplantation on the irradiated mastectomy area on a&#xD;
      histological level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lipotransplantation to the pain affected&#xD;
      mastectomy area, could have an analgesic effect in women affected by Post Breast Therapy Pain&#xD;
      Syndrome. Secondary, we wish to investigate the scar and skin modulating effects of&#xD;
      lipotransplantation to the same area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By carrying out immunohistochemical staining and subsequent stereoscopic microscopy of free&#xD;
      nerve endings in the skin biopsies taken before and after lipotransplantationen we wish to&#xD;
      determine whether changes in the number and type of free nerve endings is part of the&#xD;
      mechanism of pain reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipotransplantation to the area under the scar tissue and the area under the&#xD;
           pain-afflicted area reduces the pain in women with PBTPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The neuropathic pain in PBTPS is correlated to the number of free nerve endings crossing&#xD;
           the border between the dermis and the epidermis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipotransplantation have a beneficial effect on the scar tissue structure and improves&#xD;
           the skin quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have undergone unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer at Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark and, if applicable, has finished their adjuvant postoperative&#xD;
      radiation therapy at least 6 months ago. Patients must have had pain localized to the area of&#xD;
      the missing breast for at least three months after adjuvant radiation therapy ended. A total&#xD;
      of 32 patients with PBTPS will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PBTPS are randomly assigned to receive either lipotransplantation or no active&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of randomization, the patient will be invited to three follow-up visits,&#xD;
      respectively 3 and 6 months after inclusion/surgery. At each of the outpatient visits the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete the DoloTest ® , VAS pain score and the Patient Scar&#xD;
      Assessment Scale. The clinician will complete the Observer Scar Assessment Scale and record&#xD;
      the consumption of pain medication. DoloTest ® is a validated, visual analogue questionnaire&#xD;
      designed to assess the patients experienced pain and impact on the patients daily life. Three&#xD;
      3-mm punch biopsies will be taken at inclusion, one from the mastectomy scar, one from the&#xD;
      skin 2 cm above the mastectomy scar in the medioclavicular line, and one from the healthy&#xD;
      skin on the health breast in an area corresponding to the other skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin punch biopsies from the pain afflicted area will be fixed in 4% phosphate buffered&#xD;
      paraformaldehyde. After freezing, the tissue samples are cut into 50-micron thick sections.&#xD;
      Systematically sampled sections immunostained with rabbit anti-human Protein Gene Product 9.5&#xD;
      (a neuron-specific protein), and DAB-marked goat anti-rabbit as the secondary antibody. The&#xD;
      sections are then microscoped in an Olympus BX51 light microscope with an Olympus DP71&#xD;
      digital camera and Prior motorized board connected to a computer with Newcast stereology&#xD;
      software. Two goals can then be calculated: 1) the number of free nerve endings, which&#xD;
      crosses the border between dermis and epidermis per mm 2) the average nerve fibre length&#xD;
      density in the epidermis and / or dermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin punch biopsies from the mastectomy scar are fixed in formaldehyde for embedding in&#xD;
      paraffin. The tissue samples are cut into 1-2 micron thick sections and stained with&#xD;
      Picrosirius red (PR) colour. By using polarized light microscopy, the various subtypes of&#xD;
      collagen fibres may be visualized and differentiated. The thicker collagen fibres (type I)&#xD;
      are red-orange-yellow and the thinner collagen fibres (type III) are green. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      sections will be stained for elastin. Quantitatively, by means of the above-mentioned method,&#xD;
      changes in the volume fraction of collagen type I and III, and elastin may be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimal clinically relevant difference the study is looking for, is a Visual Analog Pain&#xD;
      score difference of 3. The common standard deviation was estimated from a similar study by&#xD;
      Caviggioli et al. in 2011, and set to be 2.96 on the Visual Analog Pain scale. We assume that&#xD;
      our standard deviation (SD) will be the same. Using the following formula: N = (Za + Zb)2 x&#xD;
      SD2 / dif2 where Za and Zb are the standardized normal deviations corresponding to the&#xD;
      selected levels of significance, SD is Standard Deviation and dif is the minimal clinically&#xD;
      relevant difference the study is looking for. The result is 16 patients in each arm,&#xD;
      totalling 32 patients, when the significance level is set at 5% and the power of the study is&#xD;
      set to 80%. Statistical analyzes will be performed in collaboration with a biostatistician&#xD;
      from the Health Sciences Institution, Aarhus University, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic Conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is supported by: Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Aarhus with three full&#xD;
      time equivalents, which is used to pay for full-time academic staff. Other project expenses&#xD;
      are to be covered by independent foundations and endowments that do not have an influence on&#xD;
      the study. None of the personnel in the project have a financial interest in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation to the participating patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating patients in the study will not receive any financial compensation. However,&#xD;
      documented travel expenses will be reimbursed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are primarily recruited from a previous study, were a questionnaire was sent to all&#xD;
      women having received an unilateral mastectomy at Aarhus University Hospital, in the period&#xD;
      from 2009 to 2013. In the questionnaire, patients were asked to evaluate their pain in the&#xD;
      different areas pertaining to PBTPS, and if they would allow our department to contact them&#xD;
      in regards to the present study. If patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, they are&#xD;
      contacted by the primary investigator by telephone, and a meeting were the details of the&#xD;
      study are presented is arranged. Patients with PBTPS could also be recruited during their&#xD;
      routine visits at the department of oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will always be offered at least 24 hours of consideration before deciding to&#xD;
      give written consent to participate in the study. With the signing of the consent form, the&#xD;
      patient accepts the terms and conditions in the study. The patient may at any time and&#xD;
      without justification withdraw her consent to participate, without her decision affecting her&#xD;
      present or future treatment or any other rights the patient may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative, inconclusive and positive results from the study will be published in&#xD;
      internationally recognized, peer-reviewed, English-language journals with an interest in the&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical statement, side effects and risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present project, data will be treated confidentially in accordance with the Danish Act&#xD;
      on Processing of Personal Data. Participants shall be informed both in writing and orally&#xD;
      prior to deciding to participate in the study. The participants are thus fully aware of the&#xD;
      projects purpose, background and methods, as well as what is expected from the patient's role&#xD;
      as a participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating patients are in the lipotransplantation group, offered an active treatment,&#xD;
      which if the current study program can confirm the foreign study, hopefully reduces their&#xD;
      daily pain and discomfort and thereby also their consumption of analgesia. If the project&#xD;
      provides positive results, the control group will, after the study has ended, be offered the&#xD;
      same active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, which only after informed consent, is part of the project will, in connection&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lipotransplantation in general anaesthesia; only be exposed to the risk associated with&#xD;
           general anaesthesia. The patients in the present study have in relation to their&#xD;
           previous surgery for breast cancer been exposed to one or more interventions in general&#xD;
           anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risks related to the actual lipotransplantation. At the donor site, there is a risk for&#xD;
           short-term tenderness and temporary discolouration. In the long term, a slightly rough&#xD;
           surface of the skin may arise. The advantage of the harvest of the fat graft is that the&#xD;
           patient achieves a visible improvement of the contour at the donor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The risk related to the skin punch biopsies: apart from a small scar 1-3 mm&#xD;
           corresponding to the place where the biopsy is collected, there is not assessed to any&#xD;
           risk of permanent injury or damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interventions are carried out by experienced specialists in plastic surgery with several&#xD;
      years experience with lipotransplantation. The general anaesthesia is performed by&#xD;
      specialists in anaesthesiology, which are all part of the permanent team at the plastic&#xD;
      surgery department and therefore familiar with providing anaesthesia during the described&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
