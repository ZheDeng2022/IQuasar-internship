  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)&#xD;
      activity on the risk of HDM-related bone marrow- and hepatotoxicity and treatment&#xD;
      interruptions during maintenance therapy for children with ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study: Patients with TPMT activity compatible with TPMT low activity&#xD;
      polymorphisms have an increased risk of toxicity following high-dose methotrexate (HDM)&#xD;
      compared to children with normal TPMT activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-dose methotrexate (HDM) given concurrently with oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) may be&#xD;
      followed by myelotoxicity, which may necessitate treatment interruption and thus interfere&#xD;
      with the efficacy of the treatment of childhood ALL. Several studies have indicated that MTX&#xD;
      and 6MP act synergistically. It has previously been reported that the risk of significant&#xD;
      bone-marrow suppression is increased if oral 6MP is coadministered with HDM during&#xD;
      maintenance therapy and that reductions of the dose of concurrently given oral 6MP can reduce&#xD;
      the risk of significant myelotoxicity following HDM. MTX may increase the bioavailability of&#xD;
      6MP through inhibition of xanthine oxidase, which catabolizes 6MP. In addition, MTX may&#xD;
      through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis enhance the availability of 6-thioguanine&#xD;
      nucleotides (6TGN) that primarily exert the cytotoxic effect of 6MP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enzyme TPMT competes with the formation of 6TGN, as it methylates 6MP and thus create&#xD;
      relatively non-toxic metabolites. TPMT heterozygous patients with one wild type and one&#xD;
      low-activity allele have a higher risk of myelosuppression and treatment interruption&#xD;
      compared to patients with TPMT wild type. Furthermore, TPMT heterozygous patients have a&#xD;
      reduced risk of relapse and a higher risk of secondary malignancy compared to patients with&#xD;
      TPMT wild type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little has been published on the influence of both TPMT activity and 6MP dosage on myelo- and&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity following HDM.&#xD;

        The study cohort was based on patients enrolled in the NOPHO ALL92 protocol, where 97% of&#xD;
        all eligible patients were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in this study was on the basis of TPMT status that was randomly missing.&#xD;
