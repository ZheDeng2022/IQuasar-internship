      Primary objective: to test the hypothesis that elective early delivery will protect the fetal&#xD;
      bowel from the deleterious intrauterine factors late in the pregnancy and will be associated&#xD;
      with improved neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to introduce a standardized diagnostic, monitoring, and postnatal&#xD;
      surgical management of infants with gastroschisis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroschisis is a congenital malformation in which abdominal organs protrude through an&#xD;
      abdominal wall defect, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality during infancy. In&#xD;
      contrast to the second class of congenital abdominal wall defects, omphalocele, there is no&#xD;
      association of gastroschisis with aneuploidy and there are no familial cohorts or&#xD;
      heritability indices to suggest genetic etiology to gastroschisis. Although multiple&#xD;
      population and cohort based-studies have implicated various environmental and maternal&#xD;
      factors in the pathogenesis of gastroschisis (e.g. young age, smoking), the causes and&#xD;
      mechanisms of this condition remain relatively unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The herniated bowel often accumulates a fibrinous covering possibly due to inflammation&#xD;
      induced by the amniotic fluid. There is usually a 25% or greater risk of intrauterine growth&#xD;
      restriction with gastroschisis. Although long term intact survival is excellent (exceeding&#xD;
      95%), the associated morbidity is significant including gastrointestinal complications such&#xD;
      as stricture, adhesions, and volvulus. Furthermore, there is a known association between&#xD;
      fetal gastroschisis and late gestational intra-uterine fetal demise (IUFD). Late gestation&#xD;
      IUFD is believed to result from acute volvulus of the small bowel and resultant bowel&#xD;
      necrosis and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, there were no indications for early delivery, however; now there is mounting&#xD;
      evidence supporting delivery at an earlier gestational age. This is supported with the&#xD;
      prevailing hypothesis that early delivery prevents further insult from the amniotic fluid to&#xD;
      the small bowel. However, these hypotheses have yet to be examined in a well designed,&#xD;
      adequately powered, randomized clinical trial. Consequently, it is our primary objective to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that elective early delivery will protect the fetal bowel from the&#xD;
      deleterious intrauterine factors late in the pregnancy. Our secondary objective is to&#xD;
      introduce a standardized protocol for diagnostic, antepartum, and post-natal surgical&#xD;
      management of infants with gastroschisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, four studies have attempted to evaluate the effect of delivery timing on neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. In a retrospective review of 57 cases, Huang was unable to demonstrate an&#xD;
      association between earlier delivery and shorter time to surgical repair or oral feeds. Logge&#xD;
      and colleagues performed a randomized controlled trial of delivery at 36 weeks (early) versus&#xD;
      awaiting spontaneous labor (later). Although the study did demonstrate a trend toward&#xD;
      improved outcomes in the earlier group, it was underpowered especially considering that the&#xD;
      mean gestational age for delivery in the early versus later groups differed by only a week&#xD;
      and were 35.8 and 36.7 weeks, respectively. In a recent report by Serra, 13 patients were&#xD;
      delivered electively at 34 weeks and compared to historical controls. The early delivery&#xD;
      group demonstrated shorter time to oral feeds and closure, along with decreased acute and&#xD;
      late complications. This corroborated similar findings by Peiro where 6 patients were&#xD;
      delivered at 34 weeks. In the latter, the morphology of the bowel demonstrated no evidence of&#xD;
      inflammation or thickening, which was uniformly seen in those delivered at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned earlier the hypothesis of improved benefit from early delivery has yet to be&#xD;
      examined in a well designed, adequately powered, randomized clinical trial. The preliminary&#xD;
      data underscore the need for 1) an adequately powered randomized controlled trial, 2) clearly&#xD;
      defined objective outcome measures, and 3) a standardized evidence-based management protocol&#xD;
      to attempt and control varying practices by obstetricians and pediatric surgeons, which may&#xD;
      undoubtedly impact the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal gastroschisis is generally diagnosed after 14 weeks gestation via ultrasound. The&#xD;
      subjects will be identified after referral has been made to the Texas Children's Pavilion for&#xD;
      Women Ultrasound unit, Texas Children's Fetal Center, or the Ben Taub Hospital's Ultrasound&#xD;
      unit. The subject population will consist of patients from the investigator or&#xD;
      co-investigators practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be approached by the principal or co-investigators. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before any study related procedures are done. Risks, benefits, and alternatives to&#xD;
      study participation will be discussed in their entirety and all questions answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care presently includes delivery at 38-39 weeks with cesarean delivery reserved for&#xD;
      obstetrical indications. The care under this research protocol will include standard care (as&#xD;
      mentioned above) for the &quot;late&quot; group, versus delivery at 34 weeks (research care) for the&#xD;
      &quot;early&quot; group. Otherwise, the remainder of the care will not differ regardless of the&#xD;
      allocation arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients with a suspected diagnosis of fetal gastroschisis will undergo a&#xD;
           comprehensive ultrasound examination to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, as part of&#xD;
           routine clinical care, the patient will undergo a Maternal-Fetal Medicine consultation.&#xD;
           After the visit, the patient will be approached regarding participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient agrees to participate and meets all inclusion criteria, the patient will&#xD;
           be enrolled into the study and assigned into the &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; delivery arm. After&#xD;
           informed consent, the patient will be assigned to a study arm using a concealed&#xD;
           envelope, which will be created prior to the start of the study using a randomization&#xD;
           scheme- prepared prior to start of study by non-participating statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Antepartum care will be similar for both groups except for timing of delivery. This will&#xD;
           include ultrasound fetal growth evaluations every 3 weeks and a weekly fetal biophysical&#xD;
           profile (antenatal fetal well-being testing) starting at 32 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The early group will undergo induction of labor at 34 weeks with cesarean delivery&#xD;
           reserved for obstetrical indications with two injections of celestone (12mg/kg) prior to&#xD;
           induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The late group will undergo induction of labor at 38-39 weeks with cesarean delivery&#xD;
           reserved for obstetrical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The trial will be conducted in an intent-to-treat fashion. With regards to the postnatal&#xD;
           management of the neonate, the neonate will be evaluated by a neonatologist and&#xD;
           pediatric surgeon immediately after birth. All neonates, regardless of allocation arm,&#xD;
           will undergo routine care including intubation and initiation of total parenteral&#xD;
           nutrition immediately after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With respect to nutritional care, all neonates will be managed per the Texas Children's&#xD;
           Hospital's neonatal intensive care (NICU) feeding protocol, which consists of exclusive&#xD;
           human milk. This is also applicable at Ben Taub General Hospital. Total Parenteral&#xD;
           Nutrition (TPN) will be continued until total oral intake exceeds 100 ml/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Two teaspoons (10mL) of maternal blood will be collected and will be stored&#xD;
           appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to surgical care, the neonates will be grouped as simple gastroschisis or&#xD;
      complicated gastroschisis. The latter will consist of cases complicated by perforation or&#xD;
      intestinal atresia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In all cases of simple gastroschisis, where immediate closure is not possible, they will&#xD;
           be placed in a silo with closure within 4 days (day of life 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In complicated cases with intestinal atresia, a silo closure will be undertaken within 4&#xD;
           days (day of life 5), and the neonates will be returned to the operating room at 6 weeks&#xD;
           of life for resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In complicated cases with perforation, the neonates will be taken immediately to the&#xD;
           operating room for ostomy and/or bowel ligation with closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include the following neonatal and pediatric components: 1. In all cases,&#xD;
      neonatal data will be collected during the initial post-delivery stay. This will include the&#xD;
      following variables: a. INITIAL STAY AFTER DELIVERY - length at birth and discharge - weight&#xD;
      at birth and discharge - head circumference at birth and discharge, - enteral feeding data&#xD;
      and parenteral nutrition throughout admission - nutrition related labs - APGAR scores -&#xD;
      medications- lasix, chlorothiazide, dopamine, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone - morbidities&#xD;
      such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, spontaneous intestinal&#xD;
      perforation, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, and chronic lung disease b. 1 MONTH POST&#xD;
      DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference - demographic, socioeconomic, and nutritional&#xD;
      information c. 6 MONTHS POST DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference d. 12 MONTHS&#xD;
      POST DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference e. 18 MONTHS POST DELIVERY - length -&#xD;
      weight - head circumference - the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II by a certified&#xD;
      practitioner Subject participation will be approximately 1 1/2 years.&#xD;
