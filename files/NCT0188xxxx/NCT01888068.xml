      A new investigational device (BIA/Vitality Analyzer™) is being compared to a United States&#xD;
      Food and Drug Approved 'predicate' reference device (EFG®) to demonstrate that they provide&#xD;
      equivalent measurements of body fat. Both devices are &quot;over-the-counter&quot; bioimpedance body&#xD;
      composition analyzers (estimate of body fat). These devices are classified as 'Not&#xD;
      Significant Risk' devices; they do not expose you to any significant risks.&#xD;

      You will be asked if you are 'healthy' to help the sub-investigator decide if you can be in&#xD;
      the study. This is part of the &quot;screening&quot; process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are 'healthy,' you will be asked to read and sign the informed consent documents and&#xD;
      then enter into the study. The study Sub-investigator will ask your age, standing height and&#xD;
      body weight. This information is used to describe the study participants. You will lie down&#xD;
      on a flat surface/table; remove your shoes, socks and any jewelry. Four adhesive electrodes&#xD;
      will be attached to your right hand and foot (two on each hand and foot), a small clip will&#xD;
      then be connected to each electrode. A low level, radiofrequency alternating electrical&#xD;
      current (425 microamps at 50 kilohertz) will be introduced into one pair (hand and foot) and&#xD;
      the voltage across your body will be measured (other hand and foot). You will not feel the&#xD;
      current being introduced into your body. While you remain on the table, the test will be&#xD;
      repeated with a second bioimpedance device. The time required to complete these tests is&#xD;
      about fifteen minutes. Participation in this study will depend upon if you are healthy and&#xD;
      meet the specific study guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for this study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. You are between the ages of 18 and 99 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. You declare that you are healthy and do not have any known disease condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. You are not pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. You do not have an implanted electrical defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. You do not have a pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method for determining body impedance is based on the conduction of an applied electrical&#xD;
      current in the organism. In biological structures, application of a constant low-level&#xD;
      alternating current results in an impedance to the spread of the current that is frequency&#xD;
      dependent. The living organism contains intra- and extracellular fluids that behave as&#xD;
      electrical conductors and cell membranes that act as electrical condensers and are regarded&#xD;
      as imperfect reactive elements. At low frequencies (-1 kHz) the current mainly passes through&#xD;
      the extracellular fluids, whereas at higher frequencies (50-800 kHz), it penetrates the&#xD;
      intra- and extracellular fluids. Thus body fluids and electrolytes are responsible for&#xD;
      electrical conductance, which is the inverse of resistance, and cell membranes are involved&#xD;
      in capacitance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In biological systems, electrical conduction is related to water and ionic distribution in&#xD;
      the conductor. Because fat-free mass, which includes the protein matrix of adipose tissue,&#xD;
      contains virtually all the water and conducting electrolytes in the body, conductivity is far&#xD;
      greater in the fat-free mass than the fat mass of the body. This hypothetical relationship&#xD;
      was proposed by Nyboer et al., who demonstrated that electrically determined biological&#xD;
      volumes (V) were inversely related to resistance (R), and reactance (Xc). Because the&#xD;
      magnitude of reactance is small relative to resistance, and resistance is a better predictor&#xD;
      of impedance than is reactance, the expression for V becomes: V = pL2/R, where R is in ohms.&#xD;
