  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine is conducting a research study on Irritable&#xD;
      Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a common condition in North America. It is a long term, recurring&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorder that is estimated to affect 30% of the general population. IBS is&#xD;
      characterized by abdominal pain and cramps, and bowel dysfunction such as diarrhea and&#xD;
      bloating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medicines that are currently used to help people with IBS are not as effective as we&#xD;
      would like them to be. These medicines are usually only prescribed to reduce the pain of IBS&#xD;
      and not actually treat the disorder itself. Recently, scientists have found that probiotics&#xD;
      (beneficial bacteria that live inside humans) may help reduce the painful symptoms and&#xD;
      diarrhea that are part of IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being conducted to determine whether this particular combination of three&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria (named Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      longum) will reduce the symptoms of severe IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effects of the three strain probiotic,&#xD;
      Kyo-Dophilus, on the symptoms associated with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome. A previous&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial identified individuals with severe IBS to be most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      the treatment provided in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of Kyo-Dophilus on the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome in an adult population diagnosed with&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome by ROME III criteria and classified as severe through the Irritable&#xD;
      Bowel Severity Scoring System and to measure quality of life and global well-being of&#xD;
      patients through the Adequate Relief Criteria and the Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of&#xD;
      Life Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the tolerability of the treatment through the use of&#xD;
      Adverse Event Reporting Forms.&#xD;

Subjects will be provided with two bottles containing 30 capsules each of matching placebo upon randomization. Subjects will be instructed to take one capsule with breakfast daily for the full 12 weeks duration of the trial. While one bottle contains enough capsules for the time frame between each visit, two bottles have been provided to permit a surplus in the event scheduling conflicts arise. The third bottle, providing the remainder or study capsules, will be provided at visit 2.</description>

The Kyo-Dophilus study product is a gelatin capsule containing three proprietary probiotic bacterial strains. The total quantity of bacteria per capsule is 1.5 billion colony forming units (1.5 x 109 cfu) and is composed of the following strains:&#xD;
Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13 1.2&#xD;
Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1 0.15&#xD;
Bifidobacterium longum MM-2 0.15&#xD;
