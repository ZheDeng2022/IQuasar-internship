  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The G coupled-protein receptors 99 (GPR99) was discovered in 2002 by Wittenberg et al.&#xD;
           and is involved as a metabolic receptor. It has been shown that the natural ligand of&#xD;
           GPR99 is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG). Studies done on&#xD;
           rats have shown that aKG is measurable in the blood, freely filtered by the glomerulus&#xD;
           and highly reabsorbed in the proximal tubule in metabolic acidosis, while it is not&#xD;
           reabsorbed in metabolic alkalosis. No absorption or secretion of aKG intervene between&#xD;
           the end of the proximal tubule and the final urine. Thus, having a receptor aKG in the&#xD;
           distal tubule creates a paracrine communication with the proximal tubule, informing&#xD;
           about the acid-base status of the body and allows adjustment of the urinary excretion of&#xD;
           acid or base.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The hypothesis is that GPR99 is aKG sensor in the distal tubules and allow to report the&#xD;
           acid-base status (determined by the metabolic activity of the proximal tubule) of the&#xD;
           body to the distal tubule. This can then adapt the urinary excretion of acid or base in&#xD;
           the final urine. Acidifying the body by a high meat consumption associated with a test&#xD;
           of acidification, the kidney should reduce its aKG excretion and the concentration of&#xD;
           this metabolite should be even lower in the urine. And vice versa in the case of&#xD;
           alkalizing the body through a vegetarian diet associated with an alkalizing test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve healthy omnivorous volunteers will be selected. First inclusion visit includes&#xD;
           verification of inclusion/exclusion criteria and signed informed consent. Urine and&#xD;
           plasma baseline measurements will be performed and volunteers will meet a dietician.&#xD;
           This person will tell them concerning meat and vegetarian diet as well as how to have a&#xD;
           diet with 6g of salt per day.Volunteers are then randomized in order to determine which&#xD;
           diet they will start first.The first phase will last during 4 days. The diet is followed&#xD;
           during 3 days, and a 24-hour urine collection will begin on the third day at 7: 00 am.&#xD;
           The fourth day, volunteers will have an investigational's day at the investigation's&#xD;
           center after completing their urine collection at home (7:00 am). During the day of&#xD;
           investigation, volunteers will give their urine (8: 00 am, corresponding to the baseline&#xD;
           urine), and then the &quot;meat&quot; arm will receive a tablet of 50meq of NH4Cl and the&#xD;
           &quot;vegetarian&quot; arm will receive a tablet of 1g of NaHC03. Volunteers will stay in the&#xD;
           investigation center for 6h. Each hour since 8:00am, a urine sample will be taken, and&#xD;
           at 3 hours and 6 hours post-tablet, a blood sample will also be made.This&#xD;
           investigational's day will be followed by one to two weeks of treatment washing out.&#xD;
           After that, the second phase will begin and will as the first phase excepted that the&#xD;
           diet will be inversed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5 other healthy vegetarian or vegan volunteers are recruited. Inclusion visit is the&#xD;
           same as omnivorous volunteers. Only investigational's day at the investigation's center&#xD;
           will be performed (no diet, no urine collection).&#xD;
