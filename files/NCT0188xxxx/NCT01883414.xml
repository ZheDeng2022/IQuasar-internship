  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will received on Ulthera® treatment on&#xD;
      one half of their surgical scar. Follow up visits will occur at 30, 90 and 180 days after&#xD;
      treatment. Study images will be obtained before treatment, immediately after treatment and at&#xD;
      each follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Ulthera® system to improve the appearance of scar tissue on the neck, abdomen or back.&#xD;
      Changes from baseline of the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale score will be assessed at&#xD;
      study follow-up visits. Images will be obtained prior to treatment and at each follow up&#xD;
      visit. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is improvement in appearance of scar tissue as determined by a masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 90-days post-treatment time points comparing the treated to untreated side of the scar.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Masked assessors will compare baseline images to images obtained at the 90 day follow up time point in a blinded fashion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1. Improvement in POSAS score of the treated half of the scar as assessed by the observer using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) at 90-days post-treatment compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The observer will complete the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (6 questions) prior to treatment and at each follow up visit on both halves of the scar (treated and untreated). Scores will be tabulated and compared for improvement at 90 days after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2. Difference in POSAS score as assessed by the patient using the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) between the treated and untreated half of the scar at 90-days post-treatment compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will complete the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (6 questions) prior to treatment and at each follow up visit on both halves of the scar (treated and untreated). Scores will be tabulated and compared for improvement at 90 days after treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3. Patient satisfaction questionnaire at the 90-day follow-up visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will complete a Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) at the 90 follow-up visit. These results will be tabulated to assess subjects satisfaction with the treatment.</description>
