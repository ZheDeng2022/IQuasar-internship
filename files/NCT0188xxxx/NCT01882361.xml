  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the question of the comparison of two courses of Vivitrol with differing lengths&#xD;
      in 130 HIV negative, consenting, opioid addicted patients who have completed inpatient&#xD;
      treatment. Participants will be randomized under double blind conditions to a 24 or 48-week&#xD;
      course of pharmacotherapy, along with bi-weekly drug counselling, over 48 weeks, with&#xD;
      follow-ups at weeks 60 and 72. The 24-week cohort will receive Vivitrol placebo injections in&#xD;
      weeks 24 to 48.&#xD;

      1.2.1 Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Opiate positive urine tests; 2) HIV injecting risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Time to relapse; 2) HIV sex risk; 3) Proportion of appointments kept; 6) Psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms; 7) Opioid craving; 8) Self-reported drug use; 9) Money spent for drugs; 10)&#xD;
      Employment; 11) Arrests; 12) Overall adjustment; 12) Adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcomes will significantly favor the 48-week Vivitrol condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Five or more secondary outcomes will favor the 48-week condition; none will favor the&#xD;
           24-week condition.&#xD;

    <description>Vivitrol is an extended-release, microsphere formulation of naltrexone designed to be administered by intramuscular (IM) gluteal injection every 4 weeks or once a month. After IM injection, the naltrexone plasma concentration time profile is characterized by a transient initial peak, which occurs approximately 2 hours after injection, followed by a second peak observed approximately 2 - 3 days later. Beginning approximately 14 days after dosing, concentrations slowly decline, with measurable levels for greater than 1 month.</description>
