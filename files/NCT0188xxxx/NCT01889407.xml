  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term survival rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been significantly prolonged&#xD;
      due to the improvement of chemotherapeutic protocols and hemopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. However, about 20%-40% of the patients with refractory AML fail to achieve&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) and approximately 50% of the CR patients will relapse eventually. 1-3&#xD;
      The refractoried and relapsed AML patients have very poor prognosis, therefore refractoriness&#xD;
      and relapse are the major challenges for the chemotherapy of AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemoresistance is one of the major obstacle for the success of AML treatment.4 One of the&#xD;
      main mediators for AML chemoresistance is the multi-drug resistance-1(MDR1) gene and MDR1&#xD;
      protein, also known as permeability-glycoprotein or P-gp.5,6,7 Studies on leukemic blast&#xD;
      cells demonstrated the association of MDR1 expression with a lower intracellular retention of&#xD;
      cytostatic drugs leading to cancer cell resistance to several commonly used anti-cancer drugs&#xD;
      in chemotherapy. Several subsequent studies indicated the influence of MDR1 expression levels&#xD;
      in the treatment response and survival of leukemia patients, the frequency of resistance to&#xD;
      the chemotherapy increased with increasing MDR1 expression.8,9,10 Previous methods for&#xD;
      determination of MDR1 expression have included demonstration of P-glycoprotein by flow&#xD;
      cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry, and molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based&#xD;
      assays for RNA expression. However, these assays have either proven difficult to standardize&#xD;
      or tedious to perform and they are mainly focused on qualitative or semi-quantitative assays.&#xD;
      11,12 A real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR will increase the sensitivity and also&#xD;
      maintain the high specificity. The false positivity caused by pollution of amplification&#xD;
      production can also be decreased by hermetization operation. RQ- PCR is a novel methodology&#xD;
      which enables sensitive and quantitative measurement of gene expression. 12We have&#xD;
      established RQ-PCR method for determination expression of MDR1 gene. We have performed a&#xD;
      pilot study with a small cohort of AML patients to determine the relationship of MDR1&#xD;
      expression and CR rate of AML patients. The data shows MDR1 expression has been found in most&#xD;
      cases of AML. However, the MDR1 expression levels vary widely from case to case. This result&#xD;
      indicated that RQ-PCR method would provide an accurate quantitative measurement for detection&#xD;
      of MDR1 expression level in different AML cases who were both positive by qualitative RT-PCR&#xD;
      method. 13,14 The pilot results indicated that the complete response rate to induction&#xD;
      therapy was compromised by the expression of high levels of MDR1. 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal residual disease (MRD) is the major cause of leukemia relapse. It has been reported&#xD;
      that the treatment intensity in human leukemia can be assessed by the expression status of&#xD;
      MRD gene. However, more than 50% of acute leukemia, especially in AMLs, lack known genetic&#xD;
      lesions or clonegenic markers suitable for MRD monitoring. WT1 gene is located on chromosome&#xD;
      11p13 coding for a zinc-finger transcription factor, has been identified in most AML&#xD;
      patients. It has been reported that detection of WT1 levels can effectively monitor the MRD&#xD;
      expression status in AML.16,17 Therefore, WT1 expression can be used to monitor the MRD and&#xD;
      evaluation the remission quality in AML patients. By detecting WT1 levels we can evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of different induction therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By employing multiple fluorescence quantitative PCR, several target genes can be&#xD;
      simultaneously and quantitatively amplified. Therefore multiple fluorescence quantitative PCR&#xD;
      is more suitable for clinical application. This technology will not only provide higher&#xD;
      accuracy, specificity and reproducibility but also simplify procedure and reduce measurement&#xD;
      cost. The recombinant plasmids of MDR1 and WT1 gene have been constructed and the methodology&#xD;
      of multiple fluorescence quantitative PCR has also been developed in our group .14&#xD;
&#xD;
      High MDR1 gene expression is a common feature of AML resistance to conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimen.18,19 One of the strategies that overcome MDR is to increase the&#xD;
      pharmacal liposolubility and elevate the intracellular drug concentration, so as to&#xD;
      counteract drug efflux pumped by P-glycoprotein. Idarubicin (IDA), a new anthracycline, has&#xD;
      more strengthened liposolubility and can easily permeate the cell membrane in comparison with&#xD;
      traditional marcellomycin. Also, the in vivo metabolite of IDA (4-IDA) has the same&#xD;
      antineoplastic activity as IDA and a longer half-life in vivo. It can also permeate blood&#xD;
      brain barrier. As a result, IDA has a stronger antileukemia activity than other marcellomycin&#xD;
      and can partially overcome P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance.20, 21 In our recently&#xD;
      pilot study, we have detected the expression of MDR1 in pre-treated bone marrow samples from&#xD;
      160 de novo AML patients and the median value of MDR1/GAPDH ratio in the de novo AML cases&#xD;
      was 0.016（0-81.865）. The median value of MDR1 gene expression was taken as the cut-off point&#xD;
      of high or low MDR1 gene expression levels. For high MDR1 expression patients, a lower CR&#xD;
      rate (61.3%) was observed compared with low-MDR1 expression patients (80.0%, P =0.009). In&#xD;
      this retrospective pilot study, 123 patients were received daunorubicin (DNR 35~45mg/m2/d,3&#xD;
      days) or idarubicin (IDA 6~8 mg/m2/d, 3 days) in combination with cytarabine (Ara-c100~200&#xD;
      mg/m2/d, 7 days) for remission induction and significant difference were also observed after&#xD;
      2 courses of chemotherapy between those who receive IA regimen (57 cases) and DA regimen (66&#xD;
      cases) regarding to CR rate (80.7% vs 57.6%, P=0.006). Significant difference could also be&#xD;
      discovered between two treatment arm with regard to CR rate (75.9% vs 43.6%, P=0.011) in&#xD;
      those who had high MDR1 expression AML patients. Our data shows that IDA may overcome MDR1&#xD;
      induced chemoresistance with a higher CR rate than DNR in de novo high MDR1 expresser AML&#xD;
      patients.These results provide rationale for development of randomized, prospective trial to&#xD;
      compare the CR rate of IA regimen and DA regimen in de novo AML patients with high MDR1&#xD;
      expression and to identify whether Idarubicin can overcomes MDR1 induced chemoresistance with&#xD;
      higher induction remission rate than daunorubicin in de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients.&#xD;
      We speculated that the more favorable outcome in high-MDR1 patient group with IA regimen may&#xD;
      be associated with a higher remission rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It had been reported that AML patients achieved lower MRD level had an extremely lower&#xD;
      relapse rate. It had also been reported that patients treated with IA regimen had a&#xD;
      significant higher long-term survival than those with DA regimen .22-24 Therefore, we&#xD;
      speculated that the more favorable outcome in IA group may be associated with a lower MRD&#xD;
      level and higher remission quality. This study is also to conduct a prospective analysis on&#xD;
      the alteration of WT1 and MDR1 gene expression level after induction therapy with IA or DA&#xD;
      separately to identify whether induction therapy with IA regimen has a lower MRD level and a&#xD;
      higher remission quality than that of DA regimen.&#xD;
