  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who recently suffered a heart attack will use a smart-phone/computer application&#xD;
      during cardiac rehabilitation to reduce their risk of a future attack, their&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations, their cost of care, and increase their quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two phases - an initial feasibility trial (Phase 1), followed by a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (Phase 2). Once the Phase 1 trial is evaluated, Phase 2 will be&#xD;
      implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will consist of up to 35 participants to ensure that the software application is&#xD;
      user-friendly, properly stores pertinent data, and has no technical glitches. All&#xD;
      participants in Phase 1 will have access to the software application and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete online questionnaires, at baseline and post cardiac rehab, to assess their quality&#xD;
      of life and also their satisfaction with their care and the software application itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will consist of 65 participants. These participants will be randomized to either 1)&#xD;
      Cardiac Rehab (CR) alone along with answering questionnaires regarding quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction of care or 2) CR along with the software application and the quality of life,&#xD;
      satisfaction of care and software application questionnaires. All participants (both Phase 1&#xD;
      and Phase 2) enrolled into the study will be status-post percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI). The potential participants will be asked to participate while still in the hospital&#xD;
      and will be approached as soon as possible after agreeing to participate in CR,. The&#xD;
      participants who enroll in Phase 2 will be randomized prior to discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in Phase 1 and those in Phase 2 who randomize to the software application&#xD;
      will be instructed on the use of either the desktop or smart-phone version of the software&#xD;
      application. Baseline information, including participant name, date of birth, email address,&#xD;
      and phone number, will be gathered from the participant at that time, and all characteristics&#xD;
      will be entered by the participant and study coordinator into their own account in the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow all Phase 1 participants and those in Phase 2 who randomize to the&#xD;
      software application for three months after hospital dismissal and evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight/BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual lab values already gathered for the participant such as lipids, Complete Blood&#xD;
           Count (CBC), and HgbA1C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life, disposition, and mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant compliance, satisfaction, and adherence to the application&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-hospitalizations, participants phone calls, and cost of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second week of their CR an additional 30-60 minute educational session will be&#xD;
      required so that the study coordinator can instruct the participant on the software&#xD;
      application and how to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also ask that participants &quot;log in&quot; to their online account at least 3-4 times weekly&#xD;
      for important reminders, care tips, and educational materials. This will last the duration of&#xD;
      their cardiac rehabilitation program (approximately 12 weeks). Specific examples of sections&#xD;
      within the software application will pertain to medication adherence, diet, exercise,&#xD;
      educational materials, and reviews of your medical profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we would ask that participants (all of Phase 1 and those who randomize to the&#xD;
      software application in Phase 2) to complete online questionnaires, at baseline and post&#xD;
      cardiac rehab. that assess their quality of life and also their satisfaction with their care&#xD;
      and the software application itself. This will be used for both data purposes as well as in&#xD;
      future improvements to the program. These individual surveys will take approximately 5&#xD;
      minutes to complete. Phase 2 study participants who do not randomize to the software&#xD;
      application will be sent the quality of life and satisfaction of care questionnaires.&#xD;
