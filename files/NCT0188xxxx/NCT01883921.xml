      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the utility of an electronic data capture (EDC) system (CareExchange™) using&#xD;
           infusion nurse and patient measured physical, quality of life (QOL), respiratory,&#xD;
           laboratory, and disability assessments in patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Disease&#xD;
           (PIDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Intravenous/Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (IVIg/SCIg) dose effects measured&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in IVIg/SCIg dose timing effects measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in patient status is reflected in measured outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the value to physicians from collected outcomes data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify types of patients by response to IVIg/SCIg therapies (well maintained,&#xD;
           problematic, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in response rate as measured by outcomes to IVIg/SCIg therapies by disease state,&#xD;
           co-morbidities, and demographics.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational evaluation of immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy in consenting&#xD;
      PIDD adult and assenting pediatric subjects who receive infusion services from BriovaRx&#xD;
      Infusion Services (formerly AxelaCare Health Solutions, LLC). Subjects meeting all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria who have provided informed consent/assent for trial participation will have&#xD;
      validated, physician-prescribed, standard-of-care outcome measures, and Ig administration&#xD;
      information recorded during normal home infusion visits. There will also be standard-of-care&#xD;
      questions captured within some outcome measures recorded during normal home infusion visits&#xD;
      that may be at a frequency and/or combination which may not be considered routine clinical&#xD;
      care by some physicians who treat for this medical condition. Collected data will be&#xD;
      de-identified and aggregated into cohorts of like diagnosis for trend analysis.&#xD;
