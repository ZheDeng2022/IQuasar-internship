    <textblock>
      Acknowledging that level I evidence already exists regarding the general beneficial impact on&#xD;
      FDG PET in the staging and subsequent management of lung cancer the investigators postulate&#xD;
      that fusing PET/CT data sets with RT CT simulation data sets for adult patients with&#xD;
      conventionally/clinically assessed stage III non-small cell lung cancer will have a&#xD;
      significant impact on GTV as well as normal tissue irradiation. This research will also&#xD;
      estimate inter and intra-observer variability of treatment planning, relative to GTV, between&#xD;
      and amongst radiation oncologists.&#xD;

      Primary objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.To determine the impact of PET/CT fusion on gross tumor volume ( GTV ) for primary(GTVP)&#xD;
      and nodal (GTVN) disease for each patient by comparing GTV contours using two separate data&#xD;
      sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) GTVP CT+ ve and GTVN CT+ ve&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) GTVP PET+ve and GTVN PET +ve&#xD;
&#xD;
      GTV will be measured and recorded in cubic centimeters for each volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Normal tissue toxicity:3D conformal Computerized radiation plans will be generated for the&#xD;
      data sets GTVP and GTVN A and B .Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) will be determined and compared&#xD;
      for the following normal tissue toxicity parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. V 20 Both lungs (Combined total lung volumes including PTV): Volume of both lungs&#xD;
      receiving ≥ 20 G y, including planning target volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Mean lung dose: Mean radiation dose received by both lungs in a given radiation plan,&#xD;
      calculated by the planning computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. V 55 Esophagus: Volume of esophagus receiving≥ 55Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Mean esophageal dose : Mean radiation dose received by whole esophagus in a given&#xD;
      radiation plan, calculated by the planning computer&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Spinal cord dose: Maximum dose received by the spinal cord in a given radiation plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V1.. V40 Whole heart: Volume of heart receiving ≥ 40Gy&#xD;
&#xD;
      2A Inter observer variation: This will be determined for the data sets GTV A and B only&#xD;
      delineated by 4 radiation oncologists blinded to each other, for first 20 patients. The&#xD;
      resident involved in this project will be responsible to co-ordinate this part of the&#xD;
      project. GTV will be measured and recorded in cubic centimeters for each volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2B Intra observer variation: This will be determined for the data sets GTV A and B only&#xD;
      delineated by the same radiation oncologist (treating physician) at two different occasions,&#xD;
      for first 20 patients. Minimum time interval between the two contours will be one month .The&#xD;
      resident involved in this project will be responsible to co-ordinate this part of the&#xD;
      project. GTV will be measured and recorded in cubic centimeters for each volume.&#xD;
