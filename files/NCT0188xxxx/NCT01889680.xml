  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FC-8 is a Phase II, multi-center randomized study of a continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV with&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept or 5-FU/LV alone (control arm) following the induction regimen of mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      and ziv-aflibercept as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the study is to determine the value of adding ziv-aflibercept to the&#xD;
      continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV in improving progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer who have achieved at least stable disease after induction&#xD;
      therapy. The secondary aim is to determine the overall objective response rate (complete,&#xD;
      partial or stable responses) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive an induction regimen with mFOLFOX6 (5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus Day 1 +&#xD;
      leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV Day 1 + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV Day 1 followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 by&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion (CIV infusion) over 46 hours [Day 1 and 2]) + ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      (4 mg/kg on Day 1) every 14 days for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attaining stable disease or better after 6 cycles of induction therapy will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a continuation regimen of either 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept IV [4 mg/kg&#xD;
      Day 1]) every 14 days, as the investigational arm; or 5-FU/LV alone every 14 days, as the&#xD;
      control arm, until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submission of archived primary tumor tissue and blood samples for FC-8 correlative science&#xD;
      studies will be a study requirement for all patients. Submissions will include primary tumor&#xD;
      specimens from the diagnostic biopsy sample or another previous surgery and blood samples&#xD;
      collected before the start of study therapy, prior to starting each even numbered cycle of&#xD;
      therapy, (i.e., Cycles 2, 4, and 6) and at the time of disease progression or end of study&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study accrual will be up to 120 patients over a period of 24 months in order to&#xD;
      provide 90 patients for randomization to the continuation regimen. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 to receive the continuation regimen of 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept (Arm 2, 60&#xD;
      patients) or 5-FU/LV alone (Arm 1, 30 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, clinical response will be assessed by radiological examination every eight&#xD;
      weeks during the continuation regimen course.&#xD;
