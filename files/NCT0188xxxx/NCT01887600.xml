    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Anemia is a&#xD;
      reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is important for the transport of&#xD;
      oxygen in your blood. The purpose of the study was to see if Roxadustat is both effective and&#xD;
      safe as a treatment for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

    <description>Baseline FACT-An Total Score was defined as the FACT-An Total score on Day 1. Total Fact-An score is composed of FACT-G and Ans scales. FACT-G contains 27 items that cover four dimensions of well-being: physical (PWB) - 7 items, functional (FWB) - 7 items, social/family (SWB) - 7 items, and emotional (EWB) - 6 items. The AnS scale contains 13 fatigue specific items (the Fatigue Score) plus 7 items related to anemia. The total score is obtained by summation of the scores from PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB and AnS. The FACT-An Total Score scale range is 0-188. A higher score indicates better QoL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Euroqol Questionnaire - 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D 5L) is a self-reported questionnaire. The EQ-5D 5L is used as a measure of respondents' Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The EQ-5D 5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D 5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, where the answers are labeled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' with higher scores for higher HRQoL.</description>

    <measure>Change From BL to the Average Value of Weeks 12-28 in Overall Work Impairment Due to Anaemic Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>Work productivity and activity impairment: anemic symptoms (WPAI:ANS) questionnaire version 2 was used to measure work and activity impairment during the last seven days due to anemia. It is self-assessed questionnaire which consists of 6 questions covering work and daily activities. Questions include asking if participant is working, how many hours the person missed work due to anemic symptoms, how many hours the person missed work due to other reasons, how many hours participant actually worked and how the anemic symptoms impacted their productivity and ability to do daily activities. For the last 2 questions, they were scored from 0-10 with 0 identifying no effect on work and 10 completely prevented from working. Overall work impairment due to ANS was calculated as 100 x Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)]. Scores were calculated with the formula to derive the overall work impairment on each timepoints in percentage, and then changes of the percentage from baseline are reported.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study population consisted of anemic participants with stages 3, 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2) who were not on dialysis. Participants were recruited from 125 study centers located in 22 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 594 participants with CKD were randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio receiving roxadustat or placebo. Anemia was defined as a mean Hb ≤ 10.0 g/dL upon repeated measurements during the screening period. Participants needed a ferritin ≥30 ng/mL (≥ 67.4 pmol/L) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 5%.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Roxadustat</title>
          <description>Participants received roxadustat according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting doses of 70 mg given thrice weekly (TIW) to participants weighing up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Change from BL in SF-36 VT sub-score to the average value in weeks 12-28 was calculated using the physical component scores (PCS) of SF-36. The multi-purpose, short-form health survey has 36 questions with an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. The survey measures eight dimensions or scales: (1) physical functioning (PF) (10 items); (2) role limitations due to physical health problems (RP) (3 items); (3) bodily pain (BP) (2 items); (4) social functioning (SF) (2 items); (5) general health perceptions (GH) (5 items); (6) role limitations due to emotional problems (RE) (3 items); (7) vitality, energy or fatigue (VT) (4 items); and (8) mental health (MH) (5 items). The SF-36 scores ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>

        <title>Change From BL in SF-36 Physical Functioning (PF) Sub-score to the Average PF Sub-score of Weeks 12 to 28</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in SF-36 PF normalized sub-score compared to the average PF sub-score of weeks 12 to 28. The multi-purpose, short-form health survey has 36 questions with an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. Change from baseline in PF sub score of SF-36 to the average of weeks 12-28 was compared by treatment arm for all participants (primary analysis) and in the subsets of participants with baseline PF sub score below 35 and equal or above 35. The SF-36 scores ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better health status. All available SF-36 PF values were used i.e., both scheduled and unscheduled for the calculation of the average PF sub-score of weeks 12 to 28.</description>

            <groups_desc>Average Level of Hb Over Weeks 96 to 104. A Mixed Model of Repeated Measures was applied using the visits over weeks 96 to 104. The results were based on the estimated difference between the two treatment arms by visit. The model included treatment arm, region, CV history, visits and visit by treatment as categorical variables and baseline Hb and baseline eGFR as continuous variables.</groups_desc>

        <title>Time to Achieve the First Hb Response Without Rescue Therapy, as Defined by Primary Endpoint</title>
        <description>Hb response was measured as Yes or No; Yes was defined as Hb ≥11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline by ≥ 1.0 g/dL, for participants with baseline Hb &gt; 8.0 g/dL; or Hb increase from baseline by ≥ 2.0 g/dL, for participants with baseline Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dL. For a participant without rescue therapy before Hb response (defined in 1 primary outcome), the time to achieve Hb response was calculated (in weeks) as: (First event date - Analysis date of first dose intake + 1) / 7 where First event date was defined as First date of both values that met the criteria for response. Participants who discontinued or received rescue therapy prior to the first Hb response or before the second consecutive Hb value defined as a response were classified as non responders and were censored at week 24 or end of efficacy emergent period, whichever came first. Data analysis was completed using Kaplan-Meier estimate for cumulative proportion.</description>

        <description>During efficacy emergent period, the mean monthly number of RBC packs was calculated as the sum of units transfused between the first dose and up to the last dose in the period divided by duration of efficacy emergent period (in days) divided by 28 days. The efficacy emergent period was defined as the evaluation period from the analysis date of first dose intake up to 7 days after the analysis date of last dose or EOT visit, whichever occured first. In case of missing number of packs, values were estimated based on 1 unit for packed cells = 250 mL or 1 unit for whole blood = 500 mL. Participants without RBC transfusion were included with a value of zero. No estimation if values were missing.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received matching placebo for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

          <title>Mean Monthly Volume of Blood Transfused</title>
          <description>During efficacy emergent period, the mean monthly volume of blood transfused was calculated as the sum of blood volume transfused between the first dose and up to the last dose in the period divided by duration of efficacy emergent period (in days) divided by 28 days. The efficacy emergent period was defined as the evaluation period from the analysis date of first dose intake up to 7 days after the analysis date of last dose or EOT visit, whichever occurred first. The mean monthly volume transfused was calculated as the sum of the volume transfused between the first dose and up to the last dose in the period divided by duration (in days) and multiplied by 28 days. Participants without RBC transfusion were included with a value of zero.</description>

            <description>Participants received matching placebo according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting doses of 70 mg given thrice weekly (TIW) to participants weighing up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received matching placebo for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting doses of 70 mg given thrice weekly (TIW) to participants weighing up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting doses of 70 mg given thrice weekly (TIW) to participants weighing up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>The 36-Item short-form health survey (SF-36) is a multi-purpose survey with 36 questions. It provides an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. For each scale scores range from 0-100. The physical component score was calculated based on the results of the SF-36 scores. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

        <description>Baseline FACT-An AnS was defined as the FACT-An AnS value on Day 1. Together with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), the Anemia Subscale (AnS) is referred to as the FACT-An Total. The AnS scale contains 13 fatigue specific items (the Fatigue Score) plus 7 items related to anemia. The Anemia AnS score range is 0 to 80. For the above score, a higher score indicates better QoL.</description>

        <description>Work productivity and activity impairment: anemic symptoms (WPAI:ANS) questionnaire version 2 was used to measure work and activity impairment during the last seven days due to anemia. It is self-assessed questionnaire which consists of 6 questions covering work and daily activities. Questions include asking if participant is working, how many hours the person missed work due to anemic symptoms, how many hours the person missed work due to other reasons, how many hours participant actually worked and how the anemic symptoms impacted their productivity and ability to do daily activities. For the last 2 questions, they were scored from 0-10 with 0 identifying no effect on work and 10 completely prevented from working. Overall work impairment due to ANS was calculated as 100 x Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)]. Scores were calculated with the formula to derive the overall work impairment on each timepoints in percentage, and then changes of the percentage from baseline are reported.</description>

        <description>HbA1c was measured at each timepoint and presented in 'fraction of 1' unit by dividing the values in percentage by 100, in order to fit for CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) standard terminology. Changes from baseline to each timepoint were reported in unit 'fraction of 1'. Baseline was assessed on Day 1 visit. If baseline value was missing, the value from screening visit was used. In case of missing data, no imputation rules were applied.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting doses of 70 mg given thrice weekly (TIW) to participants weighing up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Baseline assessment was the assessment from day 1 visit. If baseline value was missing, value from screening visit was used. In case of missing data, no imputation rules were applied. To compute the geometric mean of albumin/creatinine ratio in urine and associated 95% CI, the mean of log-transformed albumin/creatinine ratio in urine values (ratio) and associated 95% CI are back-transformed to the raw scale. All assessments collected after initiation of dialysis (acute or chronic) were excluded from the analysis.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Baseline assessment was the assessment from day 1 visit. If baseline value was missing, the value from screening visit was used. In case of missing data, no imputation rules were applied. To compute the geometric mean of serum Cr (ratio) and associated 95% CI, the mean of log-transformed serum Cr (ratio) values and associated 95% CI are back-transformed to the raw scale. All assessments collected after initiation of dialysis (acute or chronic) were excluded from the analysis.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting doses of 70 mg given thrice weekly (TIW) to participants weighing up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>The endpoint was defined as time to doubling serum creatinine or chronic dialysis or renal transplant what ever came first. Time to event was defined as (First event date - Analysis date of first dose intake + 1) / 365.25. First event date was defined as date of dialysis or date of renal transplant (whichever occurred first) and analysis date of first dose intake was defined as date of first study drug dose intake collected on day 1 visit. Data analysis was completed using Kaplan-Meier estimate for cumulative proportion. The data evaluated until the safety emergent period, which was defined as the evaluation period from analysis date of first drug intake up to 28 days after the analysis last dose, and results were presented for every 6 months up to 2 years.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline (BL) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for at least 52 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <title>Time to CKD Progression (Composite of Doubling Serum Creatinine, Chronic Dialysis or Renal Transplant, and Death)</title>
        <description>CKD progression was defined as date of occurrence of chronic dialysis or date of renal transplant or doubled serum creatinine or date of death, whichever came first. The time to CKD progression was calculated (in years) as (First event date - Analysis date of first dose intake + 1) / 365.25. First event date was defined as first occurrence of serum creatinine being doubled compared with baseline, first occurrence of chronic dialysis or renal transplant, occurrence of participants who died (whichever occurred first). Analysis date of first dose intake was defined as date of first study drug dose intake collected on day 1 visit. Data analysis was completed using Kaplan-Meier estimate for cumulative proportion. The data evaluated until the safety emergent period, which was defined as the evaluation period from analysis date of first drug intake up to 28 days after the analysis last dose, and results were presented for every 6 months up to 2 years.</description>
