  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most leading academic centers including Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) perform deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation surgery in the awake patient using microelectrode recording to guide final&#xD;
      electrode placement. Microelectrode recording is a means of analyzing the electrical activity&#xD;
      of the brain, and assessing whether we have found the target for the deep brain stimulator&#xD;
      electrode. However, no evidence exists that microelectrode recording improves patient&#xD;
      outcomes. The use of microelectrode recording does extend the duration of surgery and there&#xD;
      is evidence to suggest that microelectrode recording may increase the risk of bleeding in the&#xD;
      brain during surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients who have been randomized into Group 1 will undergo DBS implantation while awake. On&#xD;
      the morning of surgery, the patient will undergo placement of the stereotactic head frame&#xD;
      under local anesthesia. A CT scan will be performed for stereotactic planning, which will be&#xD;
      fused to a preoperatively obtained MRI. The coordinates for the planned target will be&#xD;
      selected using standard coordinates based on known relationships with the anterior commissure&#xD;
      - posterior commissure plane, along with anatomical structures visualized on the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be performed with the patient awake. Two simultaneous microelectrode tracks&#xD;
      will be used for each DBS electrode to be implanted. If neither electrophysiological&#xD;
      recording is adequate, additional MER tracks may be performed. Macro-stimulation will also be&#xD;
      used to evaluate for clinical efficacy and stimulation induced side effects. The DBS&#xD;
      electrode will be placed into the track with the optimal electrophysiological and clinical&#xD;
      findings. The identical procedure will be followed for the contralateral side. A&#xD;
      post-operative stereotactic CT scan will be performed to assess lead location and evaluate&#xD;
      for intracranial bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been randomized into Group 2 will undergo DBS implantation under general&#xD;
      anesthesia in an operating room equipped with an intraoperative MRI. Once under anesthesia&#xD;
      the patient will be placed into a rigid head holder, and an MRI scan will be obtained to&#xD;
      register the navigation system. The location for the holes in the skull will be identified,&#xD;
      and the surgery will be commenced. Once the holes have been made in the skull and the dura&#xD;
      has been opened, a second MRI scan will be obtained to identify the target. A ceramic stylet&#xD;
      will then be stereotactically introduced to the target, and a third MRI sequence will be&#xD;
      performed to verify the stylet is indeed at the desired target. The DBS electrode will then&#xD;
      be implanted after removing the stylet. A post-operative stereotactic CT scan will be&#xD;
      performed to assess lead location and evaluate for intracranial bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither of the surgical groups will undergo investigational procedures. Both surgical&#xD;
      techniques utilize FDA approved devices, used in the manner for which FDA approval was given.&#xD;
      They represent two different, but both accepted, means for implanting deep brain stimulator&#xD;
      electrodes.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study is the percentage improvement in the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III motor score from baseline to 6 months in patients who receiving stimulation in the &quot;OFF&quot; medication state. Secondary outcome measures include rate of radiographically visible intracranial hemorrhage and changes in neurocognitive function and quality of life testing. The student's two sample t-test will be used to perform the statistically comparisons.</description>

&#xD;
               3. Persistent motor symptoms which are not effectively controlled with optimal&#xD;
