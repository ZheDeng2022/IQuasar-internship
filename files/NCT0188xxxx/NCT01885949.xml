    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether they work in treating a specific&#xD;
      cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is still being studied and that&#xD;
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it, such as the safest dose to use and the&#xD;
      side effects they may cause. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two drugs being tested in this study are tivozanib and enzalutamide. Enzalutamide has&#xD;
      been approved by the FDA for treatment of prostate cancer. On the other hand, tivozanib is&#xD;
      still investigational, and has not been tested in a combination with enzalutamide before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist (it blocks the activity of the male sex&#xD;
      hormones). Prostate cancers are initially dependent on the male hormone testosterone for&#xD;
      growth. Hormonal therapies that lower testosterone or block the ability of testosterone to&#xD;
      act at the level of the prostate cancer are currently among the most effective treatments for&#xD;
      prostate cancers taht have spread to other body organs (metastasized). The effectiveness of&#xD;
      hormonal treatments, however, is not permanent, and over time many prostate cancers progress&#xD;
      in spite of these treatments. Enzalutamide is a drug that has been proven to help delay the&#xD;
      progression of advanced prostate cancer on average for about 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tivozanib is an anti-angiogenesis medicine that fights different types of cancer by blocking&#xD;
      the blood supply to the tumor, so that the tumor does not receive the nutrients it needs to&#xD;
      grow. The main goal of this study is to determine whether the combination of tivozanib and&#xD;
      enzalutamide is more effective in delaying the progression of disease than when enzalutamide&#xD;
      is given alone. This study will also determine whether treatment with the combination of the&#xD;
      tivozanib and enzalutamide will have more side effects then treatment with enzalutamide&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated in treatment cycles of 28 days (4 weeks), during which time they&#xD;
      will take tivozanib once a day for 21 days (3 weeks) followed by a one week break from&#xD;
      treatment. The other medication, enzalutamide, will be taken every day throughout each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given a Study Drug Administration Diary to keep a brief record of medication&#xD;
      administration, and to record any side effects or symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen in the clinic at the beginning of each cycle (every 4 weeks). During&#xD;
      each visit they will have the following procedures: medical history, vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      complete physical examination, performance status, routine blood tests, urine sample,&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, assessment of tumor, review of study drug&#xD;
      administration diary, and review of current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About four weeks after stopping the study drug patients will be asked to return to the&#xD;
      research clinic for a final study visit. The following procedures will be done: medical&#xD;
      history, vital sign measurements, brief physical examination, electrocardiogram, review of&#xD;
      other medications used since the last visit, routine blood tests, urine sample and a review&#xD;
      of any changes in health.&#xD;
