  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of two anti-inflammatory drugs, fish oil&#xD;
      capsules and the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, on pregnancy associated breast cancer (PABC).&#xD;
      Short-term intervention with anti-inflammatory medications will demonstrate a reduction in&#xD;
      the inflammation and immune suppressive phenotype of PABC, and decreased metastatic potential&#xD;
      in PABC. This unique window in breast cancer management serves as a valuable opportunity to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary data on biomarkers and the alterations that occur when the system is&#xD;
      troubled by a drug or other intervention which will be instrumental in designing future&#xD;
      therapeutic or preventative strategies for larger clinical study.&#xD;

      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies omega-3 fatty acid or celecoxib in treating&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer planning to undergo surgery. Omega-3 fatty acid may stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Celecoxib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether omega-3 fatty acid or celecoxib is more effective in treating breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Tumor cells are stained using the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody. Ki-67 is measured as a percentage of positive tumor cells. The investigator will conduct three paired t-tests comparing the percent Ki-67 at baseline to the percent Ki-67 after treatment. There will be one t-test for each arm.</description>
