    <textblock>
      A series of case-studies to explore the efficacy of classification based cognitive functional&#xD;
      physiotherapy according to the classification system proposed by Peter O'Sullivan in specific&#xD;
      nursing population with non specific chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis was that treatment targeting the mechanisms behind the problem&#xD;
      from a multidimensional perspective would be effective to reduce pain, disability and&#xD;
      sick-leave.&#xD;

      Low back pain (LBP) is a common, recalcitrant and costly health problem, which limits&#xD;
      patients' daily activities. In 85% of the cases, LBP is classified as 'non-specific', which&#xD;
      means there is no clear underlying patho-anatomical/radiological abnormality. This subgroup&#xD;
      often gives rise to a chronic fluctuating problem. Although most cases of LBP resolve within&#xD;
      8 to 12 weeks, it may become chronic in up to 15% of patients. LBP constitutes an enormous&#xD;
      and growing medical and socio-economical problem for the modern society. Nursing has been&#xD;
      identified amongst the top professions at risk for occupational LBP, with lifetime prevalence&#xD;
      between 66%-82%. The impact of LBP for nurses includes time off work, increased risk of&#xD;
      chronicity, associated personal and economic costs and reduced nursing workforce efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non Specific Chronic Low Back Pain (NSCLBP) is widely viewed as a multifactorial&#xD;
      biopsychosocial pain syndrome. It has been proposed by several authors that NSCLBP represents&#xD;
      a vicious cycle associated with different combinations of maladaptive; cognitive (negative&#xD;
      beliefs, fear avoidance behaviours, catastrophising, depression, stress, lack of pacing and&#xD;
      coping), physical (pain provocative postures, movement patterns and pain behaviours) and&#xD;
      lifestyle (inactivity, rest) behaviours that act to promote pain and disability. However a&#xD;
      recent systematic review suggests that this change in paradigm and the investigators new&#xD;
      understanding of NSCLBP has not resulted in clinical trials utilizing multidimensional&#xD;
      classification systems or targeted interventions based on the underlying mechanisms. In line&#xD;
      with this paradigm shift a novel multidimensional classification system has been developed&#xD;
      incorporating the biopsychosocial model, which subgroups patients based on their underlying&#xD;
      pain mechanism. Enabling a classification based interventions targetting the maladaptive&#xD;
      cognitive, physical and lifestyle behaviours associated with the disorder.&#xD;

    <description>A novel multidimensional classification system has been developed incorporating the biopsychosocial model, which subgroups patients based on their presentation. This subclassification is the base for matched interventions directed at the maladaptive cognitive, physical and lifestyle behaviours associated with the disorder. The intervention is called 'cognitive functional therapy' as it directly challenges these behaviours in a functionally specific and graduated manner.</description>
