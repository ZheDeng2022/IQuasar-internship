      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration: 36 months Enrollment: 20 months Treatment: 5 months per patient Follow-up&#xD;
      every three months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the tumor antigen-specific immune response induced by the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to prospectively determine the predictive/prognostic value of pretreatment biological&#xD;
           features in identifying patients who will benefit from HDIL-2-based therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Response Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall Survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini-max two-stage Simon design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Step 1: 7 patients enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      If tumor antigen-specific immune response is observed in at least 3 patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Step 2: recruitment of an additional 12 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen and duration of administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three daily doses boost radiotherapy (XRT) at 6-12 Gy to at least 1, and up to a maximum of&#xD;
      5, metastatic fields, will be administrated on days -4 -3 -2 or -3 -2 -1 before the first and&#xD;
      the third cycle of IL-2. The first day of administration of IL-2 of each cycle is the day +1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with IL-2 (dose 18 MIU/m2/day in 500cc by continuous IV infusion for 72 hours) will&#xD;
      start on day +1 and will be administered every 3 weeks up to 4 cycles, than every 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      for a further 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 will be withheld for refractory hypotension (hypotension where isotropic or vasoactive&#xD;
      therapy is ineffective and that persists despite specific medical therapy set), anuria for &gt;&#xD;
      24 hours, respiratory distress, confusion, sustained ventricular tachycardia, signs of&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia or myocarditis, persistant metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation and&#xD;
      documented systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated every 8 weeks with computed tomography to determine the response,&#xD;
      and every 3 months after completion of treatment until death (the time of disease progression&#xD;
      and the initiation of alternative therapies will also be documented).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimax two-stage Simon design will be employed. A 40% immune response will preclude&#xD;
      further study, whereas a 70% response rate will indicate that further study would be&#xD;
      warranted. Using alfa and beta errors of 0.10, 7 patients will be enrolled during the first&#xD;
      stage, and if an immune response is observed in at least 3 patients the study will go on, and&#xD;
      an additional 12 patients will be treated. The treatments will be considered active if a&#xD;
      tumor antigen-specific immune response is observed in 11 out of 19 patients treated. The&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on an intention to treat population, i.e. all patients having&#xD;
      received at least one cycle of therapy.&#xD;
