      Hypothesis: Statin therapy will decrease inflammation and slow progression of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      abnormalities in HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important&#xD;
      cause of respiratory impairment in HIV+ persons and will likely increase as the HIV+&#xD;
      population continues to age. In the HIV-uninfected population, COPD frequently co-exists with&#xD;
      cardiac disease including atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The investigators&#xD;
      work has demonstrated that a syndrome of &quot;cardiopulmonary dysfunction&quot; exists even in&#xD;
      non-smoking or antiretroviral-treated HIV+ individuals. The investigators have found that&#xD;
      HIV+ individuals have a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, airflow obstruction, and&#xD;
      diffusing capacity (DLco) abnormalities that occur concurrently with cardiac co-morbidities,&#xD;
      including radiographic measures of atherosclerosis and elevated echocardiographic pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressures. This syndrome is marked by inflammation with elevated levels of cytokines&#xD;
      and hsCRP, peripheral T-cell activation, and increased sputum neutrophils as well as&#xD;
      elevation of NT-proBNP, a marker of heart strain. Importantly, the investigators have shown&#xD;
      that DLco impairment and elevated NT-proBNP are significant independent predictors of&#xD;
      mortality in HIV, indicating that cardiopulmonary dysfunction is likely highly clinically&#xD;
      relevant and identifies a vulnerable population in whom the investigators lack effective&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins have anti-inflammatory effects in the lung and vasculature that might benefit&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary dysfunction in HIV. These agents have a long history of clinical use in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and are currently being investigated as disease-modifying drugs for&#xD;
      HIV, COPD, and PH. In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that HIV+&#xD;
      individuals who received statin therapy within the past year were significantly less likely&#xD;
      to have impaired DLco and had lower pulmonary artery pressures, lower NT-proBNP, lower&#xD;
      peripheral cytokines, and fewer sputum neutrophils despite being older and having a greater&#xD;
      smoking history than those not using statins.&#xD;
