    <textblock>
      Glycemic control is fundamental in the management of diabetes mellitus .If lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention and full tolerated doses of one or two oral glucose lowering drugs (OGLDs) fail&#xD;
      to achieve or sustain glycemic goals, insulin should be initiated. New insulin analogs are&#xD;
      generated to improve glycemic control .New insulin analogs are generated to improve glycemic&#xD;
      control,However, the cost of these analogs is a major problem .The aim of this piggy back&#xD;
      evaluation was to assess the effect of BIAsp 30 versus NPH plus regular human insulin on&#xD;
      metabolic control as well as its cost-effectiveness in people with type 2 diabetes in the&#xD;
      Iranian setting.&#xD;

      Study design and participants This was a randomized controlled clinical trial of 48 weeks on&#xD;
      subjects with T2DM between July 2011 and October 2012. Two hundred and four diabetic subjects&#xD;
      aged 28-65 years were included in the study. Subjects had A1C &gt;8.0% and had indication for&#xD;
      starting insulin. They were randomly allocated to two groups using a simple randomization&#xD;
      method. Any current and prior medications were acceptable for inclusion of participant except&#xD;
      any type of insulin being evaluated. Demographic and anthropometric variables were recorded.&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia events and laboratory data including FPG, HbA1c and lipid profiles were measured&#xD;
      every three months. In addition, quality of life was assessed with self-administered standard&#xD;
      EQ-5D questionnaire (Brooks, Rabin et al. 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were excluded for any of the following criteria: Alteration in insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      such as major surgery, infection, renal failure (Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 50),&#xD;
      glucocorticoid treatment, recent (within 2 weeks) serious hypoglycemic episode (requires&#xD;
      assistance of another), simultaneous participating in another clinical study, using any type&#xD;
      of insulin, sight or hearing impaired, active proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy&#xD;
      require treatment within 6 months prior to screening, breast feeding, pregnancy or nursing of&#xD;
      the intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and was&#xD;
      recorded in IRCT (IRCT code: 201112038282N1). All eligible subjects agreed and signed written&#xD;
      informed consent after full explanation of the purpose and nature of all procedures used. All&#xD;
      patients were free to withdraw at will at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and outcome measures The insulin therapies were prescribed by a single physician&#xD;
      in the clinic. The starting dose of BIAsp 30 (NovoMix® 30-pen, NovoNordisk) was 0.2-0.6&#xD;
      unit/kg per day in 2 divided doses according to level of glycemia in the intervention group.&#xD;
      The control group received NPH/Reg insulin (from Exir pharmaceuticals, Lorestan, Iran) in a&#xD;
      Ratio of 2:1 with initiation dose of 0.2-0.6 unit/kg in 2 divided doses. Two-thirds of the&#xD;
      dose was given before breakfast and the remainder before dinner in NPH/Reg insulin group.&#xD;
      Changes to oral glucose lowering drugs (OGLDs) at the time of starting the insulin analog, or&#xD;
      thereafter, were entirely at the discretion of the participant and physician. Para clinical&#xD;
      data were measured in a referral laboratory every three months. After an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 12 hours, blood samples were obtained for measurement of fasting blood sugar (FBS)&#xD;
      using a the glucose oxidase method, lipid profileswere determined using enzymatic methods.&#xD;
      These measurements were conducted using commercial Parsazmun kits (Tehran, Iran) and a&#xD;
      Hitachi 704 automatic analyzer (Tokyo, Japan)(Lentjes, Harff et al. 1987). HbA1c was measured&#xD;
      using the high performance liquid chromatography method(Esteghamati, Jamali et al. 2010).&#xD;
      Post prandial blood glucose (PPG) was measured two hours after breakfast using a glucose&#xD;
      analyzer (YSI 2700 Select, YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial visits were defined as 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks from baseline. All participants were&#xD;
      asked to record their 7-point blood glucose values in three consecutive days before each&#xD;
      visit. Seven-point self-monitoring blood glucose includes three pre-meals, three post-meals,&#xD;
      and bedtime blood glucose values during each day. Insulin doses were adjusted by a titration&#xD;
      regimen according to self-monitored blood glucose. For both groups, treatment goals were as&#xD;
      follows: fasting blood glucose of 80-120 mg/dl, postprandial glucose &lt;160 mg/dl, A1C&lt;7% and&#xD;
      the before dinner blood glucose target for the NPH/Reg insulin group was 100 mg/dl, with a&#xD;
      stepwise increase of both type of insulin depending on the pre-meal blood glucose values to&#xD;
      achieve targets for plasma glucose (PG)as follows: +2 IU/day where 126 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 140&#xD;
      mg/dl, +4 IU/day where 140 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 160 mg/dl, +6 IU/day where 160 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 180&#xD;
      mg/dl, +8 IU/day where 180 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 200 mg/dl and +10 IU/day where PG &gt; 200&#xD;
      mg/dl(Hermansen, Davies et al. 2006; Liebl, Prager et al. 2009), unless symptoms of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia occurred. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose &lt;70 mg/dl. Severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia where the&#xD;
      individual required the assistance of another person and was not treated with oral&#xD;
      carbohydrate due to confusion or unconsciousness and was associated with a blood glucose&#xD;
      level &lt;40 mg/dl with recovery with intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Nocturnal&#xD;
      hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia occurred at night and which commonly known as&#xD;
      hypoglycemia while asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected from the physician's clinical notes and participants' recall and&#xD;
      self-monitoring blood glucose values at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct medical costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We collected medical costs of each patient by a checklist. All patients had been asked to&#xD;
      refer to the clinic every one month during the study. Clinical events or hospital episodes&#xD;
      and also all related costs were determined at each visit. Any pharmaceutical,&#xD;
      laboratory/diagnostic and rehabilitative care, as well as any contact with specialists,&#xD;
      general practitioners, nurses, opticians, and dieticians were recorded for patients&#xD;
      with/without complication. Finally total costs were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct nonmedical costs Any services such as transportation for patients and their family to&#xD;
      clinic and taking care of dependents were assessed for non-medical expenditures by a patient&#xD;
      self-estimate questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect costs The lost productivity costs due to health problems of DM were determined by&#xD;
      days absent from work, poor work performance, low earnings capacity from disabilities, and&#xD;
      mortality. We calculated number of days in each visit that the patient could not be present&#xD;
      in their job because of DM related health care. The average net hourly wage was asked from&#xD;
      each patient. For unemployed patients, we considered average wage of population who were&#xD;
      economically active and in employment (Javanbakht, Baradaran et al. 2011). Lost earnings&#xD;
      owing to premature mortality were defined as the mortality costs. Costs from the health&#xD;
      provider perspective, were converted from Iranian Rials (IRR) into USA dollar (USD) at an&#xD;
      official exchange rate of 12,260 IRR/1USD 2012 to have an international comparison (Central&#xD;
      Bank of Iran).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utility calculation Utility scores were calculated with two recent well known&#xD;
      measurements;EQ-5D and EQ-VAS between 0-1.These are two standardized measures of health&#xD;
      status and quality adjusted life year (QALY), developed by the EuroQol group in order to&#xD;
      provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost Effectiveness Analysis Hypoglycemic events and QALYs were considered as outcomes and the&#xD;
      incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per patient was calculated according to the below&#xD;
      formula: ICER= ∆Cost/ ∆Outcome (Rasccati Karen L. 2009).The comparison of ICERs was held&#xD;
      afterwards per each outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Significant differences in&#xD;
      general characteristics were determined by Chi-square and Student's t-test. Change from&#xD;
      baseline HbA1c, FBS, PPBG, and blood lipids was analyzed using an analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) model with baseline characteristics as variates. SPSS for Windows (Version 14; SPSS&#xD;
      Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for data analyses and P values &lt; 0.05 were considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
