  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current research is to improve treatment for injection opioid users by&#xD;
      augmenting pharmacotherapy with an innovative text-messaging strategy to promote relapse&#xD;
      prevention skills, reduce HIV-risk behaviors, and improve HIV treatment regimen adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the specific aims of this research are 1) To develop and refine, with user feedback, a&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy-based text-messaging intervention (TXT-CBT) for HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults with opioid dependence; 2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining individuals for a large scale study and to determine&#xD;
      the effect size of TXT-CBT over and above standard care (SC) on opioid use, HIV medication&#xD;
      adherence, and healthcare outcomes. Both SC and SC+TXT-CBT participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, treatment-end, and 12 weeks post-treatment; and 3) To examine potential mechanisms&#xD;
      of action of TXT-CBT, including self-efficacy, affect regulation, and social support. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that TXT-CBT delivered in conjunction with SC will produce greater&#xD;
      reductions in opioid use and HIV-risk behaviors, and will improve HIV treatment regimen&#xD;
      adherence, relative to MM alone. Further, the investigators expect that SC+TXT-CBT will&#xD;
      facilitate greater changes in negative affect, self-efficacy, and social support, and these&#xD;
      changes will be associated with substance use outcomes. TXT-CBT incorporates specific&#xD;
      substance- and adherence-focused cognitive therapy techniques with a concurrent emphasis on&#xD;
      reducing HIV-risk behaviors. By providing support to maximize HIV treatment regimen&#xD;
      adherence, coupled with coping skills to address withdrawal symptoms and stress, two&#xD;
      important factors in opioid relapse, TXT-CBT may provide a promising, cost-effective, and&#xD;
      easily deployable augmenting strategy for the treatment of opioid users who are HIV-infected.&#xD;

    <description>Addiction Severity Index (ASI) is an instrument widely used in addiction research to quantify drug use frequency and related problem areas.&#xD;
Urine Drug Screen (UDS). Urine drug screens will be collected monthly using temperature controlled test cups. An FDA-approved one-step test will be used. During the 12-week treatment period, one full-screen panel and two panels only testing for opioids (heroin and prescription opioids) will be conducted. The UDS will test for the presence of: amphetamines, benzodiazepines, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine, morphine (heroin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (OxyContin), and marijuana. The participants' change in substance use over time (as assessed by the ASI and UDS results) is being assessed from each timepoint to the next.</description>

    <description>Risk Behavior Survey (RBS): The RBS (Darke et al., 1991) is a brief interview assessing involvement in HIV risk behaviors in the areas of drug use and sex in the previous 30 days. Additional items include whether the sexual partner uses or injects drugs. The participants' change in RBS scores is being assessed from each timepoint to the next.</description>

    <time_frame>Pill bottle collection will be weekly during the intervention. Pill counts and Viral load will be collected at baseline (week 0), treatment end (week 12), and FU (week 24).</time_frame>
    <description>â€¢ ART Adherence. The investigator will use monthly phone-based unannounced pill counts (UPCs); Pharmacy information from pill bottles will also be collected to verify the number of pills dispensed between calls. Self-reported adherence will be assessed monthly using a brief adherence survey developed by Lu et al. Viral load will serve as a biological indicator of adherence. Consistent with the typical frequency with which viral load is assessed in clinical settings, data concerning viral load will be collected at baseline (week 0), treatment end (week 12), and FU (week 24) via chart review from the participant's medical provider. The participants' change in Adherence scores is being assessed from each timepoint to the next.</description>

    <description>This condition will receive CBT based text messaging (TXT-CBT). Those assigned to TXT-CBT will also be given a treatment manual (developed in Phase I) containing descriptions of core therapeutic content/topics for each week. HIV-infected participants will have an initial meeting with a CBT clinician to review the Life-Steps concepts. The 3 most applicable medication adherence skills will be identified for emphasis in tailored messages. A research coordinator will meet with the participants weekly at data collection visits throughout the intervention phase to answer any technical questions and ensure that the intervention program is working properly.</description>
