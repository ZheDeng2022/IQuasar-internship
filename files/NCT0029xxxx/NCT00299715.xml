  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 3 different doses of&#xD;
      paliperidone extended release (ER) compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with Bipolar I&#xD;
      Disorder who are experiencing an acute manic or mixed episode. This study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of paliperidone extended release on global functioning, and the relationship&#xD;
      between blood levels and the effectiveness and safety of paliperidone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several treatments are available for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes&#xD;
      associated with bipolar disorder. Some of these treatments although used for many years, are&#xD;
      associated with well-known problems such as poor tolerability, significant toxicities, narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic ranges, and drug interactions. Often, several drugs must be used in combination&#xD;
      to achieve the best clinical effect. More recently, a group of compounds known as atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics, such as risperidone, have been licensed for use in this indication. Based on&#xD;
      the pharmacological profile of Paliperidone, it is expected to be effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Paliperidone extended&#xD;
      release has been shown to be effective in schizophrenia and it has an improved drug delivery&#xD;
      system with a reduced potential for drug interactions. Study drug tablets are designed to&#xD;
      deliver the appropriate amount of drug (3 mg or 6 mg) using a &quot;Push-Pull&quot; delivery system&#xD;
      based on a patented oral osmotic pump technology (OROS) that allows the drug to be delivered&#xD;
      at a relatively controlled rate for 24 hours. This study will test 3 different doses of&#xD;
      paliperidone extended release (3, 6, or 12 mg/day once daily) compared to placebo (inactive&#xD;
      substance). There are 3 parts to the study: a screening and washout phase that lasts up to 7&#xD;
      days to determine if patients are eligible for the study and to discontinue all current&#xD;
      medications, a double-blind treatment phase that lasts for 3 weeks, and a follow-up phase&#xD;
      that lasts about 1 week after the end-of-study visit or early withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
      During the double-blind treatment phase, patients are randomly assigned to receive treatment&#xD;
      either with placebo or 1 of 3 daily doses of paliperidone extended release. Patients assigned&#xD;
      to paliperidone extended release will receive either 3, 6, or 12 mg/day given once daily for&#xD;
      a 3-week period. All patients whether receiving paliperidone extended release or placebo will&#xD;
      take 2 capsules each time the study drug is given. Patients will be hospitalized for at least&#xD;
      the first 7 days of double-blind treatment, and may be discharged on the seventh day and&#xD;
      followed as outpatients based on the judgment of the study doctor. End-of-study/early&#xD;
      withdrawal procedures will be done after the last dose of study drug has been received and&#xD;
      blood samples have been taken, or at early withdrawal from the study. Patients will have a&#xD;
      follow-up visit with safety evaluations approximately 1 week later. The study, including the&#xD;
      screening and washout phases, will last approximately 35 days or 5 weeks. Effectiveness will&#xD;
      be primarily determined by the change in the total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score from&#xD;
      the beginning (baseline) to the end of the double-blind treatment phase of the study. The&#xD;
      Young Mania Rating Scale is an 11-item established measure used to evaluate manic symptoms. A&#xD;
      secondary measure of effectiveness is the change in the Global Assessment of Functioning&#xD;
      Scale (GAF) from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment phase of the study. Other&#xD;
      measures of effectiveness include the time to onset of therapeutic effect, responder rate&#xD;
      (defined as 50% or more reduction from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale score), and&#xD;
      changes from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatments phase in all other assessment&#xD;
      scales. Additional assessment scales will be used to evaluate the clinical progress of the&#xD;
      patient, psychotic and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder, quality of sleep and daytime&#xD;
      drowsiness, health-related function, and rate the severity of the patient's bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by the frequency, severity, and timing of side effects, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (including pregnancy tests), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs&#xD;
      measurements, and physical and neurological examinations. The study hypotheses for the&#xD;
      primary and secondary effectiveness measures are 1) that at least 1 dose of paliperidone&#xD;
      extended release is better than placebo on the change from baseline in the Young Mania Rating&#xD;
      Scale total score at the end of 3 weeks of treatment, and 2) at least 1 dose of paliperidone&#xD;
      extended release is better than placebo on the change from baseline in Global Assessment of&#xD;
      Functional Scale score at the end of 3 weeks of treatment. The potential effect of the&#xD;
      variation in genes related to paliperidone ER may be evaluated separately in patients who&#xD;
      consent to DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing. Paliperidone ER, 3, 6, or 12 mg/day or&#xD;
      placebo once daily for 3 weeks. To maintain the blind, all patients will take 2 capsules each&#xD;
      time study drug is given. Capsules may contain a 3-mg tablet and matching placebo, a 6-mg&#xD;
      tablet and matching placebo, two 6-mg tablets, or placebo (inactive) tablets. The doses of&#xD;
      study drug will be fixed throughout the study.&#xD;
