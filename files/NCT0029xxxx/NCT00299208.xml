    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a safe, well tolerated, and highly efficacious&#xD;
      azithromycin combination treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Azithromycin is a&#xD;
      drug that has shown potential for malaria treatment. It will be combined with other malaria&#xD;
      drugs currently approved for treatment in Thailand. About 120 people, ages 20-65, will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Thailand. Participants will have severe cases of malaria and they will be&#xD;
      hospitalized 28 days for treatment.&#xD;

      The study is aimed at identifying a well tolerated, practical and highly efficacious&#xD;
      treatment regimen of azithromycin in combination with artesunate or quinine for uncomplicated&#xD;
      falciparum malaria for future studies, to monitor for the tolerability and safety of these&#xD;
      combination regimens and to compare tolerability, safety and efficacy of azithromycin when&#xD;
      given in combination with artesunate as compared to quinine. This study is also aimed at&#xD;
      comparing tolerability, safety and efficacy of the combination of artesunate and azithromycin&#xD;
      when given as a single daily dose (200mg As+1000mg Az) for 3 days as compared to 2 doses of&#xD;
      100mg As+750mg Az per day for 3 days and to compare the tolerability, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination of quinine and azithromycin when given as 3 daily doses of quinine (10mg/kg)&#xD;
      + Az 500mg vs. 2 daily doses of quinine (10mg/kg) + Az 750mg when given for 3 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Acute symptomatic falciparum malaria infection as determined by malaria smear with a&#xD;
             parasite density of 100 to 100,000 asexual parasites/µL with fever, defined as&#xD;
             &gt;37.5ºC, during the current illness, or history (within the last 48 hours) of fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age: 20-65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female. All females are required to have a negative human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropic (hCG) pregnancy test (urine). All females of childbearing potential (not&#xD;
             surgically sterile, or less than two years post menopausal) are required to use an&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception, such as implant, injectable, oral contraceptive(s)&#xD;
             with additional barrier contraception, intrauterine device, sexual abstinence, or&#xD;
             vasectomized partner, throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to stay hospitalized for 28 days for treatment and observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Otherwise healthy outpatients (with no other clinically-significant illnesses as&#xD;
             described in Exclusion Criteria, #6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential who do not use an&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception (as described in Inclusion Criteria, #3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Mixed malaria infection on admission by malaria smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A previous state of intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study drugs quinine,&#xD;
             artesunate, or azithromycin or to drugs with similar chemical structures (quinidine,&#xD;
             any artemisinin derivative, and macrolides such as erythromycin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Malaria drug therapy administered in the past 30 days by history (quinine,&#xD;
             chloroquine, mefloquine, artemisinin derivatives, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine,&#xD;
             lumefantrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous participation in this trial, or participation in any other studies involving&#xD;
             investigational or marketed products, concomitantly or within 30 days prior to entry&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant illness (intercurrent illness e.g. pneumonia, pre-existing&#xD;
             condition e..g. malignancy or conditions that may effect absorption of study&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Laboratory evidence or history of significant cardiovascular, liver or renal&#xD;
             functional abnormality, which in the opinion of the investigator would place them at&#xD;

             values:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. AST, ALT &gt; 3x ULN (120 U/L), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Prolonged QT wave on baseline electrocardiogram (QT &gt;0.45s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Symptoms of severe vomiting (no food or inability to take food during the previous 8&#xD;
             hours).&#xD;

             the study protocol.&#xD;
