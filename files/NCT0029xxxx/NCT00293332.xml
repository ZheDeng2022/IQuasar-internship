      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving docetaxel and carboplatin&#xD;
      together with bevacizumab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of&#xD;
      normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel and carboplatin together&#xD;
      with bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer that can be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the median and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to treatment failure of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pathologic response rate and the resectability rate in patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels or expression with response&#xD;
           and survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15-60 minutes, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes,&#xD;
      and bevacizumab* IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 4-6&#xD;
      weeks after completion of chemotherapy, eligible patients with no distant or mediastinal&#xD;
      disease progression undergo lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or segmentectomy with standard radical&#xD;
      mediastinal lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Bevacizumab is only administered during courses 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
