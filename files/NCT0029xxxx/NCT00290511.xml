    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if chemotherapy given with rituximab,&#xD;
      followed by Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), and then followed by rituximab can help to&#xD;
      control lymphoma. The safety of this treatment schedule will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether the time to progression for these high-risk patients can be prolonged&#xD;
           to a median of 36 months, compared to the historical expectation of approximately 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the tolerance and efficacy of Y2B8 (Zevalin) after R-FND (rituximab,&#xD;
           fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone) in patients with high-risk stage III-IV&#xD;
           follicular lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess overall response, failure-free survival, and survival of this strategy&#xD;
           compared to our historical experience with FND (fludarabine, mitoxantrone,&#xD;
           dexamethasone) alone or R-FND&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the tolerance and efficacy of maintenance therapy with rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To maximize the 12-month molecular remission rate for patients with high-risk stage&#xD;
           III-IV follicular lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to correlate the results of quantitative PCR assay with classical PCR and with clinical&#xD;
           outcome&#xD;

      The treatments used in this program include several standard chemotherapy agents&#xD;
      (fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone). Also, immune therapy agents will be given,&#xD;
      including rituximab (a monoclonal antibody that attacks B-cells, which is what this type of&#xD;
      lymphoma is made of), and Ibritumomab tiuxetan (another similar monoclonal antibody, which&#xD;
      delivers radiation to the lymphoma cells to strengthen the attack).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive rituximab on Days 1 and 8 of the first cycle, and on Day 1 only of Cycles&#xD;
      2-4 of the monthly cycles of chemotherapy, called R-FND. R-FND includes rituximab and&#xD;
      fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone. Fludarabine will be given for 3 days,&#xD;
      mitoxantrone for 1 day, and dexamethasone for 5 days of each 28-day cycle (FND). After 4&#xD;
      cycles of R-FND, you will receive Ibritumomab tiuxetan. After the Ibritumomab tiuxetan, you&#xD;
      will receive rituximab every 2 months for 1 year. All are given by vein. Sometimes&#xD;
      dexamethasone can be given in pill form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, you will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons), sometimes every week.&#xD;
      Every 2 cycles, you will have a chest x-ray and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. Bone&#xD;
      marrow samples will be taken. Heart function tests will be done as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you desire, it may be possible for you to receive some of your study treatment at home&#xD;
      (from your home doctor). Your study doctor will discuss this possibility with you. If this is&#xD;
      the case, your home doctor will receive a letter telling him about this study and asking him&#xD;
      if he wishes to participate in your treatments. He will be asked to provide the study doctors&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson specific information about your treatments and any side effects you may&#xD;
      have. All communications between your home doctor and your study doctors will be included as&#xD;
      part of your M. D. Anderson medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study ends, you will return for checkups every 3 months in the first year, every 4&#xD;
      months in Years 2 and 3, and every 6 months in Years 4 and 5. After that, checkups will be&#xD;
      needed once a year. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and bone marrow samples will be taken at&#xD;
      these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab are approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for commercial use. The other drugs used in the study are also approved for commercial use by&#xD;
      the FDA. About 50 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with high-risk Ann Arbor stage III-IV follicular lymphoma. High-risk is&#xD;
             defined by advanced stage (III or IV), plus any 2 of the following features: age 60 or&#xD;
             greater; elevated LDH; Hgb &lt; 12; or number of involved nodal sites 5 or more .&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients will be previously untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Follicular lymphoma, grade 3 (follicular large cell lymphoma): If eligible for a&#xD;
             current large cell lymphoma protocol, that alternative protocol is recommended,&#xD;
             particularly grade 3b or FLCL patients characterized as large non-cleaved cell.&#xD;
             However, both FND and rituximab have established efficacy in FLCL, so if a patient is&#xD;
             not eligible for a protocol for aggressive lymphoma (e.g., because of SCCL in the&#xD;
             marrow), then registration on this trial is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Biopsy or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) material is strongly recommended for bcl-2&#xD;
             studies to verify rearrangement status of all patients who are designated &quot;germline&quot;.&#xD;
             (see section 6.4). For other patients, tissue availability is desirable but not&#xD;
             mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a performance status of Zubrod 3 or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine &lt; 2mg%; bilirubin &lt;&#xD;
             2 mg%). Patients with renal or liver dysfunction due to organ infiltration by lymphoma&#xD;
             may be eligible after discussion with the study chairman.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients may not receive other concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or&#xD;
             immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are unable or unlikely to be able to adhere to the treatment plan or to&#xD;
             return to Houston for follow-up visits because of geographical, economic, emotional,&#xD;
             or social considerations are not eligible for this study. Note: some follow-up care&#xD;
             may be provided by outside physicians as long as the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)&#xD;
             protocol for outside physician participation is strictly adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with an absolute peripheral granulocyte count of &lt; 1,000 and platelet count &lt;&#xD;
             100,000 unless due to marrow infiltration or hypersplenism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with organ dysfunction, including bilirubin of &gt; 2 mg% or serum creatinine&#xD;
             level &gt; 2 mg%, unless the alteration is due to lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with HIV infection should not be registered on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with an antecedent malignancy whose prognosis is poor (&lt; 90% probability of&#xD;
             surviving for 5 yrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All patients should have a cardiac ejection fraction of 50% or more by&#xD;
             echocardiography or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who will not accept transfusions of blood products or supportive care&#xD;
             measures such as antibiotics are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients must not be pregnant or lactating, and men and women of reproductive&#xD;
             potential must follow accepted birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who have received prior murine antibody therapy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with evidence of active or prior infection of Hepatitis B are excluded.&#xD;
             (Note: Persons vaccinated for Hepatitis B who have + antibodies are not excluded).&#xD;
