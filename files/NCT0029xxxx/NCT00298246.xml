  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about autism and its subtypes. Autism is a&#xD;
      developmental disorder in which children have problems with communication and social skills&#xD;
      and display restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has several goals. One aim is to look at types of autism that are known, such as&#xD;
      the regressive subtype, (where skills are lost). We will explore whether there is a unique&#xD;
      change in immune functioning related to this subtype. Another aim is to serve as one of the&#xD;
      sites that will pilot a larger natural history study, entitled Autism Phenome Project. The&#xD;
      goal is to further understand autism by identifying other subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will look at several types of medical issues that may be related to autism, including&#xD;
      immunologic problems. Children will be followed over the course of several years. We aim to&#xD;
      capture medical problems that may be related to autism as they develop, and study outcomes in&#xD;
      areas such as behavior and language, in order to explore known and new subtypes of autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally developing children (aged 1) with autism (age 1, and developmental delays other than&#xD;
      autism (age 1), may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on each child's study group and age, participants may undergo the following tests&#xD;
      and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and developmental history, physical examination, psychological, cognitive and&#xD;
           medical tests to assess symptoms of autism or other developmental disorders, photographs&#xD;
           of the child's face, collection of hair, urine and baby teeth samples. If available,&#xD;
           hair samples from the baby's first haircut and from the biological mother's hair are&#xD;
           also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overnight electroencephalogram (EEG): A special cap with electrodes is placed on the&#xD;
           child's head to measure brain waves (brain electrical activity) while the child sleeps&#xD;
           in the hospital overnight. Healthy volunteers do not undergo this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: The child stays in the scanner, lying still for&#xD;
           10 to 15 minutes at a time. Since it may be difficult for the child to lie still, the&#xD;
           test may be scheduled for a time when the child is likely to be sleepy, or the child may&#xD;
           be sedated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (for children in the autism). This test and the MRI may be done under&#xD;
           sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits are scheduled at different intervals, depending on study group, age and&#xD;
      aspect of the study the child is enrolled in. The visits include a short interview session&#xD;
      with the child's caregiver and assessment of the child's development and behavior. Some of&#xD;
      the assessment measures used during the baseline examination are repeated, including symptoms&#xD;
      ratings, behavioral tests and a blood test. For some children, the final visit will include&#xD;
      repeats of the medical procedures.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current investigation focuses on finding meaningful subtypes of autism. Our objectives&#xD;
      include using comprehensive and longitudinal medical assessments and behavioral testing to&#xD;
      find subgroups of children with autism with profiles that comprise distinct&#xD;
      biological/behavioral phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific goals include determining if there is a unique alteration in immune function among&#xD;
      autistic children with a regressive clinical course, and identifying autism-specific sleep&#xD;
      and electroenchelalogram (EEG) abnormalities, and other potential biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are conducting a longitudinal natural history study of 140 children with autism, 12 to 84&#xD;
      months of age at study entry. We also are following as many as 75 typically developing&#xD;
      children, and 50 children with Developmental Delay to serve as age-/sex-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic prospective evaluations are being utilized to determine diagnostic and functional&#xD;
      outcomes, and evaluate behavioral, medical and immunologic functioning. These evaluations&#xD;
      include comprehensive medical history, behavioral assessment, physical and neurologic&#xD;
      examination, polysomnography (PSG) and EEG, and blood work for laboratory assays. Baseline&#xD;
      evaluations also included MRI and lumbar puncture (the latter was only subjects with autism).&#xD;
      In any investigation of behavioral outcomes and potential biomarkers, repeated assessments&#xD;
      are necessary to determine whether findings are due to state versus trait alterations. Thus,&#xD;
      key elements of the assessments are repeated every 6 to 12 months, depending on the child s&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of autism symptoms and severity, along with cognitive and adaptive behavior&#xD;
      profiles, will be used as behavioral outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of physical and neurological examinations, genetic testing, EEGs, polysomnograms, MRI&#xD;
      scans and laboratory assays of blood and CSF will be tested for their utility as biomarkers&#xD;
      of autism s core symptoms or identification of etiologically related subgroups of patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are 3 participant groups in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AUT: Children with autism (diagnosed with autistic disorder according to DSM-IV&#xD;
                  criteria). This group will include children that may be dichotomized as with&#xD;
                  regression and without regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  DD: Children with nonspectrum developmental delays&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  TYP: Children deemed to be typically developing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Accrual numbers are to include 140 children in the AUT group, 50 children in the&#xD;
                  DD group and 75 children in the TYP group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AUT: Children are included if they meet DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder, based&#xD;
             on ADI-R and ADOS and clinical judgment. Those meeting research criteria for autism&#xD;
             will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regression is defined as: Language loss: Loss of at least 3 spontaneously meaningful&#xD;
             words (excluding mama or dada) used for at least a month, and lost for at least a&#xD;
             month.AND/OR Nonverbal communication/social loss: Loss of more than one nonverbal&#xD;
             communicative behavior (e.g. gestures, joint attention, eye contact, imagination,&#xD;
             pretend play, sharing, showing, watching children, orienting to name, social smiling,&#xD;
             social games, spontaneous imitation of actions, response to social overtures).&#xD;
             Although there is overlap in the age period for regression specified in this protocol&#xD;
             (regression between 15-30 months) and that described for childhood disintegrative&#xD;
             disorder (CDD) (the DSM-IV criteria for indicate apparently normal development for the&#xD;
             first 2 years after birth ), the criteria for CDD also indicate a diagnosis can only&#xD;
             be made if symptoms are not better accounted for by another pervasive developmental&#xD;
             disorder such as autism. Symptoms of CDD that separate it from autism include loss of&#xD;
             acquired skills in areas such as motor skills and bowel or bladder control, while the&#xD;
             focus of the current study is on regression in core symptoms of autism (i.e.&#xD;
             socio-communicative skills). Thus, the currently protocol will include children with&#xD;
             regression over 2 who meet criteria for autism, but not those who only meet criteria&#xD;
             for CDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DD: Developmental scores (Performance Quotient and Verbal Quotient) greater than 1.5&#xD;
             standard deviations below mean on Mullen Scales of Early Learning&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TYP: No diagnosis of developmental delay, and no first-degree relatives with a history&#xD;
             of autism spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of cerebral palsy. For the typical controls only, a history of extremely low&#xD;
             birth weight (due to prematurity or intrauterine growth failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If behavioral management issues (e.g. self-injury, aggressiveness) are severe to the&#xD;
             extent that the screening protocol was aborted.&#xD;
