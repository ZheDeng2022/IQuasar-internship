  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), derived from healthy adult volunteer human donors, can&#xD;
      be obtained from bone marrow donation and cultured in the laboratory. MSCs have shown the&#xD;
      ability to find injured tissue, reduce and control inflammation, and assist in tissue repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prochymal™ MSCs will be infused into patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Infusions will occur on two separate days, 7-10 days apart. Patients will be monitored for&#xD;
      reduced Crohn's disease symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Reduction in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of at Least 100 Points</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI is a composite index of 8 disease variables (stool frequency, severity of abdominal pain, degree of general well-being, presence or absence of extra-intestinal manifestations or fistula, use or non-use of antidiarrheal agents, presence or absence of an abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight). Scores range from approximately 0 to 600, with a higher score indicating more disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement as Assessed by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The IBDQ measures disease-specific quality of life by assessing bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional function, and social function. Subscores can range from 1 (worst) to 7 (best). The total IBDQ is calculated as the sum of the responses to the individual IBDQ questions. The total score ranges from 32 to 224. An increase in score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
