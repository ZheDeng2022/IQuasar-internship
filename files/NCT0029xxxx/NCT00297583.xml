  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the effect of insulin glulisine, insulin&#xD;
      lispro and unmodified human insulin on endogenous glucose production during euglycemic&#xD;
      glucose clamps using stable labeled glucose in type 1 diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study were to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of insulin glulisine, insulin lispro and unmodified human insulin on plasma&#xD;
           nonesterified free fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of insulin glulisine, insulin lispro and unmodified human insulin on plasma&#xD;
           lactate levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the safety and tolerability of insulin glulisine in comparison to insulin lispro and&#xD;
           unmodified human insulin.&#xD;
