      Background: Studies have noted a correlation between food sensitivities and health disorders.&#xD;
      Various commonly seen health problems may be caused by cane sugar since it is lavishly and&#xD;
      frequently used by people worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of NAET testing instruments in detecting&#xD;
      hypersensitivities to cane sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Seventy-four subjects volunteered for this study. They were asked to&#xD;
      write down one of their major health problems, the amount of sugar consumed on a daily basis&#xD;
      and any known health problem(s) related to sugar consumption. The following testing&#xD;
      modalities were used in the study: (1). Allergy Symptom-Rating Scale (ASRS); (2). NST Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NSTRS); (3). Pulse Difference Rating Scale (PDRS). Test-1 was done twice. Tests 2 and&#xD;
      3 were done three times each: once without contacting sugar and then contacting sugar at one&#xD;
      minute and ten minutes.&#xD;

      NAET® testing devices are able to detect various levels of sensitivities to food substances&#xD;
      in people (JNECM Vol. 1, No.1 &amp; 2, 2005) before they manifest in symptoms. Using NAET testing&#xD;
      devices various levels of sensitivities to sugar can be easily detected and the people who&#xD;
      are found to be sensitive to sugar can be advised to take strict preventive measures thus&#xD;
      helping to alleviate their health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective of the Study The study will evaluate the efficacy of NAET® testing devices&#xD;
      in detecting sensitivity to cane sugar (intolerance, hypersensitivity, or allergy) in a group&#xD;
      of subjects from both sexes who had no prior knowledge of any health problems related to&#xD;
      sugar consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Characteristics Eighty subjects from a group of medical professionals of both sexes&#xD;
      who came to attend a medical conference volunteered to participate in the study. These&#xD;
      volunteers came from different parts of Japan thus representing a large part of the country.&#xD;
      Nine NAET® practitioners volunteered to supervise the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An on-site invitation to participate in the study was given to a group of 80 medical&#xD;
      professionals who had come to attend a medical conference in Tokyo, Japan. The invitation to&#xD;
      take part in the study was given to each member in the same morning at the time of&#xD;
      registration for the conference. The 80 subjects who responded to the invitation were asked&#xD;
      to complete an Allergy Symptom Rating Scale. They were asked to list an approximate amount of&#xD;
      daily sugar consumption in number of teaspoons. They were also asked to record if they had&#xD;
      suffered from any known sugar-related problems in the past. The five volunteer-subjects with&#xD;
      known diabetes and hypoglycemia were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 75 subjects had completed the Allergy Symptom Rating Scale form (ASRS) initially prior to&#xD;
      entering the study. After enrolling in the study, the examiners performed the Neuromuscular&#xD;
      sensitivity testing (NST Rating Scale) on their subjects before touching the test sample and&#xD;
      recording of the results. Initial radial pulse was taken and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Detailed information on the Allergy Symptom-Rating scale (ASRS); NSTRS, and PDRS: Subject&#xD;
      were asked to mark and rate their symptoms in their own words on a zero to ten scale where&#xD;
      zero=normal; and ten=maximum discomfort): 0= no allergy; (1-3)=1=mild; (4-6)= 2=moderate;&#xD;
      (7-10)=3=severe. After the initial testing (after completing ASRS form, NSTRS after balancing&#xD;
      the body, and after initial pulse reading) each one of the subjects was given a test tube&#xD;
      with clear liquid (dissolved sugar) in their hands. The examiners tested the NST of the&#xD;
      subjects with them holding the sample-test tube in their hands and the results recorded. The&#xD;
      radial pulse was also checked and recorded. Then they were asked to continue to hold the&#xD;
      samples for full ten minutes. At the end of ten minutes, they were assigned to be tested for&#xD;
      NST and Pulse by different examiners. While still holding the test tube in the hand, the&#xD;
      radial pulse was tested and recorded; NST was perfomed and recorded and each one of them was&#xD;
      asked to complete another Allergy Symptom Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the initial test, the monitors moved the subjects one at a time to a&#xD;
      different area and each one of them was asked to continue to hold the sample-tubes in their&#xD;
      hands for the following ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of ten minutes' waiting period with the test tubes in their hands, each subject&#xD;
      was given another ASRS form to record their symptoms one more time. They were also instructed&#xD;
      to rate their symptoms on a zero to ten scale. Then the monitors ushered them to different&#xD;
      examiners to check the NST and radial pulse one more time, while still holding the test tubes&#xD;
      in their hands. The results were recorded in a separate paper and the monitors collected the&#xD;
      results and sent for analysis.&#xD;
