  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if people taking lansoprazole two times a day to&#xD;
      control severe GERD symptoms can be controlled just as well, if not better, by taking Nexium&#xD;
      just once a day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      approximately 20% of patients taking first generation proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are&#xD;
      taking more than the standard approved dose. This dosing is required to attain adequate&#xD;
      control of the gastric and intraesophageal pH in order to affect the desired clinical&#xD;
      improvement. It is recognized that the b.i.d dosing strategy increases the intragastric pH&#xD;
      control of &lt;4 from approximately 12 hours to almost 16 hours. The refinement of the S isomer&#xD;
      of omeprazole (Nexium)has led to a way to more effectively control acid exposure. Comparative&#xD;
      trials with all the PPIs have shown significantly greater pH control of &lt;4 and head to head&#xD;
      comparisons as well as a recent crossover study. One study suggests that Nexium dosing&#xD;
      contains approximately 16.5 hours of a pH control of &lt;4. Conceivably, this duration of pH&#xD;
      control suggests that b.i.d. dosing of other PPIs might be avoided. Furthermore, it suggests&#xD;
      that patients currently taking b.i.d. PPIs might be successful candidates for conversion to&#xD;
      q.d. Nexium. This would provide a considerable cost implication to health care plans and for&#xD;
      patients who are responsible for paying for their PPI therapy. To date, esomeprazole has not&#xD;
      been studied in comparison to b.i.d. dosing with other PPIs. There is pharmacologic evidence&#xD;
      to suggest, however, that it is comparable. In this proposed study, we believe that by&#xD;
      beginning with patients who were well controlled should make for a cleaner definition and a&#xD;
      higher likelihood to demonstrate efficacy.&#xD;
