  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if the drug Atorvastatin (Lipitor) changes the genetic material&#xD;
      found in blood cells of people with vascular (blood vessel) disease. Vascular diseases affect&#xD;
      the blood flow in the body and can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Information gained from&#xD;
      this study could be used to develop a more reliable blood test that predicts the risk of&#xD;
      heart attack or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 21 and older who have two or more risk factors for developing vascular disease are&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram, ultrasound of the carotid (neck) arteries, blood tests, and&#xD;
      check of blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Three groups receive&#xD;
      Lipitor in a dose of either 10, 20 or 40 milligrams; the fourth group receives a placebo. All&#xD;
      take the study drug for 3 months. In addition, they undergo the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase I (Months 2-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in all groups are seen once a month at the NIH Clinical Center for blood tests&#xD;
      and monitoring of drug side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase 2 (Months 5-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo group: Participants are given 40 mg of Lipitor for 3 months (months 5-7) and&#xD;
           seen by a physician once a month during that time. Blood is drawn at the 7-month visit&#xD;
           and then participants are referred back to their physicians. During months 8, 9 and 10,&#xD;
           participants are called once a month to check on their health. Participation ends after&#xD;
           the tenth month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipitor group: Participants are referred back to their physicians for months 5 and 6 and&#xD;
           are called once a month. During month 7, they return to the clinic for a follow-up&#xD;
           evaluation and blood test. Participation ends after the seventh month.&#xD;

      Background: Atherosclerosis and its consequences - coronary heart disease and stroke - are&#xD;
      principal causes of mortality in developed countries. Being able to accurately predict an&#xD;
      individual's risk of vascular disease is needed for preventive strategies and measuring the&#xD;
      effectiveness thereof. Current risk assessment tools are imperfect at best. It is possible&#xD;
      that information from gene expression profiling of peripheral white blood cells may add&#xD;
      predictive information about vascular risk. We previously identified a panel of 78 genes in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood that correlated with an individual's future risk of stroke. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that gene expression in white blood cells will be modified by an intervention&#xD;
      that has been shown to reduce vascular risk via anti-inflammatory mechanisms: the&#xD;
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitor class of lipid lowering&#xD;
      drugs, known as &quot;statins&quot;. The vascular protective effects of statins appear to be due in&#xD;
      part to immune modulation and to be dose-dependent. Statin administration has been shown to&#xD;
      modulate gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Overall: To determine if atorvastatin modulates gene expression in peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells in a dose dependent manner in a cohort of subjects at risk of&#xD;
      vascular disease. Specific: To determine if: (1) Inflammatory genes are specifically and&#xD;
      temporarily modified by atrovastatin in a dose dependent manner; (2) A previously defined&#xD;
      panel of 78 genes is included among the genes modified by atorvastatin; and (3) Gene&#xD;
      expression changes correlate the degree of gene expression modulation by atorvastatin with&#xD;
      the degree of lipid lowering and other inflammatory parameters such as high sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Dose-response randomized, blinded study of atorvastatin treatment of 120&#xD;
      volunteer subjects with at least two conventional vascular risk factors who are not currently&#xD;
      taking a statin. In the first and primary phase of the study, subjects will be administered&#xD;
      atorvastatin in a blinded fashion in one of four doses (0mg, 10mg, 20mg or 40mg) for a period&#xD;
      of three months. Block randomization will stratify on age and risk factor status. In the&#xD;
      second and validation phase of the study, the subjects randomized to 0mg of atorvastatin in&#xD;
      phase 1 will receive 40mg of atorvastatin for a further 3 month period. The remaining&#xD;
      subjects will not be randomized to study drug in phase II of the study. Lipid profiles, liver&#xD;
      function tests and muscle enzymes will be measured prior to enrollment, and during the&#xD;
      treatment phases of the study. Gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      measured using Affymetrix microarrays pre treatment and at the end of phases I and II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: (1) Gene changes induced by statin treatment by dosage and over time; (2)&#xD;
      Accuracy of vascular gene panel for defining gene expression changes induced by statin&#xD;
      treatment; and (3) Correlations of gene expression changes with conventional vascular risk&#xD;
      factors, changes in lipid and inflammatory markers and determination of best vascular risk&#xD;
      prediction paradigm.&#xD;
