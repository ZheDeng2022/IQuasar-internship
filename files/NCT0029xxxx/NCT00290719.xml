      RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and irinotecan, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving&#xD;
      gefitinib together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor&#xD;
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of gefitinib when given together&#xD;
      with cisplatin, irinotecan, and radiation therapy before surgery and to see how well they&#xD;
      work in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer that can&#xD;
      be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the pathologic response (complete and partial) in patients with resectable&#xD;
           esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with neoadjuvant gefitinib,&#xD;
           cisplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate of complete resection in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine surgical morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction phase: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-14. Patients with&#xD;
           stable or responding disease proceed to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive gefitinib as in the induction phase&#xD;
           beginning in week 4 and continuing through the last day of radiotherapy. Patients also&#xD;
           receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days&#xD;
           22, 29, 43, and 50 and undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks&#xD;
           (total of 25 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Within 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients&#xD;
           with stable or responding disease undergo an esophagectomy and lymph node dissection.&#xD;
           Patients with a progressive or unresectable disease are removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
