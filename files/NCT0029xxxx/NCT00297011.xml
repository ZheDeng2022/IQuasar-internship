      A randomized study comparing the combination of valacyclovir and temovate gel (clobetasol&#xD;
      gel) versus placebo for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herpes simplex labialis is a common, worldwide affliction for which neither public health&#xD;
      procedures, vaccines, nor antiviral chemotherapy have had a major impact. The present study&#xD;
      has been proposed because it has become clear there are marked limitations to the benefit of&#xD;
      antiviral therapy in herpes labialis. Recently, a pilot trial of the combination of&#xD;
      famciclovir and topical 0.05% fluocinonide vs famciclovir alone showed that the addition of&#xD;
      corticosteroids to the antiviral drug treatment caused a marked and statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction in lesion size and a trend to more aborted lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, , patient-initiated study. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral valacyclovir 2grams&#xD;
      BID for one day and topical temovate 0.05% gel BID for three days compared to placebo&#xD;
      capsules and placebo gel in the episodic treatment of a single episode of recurrent herpes&#xD;
      labialis in immunologically normal patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened, randomized to study drug and instructed to start using study drug&#xD;
      within one hour of the first sign or symptom of their next episode of herpes labialis. Data&#xD;
      on the treated lesion will be collected by clinic visits and a patient diary card.&#xD;
