  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious illness associated with considerable morbidity,&#xD;
      risk of suicide and adverse social consequences (Montgomery et al., 1994a). Cognitive&#xD;
      impairment is one of the three major symptom areas of MDD. Specifically, memory impairment&#xD;
      and concerns are one of the most commonly reported complaints in MDD. While antidepressant&#xD;
      (AD) treatments vary a great deal in their propensity to cause cognitive impairment, there&#xD;
      remains a paucity of empirical evidence on the effects of AD treatment on neuropsychological&#xD;
      indices of memory functioning in non-geriatric depressed individuals. Hence, comparative&#xD;
      effects of various AD drugs on memory functioning remain unclear.The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate multiple aspects of memory functioning (short-term, working memory, verbal,&#xD;
      non-verbal, spatial and prospective memory) of MDD patients before and after 8 weeks of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment with bupropion XL or escitalopram.&#xD;

      Purpose of the Present Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to comprehensively evaluate memory functioning of MDD&#xD;
      patients before and after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment with bupropion-XL or&#xD;
      escitalopram. A neuropsychological test battery will incorporate multiple aspects of memory&#xD;
      functioning including: short-term &amp; working memory; verbal, non-verbal, spatial and&#xD;
      prospective memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Which subtypes of memory at baseline are more impaired?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the relationship between memory impairment and symptom severity and previous&#xD;
           number of episodes or duration of illness?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is successful AD treatment associated with improvement in memory functioning?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is there a main effect by AD type?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. On which subtypes of memory do patients improve, worsen, or remain neutral in the 2&#xD;
           different AD groups? (Main effect of memory type?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What is the relationship between change in memory function and symptomatic outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial comparing the memory functioning of&#xD;
      depressed subjects before and after 8 weeks of treatment with bupropion-XL as compared to&#xD;
      escitalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting, eligible subjects will receive either active bupropion-XL or active&#xD;
      escitalopram following the baseline visit. Doses will be fixed with an opportunity for dose&#xD;
      reduction if subjects are unable to tolerate fixed dose.&#xD;
