  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a long-term disorder that is characterized by widespread body&#xD;
      pain and tender points in joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues. Other symptoms&#xD;
      associated with the disorder include fatigue and depression. The cause of FMS is unknown, and&#xD;
      conventional treatments are often unsuccessful in adequately relieving pain. For people with&#xD;
      severe, unrelenting pain, which is referred to as refractory FMS, opioid maintenance therapy&#xD;
      may be an option, but it comes with the dangerous potential of addiction and is therefore&#xD;
      avoided if possible. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), in which a nerve located in the neck&#xD;
      receives electrical input, may be an option for providing pain relief. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of VNS as a treatment for&#xD;
      people with refractory FMS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FMS affects about 5% of the general population and occurs most often in women between the&#xD;
      ages of 20 and 50 years old. Overall, more than 80% of FMS patients report that pain is the&#xD;
      primary symptom that limits their ability to work, about 30% of patients are disabled, and&#xD;
      about 45% collect Social Security Disability insurance. Conventional treatments, which&#xD;
      include pharmacological and behavioral interventions, fail to provide adequate pain relief in&#xD;
      more than half of FMS patients, strongly suggesting the need for improved treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such option is a treatment called vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), in which short bursts of&#xD;
      electrical energy are directed into the brain by way of the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is a&#xD;
      cranial nerve that originates in the brainstem, travels through the neck, and then continues&#xD;
      down through the thorax and abdomen. The nerve acts as both a sensory and motor nerve, and it&#xD;
      can regulate several brain areas involved in pain and emotional processing. With VNS, a small&#xD;
      battery device is surgically implanted under the skin, usually under the chest, and provides&#xD;
      the necessary electrical energy for stimulation. Although VNS has been FDA approved for some&#xD;
      forms of epilepsy and depression, it has yet to receive FDA approval for FMS. Also, it is&#xD;
      unknown whether the safety and tolerability profile of an FMS patient receiving VNS is the&#xD;
      same as that of a patient with epilepsy or depression who is receiving VNS. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of VNS as a treatment&#xD;
      option for adults with refractory FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this study for about 25 months. An initial screening period that may&#xD;
      last up to 6 weeks will include a medical history review, various examinations, and the use&#xD;
      of a wrist-mounted device called an Actiwatch to record pain severity and mood over seven&#xD;
      consecutive days. Eligible participants will then undergo surgical implantation of the VNS&#xD;
      system. This will be followed by a 2-week recovery period, then a 2-week period of gradually&#xD;
      increasing the electrical output of the VNS system, and finally a 12-week VNS treatment&#xD;
      period during which the electrical output level will remain constant, unless a participant&#xD;
      develops intolerable side effects. Study visits will occur weekly for the first month after&#xD;
      implantation and then every 2 weeks during the treatment period. During most study visits,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a clinical assessment, including evaluation of any side effects,&#xD;
      and they will complete written assessments on pain, mood, fatigue, and quality of life and&#xD;
      sleep. The VNS system will also be checked for safety and programmed appropriately. During&#xD;
      the Week 16 visit, some of the screening evaluations will be repeated. Also at Week 16, which&#xD;
      will mark the end of the treatment period, participants will have the option to continue&#xD;
      receiving treatment. All participants will have follow-up evaluations at Months 6, 9, 12, and&#xD;
      24. Participants who wish to retain the VNS implantation beyond the length of the study will&#xD;
      be referred to a qualified neurologist for follow-up care. For the other participants, the&#xD;
      VNS system will be turned off and surgically explanted.&#xD;
