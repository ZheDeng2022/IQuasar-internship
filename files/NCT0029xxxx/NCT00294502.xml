      To study the efficacy of an antibacterial/anticoagulant solution instilled into the&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD) catheters after each treatment (&quot;antibiotic lock solution - ALS&quot;) to&#xD;
      prevent catheter related bacteremia (CRB) and to salvage catheters with established CRB.&#xD;

      Scope of the problem. A large number of hemodialysis patients in this country rely on&#xD;
      indwelling tunneled and non-tunneled catheters as vascular access for hemodialysis even&#xD;
      though the K/DOQI guidelines discourage their use. In a study performed by ESRD network 11,&#xD;
      [to which all Michigan dialysis centers submit data] 63% of patients initiated HD with a&#xD;
      catheter as their sole form of vascular access. At 6 months after initiation of HD, 40% of&#xD;
      these patients were still using a catheter. Other studies had shown that the prevalence of&#xD;
      overall catheter use to be around 20% of all accesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter associated infection. Current literature indicates that these catheters are&#xD;
      associated with a disproportionate risk for infection, particularly CRB, resulting in high&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and healthcare expenditure. The 'epidemic' of ESRD in this country has&#xD;
      seen an ever increasing reliance on these catheters not only to initiate the HD but also for&#xD;
      long term treatment in those patients who have no other access options. It has been estimated&#xD;
      that intravascular catheters are associated with more than 60,000 cases of nosocomial&#xD;
      bacteremia each year. HD catheters pose a particularly high risk for developing infections&#xD;
      because of their frequent use as well as their long-term use. All indwelling vascular&#xD;
      catheters are colonized by micro-organisms within 24 hours after insertion. The deposition of&#xD;
      biofilm on the external and internal surface of vascular catheters is thought to play an&#xD;
      important role in the colonization process. The biofilm is produced by a combination of host&#xD;
      factors (e.g., fibrinogen, fibrin, fibronectin and extracellular polysaccharides) and&#xD;
      microbial products (e.g., glycocalyx or &quot;slime&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics used to treat bacteremia do not penetrate&#xD;
      catheter lumen and therefore do not eradicate the biofilm, leading to potential treatment&#xD;
      failures and eventual sacrifice of the catheter. Recently published data suggests that using&#xD;
      a combination solution with antibacterial/anticoagulant agents prevents the formation of the&#xD;
      'biofilm' in the catheter lumen thereby preventing CRB, as well as salvage the catheters in&#xD;
      cases of established CRB. However, there continues to be a debate on the appropriate&#xD;
      antibacterial agent as well as its optimal concentration, in order to eradicate a wide&#xD;
      variety of organisms. Several other strategies were studied in the past 10 years to prevent&#xD;
      CRB and CRI. These include eradication of nasal Staphylococcal carriage with mupirocin, using&#xD;
      chlorhexidine for catheter hub cleaning and exit site disinfection and using mupirocin or&#xD;
      Polysporin ointments to the exit site along with standard dressing. But emergence of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance as well as the high costs of administrating these methods continue to&#xD;
      be barriers to their widespread use and cannot be relied upon to manage the high rate of&#xD;
      infection by themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salvaging catheters. In the past, infected catheters were routinely removed, especially for&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus infections, per the CDC guidelines. However, recent small studies&#xD;
      indicate that strategies such as ALS packing or changing catheter over a guide wire can&#xD;
      salvage a significant fraction of these catheters, thereby saving expense and morbidity, and&#xD;
      preserving the site. Thrombotic occlusions and infection are the two most common&#xD;
      complications of the HD catheters, each predisposing to the other. Some studies have shown&#xD;
      that ALS packing has also improved the long-term catheter function by preventing the&#xD;
      formation and propagation of the biofilm. Studying this aspect of catheter maintenance is&#xD;
      also an important outcome for our proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic Lock Solutions. We have identified 10 clinical trials (attached as appendix) in&#xD;
      the published literature describing the results of antibiotic lock therapy for preventing&#xD;
      infections in indwelling vascular catheters. All but one have demonstrated efficacy of ALS&#xD;
      packing. Of the 9 successful trials, only 6 were randomized controlled trials and only 3 of&#xD;
      these were done on HD catheters, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a prospective study. If we can achieve the same superior results from our study&#xD;
      incorporating the ALS packing strategy, we should be able to assess cost- effectiveness of&#xD;
      using the ALS packing vs. standard approach as has been discussed in previous trials, but has&#xD;
      not been systematically studied. In fact there are insufficient numbers of patients studies&#xD;
      to even perform a meta-analysis. We feel that it is critical to prove the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the new strategy in order for it to be used in a widespread fashion.&#xD;

      The applicant, Anatole Besarab MD, has extensive experience in Nephrology and specifically in&#xD;
      vascular access management. He has published, lectured, and coordinated symposia on vascular&#xD;
      access care and is the current chair of the K/DOQI vascular access workgroup of the NKF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is conceived for the following reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CRB burden in the hemodialysis patients at this institution has reached overwhelming&#xD;
           proportions and needs urgent strategies to counter this 'epidemic'. Current management&#xD;
           guidelines rely mostly on treatment of established infections but do not aim at&#xD;
           preventing these infections. This kind of economic burden and increased&#xD;
           morbidity/mortality in patients are unacceptable in the current health care environment.&#xD;
           Our study will add to the existing literature in defining the management guidelines for&#xD;
           CRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Greenfield Health System (GHS) that provides dialysis care to the patients of the&#xD;
           Henry Ford Health System includes several hundreds of patients and would be the ideal&#xD;
           setting to study the proposed intervention. This population also represents a&#xD;
           cross-section of many types of disease severity and number of co-morbid conditions.&#xD;
           Therefore they provide an opportunity to observe the effects on the proposed&#xD;
           intervention in different demographic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Henry Ford Hospital represents a completely new demography to study the effects of the&#xD;
           proposed intervention. The disease burden with CRB in the population served by this area&#xD;
           is higher than the national average and would be ideal to study the proposed&#xD;
           intervention in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cost effectiveness of using the antibiotic lock therapy has not been well studied to&#xD;
           date and will have a significant impact on the eventual formulation of treatment&#xD;
           guidelines. In the setting of current economic burden in the health care industry, study&#xD;
           of this issue is vital and timely. The vision of a simple, cheap intervention that can&#xD;
           result in savings of millions of dollars is central to this study.&#xD;
