  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing in US. The reason for this increase&#xD;
      has been attributed to the emergence of hepatitis C. Studies suggest that patients with&#xD;
      hepatitis C are at higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (elevated&#xD;
      alpha-fetoprotein) and, therefore should undergo periodic radiological investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver is also a common site for metastases for various malignancies. The metastasis to&#xD;
      liver profoundly affects the management and prognosis, since these patients have advanced&#xD;
      cancer and therefore are not candidates for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Current standards of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary liver tumors alpha-fetoprotein, abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen&#xD;
      are the suggested tests for the screening in patients that are at higher risk of developing&#xD;
      this complication. Measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be helpful in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and management of HCC. AFP is elevated above 20 ng/Ml in more than 70% of patients&#xD;
      with HCC. However, AFP elevations from 10-500 ng/Ml and even occasionally to 1000 ng/ml may&#xD;
      be seen in patients with a high degree of inflammatory activity such as with chronic viral&#xD;
      hepatitis, who do not have HCC (3). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive&#xD;
      value of AFP in 3 well performed screening studies for HCC ranged from 39%-64%, 76%-91%, and&#xD;
      9%-32%, respectively (4). Imaging studies play a key role in the diagnosis of HCC since a&#xD;
      significant number of cases are missed by AFP. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging are&#xD;
      commonly used tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of studies conducted over last two decades, National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network (2004) guidelines for the management of cancer recommended CT scan for the evaluation&#xD;
      of the liver for metastases (Please refer to appendix III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that CT scan is far from ideal for detection of primary as well as&#xD;
      metastases to liver (5,6). A well designed study showed that CT scan missed 32 % of the&#xD;
      primary tumors of the liver. A prospective study of 100 patients with colorectal cancer&#xD;
      showed that CT scan missed liver metastases in 37% of cases (5). Another prospective&#xD;
      controlled study of 135 subjects showed that CT scan failed to detect liver metastases in 49%&#xD;
      of patients with various malignancies (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 EUS as a possible diagnostic tool for liver tumors EUS is a well-established tool for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and/ or staging of the esophageal, gastric and pancreatic cancer. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown a potential role of EUS for the liver imaging (7, 8, and 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Comparison of EUS and CT scan for detection of liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that EUS may be an attractive alternative to CT scan for detection of the&#xD;
      liver metastases, since it can detect lesions that are missed on the CT scan (9). EUS&#xD;
      detected metastatic lesions overlooked by conventional, cross-sectional imaging studies in 5&#xD;
      of 222 cases (2.3%) (9). Another study found occult liver metastases in 2.4% of 574 patients&#xD;
      with suspected GI or pulmonary malignancies (4). Each patient found to have occult metastases&#xD;
      at EUS had staging CT, which raises an issue as to the quality and/or interpretation of those&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional advantage of EUS is that fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be performed&#xD;
      simultaneously and therefore confirmation of malignancy can usually be accomplished in a&#xD;
      single procedure whereas CT or US typically require 2 sessions to accomplish these tasks, one&#xD;
      for detection and another for FNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Limitation of EUS: Right lobe The limitation of the EUS is that it is not able to examine&#xD;
      the right lobe of the liver completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Rationale for the study. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS for detection of the liver tumors&#xD;
      (primary and metastatic) remains unknown. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that EUS&#xD;
      may be superior to the CT scan for the liver metastases. Studies that have evaluated the role&#xD;
      of EUS are limited by small sample size or retrospective design. Therefore, a prospective&#xD;
      study with adequate sample size is required to determine the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopy&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the accuracy of the EUS and CT scan for detection of the primary and metastatic&#xD;
      carcinoma of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary: 2.2.1 Determine the diagnostic yield of fine needle aspiration using EUS&#xD;
      (EUS-FNA) in patients with suspected liver metastasis on EUS examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2 Compare the accuracy of the PET scan with EUS for the detection of the liver&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.3 Determine the safety of EUS-FNA in subjects with liver lesions. 2.2.4 Impact of the EUS&#xD;
      on the management of the hepatocellular carcinoma 2.2.5 To study characteristic&#xD;
      echoendoscopic findings of the primary and secondary liver tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Hypothesis: 2.3.1 EUS is likely to detect primary tumor and liver metastasis in subjects&#xD;
      with normal CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Design: This is a prospective study where study group would comprise of consecutive&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed colon, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, gastric cancer and patient&#xD;
      with hepatitis C or B with elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein or radiological findings&#xD;
      suggestive of mass in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be selected from gastroenterology clinic, primary care clinic, surgery clinic,&#xD;
      sub-specialty clinics (Oncology, Pulmonary) and hepatitis C clinic. These clinics would be&#xD;
      informed about the ongoing EUS study and the eligibility criteria's of the study. All&#xD;
      patients will be seen in the gastroenterology clinic where a detail description of the&#xD;
      EUS-FNA procedure would be provided to them. In addition, patients would be provided consent&#xD;
      forms. (Please refer to section 5 for details of the consent process.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study would undergo -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed history and physical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT-abdomen preferably with contrast, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible PET scan. PET scan will be performed on patients who do not have evident&#xD;
           distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention allocation: all eligible patients would be encouraged to undergo EUS and&#xD;
           EUS-FNA examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and schedule: All eligible patients would undergo EUS examination of the liver.&#xD;
      Any subject with abnormality suspicious for malignancy in liver would undergo FNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits description and schedule. After the procedure patient would be referred back&#xD;
      to the clinic from which the patient was identified for further management. These patients&#xD;
      are usually seen by oncologists, pulmonologists and cardio-thoracic surgeon depending on the&#xD;
      stage and the medical condition of the patient.&#xD;
