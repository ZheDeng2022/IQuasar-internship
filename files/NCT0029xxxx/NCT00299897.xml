  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 28-day, multi-center, placebo-controlled study designed to look at the dose&#xD;
      response, efficacy, and safety of SP01A, given as a pill to be swallowed, in the treatment of&#xD;
      HIV-infected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samaritan has discovered that SP01A affects cholesterol binding, which is directly implicated&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of HIV. It has also been established that drugs of this nature exert an&#xD;
      anti-HIV effect in-vitro. These data suggest that SP01A has the potential to reduce HIV virus&#xD;
      replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One measurement of an HIV infected person's risk of progressing to AIDS is the number of&#xD;
      viral particles of HIV in their blood (called a &quot;viral load&quot;). This study is designed to see&#xD;
      if SP01A will lower the amount of HIV in an infected individual's blood. Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned by chance to 1 of 4 groups. Neither the patient nor the study doctor or nurse will&#xD;
      know which dose of the study drug the patient is taking or if he/she is receiving the placebo&#xD;
      (a capsule that looks like the study drug but does not contain any active ingredient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug administration will continue for 28 days. At the end of the 28-day study, the&#xD;
      patient will be offered testing of his/her virus for resistance to approved drugs (genotype).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently approved antiretroviral medications target either the HIV viral reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase (RT), (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) and Non-Nucleoside&#xD;
      Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)) or the viral protease, (Protease Inhibitors (PIs))&#xD;
      or inhibit viral fusion with target cells (Fusion Inhibitors). A regimen using a combination&#xD;
      of these agents is considered the standard of care and, when effective, results in&#xD;
      suppression of the virus below the detection limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the long-term use of antiretroviral therapy is sometimes hampered by poor compliance&#xD;
      due to pill burden, food restrictions, and major side effects that impact Quality of Life.&#xD;
      Furthermore, one of the major reasons for therapy failure is the emergence of resistant virus&#xD;
      against one or more of the anti-HIV medications or, to some extent, an entire class of drug&#xD;
      (cross resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon™) was recently approved as an HIV-1 fusion/entry inhibitor, a new class&#xD;
      of treatment that prevents fusion of the HIV-1 virus to the CD4+ cell membrane by preventing&#xD;
      the conformational changes required for this fusion. Since the mechanism of action of&#xD;
      Enfuvirtide is different from other classes of anti-HIV medication, it is effective in&#xD;
      patients who have failed other therapies due to emergence of resistant virus. However, a&#xD;
      recent study demonstrated the emergence of resistance to Enfuvirtide due to a mutation in&#xD;
      viral gp41.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid rate of mutation of HIV-1 and conferred resistance of the virus to current&#xD;
      therapies continues to necessitate a need for additional therapeutic agents. To that end, a&#xD;
      hypothesis has been suggested regarding the immuno-modulating and anti-viral effects of SP01A&#xD;
      in the treatment of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SP01A may affect cholesterol binding, which is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      HIV. Several observations have also established that inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis&#xD;
      inhibit cell fusion formation induced by HIV-l and that drugs extracting cholesterol from the&#xD;
      cellular membrane exert an anti-HIV-1 effect in-vitro. Taken together, these data may suggest&#xD;
      that procaine hydrochloride and SP01A reduces HIV-1 virus replication by modifying the&#xD;
      cholesterol content of the cell membrane, rendering it much more difficult for the virus to&#xD;
      enter and infect the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to develop improved new therapeutic agents. SP01A, which targets&#xD;
      different viral or cellular components with a new mechanism of action, is being developed and&#xD;
      tested by Samaritan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as a new anti-viral therapeutic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of orally administered&#xD;
      SP01A as monotherapy in HIV-infected patients with evidence of resistance to currently&#xD;
      available antiretroviral therapy was designed to further evaluate the dose response,&#xD;
      efficacy, and safety of SP01A. HIV-positive patients will be evaluated during the pre-study&#xD;
      period. Following a 2-week washout period (if required), patients will be randomized into one&#xD;
      of four study arms and all arms will initiate the 28-day monotherapy study. The first arm&#xD;
      will receive 200 mg of SP01A QID. Arm Two will receive 200 mg bid. The third arm will orally&#xD;
      administer 400 mg bid. Finally, the fourth arm will receive placebo twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, patients will make five scheduled visits to the treatment&#xD;
      facility on or about Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. During these visits patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for viral load and general health parameters. At the conclusion of the 28-day&#xD;
      monotherapy study, patients will have optimized viral testing for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 43, patients will make their final visit to the treatment facility for post-study&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
