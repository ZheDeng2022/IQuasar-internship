      Protocol Title: Randomized open label study comparing the metabolic control of first Kidney&#xD;
      Transplant recipients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) receiving either Prograf or Neoral&#xD;
      as part of a ATG induction, prednisone free and blood monitored Cellcept immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE This is a single center medical research study to analyze post-transplant kidney&#xD;
      recipients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes managed according to the recommended American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. Prograf (Tac) and Neoral (CSA) are the two main&#xD;
      medications to prevent rejection after transplantation. However, they may contribute to&#xD;
      poorer diabetes control. The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of Prograf and&#xD;
      Neoral on the control of Diabetes after kidney transplantation. In addition, all participants&#xD;
      in this study will receive Thymoglobulin (anti-lymphocyte globulin) at the time of&#xD;
      transplantation instead of long term prednisone (steroids).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been accepted that patients with DM are associated with a greater risk of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality and hyperlipidemia, compromised graft function, stroke, nephropathy,&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, graft-loss, infection, retinopathy, neuropathy,&#xD;
      gastropathy, and vascular complications.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pre-existing DM had a 1.9 times less survival days.3 In renal transplantation,&#xD;
      twice as many patients with pre-existing diabetes die with functioning graft.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM has been shown to be predominantly the single most important predictor for adverse&#xD;
      outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity resulting from various end organ damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor DM control leads to an increased risk of both graft loss and patient death due to&#xD;
      manifestations of end-stage DM.8 Chronic Allograft Nephritis (CAN) is a common finding at the&#xD;
      6th month post kidney transplant, especially in patients with blood glucose metabolism&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several conditions may lead the worsening of the diabetes after transplantation. First, for&#xD;
      patients with ESRD the improvement of kidney function after kidney transplantation leads also&#xD;
      to an increased clearance of circulating insulin. Second, most patients experience a&#xD;
      significant improvement of well being after successful transplantation. Often their appetite&#xD;
      is significantly improved, resulting in a significant weight gain - increasing insulin demand&#xD;
      and resistance. Finally, most immunosuppressive medications are diabetogenic.&#xD;
      Corticoid-steroids are well known for their strong diabetogenic effect and have been&#xD;
      associated with post transplant diabetes. Calcineurin inhibitors are now the corner stone of&#xD;
      immunosuppression for organ transplantation. This class of medication includes cyclosporine&#xD;
      and tacrolimus. Both have been associated with post transplantation diabetes. Induction&#xD;
      agents, including polyclonal antibodies (ex. Thymoglobulin) and monoclonal antibodies (ex.&#xD;
      Anti Il-2 receptor, Zenapax, Simulect) are not found to cause hyperglycaemia. The two areas&#xD;
      of possible intervention to minimize worse diabetes after transplantation are thus limited to&#xD;
      1) comprehensive diabetes education and 2) newer immunosuppressive regimen after&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Comprehensive Diabetes Education:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DM can arise both in the stressful time of organ failure or in the post-transplant phase.&#xD;
      During a prospective study we conducted on solid organ transplant recipients with&#xD;
      pre-existing and post transplant diabetes we observed the following trends:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The complex nature of organ transplantation carries potential side effects, which are&#xD;
           amenable to early intervention in the post transplant setting with patients who have&#xD;
           diabetes through education and monitoring by the transplant team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes post transplant have a higher incidence of post&#xD;
           transplant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study showed a 7% DM-related re-admissions within one year post-transplant for patients&#xD;
      in the Diabetes and Transplant Program, compared to a 93% DM-related re-admission rate within&#xD;
      one year for patients not enrolled in the Program.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analysis of Stanford Medical Center's Transplant Diabetes Program revealed that&#xD;
      patients' average HbA1c was 8.8% at intake into the program. Patients who were followed by&#xD;
      this multi disciplinary Transplant Diabetes education team resulted in an average value of&#xD;
      7.2% following a minimum of three months of management. 11&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Immunosuppression for Transplant Patients with Diabetes: The utilization of a calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor in combination with steroids has contributed to the improved success of&#xD;
      transplantation seen since the introduction of cyclosporine in 1983. Prograf, also a&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitor was introduce later (1989) and was associated with further improvement&#xD;
      in results. Newer immunosuppressive medication has been introduced since then. There has been&#xD;
      interest in the transplant community to use the new agents to achieve steroid minimization or&#xD;
      avoidance. These strategies are very appealing for the diabetic patients as both steroids and&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors are the most diabetogenic medication they receive after&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.1 STEROIDS Stanford's Pediatric kidney transplant team have demonstrated the feasibility&#xD;
      of steroid avoidance or rapid taper after kidney transplantation. Doctor Salvatierra team&#xD;
      substituted Zenapax induction therapy for steroids in a series of pediatric kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Patients received as well tacrolimus and MMF for prophylaxis of rejection. They&#xD;
      initially reported their experience with the first 34 patients (5-21 years old) treated with&#xD;
      that protocol. The graft survival was 100 % and the incidence of acute rejection was&#xD;
      rejection 6% compared with 15 % for historical controls receiving steroids. They had no post&#xD;
      transplantation diabetes or high blood pressure, cholesterol was lower, obesity and&#xD;
      appearance was also significantly better.12 Steroid avoidance is now the standard treatment&#xD;
      for Stanford's Pediatric Transplant Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult Kidney Transplant Program has been able to reproduce the pediatric experience with&#xD;
      a similarly designed steroid avoidance protocol. A slightly different approach has also been&#xD;
      successfully used. Kidney transplant recipients received Thymoglobulin induction in lieu of&#xD;
      Zenapax and received 4 small doses of steroids peri-operatively. So far 25 patients were&#xD;
      treated with this minimal exposure to steroids. The graft and patient survival is 100% and&#xD;
      only one episode of rejection was seen. This approach is preferred to the total avoidance of&#xD;
      steroids since it is associated with a better initial kidney function.13 This later approach&#xD;
      is currently used by Stanford's Adult Kidney Transplant Program for un-sensitized adult&#xD;
      patients receiving a kidney transplant if they have a medical condition that could be&#xD;
      exacerbated by the use of steroids; diabetes, obesity, osteopenia, and coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilisation of Thymoglobulin was associated with a lower incidence of acute rejection than&#xD;
      IL-2RA. Xiao et Al showed the absence of Post Transplant Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM) and&#xD;
      decreased use of anti-hypertensive medication in the steroid free group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimization of steroid use has clear metabolic benefits for the diabetic patients. Within&#xD;
      Stanford University Transplant service there is enough experience to support its safe use. In&#xD;
      this study, all patients will have minimal exposure to steroids. We have opted to give only&#xD;
      peri-operative steroids (4 doses total) as in our experience this approach is associated with&#xD;
      better initial graft function than the complete steroid avoidance. We also elected to use&#xD;
      induction therapy with Thymoglobulin as it is associated with the lowest rate of rejection&#xD;
      rate in the above mentioned studies.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2 Calcineurin inhibitors Calcineurin inhibitors have also been associated with post&#xD;
      transplant diabetes. The incidence of PTDM has been reported to be more than 30% depending on&#xD;
      the calcineurin inhibitor used, (Cyclosporine vs. Prograf), trough level, race, and risk&#xD;
      factors for diabetes all contribute to this number. These figures may underestimate the true&#xD;
      incidence of PTDM, as most studies have not utilized the strict criteria of the ADA for&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes. Most studies report a higher incidence of PTDM with the use of Prograf&#xD;
      compared to Cyclosporine. The greater diabetogenicity of Prograf has been confirmed in a&#xD;
      recent study investigating the new onset of diabetes both before and after kidney&#xD;
      transplant.14 this study revealed that the incidence of new-onset diabetes was 70% higher in&#xD;
      Prograf treated patients than with patients receiving Neoral.16 This contrasts with studies&#xD;
      mentioned above where Prograf is used in steroid free protocols with no or very low incidence&#xD;
      of post transplant diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcineurin inhibitors do remain the corner stone of immunosuppression at the present time,&#xD;
      and even more so in the context of steroid minimization. It would thus be very important to&#xD;
      determine if one of the two calcineurin inhibitors available on the market has a more&#xD;
      favourable metabolic profile specifically for patients with pre-existing diabetes. Direct&#xD;
      comparison between Neoral (micro-emulsion formulation of CSA) and Prograf has never been made&#xD;
      in context of short steroid taper and specifically for non-insulin dependent diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equitable comparison between Neoral and Prograf is difficult, as both drugs do not have the&#xD;
      same pharmacokinetic profile. Trough (or pre-dose) level has been used to evaluate drug&#xD;
      exposure and make dosage adjustment. Prograf has a more predictive correlation between the&#xD;
      trough level and the total area under the curve (total drug exposure of the patient) than&#xD;
      Neoral. C2 monitoring of CSA consists of measuring the drug level 2 hours after ingestion.&#xD;
      The correlation of C2 monitoring of Neoral to the area under the curve is similar to the&#xD;
      correlation of the trough for Prograf to the area under the curve (both R 2=0.92). C2&#xD;
      monitoring for Neoral has been associated with an increase in efficacy and reduction in&#xD;
      toxicity. In this study we will use C2 monitoring for Neoral and trough monitoring for&#xD;
      Prograf. Moderate minimization of the calcineurin inhibitor dosage will be used in this study&#xD;
      in order to reduce the deleterious effect of the calcineurin inhibitors to the metabolism of&#xD;
      glucose. A reduction of approximately 20% of our usual target level will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.3 Cellcept (MMF) Utilization of MMF is combination of Prograf or Neoral is the standard&#xD;
      treatment after kidney transplantation. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active component of&#xD;
      MMF. Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA has been shown to reduce rejection and toxicity.15&#xD;
      Furthermore; cyclosporine interferes with MPA metabolism resulting in a lower exposure to the&#xD;
      drug compared to patients receiving Prograf when a fix dose is used. MPA monitoring may thus&#xD;
      ensure that patients in our study are within therapeutic window of this immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agent. This may prove to be even more crucial as they are not receiving steroids. MPA&#xD;
      monitoring will also ensure that Neoral and Prograf groups receive the similar drug exposure&#xD;
      to MPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.4 Conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetes are at higher risks of morbidity and mortality after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Currently, there is no published data on the morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      these high risk patients from a prospective study that utilizes the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association (ADA) criteria for diabetes management and control, nor which addresses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of steroids elimination on outcomes after kidney transplantation and&#xD;
           metabolic control in patients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimization of CI therapy for post transplant patients with pre-existing type 2 DM and&#xD;
           its impact on metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study compares the effect of Calcineurin inhibitors have on metabolic control in&#xD;
      the absence of corticosteroids to better optimize post-transplant patient outcomes and&#xD;
      decrease morbidity in patients with DM. With close monitoring of transplant recipient&#xD;
      immunosuppression protocol, elimination of CS and the reduction of CI therapy, we propose&#xD;
      there will be a decrease in patient morbidity associated with DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study may help:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify optimal immunosuppression therapy for transplant patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease DM related co-morbidities and hospital readmissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase longevity of life and graft survival in transplant recipients with DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower overall post-transplant health care costs that are attributed to the morbidity of&#xD;
           immunosuppression therapy and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promote better DM self-care in the transplant process&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results from this study where 100% of the studied population is diabetic may provide&#xD;
           further insight in the metabolism of glucose after transplantation resulting in better&#xD;
           understanding of post transplant diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the conduct of the study the outcomes were amended to included freedom from insulin&#xD;
      therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as an indicator of graft function,&#xD;
      post-operative survival up to 1 year, and biopsy-proven transplant rejection.&#xD;
