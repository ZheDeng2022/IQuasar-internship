    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial of atomoxetine (1.8&#xD;
      mg/kg) for the management of chemotherapy-related acquired attentional disorders in children&#xD;
      who have survived Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. Atomoxetine will produce a favorable impact on&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms in children with chemo-related acquired attentional disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      atomoxetine as determined by the change in the ADHD-RS-IV Total score compared to placebo in&#xD;
      the symptomatic treatment of patients diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&#xD;
      (by DSM-IV ADHD-NOS criteria) occurring as a neuropsychological late-effect of chemotherapy&#xD;
      used to treat Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the effect of once daily (AM) dosing of atomoxetine (1.8mg/kg) compared to&#xD;
           placebo on ADHD symptoms as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ADHD-RS Total score inclusive of subtypes for inattention, hyperactivity and&#xD;
                combined subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical Global Impression-ADHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine compared with placebo based on&#xD;
           treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, physical&#xD;
           examinations, and ECGs.&#xD;
