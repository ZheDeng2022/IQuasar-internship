      Brief summary: The current management guidelines recommended by ACOG rely on history as a&#xD;
      screening method to determine pregnant women who are at risk for transmitting herpes to their&#xD;
      newborn. History fails completely in identifying the women most at risk of transmitting&#xD;
      herpes to their newborn - the seronegative woman who acquires a primary infection from her&#xD;
      partner during pregnancy. Despite recent advances, both pregnant women and newborns continue&#xD;
      to be at risk of acquiring herpes infection. Genital herpes infections are epidemic in the&#xD;
      United States. In the early 1990's, 25% of women in the US were seropositive for the HSV-2&#xD;
      antibody. These numbers are likely higher now. The incidence of neonatal herpes in the US&#xD;
      cannot be accurately estimated since it is not a reportable disease. However, in some areas&#xD;
      of the US, the incidence is 1 in 3,200 live births which would translate to an incidence of&#xD;
      approximately three infants a day in the US . In other areas of the US, the incidence is even&#xD;
      higher, approaching 1 in 1,500 liveborns. This protocol examines patient acceptance of HSV-1&#xD;
      and HSV-2 type specific serologic testing and assesses patient counseling tools. In addition,&#xD;
      seroprevalence of HSV-2 in pregnant patients will be collected and evaluated.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: Despite recent advances, both pregnant women and newborns continue to&#xD;
      be at risk of acquiring herpes infection. Genital herpes infections are epidemic in the&#xD;
      United States. In the early 1990's, 25% of women in the US were seropositive for the HSV-2&#xD;
      antibody (Fleming, 1997). These numbers are likely higher now. The incidence of neonatal&#xD;
      herpes in the US cannot be accurately estimated since it is not a reportable disease.&#xD;
      However, in some areas of the US, the incidence is 1 in 3,200 live births which would&#xD;
      translate to an incidence of approximately three infants a day in the US (Brown, 2003). In&#xD;
      other areas of the US, the incidence is even higher, approaching 1 in 1,500 liveborns&#xD;
      (Whitley, personal communication, December 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current management guidelines recommended by ACOG (Guidelines for Perinatal Care, 2002)&#xD;
      rely on history as a screening method to determine pregnant women who are at risk for&#xD;
      transmitting herpes to their newborn. Based on data reported in NHANES III, history is an&#xD;
      unreliable method of determining those who are infected with genital herpes (Fleming, 1997).&#xD;
      Most importantly, history fails completely in identifying the women most at risk of&#xD;
      transmitting herpes to their newborn - the seronegative woman who acquires a primary&#xD;
      infection from her partner during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since at-risk women can now be accurately identified by new and more accurate type-specific&#xD;
      serologic tests, effective prevention strategies should be instituted to minimize risk of&#xD;
      transmission to the neonate. The first obligation is to diagnose who is at risk. The highest&#xD;
      risk is that of neonatal transmission from a mother experiencing a primary genital HSV-1 or&#xD;
      HSV-2 infection in late pregnancy. Studies indicate that approximately 1.3% of women&#xD;
      seroconvert during pregnancy and, among those who do, the risk of neonatal transmission is as&#xD;
      high as 30 - 50% (Brown 1991). Conversely, the rate of neonatal transmission from women with&#xD;
      recurrent genital herpes infection is low (&lt;1%) (Brown, 1991, 1997; Smith, 1998; Arvin, 1986;&#xD;
      Fonnest, 1997). However, since genital herpes is so common, the total number of cases of&#xD;
      neonatal herpes from women with recurrent disease remains high (Fleming, 1997; STD&#xD;
      Guidelines, 2002). Once a mother is identified as being infected with HSV-2, the health care&#xD;
      providers - both pediatrician and obstetrician - can be alerted to the potential risk of&#xD;
      neonatal herpes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of pregnant women with or without herpes infections should include steps designed&#xD;
      to minimize the risk of herpes transmission to neonates. This protocol examines patient&#xD;
      acceptance of HSV-1 and HSV-2 type specific serologic testing and assesses patient counseling&#xD;
      tools. In addition, seroprevalence of HSV-2 in pregnant patients will be collected and&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-treatment study of acceptance rates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 type specific serologic&#xD;
      testing by pregnant women and their partners. This study will also evaluate Health Care&#xD;
      Provider time spent in counseling, effectiveness of counseling tools/sessions, and acceptance&#xD;
      of antiviral suppression by pregnant women and/or their partners. In addition, HSV-2&#xD;
      seroprevalence will be assessed. This study will be conducted at a single center (Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology Office) and is not designed to yield nationally representative estimates of&#xD;
      HSV-2 seroprevalence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women who present for their first prenatal visit will be invited to enroll. A total&#xD;
      of 300 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician or staff will describe the study to the patient based on the provided&#xD;
      description.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is interested in participating in the study, she will be given an informed&#xD;
      consent to sign, told that the blood test is to determine whether she is seropositive or&#xD;
      seronegative for genital herpes (HSV-2) and the virus that causes cold sores (HSV-1), and&#xD;
      given a demographic form to complete. If the patient is willing to be tested for HSV-1 and&#xD;
      HSV-2, she will continue with counseling and completion of questionnaires. For those patients&#xD;
      willing to be tested, counseling and questionnaires will be completed during visit 1 and&#xD;
      visit 2. For those patients who are unwilling to be tested, counseling and questionnaires&#xD;
      will be administered during this first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and office staff will monitor time spent in each counseling session, and&#xD;
      also provide assessment of effectiveness and satisfaction with counseling tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inviting the patient to take part in the clinical trial, each patient's chart should&#xD;
      be reviewed to be certain that the patient does not have a known history of genital herpes or&#xD;
      prior knowledge of HSV-2 seropositivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment of patients in the study, the investigator and appropriate study&#xD;
      personnel will be provided with training on HSV serologic testing and provided with the&#xD;
      counseling tools. This will ensure that all patients receive standardized HSV counseling at&#xD;
      the initial visit and during the follow-up visit when test results are discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that ideally, the same person on staff should administer the&#xD;
      Counseling Scripts using verbiage consistent with the provided scripts This should be&#xD;
      administered with care and concern in a private setting. The counselor then should give the&#xD;
      patient sufficient time to ask questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following is an outline of study assessments and procedures Visit #1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinician or staff will describe the study to the patient by the following script:&#xD;

      with the virus that causes genital herpes or the virus that causes cold sores. If you decide&#xD;
      to participate in this study and decide to have the blood test or even if you decide NOT to&#xD;
      have the blood test, you will be asked to complete questionnaires and counseling sessions&#xD;
      given by the office staff. This will be a time commitment of about 1 hour and may include an&#xD;
      additional 20 minute office visit next week.&#xD;

      patient in the case report form Upon completion of study, complete Satisfaction with&#xD;
      Counseling Tools Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEALTH OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit a self administered questionnaire regarding barriers to testing will be&#xD;
      given to each eligible patient refusing to be tested. After counseling, this questionnaire&#xD;
      will be repeated for those patients who still refuse testing. All patients will be counseled&#xD;
      and will be given two self administered questionnaires. One questionnaire will assess the&#xD;
      patient's understanding of the counseling and the other will assess the patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction with the counseling session. At the second visit, those patients who were tested&#xD;
      will receive their test results and will be counseled on their status (positive or negative).&#xD;
      These patients will receive two self administered questionnaires. One questionnaire will&#xD;
      assess the patient's understanding of counseling (specific to their status), and the other&#xD;
      will assess the patient's satisfaction with the counseling session. A separate self&#xD;
      administered questionnaire will be given to the investigator and/or appropriate office&#xD;
      personnel to assess their satisfaction with the counseling tools and sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
