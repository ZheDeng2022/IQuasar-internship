  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have iron overload due to chronic blood transfusions and have developed heart&#xD;
      failure or who are at high risk of heart failure because of the high levels of iron in their&#xD;
      hearts, will be treated with deferiprone, an investigational drug, in combination with&#xD;
      deferoxamine (Desferal). Some studies suggest that deferiprone may be better than&#xD;
      deferoxamine in removing iron from the heart and improving heart function, and that using&#xD;
      both drugs together may remove more iron. Participants would make a clinic visit for lab&#xD;
      studies each week, and would continue to take deferiprone for as long as their physician&#xD;
      feels it is useful in their care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Repeated red cell transfusions lead to transfusional iron overload because the body lacks an&#xD;
      efficient mechanism to excrete excess iron. Without treatment, iron accumulates in the liver,&#xD;
      heart and endocrine glands. Cardiac complications including arrhythmias and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure are the most common cause of death from transfusional iron overload. New magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) T2* techniques enable an estimation of cardiac iron loading, and&#xD;
      allow patients at the highest risk of cardiac disease (those with T2* &lt; 10 ms) to be&#xD;
      identified. For over 30 years, deferoxamine has been the standard therapy. However, the mode&#xD;
      of administration is cumbersome (subcutaneous or intravenous infusion over 8 to 12 hours&#xD;
      daily), leading to poor compliance. Thus, cardiac disease and early mortality continue to be&#xD;
      a significant problem in patients treated with chronic transfusions. Treatment of cardiac&#xD;
      complications involves intensifying therapy with deferoxamine, including recommending&#xD;
      intravenous administration over a period of 24 hours daily. Deferiprone is an oral chelating&#xD;
      agent, not FDA approved for use in the United States. Recent studies indicate that&#xD;
      deferiprone is superior to deferoxamine in removing cardiac iron and reducing iron-induced&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity. The most serious side effect of deferiprone is agranulocytosis, and other&#xD;
      side effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, reversible arthralgia, reddish discoloration of&#xD;
      urine and rare cases of autoimmune disease. Patients on the study will be closely monitored&#xD;
      for these toxicities. Patients who are currently regularly followed at The Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Philadelphia will be prescribed deferiprone at 75 mg/kg/day in three divided&#xD;
      doses, taken orally, in combination with deferoxamine, at the patient's current dose. Labs&#xD;
      will be drawn once per week to monitor neutrophil count, with additional labs every three&#xD;
      months to monitor ferritin and ALT levels.&#xD;
