      The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of two&#xD;
      chemotherapies drugs, Cetuximab and Pemetrexed (Alimta), when given in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Currently Pemetrexed is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for two other types of cancer, mesothelioma and lung cancer, but it is considered&#xD;
      investigational and is not approved by the FDA for head and neck cancer. Cetuximab is&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer; however, it is not yet approved&#xD;
      for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed is a drug that kills tumor cells by stopping cells from functioning normally. It&#xD;
      has been studied in thousands of subjects and has been shown to be effective at killing tumor&#xD;
      cells in many cancers, including head and neck cancer. In preclinical studies, Pemetrexed&#xD;
      showed such promising activity against a wide range of tumor types including those mentioned&#xD;
      above as well as breast, colon, and bladder cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab (also known as &quot;C225&quot; and &quot;Erbitux&quot;) can increase the effectiveness of our standard&#xD;
      treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. Cetuximab is a type of drug known as a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are used to try to destroy some types of cancer cells while&#xD;
      causing little harm to normal cells. They are designed to recognize specific molecules that&#xD;
      are on the surface of particular cancer cells. The monoclonal antibody recognizes the protein&#xD;
      and locks onto it. This may trigger the body's immune system to attack the cancer cells and&#xD;
      can sometimes make the cells destroy themselves. Cetuximab targets the epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR), an important molecule for the growth of cancer cells. The use of&#xD;
      radiation therapy and Cetuximab has also been studied with good results. We will find what&#xD;
      effects (good and bad) Cetuximab has on you and your head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Cetuximab and Pemetrexed have been studied intensively to determine their effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will find what effects (good and bad) Cetuximab and Pemetrexed, with&#xD;
      radiation; have on you and on your head and neck cancer. We will find out if the combination&#xD;
      of Cetuximab, Pemetrexed and radiation has better results than what we ordinarily expect with&#xD;
      radiation and chemotherapy. We will also find out if the side effects are worse than those we&#xD;
      usually see. In addition, we will test both blood and tumor tissue and determine what effects&#xD;
      Cetuximab has on these specimens. Finally, we will look for &quot;markers,&quot; or cancer identifiers,&#xD;
      in your tumor cells and blood that may help to predict what the best treatment is for head&#xD;
      and neck cancer patients in the future.&#xD;

             normal (less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of liver&#xD;
             metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all subjects prior to beginning therapy.&#xD;
             Subjects should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements, significant history of uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, recent myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (within prior 3 months), uncontrolled congestive heart failure, and&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with chemotherapy. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial&#xD;
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In&#xD;
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner&#xD;
             of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control.&#xD;
             Subjects who are women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must be&#xD;
             willing to use effective contraception while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect&#xD;
             they might be pregnant .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive subjects are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior grade 3 or 4 infusion or hypersensitivity reaction to a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects who have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions&#xD;
             before initiation of protocol therapy, consideration should be given to draining the&#xD;
             effusion prior to starting therapy due the potential of increased toxicity with&#xD;
             Pemetrexed in that setting.&#xD;
