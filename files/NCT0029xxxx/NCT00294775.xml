  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consequence of aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is increased pressure load on the left&#xD;
      ventricle which causes left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and myocardial stretch will cause&#xD;
      activation of cardiac peptides and activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system&#xD;
      (RAAS). The consequence of LV hypertrophy is increased chamber-stiffness and delayed active&#xD;
      LV relaxation which initially will cause diastolic and later systolic dysfunction. In heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) and ischemic heart disease the degree of diastolic dysfunction has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to correlate with functional class, neurohormonal activation and prognosis which&#xD;
      also recently have been suggested for AVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With longstanding elevated filling pressures the left atrium (LA) will dilate. Only limited&#xD;
      data are available on the degree and importance of LA dilatation in AVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When apparent, symptoms of HF in AVS are associated with high mortality rates. If LV systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction also is present prognosis will deteriorate further. In these cases aorta valve&#xD;
      replacement (AVR) is recommended. AVR will normalize pressure overload and thereby decreases&#xD;
      LV hypertrophy. Previously it was believed that in time LV hypertrophy regressed towards&#xD;
      normal and even normalized. Recent studies however have demonstrated that LV hypertrophy&#xD;
      regression mainly happens during the first year after AVR, and little subsequent changes are&#xD;
      seen during the remaining 10 years. Furthermore, patients that experience most regression of&#xD;
      hypertrophy have more favourable outcome and better functional class than patients with less&#xD;
      regression of hypertrophy. Thus absence of reverse remodelling is associated with poor&#xD;
      outcome after AVR. Importantly the regression of LV hypertrophy is closely paralleled by&#xD;
      decreasing RAAS hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAAS hyperactivity may be attenuated pharmacologically with angiotensin II receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARB) which in systemic hypertension with LV hypertrophy has been associated with reverse&#xD;
      remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that in patients undergoing AVR for symptomatic AVS, 12 months post&#xD;
      operative blockade of the angiotensin II receptor will accelerate LV and LA reverse&#xD;
      remodelling, reduce filling pressures and suppress neurohormonal activation compared with&#xD;
      conventional therapy. This will lead to improved exercise tolerance and due to improved left&#xD;
      atrial function reducing the risk of atrial arrythmias.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most common valvular disease in the western world.&#xD;
           The prevalence increases with age where &quot;degenerative&quot; changes of the aortic valve with&#xD;
           thickening, accumulation of calcium and progressive dysfunction of the valve usually&#xD;
           becomes apparent in patients older than 60 years. Although the development of AVS&#xD;
           generally is believed to be a degenerative process more recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
           AVS is caused by a complex process of increased cellularity, lipid accumulation,&#xD;
           extracellular matrix deposition, and with disease progression calcification of lesions.&#xD;
           Although mild and moderate AVS generally is well tolerated severe AVS is associated with&#xD;
           considerable morbidity and mortality, and valve replacement is generally required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The consequence of AVS is increased pressure load on the left ventricle which causes&#xD;
           changes in the ventricular structure. Pressure overload causes replication of the&#xD;
           sarcomeres leading to left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and myocardial stretch will&#xD;
           cause activation of cardiac peptides and activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone&#xD;
           system (RAAS). With progression of disease, RAAS activation will, through stimulation of&#xD;
           the angiotensin-II receptor mediate fibroblast proliferation, promote fibrosis and&#xD;
           directly affect the extracellular matrix. The consequence of LV hypertrophy and&#xD;
           interstitial fibrosis is increased chamber-stiffness and delayed active LV relaxation&#xD;
           which initially will cause diastolic (increased LV end-diastolic pressure) and later in&#xD;
           the disease progression also systolic dysfunction. In congestive heart failure and&#xD;
           ischemic heart disease the degree of diastolic dysfunction has been demonstrated to&#xD;
           correlate with functional class, neurohormonal activation and prognosis which also&#xD;
           recently has been suggested for AVS. Thus, although not fully elucidated the transition&#xD;
           from well compensated hypertrophy caused by pressure overload to symptomatic heart&#xD;
           failure may be related to evolving diastolic dysfunction. With longstanding elevated&#xD;
           filling pressures the left atrium will dilate due to chronically increased atrial&#xD;
           afterload. Only limited data are available on the degree and importance of LA dilatation&#xD;
           in AVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When apparent, symptoms of heart failure in AVS is associated with high mortality rates.&#xD;
           If LV systolic dysfunction also is present prognosis will deteriorate further. In these&#xD;
           cases aorta valve replacement (AVR) is recommended. AVR will normalize pressure overload&#xD;
           and thereby decreases LV hypertrophy. Previously it was believed that in time LV&#xD;
           hypertrophy regressed towards normal and even normalized. More recent studies however&#xD;
           have demonstrated that LV hypertrophy regression mainly happens during the first 12-18&#xD;
           months after AVR, and little subsequent changes are seen during the remaining 10 years.&#xD;
           Furthermore, patients that experience most regression of hypertrophy has more favourable&#xD;
           outcome and better functional class than patients with less regression of hypertrophy.&#xD;
           Thus absence of reverse remodelling is associated with poor outcome after AVR.&#xD;
           Importantly the regression of LV hypertrophy is closely paralleled by decreasing RAAS&#xD;
           hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           RAAS hyperactivity may be attenuated pharmacologically using angiotensin converting&#xD;
           enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) which in systemic&#xD;
           hypertension with LV hypertrophy has been associated with reverse remodelling. This may&#xD;
           at least partly be associated with increased collagenase activity and depressed collagen&#xD;
           synthesis. Thus attenuation of RAAS hyperactivity may in theory lead to decreased&#xD;
           myocardial fibrosis and improving the diastolic function of the LV. The effect of ARB&#xD;
           treatment in patients with AVS that have undergone AVR is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients undergoing AVR for symptomatic valvular aortic stenosis, 12 months post&#xD;
           operative blockade of the angiotensin II receptor will accelerate LV and LA reverse&#xD;
           remodelling, reduce filling pressures and suppress neurohormonal activation compared&#xD;
           with conventional therapy. This will lead to improved exercise tolerance and due to&#xD;
           improved left atrial function reducing the risk of atrial arrythmias.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective single center randomized study (PROBE design). Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to either conventional management or conventional management and 12 months&#xD;
      treatment with candesartan. Treatment with candesartan will be unblinded but all&#xD;
      neurohormonal analyses and analyses of LV and LA size and function will be performed blinded&#xD;
      for treatment allocation and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for elective aortic valve replacement for severe AVS at Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital will consecutively be offered participation in the study at hospital admission (2&#xD;
      days prior to surgery). If patient consent is obtained patients will undergo the study&#xD;
      program. Baseline echocardiography, neurohormonal analyses, and 6 min walk test will be&#xD;
      performed the day before surgery. After surgery and when the patient is transferred from&#xD;
      cardiac intensive care unit to step down unit treatment with candesartan (Atacand®) 8 mg&#xD;
      daily is initiated, and during hospitalization patients are titrated to 32 mg. After hospital&#xD;
      discharge patients will be followed in the heart failure clinic at Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital. Study medication will be handed to the patient at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment is planned to start February 2006 and continue for 18 months or until 140 patients&#xD;
      have been enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1 Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography will be performed prior to valve replacement, and repeated 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months after surgery. Examinations will be performed on a GE medical Vivid 5 ultrasound&#xD;
      machine. Images will be obtained from the parasternal and apical windows. M-mode recordings&#xD;
      will be done in the parasternal long-axis view. Pulsed Doppler measurements of mitral inflow&#xD;
      will be obtained with the transducer in the apical four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler&#xD;
      sample volume placed between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler&#xD;
      imaging of the mitral annulus will be obtained from the apical 4-chamber view with a 1.5-mm&#xD;
      sample volume placed at the medial mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic examinations&#xD;
      are done with horizontal sweep set to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles will be measured.&#xD;
      Finally color coded real time tissue Doppler images will be acquired in the apical windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-systolic, end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction will be calculated according to&#xD;
           the Simpson modified biplane method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LV mass will be estimated using the recommendations of the American Society of&#xD;
           Echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two&#xD;
           orthogonal apical views.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity, peak A wave velocity,&#xD;
           and mitral E-wave deceleration time will be measured. From pulsed wave Doppler recording&#xD;
           of LV outflow ejection time will be recorded. From these recordings Tei index will be&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and size of inferior v. cava pulmonary arterial&#xD;
           systolic pressure will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E') diastolic&#xD;
           velocity will be recorded. Diastolic function will be graded in grades 0-3 and diastolic&#xD;
           E/e' ratio calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From color coded tissue Doppler images systolic longitudinal fibre shortening will be&#xD;
           assessed using tissue tracking, and systolic strain will be assessed on a regional&#xD;
           basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2 Neurohormonal Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery and at each follow-up visit venous blood samples will be drawn for analysis&#xD;
      of plasma N-terminal proBNP, and of plasma N-terminal ANP concentrations. In addition prior&#xD;
      to surgery and after 6 and 12 months treatment with candesartan RAAS activity will be&#xD;
      assessed using plasma-renin activity, plasma-aldosterone, and plasma-noradrenalin. In&#xD;
      addition plasma will be frozen at each visit for possible later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3 Six Minutes Walk Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6 min. walk test will be performed at baseline and at each outpatient visit (3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.3 Holter Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 12 months visit a 2-channel 48 hours Holter monitoring will be performed and analyzed&#xD;
      for occurrence of atrial arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.4 Blood Pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of blood pressure will be done standardized after 30 min of rest at each visit.&#xD;
      Target blood pressure will be 140/80 mmHg or less and treatment instituted when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.5 Study Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period hospitalizations for worsening of heart failure, fatal / nonfatal&#xD;
      stroke, fatal/nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, hospitalization for atrial arrhythmias, and&#xD;
      death from all causes will be recorded.&#xD;
