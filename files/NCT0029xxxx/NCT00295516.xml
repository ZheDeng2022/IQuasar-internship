  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pregnancies complicated by Rhesus disease, the mother has developed antibodies which cross&#xD;
      the placenta and can cause anemia and death of the fetus. When the anemia is detected on&#xD;
      time, the fetus can be saved by giving it blood transfusions during the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard test to predict whether the fetus needs a blood transfusion is examination of&#xD;
      the amniotic fluid. To obtain this fluid a needle has to be inserted in the womb, which has a&#xD;
      risk of preterm delivery, infection, and making the disease worse. This is called&#xD;
      amniocentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new safe test, using Doppler ultrasound, has been developed to possibly replace the&#xD;
      amniocentesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the new Doppler test with the standard amniocentesis. If&#xD;
      the Doppler test is at least as good, this safe test may replace the amniocentesis in the&#xD;
      management of pregnancies with Rhesus disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In pregnancies complicated by red cell alloimmunization, the fetus may suffer from chronic&#xD;
      progressive hemolytic anemia. Severe fetal anemia leading to hydrops and fetal demise can&#xD;
      occur as early as 17 weeks' gestation, while in other pregnancies the only manifestation of&#xD;
      the disease is neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The standard of care in the management of these&#xD;
      pregnancies is to select patients at risk of fetal anemia using information about their&#xD;
      obstetric history, and serial maternal serum antibody measurements. The selected patients are&#xD;
      followed closely, usually in referral centers with a special interest and expertise in&#xD;
      managing this now relatively rare disease. Ultrasound evaluation of fetal condition, with&#xD;
      emphasis on signs of fetal hydrops, is performed regularly. In addition, serial amniocentesis&#xD;
      is done to assess amniotic fluid bilirubin (deltaOD450) values. This spectrophotometric&#xD;
      method estimates the level of bilirubin in the amniotic fluid, which correlates with the&#xD;
      severity of the hemolytic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this diagnostic test, introduced by Liley in 1961, has served fetal medicine&#xD;
      specialists well for almost 40 years, the invasive nature of the method is considered a&#xD;
      serious disadvantage. Furthermore, its reliability has been questioned, especially when used&#xD;
      in the second trimester. In the past decade, noninvasive alternative methods to predict the&#xD;
      degree of fetal anemia have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most promising of these new diagnostic tests is Doppler measurement of fetal blood flow&#xD;
      velocities. Fetal blood flow velocity has been shown to correlate linearly with the degree of&#xD;
      anemia. Recently, middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak flow velocity measurements have been&#xD;
      reported to reliably predict presence or absence of fetal anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the performance of this new noninvasive diagnostic test&#xD;
      with the standard test, amniocentesis for amniotic fluid deltaOD450 values. In an&#xD;
      international multicenter setting, a large cohort of consecutive Rh-alloimmunized pregnancies&#xD;
      will be studied prospectively. Both diagnostic tests will be performed simultaneously in all&#xD;
      patients, and compared with the &quot;gold standard&quot;, fetal blood sampling (FBS) to assess the&#xD;
      actual hemoglobin concentration.&#xD;
