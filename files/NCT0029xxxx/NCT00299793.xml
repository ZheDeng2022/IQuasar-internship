  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability of lamotrigine as&#xD;
      used in a natural clinical setting, to examine the positive effects of lamotrigine, and the&#xD;
      reasons why some patients choose to continue or discontinue lamotrigine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been numerous randomized, double-blind controlled trials demonstrating the value&#xD;
      of lamotrigine in the treatment of seizures. However, randomized trials take place in&#xD;
      artificial experimental conditions with many restrictions imposed. There hasn't been much&#xD;
      focus on positive effects on the patient, such as improvement in mood and level of alertness&#xD;
      related to the drug. Other factors related to quality of life that affect the decision to&#xD;
      continue or discontinue the drug are also important. Anecdotal experience suggests that&#xD;
      lamotrigine is associated with increased alertness, enhanced energy levels and improved&#xD;
      general sense of well-being. Observational studies that promote awareness of such&#xD;
      distinguishing features and other aspects of efficacy are essential for guiding&#xD;
      decision-making when prescribing anti-epileptic drugs.&#xD;
