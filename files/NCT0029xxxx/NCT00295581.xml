    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at Johns Hopkins University Center for Immunization Research in&#xD;
      Washington DC, will test the safety and immune response of healthy volunteers to two&#xD;
      experimental malaria vaccines. Malaria is a disease of red blood cells caused by a parasite&#xD;
      that spreads from person to person by mosquitoes. It affects people of all ages, but is&#xD;
      particularly severe in children. Patients may have a high fever, chills and muscle aches.&#xD;
      They sometimes can have severe complications that may even result in death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccines in this study are called &quot;transmission blocking&quot; vaccines. These vaccines&#xD;
      stimulate the person's immune system to produce antibodies against malaria. When a mosquito&#xD;
      bites a vaccinated person, it ingests some of the person's blood. The antibodies in the&#xD;
      ingested blood stop the malaria parasite from developing inside the mosquito. The mosquito&#xD;
      would not be able to transmit malaria to other people. PpPfs25/ISA51 (Vaccine A) stimulates&#xD;
      production of antibodies against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and&#xD;
      ScPvs25/ISA51 (Vaccine B) stimulates antibodies against the malaria parasite Plasmodium&#xD;
      vivax. The vaccines also contain a substance called Montanide ISA51, which boosts the immune&#xD;
      response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Women&#xD;
      who are able to become pregnant have a urine pregnancy test before each immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive two injections, spaced 4 months apart, of&#xD;
      either Vaccine A or Vaccine B at one of three doses-high, medium, or low. Two subjects in&#xD;
      each dose group additionally serve as &quot;controls&quot; and receive only Montanide ISA51 mixed with&#xD;
      saline. The vaccine is injected into the muscle of the upper arm. Subjects are monitored for&#xD;
      30 minutes after each injection for possible side effects and take home a diary card to&#xD;
      record their temperature and any symptoms that may appear over the next 13 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample is drawn before and on several occasions after each vaccination to check the&#xD;
      subject's health and to evaluate the immune response to the vaccine. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21&#xD;
      days after each vaccination, participants come to the clinic for a check of vital signs&#xD;
      (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure), brief physical examination, and&#xD;
      history of symptoms since the previous visit.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Phase 1 clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of two malaria transmission-blocking vaccines, PpPfs25 and ScPvs25, in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. Of the four species of malaria that infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is&#xD;
      responsible for the majority of these deaths. However, outside of Africa, most of the malaria&#xD;
      is caused by Plasmodium vivax; although these cases result in few deaths, they represent a&#xD;
      major cause of morbidity and lead to a significant impact on the quality of life. The&#xD;
      development of a safe and effective vaccine that prevents the transmission of P. falciparum&#xD;
      or P. vivax would be an important addition to the current methods for controlling the spread&#xD;
      of malaria parasites. A vaccine designed to prevent oocyst development in the mosquito by&#xD;
      eliciting transmission-blocking antibodies in the vertebrate host would protect other&#xD;
      individuals in the vicinity from becoming infected from the immunized person. Thus, despite&#xD;
      no immediate role in personal protection, transmission-blocking vaccines are a potentially&#xD;
      powerful component of a multifaceted public health approach to controlling or eliminating&#xD;
      malaria. This study will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins University - Bloomberg School of&#xD;
      Public Health, Center for Immunization Research. Seventy-two healthy male and non-pregnant&#xD;
      female volunteers ages 18-50 will be enrolled. This study will be single blinded (to&#xD;
      volunteers) and placebo-controlled. The study will evaluate three dose levels of both the&#xD;
      PpPfs25 and ScPvs25 malaria vaccines (5 microg, 20 microg, 80 microg) emulsified with&#xD;
      Montanide ISA51 as compared to Montanide ISA51 given alone. Seventy-two volunteers (60&#xD;
      vaccine and 12 placebo) will be enrolled and assigned to one of six cohorts. In each cohort,&#xD;
      10 volunteers will receive vaccine and 2 will receive placebo. Volunteers will be vaccinated&#xD;
      by intramuscular injection on days 0 and 120. The groups will be staggered such that adequate&#xD;
      safety evaluation can be performed prior to dose escalation. The duration of the study is 18&#xD;
      months per volunteer. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess and compare, in a&#xD;
      dose-escalating study, the safety and reactogenicity of the PpPfs25 and ScPvs25 transmission&#xD;
      blocking vaccines as compared to adjuvant alone; and to assess and compare, in&#xD;
      dose-escalating study, the duration of the antibody response over an 18 month period in each&#xD;
      volunteer as well as the effect of boosting with a second vaccination at 4 months.&#xD;
