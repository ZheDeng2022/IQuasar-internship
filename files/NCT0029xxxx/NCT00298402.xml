  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking causes an increase in inflammation in the lungs. In about 20% of smokers&#xD;
      this inflammation leads to damage in lungs including making holes in the lung tissue. This&#xD;
      damage can not be repaired and these people find it very difficult to breathe. One of the&#xD;
      problems with this disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD for short,&#xD;
      is that by the time patients visit their doctor with symptoms, the damage has already been&#xD;
      done. At the moment, there is no way to predict which smokers will go on to develop COPD. The&#xD;
      aim of this research is to look at smokers who breathe normally and use an imaging technique&#xD;
      called a CT scan, to look at their lungs in more detail. Some of these people will have spots&#xD;
      on their scan which may be caused by inflammation. We want to look at the cells at these&#xD;
      spots to see if they make more proteins and enzymes that cause lung damage when compared to&#xD;
      people that do not have these spots. We would then be able to predict which smokers are&#xD;
      likely to develop COPD and treat them early before they have damaged their lungs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD for short, will be 3rd biggest killer in the&#xD;
      world by 2020. The major cause of this disease is cigarette smoking, but only about 15-20% of&#xD;
      smokers will develop COPD. In this disease, the lung becomes damaged and patients can not&#xD;
      breathe properly. This damage can not be repaired therefore at the moment there are no good&#xD;
      treatements for COPD. By the time a patient visits their doctor with symptoms the damage is&#xD;
      already done. Therefore in this study we want to look at the lungs of smokers that feel well&#xD;
      and can breathe normally. We believe that much of the damage to the lung in COPD is caused by&#xD;
      inflammation. In particular, there are more inflammatory cells called macrophages in the&#xD;
      lungs of these patients. These macrophages normally protect the lung when we inhale particles&#xD;
      like dust and are also inportant to fight infections. In COPD, these macrophages are out of&#xD;
      control and produce huge amounts of enzymes that break down lung tissue and more proteins&#xD;
      that cause inflammation. We want to see if we can find these macrophages in the lungs of&#xD;
      smokers before they get COPD. Recently, a 5 and a half year study showed that some smokers&#xD;
      that can breathe normally have increased inflammation in their lungs. This can be seen using&#xD;
      a scan called a CT scan. On the CT scan, these areas look like spots. When these smokers had&#xD;
      another scan 5 and half years later, in some cases these spots had become holes in their&#xD;
      lung. This is called emphysema and is one of the characteristics of COPD. We want to know&#xD;
      whether the macrophages in these smokers cause this damage. If this is the case, we have two&#xD;
      separate findings from this study. Firstly, we could look at macrophages and predict which&#xD;
      smokers will develop COPD and secondly, try and develop new treatments to stop the&#xD;
      macrophages from producing all proteins that cause inflammation.&#xD;
