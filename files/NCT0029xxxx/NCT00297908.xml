  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethanol based hand sanitizers do not raise blood alcohol levels to a measurable amount. This&#xD;
      study will determine to what extent, if any, heavy use of ABHS changes blood alcohol levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ethanol continues to be the most frequently abused intoxicant in the United States.4 Drug&#xD;
      testing in various work environments has become commonplace during the past two decades and&#xD;
      will at times include blood, breath, or urine alcohol testing.5 While valid reasons for false&#xD;
      positive drug tests do occur, a plethora of unusual and dubious explanations have been&#xD;
      likewise tendered. Medical Review Officers (MRO) involved in evaluating such reports rely on&#xD;
      past case reports, knowledge of laboratory analytical techniques, and other scientific&#xD;
      evidence to validate or negate claims of drug use in the workplace. ABHS are now found in&#xD;
      most hospitals and health-care facilities.1,3 Only one human report of serum ethanol levels&#xD;
      following frequent clinical use of the ABHS has been reported.7 This finding of a negative&#xD;
      serum ethanol level in this case is likely to be reproducible in all clinical settings as the&#xD;
      physician attempted to simulate the most extreme use of the product that would be consistent&#xD;
      with labeling instructions. Since alcohol breathalyzer testing is based upon exhaled portions&#xD;
      of ethanol found within the blood stream, this method of testing would likely be negative as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be the investigators and associate investigators of the study, who are all&#xD;
      employees in the emergency department at Darnall Army Community Hospital. There will be no&#xD;
      financial reward offered. Consent will be obtained on all participants. The study will be&#xD;
      performed in the Darnall Emergency Department outside of regular duty hours. Enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will apply 5 ml of the product (62% denatured ethanol alcohol manufactured by&#xD;
      Kimberley-Clark) to both hands and rub until dry. This will be repeated 50 times over&#xD;
      approximately 4 hours. Participants will have their blood drawn prior to, as well as, after&#xD;
      completing the study. No other laboratory tests will be performed other than the alcohol&#xD;
      level. Pre study blood alcohol levels will be ordered to assure a pre-study level of 0 mg/dl.&#xD;
