      The purpose of the study is to compare histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone&#xD;
      deacetylase (HDAC) expressions and activities in induced sputum macrophages obtained from&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe COPD and age-matched normal non-smokers&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS) treatment, if exists, must be stopped for 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             the study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Long-acting beta2-agonists and theophylline need to be stopped at least 3 days before&#xD;
             run-in , but anti-cholinergics will be allowed throughout the study&#xD;
