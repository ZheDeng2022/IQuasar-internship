      A phase II double blind trial to evaluate the effects of the AMPA, glutamte antagonist,&#xD;
      topiramate on levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a proof-of-concept, Phase II, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial to assess the anti-dyskinetic properties of topiramate in&#xD;
      patients with PD and bothersome levodopa-induced dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive tablets of either placebo or topiramate in a&#xD;
      double-blind, crossover design using randomization tables. Following the completion of the&#xD;
      first arm of the study and the tapering and washout phases, patients will receive topiramate&#xD;
      or placebo in a crossover design for the same treatment duration. The dose of topiramate will&#xD;
      be slowly escalated twice each week as tolerated. If a patient cannot tolerate a higher dose,&#xD;
      the dose will be reduced to the previously tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments during each arm of the study will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigator-rated dyskinesia severity (Levodopa challenge): Anti-parkinsonian&#xD;
           medications will be held for 12 hours prior to testing. At the time of the assessment,&#xD;
           patients will receive the morning dose of either topiramate or placebo and their usual&#xD;
           morning levodopa dose. Patients will be videotaped prior to and following medication&#xD;
           administration, and dyskinesia severity will subsequently be rated by a blinded&#xD;
           investigator. Levodopa challenges will be conducted before each treatment arm (baseline)&#xD;
           and at the completion of each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject-rated dyskinesia severity: Dyskinesia severity will be rated by the patient&#xD;
           using several validated methods (Lang-Fahn Activities of Daily Living Dyskinesia scale,&#xD;
           Clinical Global Impression, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and home&#xD;
           dyskinesia diaries). Rating scales will be completed at the time of each levodopa&#xD;
           challenge and at 2-week intervals. Dyskinesia diaries will be completed for 3 days prior&#xD;
           to each levodopa challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of parkinsonism: Parkinsonian disability will be assessed using the UPDRS at&#xD;
           the baseline evaluation and at the completion of each treatment arm as well as at each&#xD;
           bi-weekly visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety and tolerability assessment: During the course of each titration phase, patients&#xD;
           will be assessed in the clinic at 2-week intervals, or sooner if indicated. A general&#xD;
           physical examination including blood pressure, pulse, and weight as well as detailed&#xD;
           questioning regarding possible adverse events and tolerability will be completed. The&#xD;
           Epworth Sleepiness Scale will be completed at each visit. Telephone contact will be made&#xD;
           on alternate weeks to assess for the occurrence of adverse events and to discuss&#xD;
           titration schedules. Patients will be able to reach a physician at all times via pager&#xD;
           in the event of difficulties encountered between scheduled contact times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for safety monitoring, laboratory tests including urinalysis, clinical&#xD;
      chemistries (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine), CBC with&#xD;
      differential, and liver function tests will be followed. These studies will be evaluated at&#xD;
      the beginning and end of each treatment arm and mid-way through each dose escalation phase. A&#xD;
      baseline EKG will be obtained, and repeat EKGs will be obtained at the completion of each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will aid in the development of a larger Phase III clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the proposed trial, information regarding the anti-dyskinetic efficacy of topiramate&#xD;
      will be obtained, and tolerability in the PD patient population will be determined.&#xD;
