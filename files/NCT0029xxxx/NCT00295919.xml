      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fenretinide LXS, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fenretinide LXS in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent, refractory, or persistent neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fenretinide (4-HPR) Lym-X-Sorb™ (LXS) oral&#xD;
           powder (4-HPR/LXS oral powder) in patients with recurrent, refractory, or persistent&#xD;
           neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the toxicities of 4-HPR/LXS oral powder in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of 4-HPR/LXS oral powder and its metabolites in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the tolerability of the combination of ketoconazole and 4-HPR/LXS oral powder&#xD;
           in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with 4-HPR/LXS oral powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the level of 4-HPR/LXS oral powder in normal peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
           cells (PBMC) as a tumor cell surrogate tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine plasma levels of 4-HPR/LXS oral powder when given in combination with&#xD;
           ketoconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether ketoconazole increases 4-HPR/LXS oral powder plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fenretinide (4-HPR) Lym-X-Sorb™ (LXS) oral&#xD;
      powder, followed by an open-label study. Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: Patients receive 4-HPR/LXS oral powder 3 times daily on days 0-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: Patients receive 4-HPR/LXS oral powder as in group I and oral ketoconazole&#xD;
           once daily on days 0-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete remission at study&#xD;
      enrollment may receive up to 12 courses (9 months) of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline and during courses 1, 2, and 6 for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for the dose-escalation portion and&#xD;
      36 will be accrued for the open-label portion of this study.&#xD;
