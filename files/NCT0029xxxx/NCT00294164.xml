  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of Serostim® (mammalian cell-derived recombinant human&#xD;
      growth hormone, r-hGH) versus placebo in subjects with human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus-associated adipose tissue redistribution syndrome (HARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine whether Serostim® treatment reduces adipose&#xD;
      tissue maldistribution more effectively than placebo. The primary co-endpoints are derived&#xD;
      from measures of visceral adipose tissue assessed by computerized tomography (CT) and the&#xD;
      ratio of trunk; and limb fat assessed by dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures, physical exams, quality of life assessments, serial photographs, and&#xD;
      various laboratory measures will be used to address secondary objectives. These secondary&#xD;
      objectives relate to the impact of Serostim® on Physician and subject assessments of change&#xD;
      in body shape, health-related quality of life, attitude towards medication compliance,&#xD;
      metabolic markers, fat redistribution, and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily Serostim®,&#xD;
      Serostim® and placebo given on alternate days, or daily placebo. Serostim® doses will be&#xD;
      based on body weight, with a maximum dose of 4 milligram (mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy will continue for 12 weeks. Treatment will then be altered and the new treatment will&#xD;
      be continued through Week 24. Interim Study Visits will be required at Weeks 2 and 4&#xD;
      (Treatment Period 1) and at Weeks 14 and 16 (Treatment Period 2). Subjects will be offered to&#xD;
      be enrolled into a maintenance Protocol (Study 23056) at Week 24.&#xD;
