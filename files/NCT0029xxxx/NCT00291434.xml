  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the value of two different altered fractionation&#xD;
      schedules - hyperfractionation and accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost - in&#xD;
      comparison with conventional fractionation in primary definitive radiotherapy for squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinomas of the larynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx. The study began and was conducted&#xD;
      while the only teletherapy unit in our department was the cobalt-60 machine. During that&#xD;
      period we were expecting the installation of new sophisticated equipment. We assumed that the&#xD;
      results of this study would be also able to show whether or not it would be rational to use&#xD;
      the altered fractionation regimens on the new machines.&#xD;

      Eligible patients admitted from March 1999 to December 2000 were treated with conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated radiotherapy. These patients represented the retrospective part of the study.&#xD;
      Patients admitted between January 2001 and June 2004 were included in the prospective part of&#xD;
      the study. Following the confirmation of their eligibility, altered fractionation schedule&#xD;
      assignment was made after stratifying by site of origin (larynx vs oropharynx vs&#xD;
      hypopharynx), Karnofsky performance score (60%-70% vs 80%-100%), and stage of disease (I and&#xD;
      II vs III and IV). Patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy delivered using either&#xD;
      hyperfractionation or accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost as a late accelerating&#xD;
      component. Exceptions occurred when patients either refused treatment with two daily&#xD;
      fractions or were not offered twice-a-day irradiation because of lack of machine time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Scheduling and Technique The conventionally fractionated radiotherapy schedule&#xD;
      was 66-70 Gy in 6Â½ -7 weeks (one fraction of 2 Gy per day, 5 fractions per week), whereas the&#xD;
      hyperfractionation treatment schedule was 74.4-79.2 Gy in 6.2-7 weeks (two fractions of 1.2&#xD;
      Gy per day, 10 fractions per week with interfraction interval of at least 6 hours; Figure 1).&#xD;
      The treatment schedule in accelerated fractionation using concomitant boost consisted of&#xD;
      daily fraction of 1.8 Gy, 5 days a week, up to 32.4 Gy including all sites of disease and&#xD;
      electively irradiated areas of the neck, followed by two daily fractions for the last 11-12&#xD;
      days. The first daily fraction encompassed all sites of the disease and electively irradiated&#xD;
      neck nodes using a dose of 1.8 Gy, and the second daily fraction was the concomitant boost&#xD;
      delivered through reduced fields to encompass the gross disease only, using a fraction of 1.5&#xD;
      Gy up to total doses of 68.7-72 Gy in 6 weeks (Figure 1). The interval between the two daily&#xD;
      fractions was at least 6 hours.&#xD;
