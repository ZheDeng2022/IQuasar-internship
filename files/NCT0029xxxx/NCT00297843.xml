  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic Rhinitis is an inflammatory disease which causes an influx of inflammatory cells and&#xD;
      cytokines into the nasal mucosa. These biomarkers can also be found in the nasal secretions.&#xD;
      The evaluation of these inflammatory biomarkers is of great interest as this could lead to a&#xD;
      concept of measuring the efficacy of anti-allergic treatments by assessing the changes in&#xD;
      nasal biomarkers after allergen challenge. To use this model as an assessment of&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics it is crucial to evaluate the specificity and reproducibility of cellular&#xD;
      and cytokine levels in the nasal secretions after allergen provocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 2 part repeated measurement design 20 patients with allergic rhinitis and 20 healthy&#xD;
      subjects will undergo two 4-hour pollen exposures in an interval of 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore the cellular and cytokine levels this allergen challenge&#xD;
      will induce in nasal secretions and to assess if an increase in those inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      is specific to the patient subgroup and whether the results are reproducible after the second&#xD;
      allergen challenge.&#xD;

             including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal with documented proof of&#xD;
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meet clinical criteria for menopause and have been&#xD;
             amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the screening visit).Of childbearing&#xD;
             potential and using an appropriate method of contraception (Oral contraceptive pill or&#xD;
             double barrier).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 &gt; 80% of predicted at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of any structural nasal abnormalities or nasal polyps on examination, a&#xD;
             history of frequent nose bleeding or recent nasal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of conditions or factors, which would make the subject unlikely to be able to&#xD;
             stay in the Fraunhofer ECC for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non smoker or smokers with a history of less than 10 pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available to complete all study measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with allergic rhinitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic rhinitis to grass pollen and a positive skin prick test for&#xD;
             Dactylis glomerata pollen at or within 12 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must exhibit a moderate response upon 4.000 Dactylis glomerata pollen&#xD;
             grains/m3 during 4 hours in the ECC on visit 2, which is defined as a Total Nasal&#xD;
             Symptom Score of at least 6. (TNSS is the sum of obstruction, rhinorrhea, itch, and&#xD;
             sneeze, each of which has been scored on a scale from 0 to 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with mild stable asthma that is controlled with occasional use of as-needed&#xD;
             short-acting beta-agonists and associated with normal lung function may be included&#xD;
