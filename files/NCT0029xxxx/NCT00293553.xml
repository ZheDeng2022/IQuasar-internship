  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical treatment of choice&#xD;
      for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis, ulcerative colitis with dysplasia&#xD;
      or cancer, and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis, an inflammatory&#xD;
      process of the ileal pouch, is the most common long-term complication. Increased stool&#xD;
      frequency, abdominal pain, and pelvic discomfort are suggestive of pouchitis, approximately&#xD;
      40% of patients with these symptoms have no or minimal inflammation of the pouch or rectal&#xD;
      cuff on endoscopy and histopathology. These patients have a condition resembling irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS), which we termed the irritable pouch syndrome (IPS). The RATIONALE and&#xD;
      FEASIBILITY for the proposed study are: 1) IPS occurs in a substantial number of patients&#xD;
      with IPAA, significantly affecting the quality of life. However, IPS is rare in the general&#xD;
      population, and is considered an orphan disease. Studies such as those we propose can only be&#xD;
      conducted in centers with a large number of patients with IPAA. The Cleveland Clinic has&#xD;
      maintained the world's largest ileal pouch registry, with a total of more the 2,500 patients;&#xD;
      2) a series of investigations on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with inflammatory or&#xD;
      functional diseases of IPS, notably the initial study of IPS, have been conducted by our&#xD;
      team; 3) In contrast to IBS, the pathophysiology and treatment of IPS have not been studied.&#xD;
      Our HYPOTHESES are that 1) similar to IBS, visceral hypersensitivity may play a role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of IPS, and 2) amitriptyline, a safe and effective agent for patients with IBS,&#xD;
      will be more effective than placebo in alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with IPS. The AIMS of the study are to 1) investigate visceral hypersensitivity&#xD;
      using barostat examination of the pouch; 2) conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial evaluating the use of amitriptyline in IPS.&#xD;
