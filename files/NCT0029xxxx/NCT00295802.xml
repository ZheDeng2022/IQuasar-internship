  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the substantial equivalence of the Ablatherm high&#xD;
      intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as compared to cryotherapy for the treatment of low risk,&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypothesis of this clinical investigation is that HIFU with the Ablatherm Integrated&#xD;
      Imaging is non-inferior to minimally invasive cryosurgery as an effective treatment method&#xD;
      for low risk, localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
