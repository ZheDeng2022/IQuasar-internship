      Objectives: To determine whether people systematically misremember the &quot;myths&quot; (false&#xD;
      information) as true, and to assess effects on perceptions of risk and behavioral intentions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Public information campaigns often warn people about false and unreliable medical claims by&#xD;
      juxtaposing &quot;myths&quot; and &quot;facts.&quot; The effectiveness of such communications has rarely been&#xD;
      assessed. We assessed whether people systematically misremember the &quot;myths&quot; (false&#xD;
      information) as true, and to assess effects on perceptions of risk and behavioral intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an experimental study, participants read either a published CDC flyer on &quot;Facts and Myths&quot;&#xD;
      about the flu vaccine, or a &quot;Facts Only&quot; version; a separate control group read no flyer.&#xD;
      Participants completed the outcome measures either immediately or after 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measures were memory for information about the flu presented in the flyer, ratings of&#xD;
      perceived risks associated with the flu, and personal intentions to get vaccinated in the&#xD;
      upcoming season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a delay of 30 minutes, participants who read the &quot;Facts and Myths&quot; flyer systematically&#xD;
      misremembered myths as facts. Both versions of the flyer had the immediate effect of&#xD;
      increasing intentions to get a flu vaccine, compared to the control group. After 30 minutes,&#xD;
      however, participants who read the &quot;Facts and Myths&quot; flyer reported lower intentions to get&#xD;
      vaccinated, compared to those who read the same flyer with no delay, and compared to all&#xD;
      participants who read the &quot;Facts Only&quot; flyer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, people show a bias to think that incompletely remembered information is true, turning&#xD;
      &quot;myths&quot; into &quot;facts.&quot; Hence public information campaigns should emphasize information that is&#xD;
      true. Repeating false information, even as a warning, can create the unintended consequence&#xD;
      of belief in the information.&#xD;
