  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review patients with E. coli infections at UPMC from January&#xD;
      1, 2004 to December 31, 2005 to determine if these infections have arisen in the community&#xD;
      rather than in hospitals or nursing homes. The occurrence of such resistant isolates could be&#xD;
      devastating if they were associated with bloodstream infection, such as sometimes accompanies&#xD;
      urinary tract infection, since antibiotic resistant E. coli is not suspected in isolates&#xD;
      coming from the community.&#xD;

      The following variables will be followed: age, sex, hospital location at the time of positive&#xD;
      culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), prior hospitalization or nursing home admission, receipt&#xD;
      of outpatient dialysis or other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence&#xD;
      of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including their type and whether they were&#xD;
      adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures.&#xD;

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic&#xD;
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To&#xD;
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and&#xD;
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples&#xD;
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected&#xD;
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ll patients with E. coli infections during the time period of the study will be&#xD;
             reviewed. A community-associated E. coli isolate will be defined as one which was&#xD;
             recovered from a clinical culture from a patient at UPMC-P who had no established risk&#xD;
             factors for infection with an antibiotic resistant organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Established risk factors are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolation of the organism two or more days after admission for hospitalization OR A&#xD;
             history of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term care&#xD;
             facility within one year before the culture date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR The presence of an indwelling catheter or percutaneous medical device (eg,&#xD;
             tracheostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, or Foley catheter) at the time of the culture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR Previous isolation of an antibiotic resistant organism&#xD;
