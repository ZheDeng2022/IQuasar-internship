      A phase II double blind clinical trial investigating the effects of ipratropium spray versus&#xD;
      placebo spray in patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

      Background: Excessive drooling of saliva (sialorrhoea) is a common complication of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately current medications, which rely on anticholinergic&#xD;
      properties, often induce systemic side effects, such as confusion, hallucinations or urinary&#xD;
      retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: We therefore hypothesise that local application of an anticholinergic aerosol spray into&#xD;
      the mouth would reduce sialorrhea in PD without inducing systemic side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of the muscarinic&#xD;
      antagonist, ipratropium bromide in patients with bothersome drooling in idiopathic&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. All patients are recruited from the Movement Disorders Clinic, Toronto&#xD;
      Western Hospital and informed consent is obtained. Patients are randomised to receive&#xD;
      ipratropium bromide, 1- 2 metered doses (sprays) of active drug (21 micorgram per metered&#xD;
      dose) or matching placebo, up to a maximum of 4 times per day, in a double-blind, cross-over&#xD;
      design using randomisation tables. Total treatment length is two weeks for each limb of the&#xD;
      study with a 1-2 week wash out period. The primary outcome measure is an objective measure of&#xD;
      saliva production. Dental rolls are inserted into the mouth for 5 min and the patient&#xD;
      instructed not to swallow and sit upright. The weight of dental rolls before and after&#xD;
      insertion is calculated as a measure of saliva production. The secondary outcome measures are&#xD;
      subjective measure of saliva where patients or caregivers record the level of saliva&#xD;
      production each day for the 2 weeks of each treatment using validated subjective rating&#xD;
      scales which assess drooling severity and frequency. In addition, parkinsonism is rated using&#xD;
      the UPDRS parts I - IV and adverse events are recorded. The scores for measured saliva&#xD;
      production following ipratropium bromide and placebo treatment will be compared using&#xD;
      appropriate paired t-tests. Results from the scales assessing the subjective measures of&#xD;
      saliva production and UPDRS ratings will be compared via paired non-parametric Wilcoxon&#xD;
      matched pairs test. 20 patients will be recruited.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Male and female patients with idiopathic PD and who are currently&#xD;
        experiencing bothersome drooling (United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) item 6,&#xD;
        rating of 2 or higher) will be eligible for this study. Patients must be on a stable&#xD;
        medication regimen for the preceding one-month run-in period. In addition, patients or a&#xD;
        caregiver must be able to complete a daily record card, and patients must be able to&#xD;
        tolerate an oral dental roll for 5-minute periods for saliva measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, cholinergic agents, or anticholinergic&#xD;
        agents, history of glaucoma, clinically significant urinary outflow obstruction or urinary&#xD;
        retention, active psychosis or hallucinations, and allergy to peanuts or soybeans. -&#xD;
