      This will be a prospective randomized double-blinded parallel group clinical trial evaluating&#xD;
      the short-term effects of theophylline therapy on exercise duration and lung function in&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease already receiving both tiotropium and a&#xD;
      long-acting beta-agonist (salmeterol or formoterol).&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study is to assess the effects of 4 weeks of theophylline&#xD;
      therapy on exercise performance and lung function in patients with COPD already receiving&#xD;
      combination inhaled long-acting bronchodilator therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest Canadian COPD guidelines recommend the use of long-acting bronchodilators in&#xD;
      patients who continue to experience symptoms despite as-needed use of short-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilators. Unfortunately, patients with severe COPD may continue to experience symptoms&#xD;
      despite use of both long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics. For these patients, the&#xD;
      Canadian guidelines recommend a trial of theophylline. Studies have shown that theophylline&#xD;
      can reduce symptoms and improve exercise performance, however, the use of theophylline is&#xD;
      limited by its narrow therapeutic window and multiple drug interactions. Despite&#xD;
      recommendations, it remains unknown whether theophylline provides any additional benefit for&#xD;
      COPD patients already receiving combined long-acting bronchodilator therapy. No study has&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of theophylline in patients already receiving both long-acting&#xD;
      beta-agonist and long-acting anticholinergic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized double-blinded parallel group clinical trial evaluating&#xD;
      the short-term effects of theophylline therapy on exercise duration and lung function in&#xD;
      patients already receiving both tiotropium and a long-acting beta-agonist (salmeterol or&#xD;
      formoterol). Twenty-four patients with moderate to severe COPD who are already using&#xD;
      tiotropium and long-acting beta agonists will be randomized to receive either: a) 4 weeks of&#xD;
      oral theophylline dosed to achieve therapeutic blood levels, or b) 4 weeks of identical&#xD;
      placebo therapy. Only patients with stable COPD (no exacerbations nor changes in medications&#xD;
      over the last 2 months) and no contraindications to exercise testing or theophylline use will&#xD;
      be enrolled. All patients will undergo baseline pulmonary function testing and incremental&#xD;
      and constant load exercise testing prior to randomization. PFTs and constant load exercise&#xD;
      testing will be repeated after 4 weeks of therapy. Patients will be instructed to report&#xD;
      adverse events and will have their theophylline dose adjusted to ensure therapeutic bloods&#xD;
      levels (55-110 umol/L), prior to repeat testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of interest will be the effect of theophylline on exercise duration&#xD;
      during constant load (75% maximum) exercise testing. The study will be powered to detect a&#xD;
      20% greater improvement in exercise duration for the theophylline-treated group. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will include changes in spirometry (FEV1) and lung volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise duration (on constant load exercise testing) was chosen as the primary endpoint of&#xD;
      this study because it has been shown to be a reproducible and highly responsive measure for&#xD;
      physiologic benefit in COPD. It is unknown whether theophylline will provide any additional&#xD;
      increase in exercise duration, when added to a combined long-acting bronchodilator regimen.&#xD;
      If an improvement is found with theophylline, a follow-up study of larger size and longer&#xD;
      duration will be required to investigate whether this benefit will translate into&#xD;
      improvements in clinical outcomes such as quality of life or frequency of exacerbations.&#xD;
      Alternatively, if no improvement can be detected, the current COPD treatment recommendation&#xD;
      should be re-evaluated.&#xD;

&#xD;
        clinically stable (no exacerbations nor changes in medications over the previous two&#xD;
        months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        taking tiotropium 18ug qd and either salmeterol 50ug bid or formoterol 12 ug bid (the use&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lung disease other than COPD (e.g: asthma, interstitial lung disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-pulmonary comorbidity that may potentially limit exercise capacity (e.g: cardiac&#xD;
        disease, arthritis) or be exacerbated by theophylline use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of adverse response to theophylline or condition that may increase likelihood of&#xD;
        adverse reaction with theophylline (cardiac disease, liver disease, renal impairment,&#xD;
        thyroid disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of theophylline over last two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of a medication that may potentially interact with theophylline (e.g. warfarin,&#xD;
        digoxin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients currently enrolled (or scheduled to be enrolled) in a pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
        program will not be accepted until after completion of the program (as this may potentially&#xD;
        affect exercise performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of systemic corticosteroid therapy (this may affect peripheral muscle function)&#xD;
