  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders characterized by lack of coordination in the muscles,&#xD;
      loss of movement, and speech disturbances. These disorders are caused by injuries to the&#xD;
      brain that occur during fetal development or near the time of birth. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the effects of high frequency, low magnitude vibration on bone and&#xD;
      muscle in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extent of bone mass built up during childhood and adolescence is the most important&#xD;
      determinant of osteoporosis later in life. Some disabled children, such as those with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy, are particularly vulnerable to low bone mass accumulation due to decreased&#xD;
      mobility and weight-bearing. These children also have poor muscle strength and control, which&#xD;
      limits function and contributes to the lack of mechanical stimulation needed to build bone&#xD;
      mass. The most common treatment for these children is physical therapy, which is time- and&#xD;
      labor-intensive and may not be adequately available to them. Whole body vibration has shown&#xD;
      promise as an alternative method for stimulating increases in bone mass and improvements in&#xD;
      muscle. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of high frequency, low magnitude&#xD;
      vibration on bone and muscle in children with cerebral palsy. This intervention may be useful&#xD;
      as a noninvasive, nonpharmacological treatment for low bone mass and poor muscle function in&#xD;
      these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 1 year. All participants will visit the hospital 3 times, at study entry&#xD;
      and Months 6 and 12. At each visit, height and weight will be measured, muscle strength and&#xD;
      balance will be tested, and bones and muscles in the spine and lower leg will be imaged with&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT), a special x-ray machine. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups. For this study, all participants will be asked to stand for 10 minutes&#xD;
      every day for 1 year. For Group 1, a vibrating platform will be used for the 10-minute&#xD;
      standing sessions during the first half of the study but not during the second half of the&#xD;
      study. For Group 2, this will be reversed and the vibrating platform will not be used during&#xD;
      the first half of the study but will be used during the second half of the study.&#xD;
