  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine the rate of major bleeding and blood clots when using&#xD;
      enoxaparin as a bridge to oral blood thinning medication in patients who have undergone&#xD;
      mechanical valve replacement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo mechanical heart valve replacement are usually placed on long-term oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation (blood thinning) medication to prevent blood clots from forming on the&#xD;
      mechanical valve. This is started in the hospital with intravenous unfractionated heparin;&#xD;
      patients must remain in the hospital while on unfractionated heparin. At the same time, an&#xD;
      oral blood thinner is started (warfarin). This process is commonly referred to as &quot;bridging.&quot;&#xD;
      Once the warfarin reaches the proper level, the intravenous heparin is stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, non-randomized pilot study using twice a day enoxaparin injections&#xD;
      in place of unfractionated heparin as a bridge to warfarin therapy. A total of approximately&#xD;
      100 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be instructed how to give the enoxaparin&#xD;
      injections at home. Blood will be drawn every 1-2 days to monitor warfarin levels. Once&#xD;
      discharged, patients will continue to have their blood level checked until warfarin is at the&#xD;
      correct level, at which point enoxaparin will be discontinued. All patients who develop signs&#xD;
      or symptoms of a stroke or abnormal blood clotting will be asked to return for an&#xD;
      echocardiogram. An echocardiogram and 12-lead ECG will be done at approximately 30 days after&#xD;
      the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the first 100 consecutive patients who fit the inclusion criteria but do not&#xD;
      consent to the enoxaparin strategy will be asked to enter a registry that will monitor their&#xD;
      hospital stay and information from their routine 30 day follow-up visit will be collected.&#xD;
