    <textblock>
      Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a developmental disorder that is caused by a deficiency of a&#xD;
      maternally transmitted gene. It is inherited at birth, and affects movement, speech, and&#xD;
      social demeanor. This study will gain a better understanding of the disease progression and&#xD;
      clinical features of AS by observing children with AS over an extended period of time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AS is a developmental disorder that affects movement, speech, and social demeanor. The&#xD;
      disorder is caused by a deficiency of a maternally transmitted gene and is inherited at&#xD;
      birth. Children with AS, however, are often not diagnosed until they are between 3 and 7&#xD;
      years old. Symptoms of AS may include, but are not limited to, functionally severe&#xD;
      developmental delay; speech impairments; movement or balance problems; and behavioral&#xD;
      uniqueness, including any combination of frequent laughter or smiling, apparent happy&#xD;
      demeanor, easily excitable personality, hand flapping movements, and short attention span.&#xD;
      There are four molecular variations of AS, but past clinical studies have been inconsistent&#xD;
      in highlighting the phenotypic differences between them. This study will gain a better&#xD;
      understanding of the disease progression and clinical features of AS by observing children&#xD;
      with AS over a period of 5 to 10 years. The study will also attempt to establish&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations, which might aid in future clinical care of AS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this observational study will be limited to current or future patients at&#xD;
      one of the five study sites. A clinical evaluation will be performed at baseline, including a&#xD;
      general patient history, physical and neurological examinations, a nutritional assessment,&#xD;
      neuro-imaging, electroencephalography, laboratory testing, and neurodevelopmental testing. A&#xD;
      blood sample or mucosal sample will also be taken at baseline to acquire DNA for potential&#xD;
      genetic testing. All assessments except the neuro-imaging, electroencephalography, and blood&#xD;
      sampling will be repeated at yearly study visits for as long as funding can be secured. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will be photographed and perhaps videotaped on a yearly basis in order&#xD;
      to document clinical phenotypes and any neurologic abnormalities. Participants may be&#xD;
      followed-up for a total of 10 years.&#xD;
