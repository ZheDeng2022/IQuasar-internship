  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis by comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
      cyanoacrylate injection (GVO) and band ligation (GVL) in the treatment of acute GVH in liver&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients with or without concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric variceal hemorrhage (GVH) has a poorer prognosis than esophageal variceal hemorrhage.&#xD;
      However, data on its optimal treatment are limited. We designed a prospective study to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of endoscopic band ligation (GVL) and endoscopic N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate&#xD;
      injection (GVO). Liver cirrhotic patients with or without concomitant hepatocelluar carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) and patients presenting with acute GVH were randomized into two treatment groups.&#xD;
      Forty-eight patients received GVL, and another 49 patients received GVO. Both treatments were&#xD;
      equally successful in controlling active bleeding (14/15 vs. 14/15, P = 1.000). More of the&#xD;
      patients who underwent GVL had GV rebleeding (GVL vs. GVO, 21/48 vs. 11/49; P = .044). The&#xD;
      2-year and 3-year cumulative rate of GV rebleeding were 63.1% (95% confidence interval [CI],&#xD;
      44.5%-81.7%), 72.3% (95% CI, 51.3%-93.3%) for GVL and 26.8% (95% CI, 12.5%-41.1%), 26.8% (95%&#xD;
      CI, 12.5%-41.1%) for GVO; P = .0143, log-rank test. The rebleeding risk of GVL sustained&#xD;
      throughout the entire follow-up period. Multivariate Cox regression indicated that&#xD;
      concomitance with HCC (relative hazard: 2.453, 95% CI: 1.036-5.806, P = .041) and the&#xD;
      treatment method (GVL vs. GVO, relative hazard: 2.660, 95% CI: 1.167-6.061, P = .020) were&#xD;
      independent factors predictive of GV rebleeding. There was no difference in survival between&#xD;
      the two groups. Severe complications due to these two treatments were rare. In conclusion,&#xD;
      the efficacy of GVL to control active GVH appears to have no difference with GVO, but GVO is&#xD;
      associated with a lower GV rebleeding rate.&#xD;
