  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-ranging, Phase I-II study in 600 healthy&#xD;
      adults, 18 to 49 years old, is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      dose-related immunogenicity of an investigational inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine&#xD;
      when given alone or combined with aluminum hydroxide. A secondary goal is to guide selection&#xD;
      of vaccine dosage levels for expanded Phase II trials based on reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity profiles. This dose optimization will be applied to both younger and older&#xD;
      subject populations in subsequent studies. Subjects who meet the entry criteria for the study&#xD;
      will be enrolled at one of 4 study sites and will be randomized into one of 8 groups to&#xD;
      receive 2 doses of influenza A/H5N1 vaccine containing 3.75, 7.5, 15, or 45 mcg of HA with or&#xD;
      without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant by intramuscular injection. Participants may be involved&#xD;
      in study related procedures for up to 8 months.&#xD;

      This randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-ranging, Phase I/II study in healthy&#xD;
      adults, 18 to 49 years old, is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      dose-related immunogenicity of an investigational inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine&#xD;
      when given alone or combined with aluminum hydroxide. The primary objectives are to:&#xD;
      determine the dose-related safety of subvirion-inactivated H5N1 vaccine adjuvanted with&#xD;
      aluminum hydroxide in healthy adults; determine the potential for aluminum hydroxide to&#xD;
      enhance the immune response to subvirion-inactivated H5N1 vaccine in healthy adults&#xD;
      approximately 1 month following receipt of 2 doses of vaccine; and provide information for&#xD;
      the selection of the best dosage level for further studies. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate dose-related immunogenicity and the percent of subjects responding approximately 1&#xD;
      and 7 months after the first vaccination. This dose optimization will be applied to both&#xD;
      younger and older subject populations in subsequent studies. Subjects who meet the entry&#xD;
      criteria for the study will be randomized into 8 groups to receive 2 doses of influenza&#xD;
      A/H5N1 vaccine containing 3.75, 7.5, 15, or 45 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) with or without&#xD;
      aluminum hydroxide adjuvant by intramuscular (IM) injection (N=60 or 120/vaccine dose group).&#xD;
      The first vaccination will occur on Day 0. Symptoms and signs will be assessed in the clinic&#xD;
      for at least 15 minutes after inoculation, and the subjects will maintain a memory aid to&#xD;
      record oral temperature and systemic and local adverse events (AEs) for 7 days after each&#xD;
      immunization. Subjects will be encouraged to take their temperature around the same time each&#xD;
      day. All subjects will return to the clinic 2 days and 8 days after each vaccination for&#xD;
      assessment of adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications and targeted physical&#xD;
      examination (if indicated). Memory aids will be reviewed at each visit. Approximately Day 28&#xD;
      after the first vaccination, subjects will return to the clinic for blood sample collection&#xD;
      and safety follow-up, followed by a second vaccination. Approximately 56 days after first&#xD;
      immunization (or about 28 days after the second vaccination), subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for immunogenicity blood sample collection, AE and concomitant medication assessment,&#xD;
      and targeted physical examination (if indicated). At approximately Day 208 (7 months after&#xD;
      the first vaccination), subjects will return to the clinic for a final immunogenicity blood&#xD;
      sample collection and for follow-up (which includes a targeted physical examination [if&#xD;
      indicated]). Blood samples collected prior to each vaccination and on Days 56 and 208 after&#xD;
      the first vaccination will be tested in a central laboratory for the levels of neutralizing&#xD;
      and HAI antibodies. The primary outcome measures will be the frequencies and severities of&#xD;
      AEs in each group and the proportions of subjects who achieve a serum neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titer of greater than or equal to 1:40 against the influenza A/H5N1 virus on Day 56. Serum&#xD;
      HAI and neutralizing antibody responses (including frequencies of 4 fold or greater rise in&#xD;
      titers; geometric mean titers; and proportions of subjects achieving putative protective&#xD;
      titers of neutralizing antibody 1 month after each dose of vaccine and 7 months after first&#xD;
      dose) also will be assessed. Although the correlate of protection for infections caused by&#xD;
      influenza A/H5N1 viruses in humans is unknown, a serum neutralizing antibody titer of greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 1:40 may be considered protective, based on limited data regarding the&#xD;
      levels of serum neutralizing antibody present in serum samples collected from humans who&#xD;
      survived infections caused by influenza A/H5N1 viruses. This study is linked to DMID protocol&#xD;
      07-0022.&#xD;
