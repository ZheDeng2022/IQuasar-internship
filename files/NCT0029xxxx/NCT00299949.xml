  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the 13th most common cause of death in the United States, causing approximately&#xD;
      210,000 deaths per year. Once DIC has developed, irreversible organ injury has already&#xD;
      occurred and the mortality rate is 70%. Inhibition of systemic coagulation with activated&#xD;
      protein C concentrate has been the only therapy for sepsis introduced in the past several&#xD;
      decades which has improved outcomes. Elucidation of the coagulopathic mechanisms early in the&#xD;
      development of DIC may give rise to targeted therapies and strategies for early intervention.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that an increase in endogenous thrombin potential precedes the development of&#xD;
      overt DIC by a clinically significant time period. Our primary objective is to determine if&#xD;
      endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) measured at first diagnosis of sepsis prior to the onset&#xD;
      of DIC and organ failure is predictive of overt DIC and/or poor outcome. We will compare ETP&#xD;
      to standard coagulation assays and the clinical assessment of DIC using the ISTH criteria for&#xD;
      overt DIC. A secondary objective of this study is to determine if host coagulation variables&#xD;
      predispose to the development of DIC and poor clinical outcome during sepsis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Activation of the coagulation system occurs early in patients with sepsis, although&#xD;
      clinically overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is identified in only a&#xD;
      minority of patients with severe sepsis. Uncontrolled activation of the coagulation system&#xD;
      may contribute to the pathophysiology of multiple organ failure and the subsequent morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality of sepsis. Identification of risk factors predicting progression to severe&#xD;
      sepsis and DIC has been elusive. We propose that whole blood and cell-rich coagulation assays&#xD;
      will offer improved sensitivity to both the procoagulant and anti-coagulant changes which&#xD;
      occur early in sepsis and will improve recognition of non-overt DIC. Future studies will&#xD;
      address whether these assays have sufficiently high predictive value to identify subgroups of&#xD;
      patients who could benefit from early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We hypothesize that increased thrombin generation will precede development of overt DIC&#xD;
           by a clinically significant time period. Our primary objective is to determine if&#xD;
           endogenous thrombin potential measured at first diagnosis of sepsis prior to the onset&#xD;
           of DIC and organ failure is predictive of overt DIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is significant individual variation among the healthy population in endogenous&#xD;
           thrombin generation due to known and unknown polymorphisms within coagulation proteins.&#xD;
           We predict that host variables in thrombin generation will contribute to susceptibility&#xD;
           to DIC and poor outcome during sepsis. A secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
           determine if host coagulation variables predispose to the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
           associated with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be a prospective observational study of patients presenting to the&#xD;
      Memorial Hermann Hospital Emergency Department with sepsis. Criteria for sepsis include&#xD;
      evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome as defined by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus&#xD;
      Conference, and a known or suspected infection. Exclusion criteria include signs of severe&#xD;
      sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference, at presentation,&#xD;
      including: organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion and perfusion abnormalities. Chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions associated with immune suppression or coagulopathies, such as neutropenia and&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and use of medications leading to immune dysfunction or coagulopathies,&#xD;
      such as chronic steroid use or anti-coagulation will also be reasons for exclusion. In&#xD;
      addition, because of the volume of blood required from each patient for laboratory studies,&#xD;
      only patients 25 kg body weight or more will be enrolled. Withdrawal from the study will be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the treating physician or subject. All efforts will be made to collect&#xD;
      clinical information from patients who have withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in the emergency department within 2 hours of meeting eligibility.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from the patients or their authorized&#xD;
      representatives. Blood samples will be collected by peripheral venipuncture during the first&#xD;
      hour after enrollment and then once daily for 7 days (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be withdrawn from the study if blood sampling is not performed within 2 hours&#xD;
      of obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data collection Clinical data forms (see Appendix B) will be completed at the time&#xD;
      of enrollment and daily for 7 days , at hospital discharge, and at 28 days. Clinicians will&#xD;
      be blinded to the results of the research laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and plasma Each patient will have 15 ml blood collected at enrollment. Specimens will&#xD;
      be obtained through antecubital venipuncture. Free flow or minimal suction will be employed;&#xD;
      vacuum containers will be avoided. Specimens for platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and whole blood&#xD;
      analysis will be collected into siliconized glass tubes with 0.105M tri-sodium citrate in the&#xD;
      ratio of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood. PPP will be separated within 60 minutes&#xD;
      and analyzed immediately. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) specimens will be separated from the&#xD;
      upper Â¾ volume of plasma supernatant after centrifugation at 265g for 10 minutes at room&#xD;
      temperature. The platelets will be counted on a Beckman Coulter counter and adjusted to 150 X&#xD;
      109 platelets/l with autologous PPP. PRP will be used within 60 minutes. Cbc, PT/PTT,&#xD;
      Fibrinogen, d-dimer, Protein C activity, Protein S activity, ATIII activity, Factor V Leiden&#xD;
      mutation, Prothrombin G20210A mutation analysis will be performed in Memorial Herman Hospital&#xD;
      clinical laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RoTEG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood specimens will be drawn as described above. Measurements will be performed on two&#xD;
      roTEG Coagulation Analyzers from Pentapharm. RoTEG all-plastic reaction cups are procured&#xD;
      from the manufacturer. Polypropylene and polyethylene pipettes are used to handle reagents&#xD;
      and blood. Citrated whole blood will be re-calcified by 20 mcl 0.2 mol/L CaCl2 and activated&#xD;
      by 20 mcl solution of recombinant human TF (Innovin) diluted 1:1000 using a sodium barbital&#xD;
      buffer. The measured parameters have been defined by the manufacturer as follows: The&#xD;
      clotting time(CT) is the time in seconds from Ca2+ activation of coagulation and until an&#xD;
      increase in elasticity corresponding to 2 graphical mm is obtained on the ordinate. The clot&#xD;
      formation time (CFT) is the time in seconds passing while the elasticity increases from 2 mm&#xD;
      to 20 mm on the ordinate. The maximum clot formation (MCF) expresses the maximum strength in&#xD;
      millimeters of the final clot. Several additional parameters representing the continuous&#xD;
      registration of clot formation have been defined by Sorensen et al 28: the maximum velocity&#xD;
      (MaxVel) of clot formation, the time to maximum velocity (T,MaxVel) of clot formation, and&#xD;
      the area under the velocity curve (AUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombin Generation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibrated automated thrombin generation measurements will be performed using the Hemker&#xD;
      methodology. 29 Platelet rich plasma (PRP) will be prepared as described above. Fluorogenic&#xD;
      substrate and chromogenic thrombin will be purchased through Thermolabsystems, and&#xD;
      recombinant relipidated tissue factor(TF) through Dade Behring. alpha 2&#xD;
      macroglobulin-thrombin complex used as a calibrator will be purchased through&#xD;
      Thrombolabsystems. The thrombograms will be measured in a 96-well plate fluorometer (Ascent&#xD;
      reader, Thrombolabsystems) and analyzed with software purchased through Thrombinoscope.&#xD;
      Experiments will be carried out in quadruplicate and compared to a calibrator. To each well&#xD;
      80 mcl of plasma will be added, followed by the calibrator or buffer, then the &quot;trigger&quot;: 20&#xD;
      mcl of 3 mM of TF. The plate will be placed in the fluorometer and allowed to warm to 37 C.&#xD;
      The instrument dispenses 20 mcl of Fluorogenic substrate 2.5 mM and CaCl2 100 mM (FluCa) to&#xD;
      all the wells to be measured, registers this as zero time, shakes them for 10 s and starts&#xD;
      reading. During the measurement, the program compares the readings from the TG and the CL,&#xD;
      calculates thrombin concentration and displays the thrombin concentration in time. The peak&#xD;
      thrombin is the highest thrombin concentration reached during the time course of thrombin&#xD;
      formation and inhibition. The thrombin potential is the amount of thrombin that is formed&#xD;
      within 60 minutes (Area under the curve). The lag phase and the peak time refer to the start&#xD;
      and velocity of thrombin formation, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Data will be collected on paper forms which will be designed by the GCRC&#xD;
      informatics core section. The GCRC informatics core will maintain data on a secure database&#xD;
      (Access). Each subject will be assigned a unique ID reflecting the order in which enrollment&#xD;
      took place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study intended to provide the preliminary data for future clinical studies.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize ETP and roTEG at initial presentation of&#xD;
      sepsis. Means and ranges will be reported for each of the variables in the thrombin&#xD;
      generation assay (lag time, slope of rise, peak value, and area under the curve) and roTEG&#xD;
      (Clot formation time (CFT), maximum clot formation (MCF), maximum velocity (MaxVel) of clot&#xD;
      formation, time to maximum velocity (T,MaxVel) of clot formation, and area under the velocity&#xD;
      curve (AUC)). The primary objective of this study is to compare ETP at presentation to the&#xD;
      development of DIC, as defined by a positive ISTH DIC score. The secondary objective will be&#xD;
      to compare host coagulation variables, including ETP, roTEG, Pro C, Pro S, ATIII, FVL, and&#xD;
      prothrombin G20210A mutation at presentation, with the secondary outcome measures of 28-day&#xD;
      mortality and organ dysfunction. All statistics will be performed using NCSS/PASS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination: There are no published reports of thrombin generation assays or&#xD;
      thromboelastography in sepsis, or DIC. In our previous studies of patients taking an&#xD;
      anticoagulant (warfarin), there was a 400% decrement of ETP (1719 to 404). In order to derive&#xD;
      a mean ETP with a target width of 100 and 95% confidence interval, assuming a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 259, we will need to enroll 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will employ the following statistical methods for the analysis of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is the area under the curve of the&#xD;
      thrombin generation assay. The values are continuous and range from 0 to 2,500. Maximum clot&#xD;
      formation (MCF) from the roTEG will also be used to approximate ETP. The DIC score will be&#xD;
      calculated and coded as a dichotomous variable: Yes (score &gt; 5) or No (score &lt; 5). A receiver&#xD;
      operating curve will be derived for ETP and MCT and its sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      predicting DIC. If the area under the curve is found to be significant, an optimal cut-off&#xD;
      value with the highest degree of accuracy will be chosen. This value will be used to estimate&#xD;
      the predictive value of the test. Positive predictive value will be calculated with the&#xD;
      formula: # patients with ETP or MCT above the cut-off and development of DIC / # patients&#xD;
      with positive DIC score. The predictive value of a negative DIC score will be calculated&#xD;
      using the formula: # patients with ETP or MCT below the cut-off and no progression to DIC / #&#xD;
      patients with negative DIC score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: A multivariate analysis will be done to determine which of the predictor&#xD;
      variables (ETP, MCT, Pro C, Pro S, ATIII, FVL, ProG20210A, DIC) are associated with the&#xD;
      secondary dichotomous outcome measures: organ dysfunction at 28 days (Any/None), 28-day&#xD;
      mortality (Dead/Alive).&#xD;
