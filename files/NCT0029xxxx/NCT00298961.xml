  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study we will aim to examine the issues of cost analysis, quality of life, clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and satisfaction of psychiatric consultations through videoconference in a primary&#xD;
      care setting in comparison with in-person psychiatric treatment and primary care only. The&#xD;
      main hypotheses of the study are: Satisfaction of the patients will increase, the use of&#xD;
      telepsychiatry will reduce the costs for the primary and mental health care centers as well&#xD;
      as for the patients, the treatment will be as effective as in-person treatment, the number of&#xD;
      patients referred to mental health treatment will be higher than that of the previous year,&#xD;
      quality of life will improve and that there will be a stigma reduction of mental illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telepsychiatry, as a method which utilizes videoconferencing as a means for consultation,&#xD;
      examination and treatment of patients as a substitute for in-person treatment has been in use&#xD;
      now for over 40 years. With telepsychiatry there is an attempt to deal with the issues of&#xD;
      providing service to patients who reside at a considerable distance from the mental health&#xD;
      facilities or that conversely do not call for mental health services for other diverse&#xD;
      reasons such as loss of work days, social stigma, travel expenses and so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Israel, mental health services are provided to 1.5% of the population whereas the&#xD;
      incidence in other developed countries is significantly higher, reaching 3-5%, while the&#xD;
      prevalence of mental illness in Israel is similar. One can hypothesize that the above factors&#xD;
      such as social stigma, mental health care availability, loss of work days and travel expenses&#xD;
      all play a role in this. Consequently, patients may prefer to see their primary care&#xD;
      physician as an alternative, and according to reports of the Israeli national health&#xD;
      services, 30%-50% of visits to the primary care physician are mental health related. Thanks&#xD;
      to the technological advances in telecommunications, especially regarding cost reduction and&#xD;
      higher bandwidths, there has been a renewed interest in telepsychiatry. However, the issue of&#xD;
      the cost effectiveness of telepsychiatry is still controversial. Out of 380 studies on&#xD;
      telepsychiatry published from 1956 to 2002, only 12 dealt with the question of cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, and among those the results were equivocal. Another question that has scarcely&#xD;
      been studied is that of quality of life within telepsychiatry treatment. Finally, the issue&#xD;
      of telepsychiatry that is used as a consultation tool in the aid of the primary physician&#xD;
      that occurs physically in his own practice is another novel angle we wish to explore. The&#xD;
      advantages embodied in this are potentially many - patient discreteness and confidentiality,&#xD;
      decrease in expenses and stigma reduction among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we will attempt to address the above issues that have not received the focus of&#xD;
      attention in many of the published studies so far - cost analysis and quality of life within&#xD;
      the context of telepsychiatry consultation in primary care. Additionally, we will address the&#xD;
      issues of clinical efficacy and satisfaction (of the primary care provider as well as that of&#xD;
      the patient) from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The satisfaction of the patients will increase during the 12 months of study in the&#xD;
           group treated by telepsychiatry in comparison with the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cost analysis - the use of telepsychiatry will reduce the costs for the primary health&#xD;
           care centers and/or for the mental health centers: Travel expenses, a decrease in&#xD;
           visitations to the primary health care center, a decrease in hospitalizations in general&#xD;
           hospitals and/or psychiatric hospitals, a decrease in the number of ancillary tests and&#xD;
           of lost work days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effectiveness of treatment - the mental and physical well being of the patients will&#xD;
           improve or at least not be impaired in the group treated by telepsychiatry as compared&#xD;
           to the control groups due to the increased availability of the consultation service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The number of patients referred to mental health treatment will be higher than that of&#xD;
           the previous year due to the increased availability of telepsychiatry within the primary&#xD;
           care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patients will prefer the telepsychiatry service as compared to a referral to a&#xD;
           mental health center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality of life will improve or it least not be impaired in the group treated by&#xD;
           telepsychiatry as compared to the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Stigma reduction - Visitations to the primary health care center as opposed to the&#xD;
           mental health center will lower the possibility of the formation of a social stigma of&#xD;
           mental disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Telepsychiatry treated patients within the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In-person treated patients by a psychiatrist at the mental health center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary care treated patients without a psychiatry consultation.&#xD;
