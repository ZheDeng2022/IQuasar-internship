      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of DITROPANÂ® XL (oxybutynin chloride)&#xD;
      Extended-Release Tablets and DETROLÂ® LA (tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules) in&#xD;
      the reduction of urge urinary incontinence episodes during a 12-week treatment period in&#xD;
      patients with overactive bladder. The secondary objective is to compare the tolerability of&#xD;
      DITROPANÂ® XL (oxybutynin chloride) and DETROLÂ® LA (tolterodine tartrate) during a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of DITROPAN® XL 10 mg&#xD;
      once-daily and DETROL® LA 4 mg once-daily in the reduction of urge urinary incontinence&#xD;
      episodes in female patients with overactive bladder. This is a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel-group study with two active treatments. Screened patients are&#xD;
      qualified for the study based on information obtained from seven consecutive 24-hour urinary&#xD;
      diaries completed during the Baseline Week, and other eligibility criteria. Qualifying&#xD;
      patients receive 12 weeks of treatment with DITROPAN® XL or DETROL® LA, with clinical visits&#xD;
      at the end of Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations during the study include the collection of adverse events, laboratory&#xD;
      tests including blood chemistry and urinalysis, physical examinations, vital signs (blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate) and post-void residual urine volume. Over-encapsulated DITROPAN® XL,&#xD;
      10 mg tablets once-daily by mouth or over-encapsulated DETROL® LA, 4 mg capsules once daily&#xD;
      by mouth. The treatment phase of the study runs for 12 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are able to differentiate urinary incontinence episodes associated&#xD;
             with urgency from urinary incontinence episodes not associated with urgency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  during the 7 day baseline period have 21 to 60 urge urinary incontinence (Urge-UI)&#xD;
             episodes, a greater number of Urge-UI episodes than urinary incontinence not&#xD;
             associated with urge, and an average of 10 or more voids per 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are in good general health as determined by medical history, physical examination&#xD;
             (general, genital, pelvic, and rectal), laboratory tests and urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  if taking antihypertension medication, must be on a stable dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and if of child-bearing potential, practicing an acceptable method of birth control,&#xD;
             and must have a negative pregnancy test at Visit 2 and Visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known, treatable genitourinary conditions (identified on history or&#xD;
             on examination) that may cause incontinence (e.g., urinary tract infection,&#xD;
             interstitial cystitis, urinary tract obstruction, urethral diverticulum, bladder&#xD;
             tumor, bladder stone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have given birth or have had pelvic, vaginal or bladder surgery less than 6 months&#xD;
             before study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with a second post-void residual urine volume &gt; 150 mL at the time of screening&#xD;
             (determined by abdominal ultrasound)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with significant medical problems or other organ abnormality that places them at risk&#xD;
             from participating in the study or at a significant risk of developing complete&#xD;
             urinary retention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with significant impairment of the liver or kidneys as determined by laboratory&#xD;
             assessments or hematuria (red blood cells in microscopic urinalysis)&#xD;
