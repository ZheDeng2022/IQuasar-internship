      RATIONALE: Tinzaparin may stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of tinzaparin and to see how well&#xD;
      it works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of tinzaparin sodium on fibrin formation (prothrombin fragment&#xD;
           F1.2), thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin complexes), and fibrinolysis (D-Dimer)&#xD;
           from baseline to 2 weeks and at nadir or disease progression in patients with&#xD;
           unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of tinzaparin sodium treatment on circulating angiogenesis markers,&#xD;
           including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor&#xD;
           (bFGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of patients developing venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the tolerability of tinzaparin sodium treatment for up to 6 months in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the feasibility of undertaking a multicenter renal cell carcinoma trial with&#xD;
           specialized coagulation test collection, shipping, and processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain more accurate and specific mean, median, and variability in biomarker data in&#xD;
           advanced RCC patients treated with tinzaparin sodium for purposes of planning larger&#xD;
           future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the progression-free survival at 4 months in patients treated with tinzaparin&#xD;
           sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate progression-free survival with changes in markers of coagulation activation or&#xD;
           angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate the anticoagulant activity of tinzaparin sodium (anti-Xa activity) with change&#xD;
           in coagulation markers, angiogenesis markers, and progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a treatment dose of tinzaparin sodium subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 14&#xD;
      days followed by a prophylactic dose of tinzaparin sodium SC once daily for up to 6 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
