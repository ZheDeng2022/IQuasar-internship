  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label study for patients with p53-deleted CLL who require treatment.&#xD;
      Both untreated and previously treated patients are eligible for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of giving continuous alemtuzumab and cyclical high-dose&#xD;
      methyl-prednisone.Alentuzumab is given intravenously during the first 4 weeks of treatment to&#xD;
      ensure that adequate serum levels are achieved quickly. The drug will be administered daily&#xD;
      during the first week, commencing at a dose of 3mg, and increasing to 10mg and then up to the&#xD;
      target dose of 30mg as tolerated.Thereafter alemtuzumab will be given at a dose 30mg thrice&#xD;
      weekly. From week 5, alemtuzumab will be given at the same dose but by the subcutaneous route&#xD;
      of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methlyprednisolone will be given for 5 consecutive days at a daily dose of 1.0g/m2, starting&#xD;
      on Day 1 and repeating the cycle every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be given for 16 weeks (i.e 4 cycles of methylprednisolone). Treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued if there is no response after 8 weeks, or if toxicity becomes unacceptable.&#xD;
