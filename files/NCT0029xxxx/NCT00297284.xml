  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in order to determine if the FDA-approved drug Modafinil can&#xD;
      improve cognitive function in patients with lupus. Modafinil is currently being used to treat&#xD;
      excessive sleepiness caused by certain sleep disorders. It has also been shown to improve&#xD;
      attention and concentration in some people who don't have lupus or sleep disorders. This&#xD;
      study hopes to determine if Modafinil can be used safely and effectively in lupus patients,&#xD;
      and improve their quality of life. No medications currently exist for the treatment of&#xD;
      lupus-associated cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week pilot and feasibility single-arm, open-label trial of modafinil 200mg orally&#xD;
      every morning to improve cognitive efficiency in systemic lupus patients with cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction is a well-recognized manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      (SLE) whose reported prevalence ranges from 12-87%. SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      often occurs in the absence of frank neuropsychiatric disease (e.g., stroke, depression,&#xD;
      psychosis, cerebral vasculitis), medications known to have central nervous system effects, or&#xD;
      increased disease activity or flare. Studies of SLE antibodies (most notably the&#xD;
      antiphospholipid antibodies) have provided conflicting results with respect to their&#xD;
      association with SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction. Thus, despite numerous investigations,&#xD;
      the etiology of SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction remains unclear. There is no known means&#xD;
      for preventing cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Similarly there are no established or proven&#xD;
      treatments for cognitive dysfunction in SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of its cause, course, or long-term consequences, cognitive dysfunction in SLE is a&#xD;
      major cause of distress, compromised performance of everyday activities, and decreased&#xD;
      quality of life. Thus, treatment of decreased cognitive performance in SLE when it occurs, no&#xD;
      matter how mild, and regardless of its potential for permanence or progression, is of&#xD;
      paramount importance. It is imperative to provide SLE patients with cognitive performance&#xD;
      difficulties with the means to functionally cope with their impairments so that they can&#xD;
      maintain, if not regain their independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modafinil is a safe, orally administered wakefulness-promoting agent approved for use in&#xD;
      adults suffering from narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift&#xD;
      work sleep syndrome. Since its FDA approval, it has been used for many additional varied&#xD;
      conditions including depression, fatigue, fibromyalgia, myotonic dystrophy, organic brain&#xD;
      syndrome, sleep deprivation, Parkinson's, and drug-induced somnolence. It has also been used&#xD;
      in helicopter and airplane pilots to enhance their attentiveness during long flights. Some of&#xD;
      our SLE patients have been prescribed modafinil for narcolepsy or associated fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modafinil has broad efficacy in health and illness. It enhances cognitive function in normal&#xD;
      young adult males, as tested by digit span, visual pattern recognition memory, spatial&#xD;
      planning and stop-signal reaction time. While the majority of patients prescribed modafinil&#xD;
      received the drug for non-cognitive indications (e.g., fatigue, sleepiness), several have&#xD;
      reported improved cognitive function, especially with respect to tasks that require attention&#xD;
      and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Modafinil, an FDA-approved, non-specific wakefulness-promoting agent with&#xD;
      minimal side effects, is safe and effective when used to improve cognitive efficiency in SLE&#xD;
      patients who identify cognitive dysfunction in themselves.&#xD;
