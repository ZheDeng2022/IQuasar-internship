      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative, computer driven&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation program for individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with neurocognitive impairment, diminished life satisfaction,&#xD;
      lack of independence, and poor functioning in social, occupational and other desired and&#xD;
      expected community roles. The personal, social and economic costs of this illness are&#xD;
      enormous. Neurocognitive deficits (e.g., slowed thinking, poor attention and memory,&#xD;
      inadequate problem solving) are now recognized as core features of the illness, and primary&#xD;
      contributors to functional impairment among patients (Bellack, Gold &amp; Buchanan; 1999; Green,&#xD;
      1996). While standard antipsychotic medications improve psychotic symptomatology in many&#xD;
      patients, their impact on neurocognition is modest, at best, and dramatic functional deficits&#xD;
      remain even after adequate pharmacological treatment (Keefe et al., 1999). Hence, there is&#xD;
      growing interest in alternative treatment strategies to address cognitive deficits, including&#xD;
      computer-assisted cognitive remediation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to assess the efficacy of a computer-assisted cognitive&#xD;
      remediation program we have developed: Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR). Fifty&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders will be recruited and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two conditions: a) 36 sessions of CACR; or b) 36 sessions of a manualized computer&#xD;
      control condition (RC). The efficacy of CACR will be assessed on behavioral performance in&#xD;
      three dimensions: (1) on the trained learning exercises, (2) on neuropsychological measures,&#xD;
      and (3) on role play based assessments of everyday problem solving. We hypothesize that CACR&#xD;
      will be more effective than the control treatment in each domain.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 through 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects will be clinically stable as judged by current outpatient or inpatient&#xD;
             treatment staff&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Primary psychiatric medication is a new generation antipsychotic other than Clozapine&#xD;
             and/or a dose of first generation antipsychotic equivalent to 10 mg. of less of&#xD;
             haloperidol for one month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documented history of organic brain disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Documented history of mental retardation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Physical limitations (e.g., with hearing or vision) that would interfere substantially&#xD;
             with use of computer-based exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosis of current Substance Dependence according to DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participation in the prior full trial of this remediation program (this exclusion is&#xD;
             meant to apply to individuals participating in the full controlled trial, and not to&#xD;
             individuals participating in the preliminary sub-study).&#xD;
