      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the short-term efficacy of risperidone augmentation for treatment-resistant&#xD;
           aggression in children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the short-term safety and tolerability of risperidone augmentation in the same&#xD;
           group of subjects.&#xD;

      Methods and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of risperidone as an augmenting&#xD;
      agent in 40 children, 7-12 years of age, with ADHD. All subjects would have been treated&#xD;
      first with a stimulant medication as a single agent, but continue to present impulsive&#xD;
      aggression. The active phase of treatment will be four weeks long, during which risperidone&#xD;
      or placebo will be added to a constant dose of stimulant medication. The study will include a&#xD;
      four weeks continuation phase where placebo nonresponders will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      receive risperidone on an open basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special time and effort will be devoted to subject recruitment since we recognize that it is&#xD;
      crucial to the study. Our primary recruitment sites are the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&#xD;
      (CAP) outpatient clinic, the psychiatry crisis unit, and the child and adolescent psychiatry&#xD;
      inpatient unit. Clinical staff will identify and refer to the research team potential&#xD;
      candidates for the study. Community referrals will be sought after by means of professional&#xD;
      liaisons and academic presentations at local psychiatric facilities. Possible subjects will&#xD;
      then be scheduled for a full evaluation after telephone screening for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Recruitment will be continuous until the total number of proposed subjects (N=40),&#xD;
      complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Boys and girls ages 7 to 12 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical/neurological clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Meets DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment with a stimulant medication during the last three weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Failure to respond to stimulant medication as documented by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Three acts of aggression in the past week, two of which must be acts of physical&#xD;
                aggression against other people, objects, or self&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) Predatory-Affective index score of 0 or below. This&#xD;
                indicates primarily an affective or impulsive subtype of aggression&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Minimum CGI scale rating of 4 (moderately ill)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. IQ &gt; 75&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Major medical problems such as cardiac, renal, thyroid diseases, and seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Previous adequate treatment with risperidone (2 mg/day for at least 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acutely suicidal or homicidal&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Unable to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Instruments and Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aggression&#xD;
&#xD;
           Understanding an aggressive episode is clearly complicated by the need to numerically&#xD;
           quantify it. Being a low frequency behavior, aggression presents a challenge to the&#xD;
           systematic assessment required in a research study. We will employ the Children's&#xD;
           Aggression Scale, Parent (CAS-P) and Teacher (CAS-T) versions (Halperin et al., 2002) to&#xD;
           measure retrospectively the frequency and severity of four categories of aggression: (1)&#xD;
           verbal aggression, (2) aggression against objects and animals, (3) provoked physical&#xD;
           aggression, and (4) initiated physical aggression. Responders complete a Likert scale to&#xD;
           evaluate the frequency of an act. A distinction is made between aggressive acts directed&#xD;
           toward persons who live in the home and those who do not, and also between acts directed&#xD;
           toward peers and those directed towards adults. The frequency of aggressive events is&#xD;
           multiplied by its designated severity weight factor and then summed to yield a total&#xD;
           score. We modified the instrument so that only the occurrence of impulsive aggressive&#xD;
           events over the previous one-week period is rated (see Appendix). These &quot;event&quot; types of&#xD;
           variables fall in the category of &quot;impulsive aggression&quot; as defined above.&#xD;
           Parents/guardians and teachers will be the respondents for this scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitiello and associates (1990, 1997) studied aggressive behaviors in children and&#xD;
           adolescents and developed the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) to classify aggression into&#xD;
           &quot;predatory&quot; and &quot;affective&quot; subtypes. Subsequently, Malone et al., (1998) modified the&#xD;
           instrument by making it a parent interview and increasing the range of scoring. The&#xD;
           modified version, which will be used in this study, is a 16-item scale consisting of&#xD;
           eight items that assess predatory aggression and eight items that assess affective&#xD;
           aggression. Items are scored as not true (0), partly true (1), or very true (2).&#xD;
           Predatory and affective scores are obtained by adding the corresponding items with a&#xD;
           possible range from 0 to 16. The Predatory-Affective index is calculated by subtracting&#xD;
           the affective score from the predatory score. Higher index scores indicate a&#xD;
           predominantly predatory type of aggression while lower scores indicate primarily an&#xD;
           affective subtype. This affective aggression is viewed as an overreaction to a minor&#xD;
           provocation often accompanied by disinhibition and behavioral dyscontrol,&#xD;
           characteristically impulsive. The AQ differentiated responders from nonresponders to&#xD;
           lithium treatment in a group of aggressive conduct-disordered children (Malone et al.,&#xD;
           1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ADHD Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Conners, 1995) consists of a series of letters&#xD;
      presented on a computer screen in rapid succession. The subject is required to press a key&#xD;
      whenever a target stimulus is presented, and to refrain from pressing the key when the&#xD;
      nontarget stimulus is presented. The CPT generates separate measures of inattention and&#xD;
      impulsivity. The impulsivity score is derived from a combination of commission errors and hit&#xD;
      reaction times. T-scores of 60 or above on commission errors and hit reaction times will be&#xD;
      considered as an indication of impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ADHD Index (Conners, 1997) - Because of its brevity (12 items) and excellent psychometric&#xD;
      properties, this index is well suited for repeated measures in clinical drug trials. The ADHD&#xD;
      Index will help us understand if the effect of risperidone treatment on impulsive aggression&#xD;
      is independent of any effect it may have on ADHD symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial visit will take place at the CAP outpatient clinic where the rest of the study&#xD;
      will be conducted. The study will be fully explained and a written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the parent(s) while an assent from will be obtained from the subject. Parent(s)&#xD;
      and subject will undergo the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parent/Staff:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Structured psychiatric interview employing the computerized Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
                Schedule for Children IV (Generic C-DISC 4; Shaffer et al., 2000) - This is a&#xD;
                comprehensive, structured interview that covers 36 mental health disorders for&#xD;
                children and adolescents, using DSM-IV criteria. Extensive reliability data on this&#xD;
                instrument are available. The instrument produces a series of reports including a&#xD;
                diagnostic report that indicates endorsed symptoms, criteria, and diagnoses.&#xD;
                Comorbidity in the sample will be clearly identified. The parent version is&#xD;
                suitable for caretakers of 6 to 17 year olds. Raters will be required to&#xD;
                participate in a two-day training session by a Columbia DISC trainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Complete social history and review of environmental stressors&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Medical review of systems&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. CAS-P, ADHD index, and AQ&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Structured psychiatric interview employing the Generic C-DISC 4. The youth version&#xD;
                is suitable for children aged 9 to 17 years. The parent and youth interviews will&#xD;
                be performed in parallel except for children ages 7 and 8 years for which only the&#xD;
                parent interview is valid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Continuous Performance Test&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT; Kaufman and Kaufman 1990) - The K-BIT is a&#xD;
                brief, individually administered measure of verbal and nonverbal intelligence.&#xD;
                While it is not intended to substitute for a comprehensive measure of intelligence,&#xD;
                it is adequate for our screening purposes. The K-BIT IQ composite score was&#xD;
                correlated .80 with the WISC-R full scale IQ&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) - A four-item scale widely used in clinical drug&#xD;
                trials, involving both adult and pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Laboratory studies will include complete blood cell count (CBC) and differential,&#xD;
                electrolytes, thyroid and kidney function tests. These will be repeated at&#xD;
                endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Urine analysis for toxicology and pregnancy (females)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Teacher:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teacher will be given the Children's Aggression Scale-Teacher Version (CAS-T) (Halperin&#xD;
      et al., 2002) to evaluate the frequency and severity of aggressive acts, as distinct from&#xD;
      oppositional and defiant behaviors. In addition, the teacher will be given the ADHD index.&#xD;
      The teacher who best knows the patient will complete both scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will discuss all information collected to arrive at a preliminary consensus&#xD;
      diagnosis. After reviewing inclusion and exclusion criteria, subjects who are eligible will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will last 4 weeks. Subjects that meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive study medication (risperidone or placebo) as augmenting treatment to stimulant&#xD;
      medication. The dose of the stimulant will remain constant during this phase. Janssen&#xD;
      Pharmaceutica will supply risperidone 0.5 mg and identical placebos. All research staff and&#xD;
      subjects will be blind as to the study medication to be administered. The dose of the study&#xD;
      medication will be started at 0.5 mg/day. The dose for each child will be individually&#xD;
      regulated until optimum efficacy or until the side effects become unacceptable. The guiding&#xD;
      principle will be to achieve control of symptoms with the lowest possible dose in order to&#xD;
      minimize undue side effects. The medication dose can be gradually increased by 0.5mg weekly&#xD;
      to a maximum of 2 mg/day. Dose reduction for adverse events may occur at any time and be made&#xD;
      in any multiple of 0.5 mg as deemed clinically necessary. No other concomitant medication&#xD;
      will be permitted. Subjects will attend the research clinic on a weekly basis for behavioral&#xD;
      assessments and medication distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Phase I, the blind will be broken on every subject and the study medication&#xD;
      will be identified. Subjects that received placebo and continue to present aggressive&#xD;
      behaviors, as defined by inclusion criteria, will be eligible to continue to Phase II. All&#xD;
      other subjects will be treated as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will last 4 weeks. Subjects that received placebo during Phase I and continue to&#xD;
      present aggressive behaviors will receive risperidone on an open basis. All visits, dosing,&#xD;
      and assessment instruments will be the same as in Phase I. This represents an opportunity to&#xD;
      identify all potential responders to risperidone as an augmenting agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline, week 4, and week 8 if applicable: Blood-cell-count (CBC) and differential,&#xD;
           electrolytes, thyroid and kidney function tests, and urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs and weight; baseline and weekly thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side-effect questionnaire; baseline and weekly thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medication log will be maintained for each subject detailing dose and schedule on a daily&#xD;
      basis. At each weekly visit subjects will be provided with enough medication for one-week of&#xD;
      treatment plus an additional 2 days supply for safety. They will be required to return any&#xD;
      unused medication at the end of each week. All drug supplies will be stored in a locked&#xD;
      cabinet.&#xD;
