  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibolone, a tissue-selective compound with a combination of estrogenic, progestogenic and&#xD;
      androgenic properties, is used as an alternative for estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone&#xD;
      hormone therapy for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause and osteoporosis. The&#xD;
      current study compares endometrial histology, biochemistry (hormone levels) and&#xD;
      gene-expression profiles after short-term (21-days) treatment with tibolone, to the findings&#xD;
      after treatment with estradiol-only (E2) and E2+Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) in healthy&#xD;
      postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for endometrial prolaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since short-term tibolone use results in increased spotting and bleeding but long-term&#xD;
      treatment with tibolone has been shown to lead to an atrophic endometrium our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that tibolone first displays a more estrogenic mode of action, which over time, is&#xD;
      counterbalanced by tibolone's progestagenic properties&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Effects of estrogen deficiency in women are climacteric symptoms and bone loss, which can&#xD;
      efficiently be treated by substituting with estrogens (1). Unopposed estrogen treatment,&#xD;
      however, increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent carcinoma. For example&#xD;
      in the HOPE study (Women's Health, Osteoporosis, Progestin, Estrogen study (2, 3)), after two&#xD;
      years of treatment with conjugated equine estrogens (0.625mg/day CEE) the rate of hyperplasia&#xD;
      went up to 27,7%. When the treatment was combined with MPA (2.5 mg) the incidence of&#xD;
      hyperplasia completely disappeared. Thus, the addition of progestagens is necessary for&#xD;
      endometrial safety. Progestagen addition (in continuous combined estrogen plus progestin&#xD;
      therapy), however, also causes negative side effects like withdrawal bleeding and an&#xD;
      increased breast cancer incidence that was recently documented in the Women's Health&#xD;
      Initiative (4) and Million Women Study (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibolone is a tissue-specific compound used for treatment of climacteric complaints and&#xD;
      prevention of osteoporosis and does not stimulate the endometrium like estrogens (6). It is&#xD;
      converted by steroid metabolizing enzymes in the liver and intestine into three active&#xD;
      metabolites: two hydroxy-metabolites: 3a-hydroxy-tibolone and 3b-hydroxy-tibolone (exerting&#xD;
      estrogenic effects and in vivo present in significant amounts) and the delta-4-isomer&#xD;
      (exerting progestagenic and androgenic effects, and in vivo present in circulation for a&#xD;
      relatively short period of time (7)). The estrogenic metabolites are responsible for the&#xD;
      effects on hot flushes, vagina and bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibolone's effects on the endometrium have been studied by a number of investigators (8-14)&#xD;
      using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and histology in biopsies after long-term treatment.&#xD;
      With ultrasound it was observed that after 6 years of treatment endometrial thickness was&#xD;
      slightly increased (p &lt; 0.05, (8)) in tibolone-users compared to controls. Dőren et al. (9)&#xD;
      confirmed that tibolone treatment results in a slight increase in endometrial thickness,&#xD;
      which was not different from estrogen + norethisterone acetate treatment (E2+NETA). Histology&#xD;
      data after tibolone use for more than 3 months, show no change in 90% of the subjects and&#xD;
      only in a few cases an endometrial profile was shown which was comparable to the early&#xD;
      follicular phase of a normal cycle (15). Even after two years of tibolone use hyperplasia&#xD;
      rarely occurs (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, Hammar (16) showed that the bleeding and/or&#xD;
      spotting episodes in tibolone users in the first months of use were significantly lower than&#xD;
      in E2+NETA users, and the authors hypothesized that this was due to a higher progestagenic&#xD;
      activity of tibolone on the endometrium compared to the combined treatment. Our in vitro&#xD;
      studies show indeed that tibolone can exert a progestagenic effect and that the balance&#xD;
      between the progestagenic properties and the estrogenic properties of tibolone takes effect&#xD;
      through a different set of genes acting in the same genetic network (17, 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate whether our cell line data on tibolone action could be confirmed in&#xD;
      vivo, and because relatively short-term effects of tibolone and other hormonal treatments in&#xD;
      patients have never been described, postmenopausal women were treated for 21 days with&#xD;
      tibolone, estrogen-only, or estrogen together with progestagen (estrogen+progestagen). From&#xD;
      these women sera were obtained and endometria were removed in order to assess the&#xD;
      histological and immunohistochemical, biochemical (hormone levels) and molecular (gene&#xD;
      expression) effects of relatively short-term tibolone use (21-days). The overall results may&#xD;
      help us to obtain insight in the mechanism of action of tibolone on the human endometrium&#xD;
      compared to reference preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a controlled clinical trial. Patients who visited our clinics&#xD;
      (Amphia Hospital Breda, Albert Schweitser Hospital Dordrecht, Erasmus University Medical&#xD;
      Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands) to undergo vaginal hysterectomy for treatment of prolapse,&#xD;
      were eligible to participate in this study. A description of the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the current experiments were documented earlier (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was performed in the period before the scheduled surgery. After informed consent,&#xD;
      the patients were sequentially assigned to one of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
      Control-group (no hormonal treatment); Tibolone-group (2.5 mg tibolone (Livial, N.V. Organon,&#xD;
      Oss, The Netherlands) administered orally every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery); E2&#xD;
      group (2 mg of estradiol administered orally every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery);&#xD;
      E2+MPA-group (2 mg estradiol + 5 mg MPA administered orally every day, starting 21 days prior&#xD;
      to surgery). The investigators were kept blinded to the patient treatments during the&#xD;
      analysis. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committees of the participating&#xD;
      hospitals.&#xD;
