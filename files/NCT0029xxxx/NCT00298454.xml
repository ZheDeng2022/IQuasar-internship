    <textblock>
      Intensive care patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome often show renal failure&#xD;
      with the need for hemofiltration. Resolving renal failure after cessation of hemofiltration&#xD;
      may or may not be accompanied by oliguria. Whether or not the administration of diuretics at&#xD;
      that moment is appropriate is not known. The study randomises between furosemide or placebo&#xD;
      when hemofiltration is stopped. Study endpoint is recovery of renal function.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtually all intensive care (IC) patients with prolonged IC stay have multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction syndrome. Frequently renal failure is present. The resolution of renal failure is&#xD;
      often relatively late. After cessation of hemofiltration, oliguria may be present, at least&#xD;
      for some time. Increasing diuresis by diuretics will probably increase clearance. As a&#xD;
      result, intensive care stay and outcome may improve. However, diuretics might also be harmful&#xD;
      as it is when applied in developing renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study whether the stimulation of diuresis by furosemide when hemofiltration is stopped&#xD;
      enhances renal recovery and secondary shortens the length of IC-stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC-patients treated at the Medical Centre Leeuwarden with MODS and renal failure are included&#xD;
      when hemofiltration is stopped. The ICU is mixed medical and surgical, 16 beds with full time&#xD;
      intensivists responsible for hemofiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomised placebo controlled single centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria. Patients with mechanical ventilation in whom hemofiltration is stopped.&#xD;
      Written informed consent must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded are patients with pre-existent serum creatinin of 150 umol/l or clearance less than&#xD;
      30 ml/min. Patients admitted with renal failure as the primary admission diagnosis in case&#xD;
      acute renal failure is due to glomerulonephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinin clearance is measured in a 4 hour period directly after cessation of&#xD;
      hemofiltration. The patient is then randomised for furosemide or sodium chloride. Furosemide&#xD;
      is administered at 0.5 mg/kg/hour. Dehydration is prevented by infusing the patient the&#xD;
      volume of their diuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily creatinin clearance is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recovery of renal function (clearance more than 30 ml/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stable or declining serum creatinin in case of persistent clearance less than 30 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Need for re-start of renal replacement therapy (metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, fluid&#xD;
           overload, uremia or uremic complications)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of stay ICU, mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poweranalysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 patients per group for alpha 0.05 and beta 0.8 and 30% faster recovery of renal failure&#xD;
      for the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student t for normally distributed variables, otherwise non-parametric tests. Kaplan Meier&#xD;
      and Cox regression for time to recovery of renal function.&#xD;
