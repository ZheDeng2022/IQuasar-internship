  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrative system of breast cancer risk&#xD;
      assessment based on epidemiologic and biologic risk variables, as well as to develop or&#xD;
      refine risk biomarkers which may be useful in predicting and monitoring response to&#xD;
      prevention interventions.&#xD;

      1. To correlate established risk biomarkers such as cytomorphology obtained from random&#xD;
           periareolar fine needle aspiration ( RPFNA), mammographic breast density, serum&#xD;
           bioavailable estradiol and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 with each other and with 5-10 year Gail risk&#xD;
           estimates. Where available, and with appropriate safe guards to maintain status for&#xD;
           breast cancer susceptibility genes may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the relative predictive value of established risk biomarkers for the&#xD;
           development of DCIS and/or invasive cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate potential new breast tissue-based biomarkers including Ki-67, PCNA, ER,&#xD;
           COX-2, aromatase, methylation of key tumor suppressor genes (i.e., RAR, p16, etc),&#xD;
           proteomic patterns in RPFNA and nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), as well as NAF hormone&#xD;
           levels, and correlate them with other risk biomarkers listed in 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the prevalence of polymorphisms of a panel of genes important in hormone&#xD;
           and xenobiotic metabolism as well as DNA repair and correlate these polymorphisms with&#xD;
           established risk biomarkers listed in 1, as well as with development of DCIS and&#xD;
           invasive cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To maintain contact with this initially identified cohort of high risk women, acquire&#xD;
           demographic data, biologic specimens and data and follow them prospectively for the&#xD;
           development.&#xD;
