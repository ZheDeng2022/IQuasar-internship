      Our overall objective in this study is to study the role of B cells in inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD), using a combination of high-throughput experimental and novel bioinformatical&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic IBD includes Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), which are chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disorders of the intestine. IBD is common in developed countries, with up to 1&#xD;
      in 200 of individuals affected by theses diseases. It is currently thought that the disease&#xD;
      arises owing to a complex array of genetic, environmental and immunologic susceptibility&#xD;
      factors. T cells are thought to cause the lesions, but the B cell population apparently has a&#xD;
      significant role as well, through secreting antibodies against certain self-antigens. We&#xD;
      believe that a major contribution to the understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, and&#xD;
      especially of the immune pathway leading to CD, can be achieved by analysis of the B cell&#xD;
      clones participating in immune responses in the gut, in particular their immunoglobulin (Ig)&#xD;
      variable region gene diversity, which has never before been studied in the context of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptive immune system is one of the only two biological systems capable of continuously&#xD;
      learning and memorizing its experiences. This is a highly complex, distributed system, in&#xD;
      which pathogen recognition, decision-making and action are performed by an interacting&#xD;
      network of diverse lymphocytes. Immune learning and memory are embedded in the dynamical&#xD;
      states of the complete lymphocyte repertoire, and cannot be understood by studying the&#xD;
      behavior of single cell types. This complexity, further increased by the non-linear behavior&#xD;
      of each component, can only be elucidated by using theoretical tools to complement&#xD;
      experimental and clinical studies. Needless to say, many aspects of the deregulation of&#xD;
      lymphocyte clones are not evident in the phenotype of the single cell but rather in the&#xD;
      population dynamics of a whole clone (or many clones) of cells, as in B cell lymphomas. Such&#xD;
      aspects are best elucidated by studies of the population dynamics and genetics of the&#xD;
      relevant B cell clone(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to utilize a novel bioinformatical approach - the analysis of the&#xD;
      shapes of Ig gene mutational lineage trees. This is the main innovative feature in our&#xD;
      proposal, as it taps into parameters that have never before been measured or analyzed with&#xD;
      respect to B lymphocytes in IBD. While the method is new, it has already been shown that&#xD;
      graphical analysis of B cell lineage trees and mathematical quantification of tree properties&#xD;
      provide novel insights into the mechanisms of normal and malignant B cell clonal evolution. A&#xD;
      preliminary analysis of lineage trees from other autoimmune diseases (shown below) indicates&#xD;
      that, given sufficient amounts of data, the method could elucidate changes in Ig gene&#xD;
      diversification and selection in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we aim to search for correlations between the parameters characterizing Ig gene&#xD;
      diversification and parameters characterizing patients, disease history and severity, and&#xD;
      histological markers, as this has the potential of yielding novel diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      tools.&#xD;

      1. Extraction of Ig gene sequences from IBD patient gut samples. The proposed study aims to&#xD;
           elucidate the role of B cells in IBD via investigating their Ig gene diversification.&#xD;
           Hence the first step should be to extract Ig gene sequences from samples (cases of&#xD;
           resection procedure) archived in the pathology laboratory of the Sheba Medical Center.&#xD;
           Samples from both CD and UC cases will be used, DNA will be extracted and Ig gene&#xD;
           sequences will be amplified via PCR, in order to generate sufficient data for the&#xD;
           bioinformatical analysis. Samples from inflamed gut segments will be compared to samples&#xD;
           from uninflamed segments (where available), in order to provide an internal control for&#xD;
           the comparison of IBD-related and unrelated B cell clones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigation of the repertoire and the degree of clonality in B cells implicated in&#xD;
           IBD, based on the sequences extracted under aim (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We assume that B cells involved in a chronic disease state undergo Ig gene&#xD;
           diversification for much longer times than B cells in normal short-term immune&#xD;
           responses, and hence Ig gene sequences from IBD-related B cells will exhibit a high&#xD;
           degree of clonality. There may also be biases in specific Ig variable region (V) gene&#xD;
           segment usage, as has been observed in other chronic diseases. Hence, the sequences&#xD;
           obtained under aim (1) will be aligned with human germline V segment sequences, in order&#xD;
           to identify any possible biases in V segment usage, and to identify clonal relationships&#xD;
           between sets of sequences from the same patient. Since even gut samples from healthy&#xD;
           humans contain many clonally related Ig gene sequences (see below), we expect to find&#xD;
           many such clonal sequences in most samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Elucidation of the dynamics of the responding B cell clones, using lineage tree analysis&#xD;
           of clonal Ig gene sequences found under aim (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sets of clonally-related Ig gene sequences discovered under aim (3) will be subjected to&#xD;
           lineage tree analysis using the methods developed by the Mehr group. The results of this&#xD;
           analysis will point at the differences between IBD-related and unrelated B cell clones&#xD;
           in the dynamics of somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Search for correlations between the parameters resulting from lineage tree analysis (aim&#xD;
           3) and clinical and patient parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A particularly interesting question is whether the parameters generated by lineage tree&#xD;
      analysis of Ig gene sequences are correlated with clinical parameters describing the patients&#xD;
      (e.g. age, gender), the course of the disease (e.g. age of onset, disease duration, symptom&#xD;
      severity) and histological characteristics. We expect that analysis of these two types of&#xD;
      data (bioinformatical and clinical) will reveal quite a few correlations, and that based on&#xD;
      these correlations we may be able to enhance the set of diagnostic and prognostic tools&#xD;
      currently available to clinicians specializing in IBD.&#xD;
