      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Though the drug buprenorphine effectively treats dependence on opioids like heroin, some&#xD;
           abstinent patients relapse to use during treatment. This relapse may be triggered by&#xD;
           stress or stressful situations, and buprenorphine probably has no specific protective&#xD;
           effect in these situations. Buprenorphine probably also has no specific effect on&#xD;
           relapse to cocaine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research has shown that clonidine, a drug originally prescribed to treat high blood&#xD;
           pressure and some symptoms of opioid withdrawal, can help block stress-induced relapse&#xD;
           to heroin and cocaine seeking in rats. Researchers are interested in studying whether a&#xD;
           combination of clonidine and buprenorphine may be more effective in preventing drug&#xD;
           relapse than administering one of the medications alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether clonidine, given to abstinent patients maintained on buprenorphine, is&#xD;
      more effective than placebo in preventing relapse to heroin or cocaine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are current cocaine or heroin users seeking&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last up to 36 weeks, with four phases of treatment and a follow-up&#xD;
           evaluation. Three times a week, participants will be asked to report illicit drug use&#xD;
           and provide urine and breath samples. Throughout the study, participants will receive&#xD;
           individual counseling in weekly 40 60 minute sessions. Other samples and tests will be&#xD;
           scheduled as required by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be stabilized on daily buprenorphine over the first 14 days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 1 8: Participants will receive vouchers for regular substance-free urine samples.&#xD;
           Those who successfully complete this phase will continue to the next part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 7 9: Participants will receive either clonidine or placebo along with the&#xD;
           buprenorphine. The dose of clonidine will be stabilized during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 9 22: Participants will continue to receive either clonidine or placebo along with&#xD;
           the buprenorphine. During this part of the study, participants will keep electronic&#xD;
           diaries to record drug use or craving and to record data on mood, stress levels, and&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 23 28: Participants will stop taking the clonidine or placebo, but will continue&#xD;
           the buprenorphine treatment. Participants will continue to keep electronic diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 29 36: Participants will have the choice of transferring to a community clinic&#xD;
           transfer or gradually reducing doses of buprenorphine to end the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for a follow-up visit and urine sample 6 months after the end&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;

      Background. Though buprenorphine effectively treats opioid dependence, some abstinent&#xD;
      patients relapse to maladaptive use of opioids during treatment. Relapse may be triggered by&#xD;
      stress. Rodent studies have demonstrated that stress can induce relapse to heroin and cocaine&#xD;
      use (Erb, et al., 1996; Shaham, et al., 1996; Shaham and Stewart, 1995). In a rodent model,&#xD;
      stress-induced relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking is blocked by the alpha-2 adrenergic&#xD;
      agonist clonidine. In this study, clonidine will be compared to placebo in preventing relapse&#xD;
      to opioid abuse in opioid maintained patients who have achieved abstinence while on&#xD;
      buprenorphine and contingency management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals. To determine whether clonidine, given to abstinent patients maintained on&#xD;
      buprenorphine, prevents relapse to opioid use more effectively than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. 300 opioid-dependent outpatients (120 evaluable). Target enrollment&#xD;
      will include 40 persent women and 60 percent minorities (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods. The study will be a randomized double-blind clinical trial.&#xD;
      Two treatment groups will be studied (60/group), one receiving clonidine and the other&#xD;
      receiving placebo. Assignment to treatment group will be randomized. All patients will&#xD;
      receive buprenorphine daily (8 mg to 24 mg SL) and individual counseling weekly throughout 28&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. In order to establish abstinence prior to clonidine induction, after one&#xD;
      week of stabilization on buprenorphine, they will receive contingent vouchers for&#xD;
      opioid-negative urine specimens for 8 weeks (weeks 1-8). Patients who are abstinent from&#xD;
      illicit opioids during weeks 5 and 6 will be randomized to receive clonidine (0.3 mg oral&#xD;
      dose) or clonidine placebo from weeks 9 through 20. Participants who are not abstinent will&#xD;
      be switched to methadone for four weeks (usual dose from 50 mg to 100 mg) followed by an&#xD;
      eight week methadone taper. Assignment to clonidine or placebo will be double-blind. Weeks 21&#xD;
      and 22 will include a clonidine taper to avoid rebound hypertension. From weeks 23-28,&#xD;
      participants will receive buprenorphine and counseling only, and then will be offered&#xD;
      assistance to transfer to another program; those who do not transfer will undergo an 8-week&#xD;
      buprenorphine taper. The primary outcome measures will be longest duration of opioid&#xD;
      abstinence, time to relapse, and the proportion of opioid-negative urine specimens over time&#xD;
      during the Intervention phase. In addition, fluctuations in drug use, drug craving, stress,&#xD;
      and HIV-risk behaviors such as injection drug use will be assessed via ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society. Participants will receive buprenorphine, drug&#xD;
      counseling, and contingency-management therapy. The buprenorphine and voucher interventions&#xD;
      are likely to reduce participants' use of opioids. Counseling will include reduction of HIV&#xD;
      risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants. Participants may experience side effects from clonidine,&#xD;
      buprenorphine, or methadone and discomfort during withdrawal from each drug. In particular,&#xD;
      discontinuation of clonidine may cause rebound hypertension. The EMA component of the study&#xD;
      may generate some assessment burden.&#xD;

             within 4 hours of taking an alpha blocker or it can produce significant and&#xD;
             symptomatic hypotension (Pfizer). Of note, Viagra, like buprenorphine, is metabolized&#xD;
             by cytochrome P450 3A4. Ingestion of buprenorphine could potentate the effects of&#xD;
             sildenafil citrate which could extent the period of safety to &gt; 4 hrs from when an&#xD;
             alpha blocker could be taken after Viagra ingestion.&#xD;
