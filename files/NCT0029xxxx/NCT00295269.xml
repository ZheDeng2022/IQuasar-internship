      The purpose of this study is to assess innovative treatment methods in patients with adult&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as those at risk of developing ARDS.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARDS affects approximately 150,000 people in the United States each year. Despite twenty&#xD;
      years of research into the mechanisms that cause this syndrome and numerous developments in&#xD;
      the technology of mechanical ventilation, the mortality rate has remained greater than 50&#xD;
      percent. In addition to the tragic loss of human life, this condition poses a cost to society&#xD;
      because these patients spend an average of two weeks in intensive care units and require&#xD;
      multiple high tech procedures. Because of the overwhelming nature of the lung injury once it&#xD;
      is established, prevention appears to be the most effective strategy for improving the&#xD;
      outlook for those with ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic research has identified numerous inflammatory pathways that are associated with the&#xD;
      development of ARDS. Agents that block these mediators prolong survival in animals with lung&#xD;
      injury, and a few of them have been tested in human patients. Because of the large number of&#xD;
      putative mediators and the variety of ways that their action can be blocked, the possibility&#xD;
      for new drug development is almost infinite. This is an exciting prospect, since it envisions&#xD;
      the first effective pharmacologic treatment for ARDS. However, preliminary clinical studies&#xD;
      have shown conflicting results, and there is an urgent need for a mechanism to efficiently&#xD;
      and effectively test new drugs in ARDS. Treatment studies in patients with ARDS are difficult&#xD;
      to perform for three reasons. First, the complicated clinical picture makes it difficult to&#xD;
      accumulate a large number of comparable patients in any one center. Secondly, there is no&#xD;
      agreement on the optimal supportive care of these critically ill patients. Finally, many of&#xD;
      the patients meeting study criteria will not be enrolled in study protocols because of the&#xD;
      acute nature of the disease process. For these reasons, therapeutic trials in ARDS require&#xD;
      multicenter cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compared the effect of corticosteroids with placebo in the management of&#xD;
      late-phase (greater than seven days) ARDS. The study determined if the administration of the&#xD;
      corticosteroid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, in severe ARDS that was either stable or&#xD;
      worsening after seven days, would reduce mortality and morbidity. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ&#xD;
      failure-free days. LaSRS was designed to include 400 patients and began recruiting in the&#xD;
      Spring of 1997. In October 1999, the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) reduced the&#xD;
      recruitment target number to 200 patients because the eligible patients were fewer than&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;
