    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation is an international, prospective, double-blind, randomized safety&#xD;
      and efficacy study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of&#xD;
      the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent (1.0µg/mm2 of paclitaxel incorporated into slow- and&#xD;
      moderate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier system)in patients who present&#xD;
      for stenting of de novo lesions of a native coronary artery.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of coronary&#xD;
      artery stenting with the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent (1.0µg/mm2 of paclitaxel&#xD;
      incorporated into slow- and moderate-release formulation of a triblock copolymer carrier&#xD;
      system) for the treatment of de novo lesions in native vessels. Patients in 2 sequential&#xD;
      cohorts will be randomised to receive either the NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent or the&#xD;
      uncoated control stent. In cohort 1, the slow-release formulation NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated&#xD;
      Stent will be studied. If the safety profile is acceptable, the moderate-release formulation&#xD;
      NIRx(TM) Paclitaxel-Coated Stent will be studied in Cohort 2. In each f the 2 cohorts, 133&#xD;
      patients will be treated with the NIRx(TM) paclitaxel-Coated Stent and 133 with the uncoated&#xD;
      control stent (1.1 ratio), for a total of 532 patients in study.&#xD;
