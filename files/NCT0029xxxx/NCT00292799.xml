  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the role of the weight reduction agent, Orlistat compared to&#xD;
      the Metformin for the management of women who are obese and do not ovulate or have difficulty&#xD;
      conceiving. Patients will receive either one of these medications and will be monitored at&#xD;
      regular intervals with hormone blood tests and ultrasound scans in order to study the effect&#xD;
      of the medications on the reproductive functions. Patients will receive the medications for&#xD;
      three months and the study will end if the patient becomes pregnant. The study also aims to&#xD;
      investigate the dose of metformin that should be used as there is no consensus to date&#xD;
      regarding the optimum dosage for this drug&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to recruit 40 patients suffering from anovulatory obesity with a BMI of 30 or more.&#xD;
      Patients will be included from all ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a baseline history, clinical examination, hormonal profile (FSH/LH,&#xD;
      fasting Insulin/glucose ratio, androgen profile, day 21 serum progesterone, serum leptin and&#xD;
      ghrelin levels) ultrasound examination (ovarian volume and antral follicle count), including&#xD;
      Doppler blood flow study (ovarian stromal velocity, PI, RI, SD ratio and power Doppler)&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomised to receive either metformin or orlistat. Patients&#xD;
      receiving orlistat will receive the standard dose of the drug as recommended in the BNF.&#xD;
      Metformin will be given in an incremental dose starting at 1000mg per day and increased at 4&#xD;
      weekly intervals to 2000mg/d, depending on the occurrence of any gastrointestinal&#xD;
      intolerance. The endocrinological and ultrasound investigations will be repeated at 4 weekly&#xD;
      intervals. Both groups will be given a standard exercise and diet program in conjunction with&#xD;
      medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical endpoint will be the achievement of conception, a Body Mass Index of less than&#xD;
      30, or completion of a 3-month course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled open label clinical trial. Participants be randomised using a&#xD;
      computer generated randomisation program available at the pharmacy of the Jessop Wing, into&#xD;
      either one of two arms: metformin or orlistat. The randomisation will be stratified in order&#xD;
      to achieve a homogenous distribution of PCOS and non-PCOS patients in both arms of the study.&#xD;
