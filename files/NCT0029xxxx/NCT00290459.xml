      This proposal seeks to retain &quot;discard&quot; pieces of human gynecologic tissues and &quot;discard&quot;&#xD;
      ascites fluid collected during normal surgical procedures, along with corresponding blood&#xD;
      samples and urine, for research involving prognostic markers of disease/cancer. The specific&#xD;
      aims of the proposal include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To collect &quot;discard&quot; pieces of benign, pre-malignant and malignant gynecologic tissues,&#xD;
           &quot;discard&quot; ascites fluid and, when possible, corresponding blood and urine specimens from&#xD;
           patients undergoing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. excisions of cervical dysplasia and/or venereal warts, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. therapeutic excisional surgeries to remove gynecologic disease/cancer (uterine,&#xD;
                ovarian and lower female genital tract).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. paracentesis for the symptomatic relief of ascites fluid accumulation (distention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect pre-operative blood and urine from patients along with pre- operative blood&#xD;
           work drawn for clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. De-identify the patients from their donated tissue, blood and urine specimens by&#xD;
           assigning a laboratory identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rapidly process and store the collected specimens to preserve biological integrity.&#xD;
           (RNA, DNA and proteins)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collect and record the patient's demographic and medical information into a research&#xD;
           database under the assigned lab number only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the specimens for prognostic markers of gynecologic disease/cancer by molecular&#xD;
           techniques such as DNA arrays,immunohistochemistry and ELISA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades, cancer research has shifted from using cell lines and animal&#xD;
      models to directly using human tissue. This is especially true for research focused on&#xD;
      premalignancies for which there are few good animal models. Research utilizing human tissues&#xD;
      and sera not only addresses many issues/questions of medical research that cannot be&#xD;
      evaluated in cell lines and/or in animal models of human disease, but it also provides a&#xD;
      system to test the relevance of these findings to human diseases. Various biologic and&#xD;
      genetic changes that occur in the developmental stages of human neoplasia can be identified&#xD;
      and analyzed using human tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research using human tissues and sera is making great strides in the effort to define&#xD;
      possible markers of developing neoplasia and will promote the design of targeted cancer&#xD;
      treatments and possible prevention. It is important to link research findings in tissue and&#xD;
      blood specimens to the clinical outcome of patients with malignancy so we can pinpoint when&#xD;
      and where, during the course of cancer development, molecular changes occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many malignancies of the female genital tract may arise in more than one location, either&#xD;
      synchronously or metachronously, giving rise to the concept of a &quot;field&quot; effect of&#xD;
      carcinogenesis. By collecting tissue from multiple epithelial sites (sampled by the&#xD;
      physician) it is possible to compare the molecular changes seen in preinvasive to those that&#xD;
      occur in invasive neoplasia for differential expression profiles of potential markers. If&#xD;
      protein markers are identified in cells present in the diseased tissue we can check the&#xD;
      patient's serum and urine to see if the proteins can be detected. This information will&#xD;
      enable us to screen and possibly identify these protein markers in patient serum and urine to&#xD;
      correlate with the presence of a premalignant or malignant state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant ascites is excess fluid that accumulates in the space between the membranes lining&#xD;
      the abdomen and abdominal organs, otherwise known as the peritoneal, or abdominal cavity.&#xD;
      Malignant ascites typically occurs because of a disease, infection, or cancer in the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity that produces excessive fluid. Ascites fluid accumulation is very common in&#xD;
      gynecologic cancers, especially ovarian. If protein markers are identified in the cells&#xD;
      present in the diseased ascites fluid we may be able to correlate these markers with&#xD;
      metastasis of the disease/cancer and possibly help prevent the spread of several gynecologic&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
