      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether it is safe to treat patients with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer, with humanised A33 antibody tagged with radioactive iodine&#xD;
      (131I-huA33) in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine).&#xD;

      This clinical trial tests the combination of humanised A33 monoclonal antibody tagged with&#xD;
      radioactive iodine 131 (131I-huA33) together with capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When colorectal cancer has spread to other organs, it is generally considered incurable but&#xD;
      with a limited number of treatment options. Colorectal cancer cells express proteins on their&#xD;
      surface known as antigens, and one of these is called the A33 antigen. An antibody which&#xD;
      targets the A33 antigen was initially developed in the mouse and found to bind to human&#xD;
      colorectal cancer cells. Because humans developed immune reactions when given the mouse&#xD;
      antibody, an antibody, which is more like normal human antibodies, was developed (humanised&#xD;
      A33 antibody). In order to increase its effectiveness, radioactive iodine (131I) has been&#xD;
      attached to the antibody so that the antibody can deliver radiation directly to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that both the unlabelled humanised A33 antibody as&#xD;
      well as the humanised A33 antibody tagged with radioactive iodine can be administered safely&#xD;
      to humans with no major allergic reactions. The addition of chemotherapy to radiolabelled&#xD;
      131I-huA33 may result in a treatment that is more effective for the treatment of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer than either agent alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to give humanised A33 antibody&#xD;
      tagged with radioactive iodine together with chemotherapy. Different dose levels of&#xD;
      radioactive iodine attached to a constant dose of antibody will be given together with a&#xD;
      fixed total daily capecitabine chemotherapy dose. Providing humanised A33 antibody tagged&#xD;
      with radioactive iodine and chemotherapy is tolerated well without major side effects, the&#xD;
      dose of capecitabine chemotherapy given with 131I-huA33 will also be increased in order to&#xD;
      determine the highest dose that can be given safely in combination with radio-labelled&#xD;
      131I-huA33. The effectiveness of the treatment combination against advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have never previously received chemotherapy&#xD;
      using capecitabine may be eligible to participate in the study. A total of between 15 and 30&#xD;
      patients are expected to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening blood tests will be performed to determine eligibility, as well as baseline heart&#xD;
      and lung function tests and appropriate scans to measure tumour size and assess radiation&#xD;
      within the body. Patients will be given a trace labelled (small radiation dose) infusion of&#xD;
      131I-hu A33 into a vein followed a week later by the treatment infusion of 131I-hu A33. The&#xD;
      first infusion will be given as an outpatient but for the second patients will be&#xD;
      hospitalised and confined to a radiation shielded room until radiation levels fall to safe&#xD;
      limits. Oral iodine drops will also be given for 28 days in order to protect the thyroid&#xD;
      gland from the effects of radioactive iodine. Capecitabine chemotherapy will be taken orally&#xD;
      and will commence at the time of the treatment infusion. Each cycle of capecitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy involves the medication being taken twice per day for a total of 14 days&#xD;
      followed by 7 days rest. A total of 4 cycles of capecitabine will be given after the&#xD;
      treatment infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken just before the treatment infusion and then weekly for 9 weeks&#xD;
      and again at 12 weeks. There will be weekly physical examinations until 9 weeks after the&#xD;
      treatment infusion and again at 12 weeks. Total study duration is 13 weeks from the trace&#xD;
      labelled infusion of 131I-hu A33, that is 12 weeks from the treatment infusion of 131I-hu&#xD;
      A33. Patients will only receive one treatment infusion of 131I hu-A33 antibody.&#xD;
