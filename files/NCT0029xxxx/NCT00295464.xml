      Administration of steroid to the mother in imminent preterm delivery is a known effective&#xD;
      practice to decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular&#xD;
      haemorrhage in preterm infants if given with a week of the preterm delivery. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial is performed to test the possibility whether the repeat dose of steroid&#xD;
      results in further reduction of these diseases in case the mother is in imminent preterm&#xD;
      delivery more than a week after the first antenatal steroid treatment.&#xD;

      RANDOMIZED TRIAL ON EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THE ANTENATAL RESCUE COURSE OF GLUCOCORTCOID IN&#xD;
      THREATENED PREMATURE BIRTH (ACG trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prematurity is the main cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Immature infants have many&#xD;
      serious diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH),&#xD;
      chronic lung disease (CLD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity&#xD;
      (ROP). Corticosteroids have the maturational effects on fetal cardiovascular, respiratory,&#xD;
      nervous and gastrointestinal systems (1). Antenatal corticosteroids (ANC) have been widely&#xD;
      used for prevention of RDS and other serious diseases in preterm infants since 1972's, when&#xD;
      the controlled trial of antepartum glucocorticoid treatment was published. Administration of&#xD;
      s of 12 mg of betamethasone given twice intramuscularly 24 hours apart has shown to be&#xD;
      effective (2,3,4,39). Strong evidence exists for neonatal benefits from a complete course of&#xD;
      ANC starting at 24 hours and lasting up to 7 days after treatment (2,39). Betamethasone and&#xD;
      dexamethasone have similar biological activity and both are associated with a significant&#xD;
      reduction in the risk of RDS, but only betamethasone with a significant decrease of the&#xD;
      neonatal mortality. The clinical benefit had not been documented beyond 7 days after the&#xD;
      onset of ANC therapy. (1,2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized studies have shown that a single course of antenatal corticosteroid&#xD;
      treatment improves the survival of preterm infants born at 24-34 weeks gestation and&#xD;
      decreases the incidence of RDS, ICH and NEC. ANC therapy reduces the incidence of RDS by&#xD;
      approximately 50%.(1,2) ANC treatment also reduces the need of exogenous surfactant (4). The&#xD;
      protective effect against RDS is thought to be due to the structural maturation of the lungs,&#xD;
      increased surfactant synthesis, improved resistance to lung injury and improved&#xD;
      cardiovascular adaptation. Glucocorticoid speeds up the normal thinning of the gas-exchange&#xD;
      walls with double capillary loops between the air sacs. ANC thus accelerates the structural&#xD;
      development of the respiratory airways, but reduces the number of alveoli. Glucocorticoid&#xD;
      increases surfactant synthesis by enhancing maturation of the surfactant- producing type II&#xD;
      pneumocytes and stimulating the secretion of surfactant complex (1,6,7,8,9,40). Serial doses&#xD;
      of ANC may possibly downregulate steroid receptors resulting in decreased or disordered&#xD;
      surfactant production.(ref) ANC has not been shown to decrease the incidence of CLD at 28&#xD;
      days of age either in the meta-analysis or in the recent retrospective studies (2,13,14,15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANC treatment is associated with maturation of the cardiovascular system and normalisation of&#xD;
      the low blood pressure in the small premature infant at birth.(ref) This influence was&#xD;
      evident after administration of surfactant.(4) According to meta-analysis, ANC had no effect&#xD;
      on the incidence of PDA. However in several studies, use of ANC was associated with increased&#xD;
      spontaneous closure of PDA(2,3,4, ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANC decreases the incidence of ICH in preterm infants (2,3,4). Severe prematurity decreases&#xD;
      autoregulation of the cerebral circulation and predisposes to ICH or cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids accelerate differentiation of neuronal cells and possibly enhance maturation&#xD;
      of germinal matrix vessels (1,33,34). ANC therapy has been associated also with a lower&#xD;
      incidence of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and cerebral palsy (CP), but these effects&#xD;
      were not significant in Crowley's meta-analysis (2,3,4,5). In a recently published&#xD;
      retrospective study, antenatal administration of betamethasone was associated with a&#xD;
      decreased risk of PVL compared to antenatal dexamethasone or no treatment (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Betamethasone is clinically used as a mixture of betamethasone phosphate (6 mg) and&#xD;
      betamethasone acetate (6 mg), providing a rapid exposure from the phosphate form and a&#xD;
      sustained exposure from the acetate form. Maximal fetal serum level of betamethasone was&#xD;
      attained 1-2 hours after ANC treatment (27). The half life of antenatally administered&#xD;
      betamethasone is about 12 hours in fetal circulation (1,36). Decrease in the incidence of RDS&#xD;
      is evident when ANC is administered between 24 hours and 7 days before delivery. However, the&#xD;
      incidence of ICH is decreased even with treatment initiated less than 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      delivery (2,3,4). According to the animal studies the short term ANC (&lt;24 hours) improves the&#xD;
      postnatal lung function, decreases the protein leak into the lung and alters postnatal blood&#xD;
      pressure regulation in the premature. ANC also seems to augment the postnatal neuroendocrine&#xD;
      and endocrine responses to hypoxic challenge (28,29,30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to meta-analysis there is no significant decrease in birthweight and in physical or&#xD;
      psychological development at the age 3-12 years following a single course of ANC treatment of&#xD;
      fetuses (2,18,19). According to follow-up studies, prenatal single course of steroid&#xD;
      treatment is safe and enhanced survival is not associated with a higher incidence of&#xD;
      disabilities or developmental disturbances in survivors during childhood and young adulthood&#xD;
      (2,3,5,18,19,35). Single course of ANC treatment did not increase the risk of fetal or&#xD;
      neonatal infections or the incidence of maternal infections (2). When administered during the&#xD;
      subclinical chorioamnionitis, ANC treatment seem to decrease the incidence of RDS, ICH, PVL&#xD;
      and neonatal mortality without apparent increase in neonatal sepsis (32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is concern about possible negative effect of multiple course of ANC on&#xD;
      birthweight, head circumference and growth later in childhood. Data from numerous animal&#xD;
      studies suggest that ANC has a negative effect on pre- and postnatal growth. Most studies&#xD;
      deal with rodents who have a short gestation and period of growth (10,11,12,37). In animal&#xD;
      studies multidose ANC exposure has also decreased lung growth, which seems to be irreversible&#xD;
      and persistent into adulthood (10,11,12). Also, in several animal studies ANC exposure has&#xD;
      shown decreased brain growth and cell proliferation, which may also be due to short duration&#xD;
      of gestation and long duration of exposure (10,11,12,37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are concerns about potential suppressive effects of ANC on the fetal&#xD;
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Transient suppression of the pituitary-adrenal glands in&#xD;
      preterm infants whose mothers have received 1-2 doses of antenatal glucocorticoid, reportedly&#xD;
      recovers within 7 days of life (23,24,25,26,36). Infants delivered shortly after one course&#xD;
      of ANC are normally responsive to stress after birth (e.g. RDS and asphyxia).(36)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical practice administering antenatal corticosteroids varies greatly between individual&#xD;
      centers during the late 1990's. The practice of repeating the course of ANC has become&#xD;
      widespread. However the safety or efficacy of serial courses of glucocorticoid is not known.&#xD;
      According to recently published non-randomized studies there is conflicting data on growth&#xD;
      and neonatal morbidity of infants exposed to single vs. multiple course of ANC (13,14,15).&#xD;
      There is also concern particularly in women with prolonged premature rupture of fetal&#xD;
      membranes (PPROM) that repetitive doses may increase maternal and fetal infections (21,22).&#xD;
      In a retrospective study the multiple course of ANC was associated with an increased&#xD;
      incidence of maternal postpartum infections (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of multiple courses of ANC on the HPA-axis is not well known. In recent studies a&#xD;
      mild adrenal suppression was evident in some of the preterm infants whose mothers received&#xD;
      more than eight courses of ANC (15). It has also been proposed that perinatal stress and&#xD;
      exposure to corticosteroids induces long lasting changes in HPA-axis and is associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in stress induced CRH release in adulthood (24,34). However, there is no existing&#xD;
      data about function of HPA-axis in young adults, who have been exposed to antenatal&#xD;
      corticosteroids during fetal life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is insufficient data about optimal interval of ANC administration. According to recent&#xD;
      studies there is not additive positive effects of the practice of repeating the course of ANC&#xD;
      at 7 days intervals. However, it is known that the positive influence of the one course of&#xD;
      ANC is not evident after 7 days of administration. It is interesting whether one additional&#xD;
      rescue course of ANC given within 24 hours before premature delivery is more effective than&#xD;
      single course of ANC. No prospective studies or randomized, controlled trials comparing&#xD;
      single versus second rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present aim is to study whether in recipients of ANC a single dose of betamethasone given&#xD;
      shortly before spontaneous or elective premature birth (gestation 24 + 0 - 33 + 6 wk)&#xD;
      improves the neonatal outcome without causing serious side effects. According to protocol,&#xD;
      aim is to start the placebo or the second rescue course of ANC in 48 hours before expected&#xD;
      delivery. The first hypothesis states that administration of second rescue course of ANC is&#xD;
      more effective than the single course of ANC in increasing the intact survival at term of all&#xD;
      infants without major neonatal morbidity, defined by the protocol. The principal outcome is&#xD;
      survival of premature infants without major morbidity until the age of 36+0 weeks and&#xD;
      survival of infants born at term during early neonatal period without the major morbidity, as&#xD;
      defined by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present study is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      benefits and side effects of single vs. second rescue course of antenatal corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnant women will be eligible for the trial entry if all following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  administration of a course of antenatal corticosteroid at least 7 days before the trial&#xD;
           entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gestational age is less than 33.0 weeks 6 days*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  very high risk of premature delivery**&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  none of the following therapies complications or therapies maternal long term systemic&#xD;
           corticosteroid therapy severe clinical chorioamnionitis (maternal fever, increased CRP&#xD;
           or another acute phase protein, uterine tenderness) lethal disease of the fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  informed consent obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  premature rupture of membranes is not contraindication for the trial entry&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Gestational age will be calculated from the mother's last menstrual period and&#xD;
           confirmed by ultrasound before 20 weeks' gestation. In case the discrepancy in the&#xD;
           estimates exceeds two weeks, ultrasound date is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           **Very high risk of premature delivery is described as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elective delivery within within 4-48 hours, as indicated by the obstetrician on the&#xD;
           basis of the clinical status of the mother and/or the fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  very high risk of spontaneous delivery within 4-48 hours, i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cervix is open &gt; 3 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  contractions of the uterus at 5-10 min intervals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rupture of the membranes after the first course of ANC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fetal and/or maternal indication for elective premature delivery or cesarean section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or his/her designated representative will evaluate the pregnant women for&#xD;
      the above eligibility criteria. Administration of one course of antenatal glucocorticoid&#xD;
      identifies the pregnant mothers that are potentially eligible to present study. Oral and&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained from the women (if appropriate). The study entry&#xD;
      (randomization and administration of the drug) takes place when all entry criteria are met.&#xD;
      The parturient and her randomization number will be recorded on the trial data form and on&#xD;
      patient records to enable later description of the women and to assist follow up. At the time&#xD;
      of delivery the infants of the trial participants will be recorded to the trial data form and&#xD;
      on patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible women will be randomly and blindly assigned to receive either betamethasone or&#xD;
      saline placebo. The randomization will take place separately in each Center according to the&#xD;
      following strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I gestation at entry less than 28.0 weeks + 0 days and singleton pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      II gestation at entry 28.0 weeks + 0 days or more but less than 33.0 weeks + 6 days and&#xD;
      singleton pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      III gestation at entry less than 28.0 weeks + 0 days and multiple pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV gestation at entry 28.0 weeks + 0 days or more but less than 33.0 weeks + 6 days and&#xD;
      multiple pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first course of ANC prior to the trial entry will be given according to the clinical&#xD;
      indications of the Center. Administration of further courses of ANC before the trial entry&#xD;
      will disqualify the mother from the ACG trial. The study course of betamethasone or placebo&#xD;
      will be given to each eligible woman at least 7 days after the first course of ANC. After the&#xD;
      entry criteria are met betamethasone (12mg) or placebo (normal saline) will be drawn to a&#xD;
      sealed syringe containing the randomization number. The drug or placebo is administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1 hour the betamethasone dose increases the fetal serum levels of glucocorticoid to&#xD;
      those obtained during neonatal stress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other obstetric and neonatal management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other management given to the participating women will be decided by the obstetrician. After&#xD;
      the entry to the trial administration of ANC outside study protocol is not allowed. In an&#xD;
      event premature delivery did not occur after ACG, any further administration of ANC is not&#xD;
      indicated. The premature infants are treated in whatever way their condition demands, the&#xD;
      decision is made by pediatrician. The ACG trial infants born after 33.0 + 6 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy are included in the neonatal and the follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetuses that died after the trial entry will be recorded. The pathologic examination of these&#xD;
      fetuses is strongly encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of the trial:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Treatments requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      surfactant postnatal steroids indomethacin for PDA PDA surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome at follow up study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival without neurologic, sensory or neuromotor impairment at the age 2 years, corrected&#xD;
      for gestation. All infants will be studied. For the high-risk group, the following indices&#xD;
      and studies will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Development Index (MDI) (&lt;70) Psychomotor development will be measured by Bayley Scale&#xD;
      (PDI) Behavioral development index (percentile) Definition of abnormalities in neurological&#xD;
      status, speech development, major visual handicap and hearing defect&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes during the follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth characteristics during the first two years of corrected age Recurrent infections&#xD;
      Reactive airway disease Hospital treatment during early childhood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be collected at the time of delivery, during the hospital stay and when the&#xD;
      baby leaves the hospital or dies. Perinatal data will include prenatal history, assessment of&#xD;
      entry criteria and following information of postnatal condition: blood pressure monitoring,&#xD;
      assessment of growth at birth, day 28 and at 36 weeks gestational age (height, weight and&#xD;
      head circumference). Cranial ultrasound will be made on all infants at least between days 4-8&#xD;
      of life and at 36.0 w + 0 d (± 3 days) gestational age or before discharge. The worst grade&#xD;
      of ICH and PVL will be reported. The first ophthalmologic examination for retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity will be done 4 to 7 weeks after birth or at 32 weeks gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical status will be assessed at the time of discharge. The cause of death will be defined&#xD;
      when possible at autopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surviving children will be studied at two years of age (corrected for gestational age).&#xD;
      Their growth and neurodevelopment will be evaluated using a questionnaire and a clinical&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to detect the effects of two vs. single course of ANC on&#xD;
      survival without RDS and/or severe ICH (grade 3-4) by 36 weeks + 0 days of gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size analysis is based on morbidity and mortality from the Finnish perinatal&#xD;
      statistics (National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health) and from Vermont&#xD;
      Oxford Network Database (VON). We estimate that a second additional dose of betamethasone&#xD;
      would increase the survival without RDS and severe ICH from 50% to 62.5%. According to power&#xD;
      analysis the sample size of 220 women would be required in each arm to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis with and α of 0.05 and power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the follow up study is to find out that one course of ANC result in equal or&#xD;
      better neurodevelopmental outcome at the corrected age of two years, compared a single course&#xD;
      of ANC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary outcomes will be based on an intention to treat analysis of all&#xD;
      randomized subjects. Another analysis will be performed excluding infants who had congenital&#xD;
      lethal malformation that was not detected at the onset. The outcome will be compared for the&#xD;
      two vs. single course of ANC using the Mantel-Haenszel chi square test stratifying by the&#xD;
      prenatal variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequencies of categorical outcomes will be compared using appropriate chi square tests.&#xD;
      The growth parameters, duration of ventilation, supplemental oxygen administration and&#xD;
      hospitalization will be compared using analysis of variance or nonparametric tests when&#xD;
      applicable. Survival rate will be compared using chi square tests and survival to term using&#xD;
      survival analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neonatal and the follow-up results for adverse outcomes will be prepared by the Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee when altogether 350 study infants have reached to the term or&#xD;
      when the trial has been going on for 24 months, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent will be obtained from all the parents of the infants before the&#xD;
      enrollment. The participation in the study does not cause any extra cost to the mother or the&#xD;
      family. Participation is voluntary and withdrawing from the study is possible whenever&#xD;
      desired during the pregnancy, the hospital stay or during the follow up period. Withdrawal&#xD;
      does not affect the treatment or the follow up of the infant or the mother. If desired,&#xD;
      approval from the ethical committees of each participating center will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perinatal-neonatal trial and the follow up study will be published separately. The list&#xD;
      of authors includes Antenatal Multiple Betamethasone Trial Study Group (AMBTS). Each&#xD;
      participant of the study from each Center will be listed. Each Center has an antenatal and a&#xD;
      postnatal trial coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are free to perform ancillary studies provided that a separate protocol,&#xD;
      submitted together with the present one, is accepted by the local ethics committees.&#xD;
