  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A trial was conducted in the 1980s to compare two strategies for control of malaria in young&#xD;
      children aged 3-59 months: treatment with chloroquine versus treatment combined with&#xD;
      fortnightly chemoprophylaxis with Maloprim. The impact on mortality and morbidity was&#xD;
      assessed at the time, and their cognitive abilities and educational outcomes were assess 14&#xD;
      years later in 2001. The hypothesis was that the chemoprophylaxis would reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and would improve cognitive abilities and educational outcomes in the long term&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two drug strategies for the control of malaria in children aged 3-59 months have been&#xD;
      compared in a rural area of The Gambia - treatment of presumptive episodes of clinical&#xD;
      malaria with chloroquine by village health workers, and treatment combined with fortnightly&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis (pyrimethamine/dapsone) which was also given by village health workers.&#xD;
      Treatment alone did not have any significant effect on mortality or morbidity from malaria.&#xD;
      In contrast, treatment and chemoprophylaxis reduced overall mortality in children aged 1-4&#xD;
      years, mortality from probable malaria, and episodes of fever associated with malaria&#xD;
      parasitaemia. A high level of compliance with chemoprophylaxis was obtained and no harmful&#xD;
      consequences of chemoprophylaxis were observed. Chemoprophylaxis was offered to all children&#xD;
      at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 years after the end of the trial, participants cognitive abilities and educational&#xD;
      attainment were assessed. Associations have been found between malaria infection and poor&#xD;
      cognitive ability but causality has not yet been demonstrated through preventative trials and&#xD;
      the long-term impact of malaria has not been investigated. 1190 children who had participated&#xD;
      in the original trial for at least one year were targetted for follow-up. 579 were traced.&#xD;
      Those who had received chemoprophylaxis attended school for 0.52 years more than the placebo&#xD;
      group (p=.069). There was no overall effect on cognitive abilities but there was a&#xD;
      significant treatment effect for cohorts that had not received chemoprophylaxis at the end of&#xD;
      the trial or who had received less than one year of post-trial prophylaxis&#xD;
