  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, randomized study of NY-ESO-l protein with immune adjuvants CpG&#xD;
      7909 and Montanide® ISA-51 and NY-ESO-l protein 400µg with immune adjuvants CpG 7909 and&#xD;
      Montanide® ISA-51 in patients with tumors that often express NY-ESO-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccinations will be administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks for 4 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with any malignancy that is known to frequently express NY-ESO-1 will be eligible,&#xD;
      regardless of whether antigen expression in the autologous tumor can be demonstrated or not&#xD;
      by either PCR or immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to define the safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the study will evaluate whether patients develop a specific immunologic response&#xD;
      to the NY-ESO-1 protein. Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, prior to each&#xD;
      vaccination, one week after each vaccination, and at the last study visit for the assessment&#xD;
      of NY-ESO-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Cytokine secretion by NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+ and&#xD;
      CD4+ T-cells, as a measure of T-cell activation, will be determined by FACS analysis. In&#xD;
      addition, humoral immunity will be determined by the presence of NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies&#xD;
      which will be assessed in all patients by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease status will be assessed at baseline and 2-4 weeks after the fourth vaccination in&#xD;
      patients with evaluable (measurable and non-measurable disease).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You will receive an investigational (research) cancer vaccine every 3 weeks for a total of 4&#xD;
      treatments. It is given by injection underneath your skin in an extremity (leg or arm). A&#xD;
      vaccine is a compound designed to strengthen the immune system (the cells and substances that&#xD;
      protect the body from infection and foreign matter) to fight an illness such as infections or&#xD;
      cancer. This vaccine is called NY-ESO-1 protein. NY-ESO protein (an antigen, which is a&#xD;
      compound that is recognized by the immune system) is found in many cancers. Proteins such as&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1 and their fragments are the targets the immune system needs to recognize cancer&#xD;
      cells. If the immune system can recognize these antigens (foreign substances) it may be able&#xD;
      to kill the cells that carry them. NY-ESO-1 can be found at different stages of cancers, and&#xD;
      is likely to be expressed (shown) at some point in the lifecycle of these types of cancer&#xD;
      (that are eligible for this study). Therefore this study tries to boost (strengthen) the&#xD;
      immune system toward NY-ESO-1 protein regardless of whether it is found in your tumor or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we do not know whether different doses of the NY-ESO-1 protein may result in varying&#xD;
      degrees of immune stimulation, we will be randomizing (that is, at the flip of a coin or, in&#xD;
      other words, by chance) you may receive either the lower dose of NY-ESO-1 protein (100 µg) or&#xD;
      the higher dose (400 µg.) There is a 50:50 chance that you will receive the lower versus the&#xD;
      higher dose. At this time we have no way of knowing whether there will be any real difference&#xD;
      in the effects between these doses. In either case you will be receiving the NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      protein. In all studies to date, only the 100 µg dose has been used. There is no reason to&#xD;
      think that the higher dose will be toxic, nor is there any reason at this time to think that&#xD;
      the higher dose will be more effective at the immunological level, although it may be, which&#xD;
      is the reason for comparing the effects of these two doses of protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine is mixed with 2 substances, called adjuvants (the full names&#xD;
      are: CPG 7909 and Montanide ISA-51). Adjuvants are substances to increase the vaccine's&#xD;
      ability to stimulate the immune system. By adding two adjuvants to the vaccine, it is hoped&#xD;
      that the boosting of the immune system will be especially effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to understand, that vaccines are only experimental (investigational,&#xD;
      research) for the treatment of cancer. They are not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) as treatment. Therefore they are only offered in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests and treatments will be performed as an outpatient.&#xD;
