  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALTU-238 is a long acting crystalline formulation of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH)&#xD;
      that is being developed for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in adults and&#xD;
      children. ALTU-238 is designed to require fewer injections than the currently available&#xD;
      formulations of rhGH.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Growth hormone deficient men and women ages 18-60 years with a hypothalamic and/or&#xD;
             pituitary structural lesion or longstanding idiopathic GHD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Growth hormone deficiency as determined by pituitary testing within the last five&#xD;
             years by either of the two following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Insulin hypoglycemia (glucose &lt; 50 mg/dL) with maximum GH &lt; 5 ng/mL (5 µg/L) by&#xD;
                  radioimmunoassay or &lt; 2.5 µg/L, if measured by immunoradiometric assay&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Arginine-GHRH infusions with maximum GH &lt; 5 ng/mL (5 µg/L) or &lt; 2.5 µg/L, if&#xD;
                  measured by immunoradiometric assay&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be of non-child bearing potential (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or IUD are&#xD;
             acceptable) during the three months prior to entering the study, or post-menopausal&#xD;
             (no menses for one year or more), or six to twelve months without menses and&#xD;
             β-estradiol levels &lt; 20 pg/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Glucocorticoid use is allowed provided the subject has been on physiologic (&lt;7.5 mg&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent/day) replacement doses for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free thyroxine (T4) within the normal range at Screening. If the subject is receiving&#xD;
             thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the dose must be stable for at least 6 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous or ongoing clinically significant illness that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, could prevent the subject from completing the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of cancer within the past 5 years, except for dermal squamous and basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma with documented 6-month remission. Subjects with a more recent history&#xD;
             of successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ will not be excluded provided there&#xD;
             is documented 12-month remission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &lt;20 or &gt;36 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any allergic or abnormal reaction to human growth hormone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability of the subject to discontinue use of their regularly prescribed human growth&#xD;
             hormone treatment from six weeks prior to Day -1 through the completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia or any other disorder which may affect bone and bone&#xD;
             markers including the use of bisphosphonates or other medications for osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated inability to comply with protocol requirements (e.g. uncooperative&#xD;
             attitude, inability to return for follow-up visits, history of medical non-compliance,&#xD;
             and/or poor likelihood of completing the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation within 56 days of the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma donation within seven days of the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serum pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse of alcohol; to be determined by principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse of prescription or illicit drugs; to be determined by principal investigator&#xD;
