      RESEARCH PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Cesarean Delivery and Postoperative Pain Management with Local Anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators: Aaron Deutsch, MD, Principal Investigator Shelly Holmstrom, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain control has become a more prominent clinical issue. Typically, a patient undergoing a&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery is administered spinal anesthesia just prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain is managed with intravenous (IV) narcotics using a patient controlled&#xD;
      anesthesia (PCA) pump device. Once the patient can tolerate oral medications, the PCA pump is&#xD;
      discontinued and the patient uses oral narcotic medications for pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that injecting a local anesthetic in the subcutaneous tissue along the&#xD;
      incision can reduce postoperative pain. The objective of this study is randomly assign&#xD;
      patients to receive a local anesthetic or normal saline in the tissues surrounding the&#xD;
      incision and to study the amount of pain experienced postoperatively in these groups of&#xD;
      patients. Our hypothesis is that the patients receiving the local anesthesia along their&#xD;
      incision will have significantly less pain postoperatively and use less narcotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To decrease postoperative pain in women undergoing Cesarean delivery Secondary: To&#xD;
      decrease narcotic use, potentially decrease hospital length of stay, and increase patient&#xD;
      satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background, Study Rationale and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthesia injected at the incision site fro reduced postoperative pain has been&#xD;
      studied in other abdominal surgeries. The research has demonstrated the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      technique for reduced postoperative pain. One journal article describes a technique similar&#xD;
      to the proposed research project1. However, this article did not show any significant&#xD;
      difference in the postoperative pain following bupivacaine or normal saline injection of the&#xD;
      skin. The authors' conclusion for this lack of significance was due to their facility's high&#xD;
      quality analgesia via supplemental subarachnoid morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous other authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of using local anesthesia at&#xD;
      incision sites for reducing pain postoperatively2-4. The proposed research project has the&#xD;
      potential to decrease pain postoperatively, decrease hospital length of stay and increase&#xD;
      patient satisfaction for one of the most common surgeries in the United States of America.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients currently undergoing a repeat Cesarean delivery with a history of a previous&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery through a Pfannenstiel skin incision will be eligible to enroll in this&#xD;
      study. All ages and races will be eligible. Exclusion criteria include patients with a&#xD;
      primary Cesarean delivery, prior vertical skin incision or an allergy to bupivacaine. The&#xD;
      projected sample size required for this study is 100 (50 patients in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to either the bupivacaine or placebo (normal saline) group. An opaque envelope will contain a&#xD;
      slip of paper indicating which fluid is to be injected. The anesthesiologist will open the&#xD;
      envelope during the surgery and prepare 30 ml of the study drug. The patients will have their&#xD;
      incision site injected with either the bupivacaine or normal saline at the completion of the&#xD;
      surgery. The patients will be asked to assess their level of pain following the surgery on&#xD;
      postoperative days 0, 1, 2 and 3 using a visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the patients receiving the bupivacaine injection will experience&#xD;
      significantly less postoperative pain and use significantly less IV and oral narcotic&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Subject Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  there are minimal to no additional risks to the patients in this study. Bupivacaine is a&#xD;
           time proven safe drug (barring patient not allergic) and our dose will be far below&#xD;
           toxicity levels. There are no social risks or risks of confidentiality as patients will&#xD;
           not be personally identified in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  benefits: the benefits to the patient would be a higher satisfaction due to better pain&#xD;
           control. Additionally, patients may require less narcotics post-operatively and a&#xD;
           potentially shorter hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient information will be kept track of via name and med rec number for chart review&#xD;
           after study completion to assess all data. This info will be limited to only the primary&#xD;
           investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of note the fetus will be delivered prior to the time of anesthetic administration, so&#xD;
           they will not be exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained at the time of consent for cesarian&#xD;
      delivery. The resident obtaining consent will also obtain the research consent. This will&#xD;
      consist of explaining that the patient may receive either a local anesthetic or placebo to&#xD;
      help assess better post-op pain control. Possible benefits will be explained along with&#xD;
      minimal risks- no more than normal for a cesarian delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent process will be available in Spanish and English when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sample size/power analysis: statistical power for the study to show a statistical&#xD;
           difference was calculated to approx 33 patients in each arm- we will extend to 50.&#xD;
