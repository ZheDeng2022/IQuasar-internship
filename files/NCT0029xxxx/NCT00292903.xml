      This study will compare the effectiveness of brief interpersonal psychotherapy versus&#xD;
      standard treatment for pregnant women with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious condition affecting millions of people each year. In fact, it is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately one in every four women will be treated for a mood disorder,&#xD;
      such as depression, at some point in her life. As effective treatment options continue to&#xD;
      develop, many women diagnosed with depression are able to resume normal lives and may choose&#xD;
      to become pregnant. Also, some women become depressed when pregnant. Interpersonal&#xD;
      psychotherapy involves treating psychological difficulties by analyzing problems, talking&#xD;
      about possible solutions, and learning more helpful ways of thinking and acting. Brief&#xD;
      interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-B) is a well-tested psychotherapy for depression that has&#xD;
      been shortened and modified. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      IPT-B to reduce depressive symptoms in women during pregnancy and to prevent the continuation&#xD;
      or recurrence of their depression postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either IPT-B or a&#xD;
      facilitated referral for treatment as usual (F-TAU) at an outpatient clinic or community&#xD;
      mental health center. Participants assigned to IPT-B will be scheduled to attend eight&#xD;
      treatment sessions along with their prenatal clinic visits within a 16-week period. Each&#xD;
      treatment session will begin with a brief 1-minute evaluation to assess participants' level&#xD;
      of depression and will end with a brief evaluation of the session. Participants will attend&#xD;
      follow-up sessions every 2 weeks until 3 months postpartum and then monthly until 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum. These sessions will include evaluation of participants' level of depression,&#xD;
      identification of any difficulties or problems that participants may be experiencing, and&#xD;
      review of how to manage these problems using skills learned during treatment. Participants&#xD;
      assigned to receive F-TAU will be provided with verbal and written information regarding&#xD;
      their depressive symptoms. They will also receive a referral for treatment at a behavioral&#xD;
      health clinic. Participants receiving F-TAU will be assessed via telephone at Weeks 6 and 12.&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed via telephone at Months 2 and 6 postpartum to measure their&#xD;
      level of depression.&#xD;
