&#xD;
          -  Male or female, at least 18 years of age&#xD;

          -  Unequivocal histologic or cytologic diagnosis of AML (based on the WorldHealth&#xD;
             Organization [WHO] and/or FAB classifications), excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia&#xD;
             (FAB M3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AML patients with a history of antecedent MDS or MPD are eligible for treatment in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to voluntarily provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determination of the presence or absence of a FLT3-ITD mutation before enrollment once&#xD;
             it is ascertained that determination of FLT3-ITD mutation status is required to avoid&#xD;
             exceeding enrollment in either patient group&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an active malignancy other than AML at the time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented or suspected central nervous system leukemia involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known gastrointestinal disease that could interfere with the absorption of oral&#xD;
             tandutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe central nervous system, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease not related to AML&#xD;
&#xD;

             (NYHA) Class III or Class IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled&#xD;
             ventricular arrhythmias, or ECG evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system&#xD;
             abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc &gt;500 milliseconds (ms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history of or congenital QTc prolongation&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 x the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &gt;4.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;

             or myasthenia gravis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of prior antineoplastic therapy for leukemia, except that prior therapy with&#xD;
             the following is allowed:&#xD;

               -  Leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment for hyperleukocytosis with hydroxyurea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of prior antineoplastic therapy for MDS, except that prior therapy with the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Anagrelide (Agrylin®)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hydroxyurea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antineoplastic, experimental, or radiation therapy within 3 weeks before Day 1, except&#xD;
