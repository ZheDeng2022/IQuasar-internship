  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of caesarean section has reached 15-20% in most developed countries.&#xD;
      Encouraging vaginal birth after caesareans section (VBAC) has been considered a key component&#xD;
      of a strategy to reduce the caesarean section rate. Most medical literature has focused on&#xD;
      the efficacy of VBAC in reducing the caesarean section rate and the physical safety of&#xD;
      successful VBAC. However, 30%-40% of these women fail to achieve a vaginal delivery. Little&#xD;
      is known about how the uncertainty of labour outcome and a failed VBAC impact on the&#xD;
      psychosocial function of these women. What we do know is that antenatal depression and&#xD;
      unplanned caesarean section are major risk factors for postpartum depression, which in turn&#xD;
      is the major cause of maternal mortality in many developed countries including Hong Kong. We&#xD;
      propose to study a cohort of women with a prior caesarean section and presenting with a&#xD;
      subsequent pregnancy for care. After consent and recruitment, these subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to have a repeat caesarean section or VBAC. The medical outcomes, overall&#xD;
      satisfaction of the subjects with the care they received, and the short-term psychosocial&#xD;
      function of these subjects will be studied. The result of this study will provide important&#xD;
      information that would be useful in assisting women to decide the mode of delivery after a&#xD;
      prior caesarean section. The Hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in&#xD;
      psychosocial function between these 2 groups of patients.&#xD;
