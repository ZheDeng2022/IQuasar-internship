    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney failure have a poor survival rate that is due to a much higher than&#xD;
      average rate of heart and vascular disease. The reason that kidney failure causes heart&#xD;
      disease is unknown but recent research suggests that a hormone called aldosterone, which is&#xD;
      increased in patients with kidney disease may damage the heart and blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose, using a randomized blinded trial, to find out whether drugs that&#xD;
      inhibit the actions of aldosterone have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in&#xD;
      patients with kidney failure&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease leads to the death of over half of patients with chronic renal failure&#xD;
      (CRF) but the causes of this 'vasculopathy' remain unknown. Aldosterone is present in the&#xD;
      circulation of renal failure patients at high levels and is known to exert damaging effects&#xD;
      upon the myocardium, vasculature and autonomic nervous system. Patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      determine the effect of chronic treatment with an aldosterone receptor inhibitor on left&#xD;
      ventricular mass, diastolic function, arterial stiffness and autonomic function. All of these&#xD;
      endpoints are predictors of mortality so that the results of this study may yield information&#xD;
      of prognostic value and provide the basis for a future mortality study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in CRF accounting for&#xD;
      approximately 60% of deaths. Across the age range, cardiovascular mortality is 10 and 20&#xD;
      times greater than controls but in young patients the relative risk is extreme. Dialysis&#xD;
      patients under the age of 45 have over 100 times the risk of cardiovascular death than the&#xD;
      control population. An increased risk is also present in patients with mild renal impairment,&#xD;
      which has been estimated to occur in approximately 8% of the population. Thus, renal&#xD;
      dysfunction is a potentially important risk factor for coronary artery disease in the general&#xD;
      population. This study builds upon previous and current BHF funded work by Dr Townend and&#xD;
      colleagues in Birmingham (PG97/162 and PG02/153) which has resulted in a number of&#xD;
      publications in the area of cardiovascular disease in renal failure but takes a new approach&#xD;
      examining the potential role of aldosterone in renal 'vasculopathy'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of myocardial and vascular disease in chronic renal failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main pathological features of the cardiovascular system of patients with renal failure&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LVH often accompanied by systolic and diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arterial wall thickening, stiffening and calcification (arteriosclerosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coronary and peripheral artery atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in renal failure is poorly understood but as&#xD;
      renal function declines, a range of abnormalities occur that may exert adverse effects upon&#xD;
      the cardiovascular system. Hypertension, chronic anaemia and activation of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system all contribute to&#xD;
      the development of myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. The same abnormalities may also lead&#xD;
      to muscular hypertrophy and fibrosis of the arterial walls including the aorta. In&#xD;
      combination with an increase in extracellular matrix, loss of elastic fibres and diffuse&#xD;
      medial calcification, the arterial wall changes lead to arterial 'stiffening'. In addition to&#xD;
      these adverse haemodynamic and structural changes, endothelial injury, the first&#xD;
      physiological manifestation of atherosclerosis, occurs early in the course of renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension, anaemia, chronic inflammation, an atherogenic lipid profile, diabetes and less&#xD;
      certainly hyperhomocysteinaemia and abnormal calcium/phosphate metabolism are possible causes&#xD;
      of endothelial injury and recent evidence suggests that to this list should now be added&#xD;
      angiotensin II (ANG II) and aldosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldosterone and cardiovascular disease: The fundamental role of the RAAS in cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease is apparent from the results of many large ACE inhibitor trials. In patients with&#xD;
      chronic heart failure and in those with or at high risk of coronary artery disease, ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors improve survival, functional status and hospitalisation. These beneficial effects&#xD;
      have been attributed to prevention of the multiple adverse effects of ANG II. More recently,&#xD;
      evidence has accumulated in support of an important role for aldosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persistent elevation of ANG II and aldosterone concentrations during ACE inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy is often termed 'escape'. Aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex persists in&#xD;
      response to ANG II (produced by the non ACE enzymatic conversions of ANG I) and a rise in&#xD;
      plasma potassium. Comparison of the effects of adding ANG II receptor blockers (ARB) and&#xD;
      aldosterone receptor antagonists to ACE inhibitors in heart failure trials suggests that it&#xD;
      is aldosterone escape that exerts the greater pathophysiological effects. In ValHeFT the&#xD;
      addition of valsartan to ACE inhibitor therapy had no detectable effect on mortality. In both&#xD;
      the RALES and EPHESUS trials however, mortality was significantly reduced by the addition of&#xD;
      spironolactone (RALES) or eplerenone (EPHESUS) to standard therapy including ACE inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldosterone is synthesised in numerous tissues and mineralocorticoid receptors are present in&#xD;
      the brain, heart and blood vessels as well as the kidney. In addition to its physiological&#xD;
      role in the kidney aldosterone exerts several pathological actions on the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endothelial dysfunction: The administration of aldosterone and sodium to rats results in&#xD;
           transmural coronary arterial inflammation with monocyte and macrophage infiltration and&#xD;
           the expression of inflammatory markers such as COX-2, MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The&#xD;
           administration of an aldosterone antagonist markedly reduced this inflammatory response.&#xD;
           Although a similar response occurred with infusion of ANG II, this was in part dependent&#xD;
           on aldosterone synthesis as it was reduced by adrenalectomy but restored by aldosterone&#xD;
           infusion. In vitro, vascular endothelial fibrinolysis is inhibited by aldosterone as a&#xD;
           result of an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). In humans, primary&#xD;
           hyperaldosteronism is associated with endothelial dysfunction compared to normal and&#xD;
           hypertensive controls. In patients with chronic heart failure, aldosterone receptor&#xD;
           blockade with spironolactone results in significant improvement in endothelial dependent&#xD;
           vasodilatation and vascular nitric oxide bioactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Myocardial and vascular hypertrophy and fibrosis: Aldosterone appears to cause&#xD;
           myocardial and vascular injury independently of effects on blood pressure. Chronic&#xD;
           aldosterone infusion and sodium loading resulted in myocardial fibrosis and ventricular&#xD;
           hypertrophy in rats. Treatment with aldosterone receptor antagonists prevented aortic&#xD;
           and myocardial fibrosis in rat models of hypertension even in the absence of blood&#xD;
           pressure lowering. In addition, in aldosterone treated stroke-prone hypertensive rats,&#xD;
           spironolactone exerted a powerful protective effect against the development of&#xD;
           nephrosclerotic and cerebrovascular lesions. The mechanisms of action of aldosterone may&#xD;
           include upregulation of AT1 receptors, direct effects on fibroblast collagen synthesis&#xD;
           and possibly decreased matrix metallo-proteinase secretion. In humans, aldosterone&#xD;
           concentrations have been correlated with mortality in chronic heart failure, with the&#xD;
           severity of LVH in non-diabetic renal failure and hypertension and negatively with&#xD;
           carotid artery compliance in hypertension. When added to ACE inhibitors, treatment with&#xD;
           aldosterone receptor antagonists further reduces LVH in both hypertension and heart&#xD;
           failure. Myocardial collagen turnover (a marker for fibrosis) was significantly reduced&#xD;
           by spironolactone in the RALES study and the fall in the marker of this index was&#xD;
           related to the mortality benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Autonomic dysfunction: Like heart failure, renal failure is characterised by autonomic&#xD;
           dysfunction manifest by high resting sympathetic tone, impaired vagal control and&#xD;
           reduced baroreflex sensitivity. The prognostic significance of autonomic dysfunction is&#xD;
           not established for renal failure, but in chronic heart failure, the degree of&#xD;
           dysfunction, measured by techniques such as heart rate variability, is a powerful and&#xD;
           independent marker of prognosis. This evidence, coupled with the efficacy of&#xD;
           beta-blocker therapy in heart failure, suggests that autonomic dysfunction can actively&#xD;
           contribute to mortality and cardiovascular disease progression. Aldosterone appears to&#xD;
           increase sympathetic and reduce cardiac vagal influence. The action of the sympathetic&#xD;
           nervous system is increased as a result of reduced uptake of noradrenaline in the&#xD;
           myocardium. A reduction in baroreflex sensitivity in response to aldosterone infusion&#xD;
           has been demonstrated in both animals and man and in heart failure patients, an increase&#xD;
           in heart rate variability occurred in response to aldosterone inhibition. We have&#xD;
           recently shown that acute aldosterone receptor inhibition results in improved HRV&#xD;
           markers of cardiac parasympathetic control in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is the effect of aldosterone receptor blockade with spironolactone mediated by lowering&#xD;
           arterial pressure? Spironolactone is now recognised as an effective anti-hypertensive&#xD;
           agent for patients with hypertension, even when this is resistant to other drugs. It is&#xD;
           therefore necessary to consider whether any improvements that do occur in measures such&#xD;
           as arterial stiffness and LV mass after spironolactone might simply be due to this&#xD;
           effect. Several lines of evidence suggest that the effects of aldosterone inhibition are&#xD;
           independent of blood pressure. The work of Rocha et al. in experimental animals clearly&#xD;
           showed that inhibition of myocardial and aortic fibrosis, nephrosclerotic and&#xD;
           cerebrovascular lesions by aldosterone inhibition occurred in the absence of changes in&#xD;
           blood pressure. In humans, in the RALES and EPHESUS studies, the mortality effects&#xD;
           occurred in the absence of any fall in blood pressure. In patients with controlled&#xD;
           hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, a group relevant to the work proposed in this&#xD;
           application, high dose spironolactone treatment (100 mg per day) did not result in a&#xD;
           fall in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure but did reduce albuminuria&#xD;
           independently of blood pressure. Finally, Professor Struthers, a national authority on&#xD;
           aldosterone and the cardiovascular system, has shown that in trials of spironolactone in&#xD;
           severe heart failure and diabetes, no fall in blood pressure occurred with&#xD;
           spironolactone suggesting that the beneficial action of spironolactone on endothelial&#xD;
           function was not mediated by such an effect. (personal communication). Nevertheless, an&#xD;
           effect mediated by a reduction in blood pressure cannot be excluded. In order to examine&#xD;
           this hypothesis, we will examine the relationship between the magnitude of changes in&#xD;
           end points and changes in blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in chronic renal failure: The importance of the RAAS&#xD;
      in CRF is illustrated by the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in retarding the progression of&#xD;
      diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. The significance of ANG II mediated renal damage was&#xD;
      shown by the finding that combined treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs further slows the&#xD;
      progression of non-diabetic renal disease compared with either agent alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma aldosterone concentrations are increased in animal models of CRF as well as in&#xD;
      patients with even mild renal impairment and several lines of evidence point to a major role&#xD;
      of aldosterone in promoting progressive renal dysfunction. Observational studies in patients&#xD;
      with primary hyperaldosteronism found the prevalence and degree of proteinuria to be greater&#xD;
      than in patients with essential hypertension. Several experimental animal models are&#xD;
      consistent with the concept that aldosterone can mediate renal injury. In patients with&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy and aldosterone escape despite ACE inhibitor therapy, aldosterone&#xD;
      blockade significantly reduced proteinuria with no change in blood pressure. Little attention&#xD;
      has been paid however, to the potentially beneficial effects of aldosterone antagonism on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system in renal failure. In a single, small uncontrolled study of 13 patients&#xD;
      with diabetic nephropathy on established ACE inhibitor therapy, left ventricular mass index&#xD;
      was significantly reduced after 24 weeks of treatment with spironolactone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial stiffness as endpoints in studies in chronic renal&#xD;
      failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LVH: Up to 80% of patients have LVH at the start of dialysis. As with other patient groups,&#xD;
      LVH is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in CRF and regression of LVH is&#xD;
      associated with improved cardiac outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness: Large conduit arteries buffer the changes in pressure resulting from&#xD;
      intermittent ventricular ejection. Stiffening of the arteries (loss of arterial compliance)&#xD;
      leads to increased systolic and pulse pressure; indeed arterial stiffness is the principal&#xD;
      determinant of pulse pressure in patients with CRF. It is also closely associated with LVH&#xD;
      and its progression over time. Recent prospective studies have demonstrated that measures of&#xD;
      aortic stiffness, such as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation of central&#xD;
      aortic pressure by early wave reflections (AIx), are independent and powerful predictors of&#xD;
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients on dialysis. Indeed, in a recent&#xD;
      prospective study, lowering aortic PWV, mainly by use of an ACE-inhibitor, was associated&#xD;
      with an improved survival in dialysis patients. This reduction in aortic PWV was associated&#xD;
      with a parallel reduction in mean arterial and pulse pressure in survivors. In contrast, in&#xD;
      those who died from cardiovascular events, although mean arterial pressure was lowered to the&#xD;
      same extent as in survivors; neither pulse pressure nor aortic PWV was significantly modified&#xD;
      by ACE inhibition. These findings suggest that arterial stiffness is not merely a marker of&#xD;
      arterial damage but a potentially reversible factor contributing to mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary: Activation of the RAAS occurs early in the course of renal disease and both&#xD;
      angiotensin and aldosterone are likely to be important factors in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      arterial stiffness, LVH and autonomic dysfunction. ACE inhibitors reduce arterial stiffness&#xD;
      and LVH as well as the progression of renal dysfunction but levels of circulating aldosterone&#xD;
      may remain high and the effects of aldosterone inhibition are unknown.&#xD;
