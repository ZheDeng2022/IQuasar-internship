&#xD;
        -  End point definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Q wave myocardial infarction. Appearance of a new Q wave in two or more contiguous leads&#xD;
           on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non Q wave myocardial infarction. Infarction, which is considered present in a patient&#xD;
           having clinical, angiographic, electrocardiographic, and/or laboratory evidence of&#xD;
           myocardial necrosis with an ECG showing no new Q waves.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Stent thrombosis. Thrombotic occlusion of index stent/stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vessel measurement. Proximal reference diameter: Vessel diameter proximal to&#xD;
                lesion. Distal reference diameter: Vessel diameter distal to lesion. Reference&#xD;
                diameter: Mean of proximal and distal vessel diameter. Percentual diameter&#xD;
                stenosis: (Reference diameter - minimal luminal diameter)/reference diameter in&#xD;
                percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Angiographic restenosis. &gt; 50% diameter stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic core lab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The index and the follow-up angiograms will be assessed blindly by the QCA core lab at&#xD;
           the Department of Cardiology, Skejby Hospital, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of index angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The angiography obtained during the PCI procedure will be used as index angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up angiography. After 8 months, conventional diagnostic angiography will be&#xD;
           performed and the projections used at the index angiography will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steering committee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The steering committee members will be selected on basis of participation in the study,&#xD;
           see below. All steering committee members will have full access to the database and will&#xD;
           participate in the interpretation of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The progress of the study will be checked on a weekly basis by the steering committee.&#xD;
           They will receive and evaluate data on inclusion rate and the primary end point event&#xD;
           rate. Further, the steering committee will receive and evaluate the weekly safety data&#xD;
           on the rate of stent thrombosis in the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The statistical analyses will be performed by UNI-C, University of Aarhus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary end point. The composite of the primary end points at six months follow-up will&#xD;
           be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between the event-free survival&#xD;
           curves for the three groups will be compared with the use of the Wilcoxon and log-rank&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-sided test is used, and the p-value considered to indicate significance will be&#xD;
           0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary end points and other parameters: For continuous variables, differences between&#xD;
           the treatment groups will be evaluated by analysis of variance or Wilcoxon's rank-sum&#xD;
           test. For discrete variables, differences will be expressed as counts, and percentages&#xD;
           will be analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Secondary end-points will be assessed after 8&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-sided test is used, and the p-value considered to indicate significance will be&#xD;
           0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For safety reasons, stent thrombosis after one month will be monitored continuously. A&#xD;
           stent thrombosis rate of &gt; 5% in any of the treatment groups will necessitate premature&#xD;
           termination of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results are analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle i.e. patients&#xD;
           randomized to a certain group will be followed and assessed irrespectively of the actual&#xD;
           treatment. Protocol violations will be noted and the responsible centers notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 patients will be included in each group, with a total of 400 patients in the study.&#xD;
           This is based on the following: We expect a MACE rate of 25% in the control group and&#xD;
           13% in the interventional group. With an alfa of 5% and a strength of 80%, 167 patients&#xD;
           will be needed in each group (two-sided chi square test) to demonstrate this difference.&#xD;
           By including 200 patients in each group, a possible dropout before follow-up is counted&#xD;
           for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be randomized before insertion of any stent. Both main vessels and side&#xD;
           branch may be wired and predilated before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a block randomization according to country, a stratification according to&#xD;
           sex, age &gt; 70 years, diabetes, use of GPIIb/IIIa blocker and +/- angiographic follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be computer randomized by a 24 hour telephone service. The PARAVOX&#xD;
           system will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be monitored according to GCP rules by independent professionals. During the&#xD;
           trial, the monitor will have regular contacts with the trial site(s), including visits&#xD;
           to ensure that the trial is conducted and documented properly in compliance with the&#xD;
           protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results will be published in an international cardiovascular journal. Publication and&#xD;
           author issues will be decided by the steering committee on the basis of general&#xD;
           involvement in the study (core lab. function, end point committee membership etc.) and&#xD;
           on the number of included patients.&#xD;
