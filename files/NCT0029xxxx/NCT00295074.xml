  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury that can produce significant functional&#xD;
      sequelae and ongoing disabling symptoms. Predicting who will have an uncomplicated recovery&#xD;
      and who will suffer ongoing symptoms is difficult. This protocol evaluates the use of&#xD;
      neuropsychologic testing after mild TBI in injured patients to attempt to objectively&#xD;
      establish predictors of long term disability and functional recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are hospitalized and who have suffered mild TBI (loss of consciousness or&#xD;
      post-traumatic amnesia; Glasgow Coma Score 13-15; admitted within 24 hours of injury; able to&#xD;
      read, speak, and understand English) who do not have pre-injury dementia or significant&#xD;
      cognitive impairment will undergo computerized neuropsychologic testing using a previously&#xD;
      validated tool that has been effective in sports-related mild TBI. Sequential testing will be&#xD;
      performed during recovery and patients who report disabling symptoms and/or functional&#xD;
      impairment will be compared to patients who recover uneventfully. Goal is to identify those&#xD;
      parameters that predict early who may suffer long term sequelae or functional impairment and&#xD;
      therefore benefit from early cognitive rehabilitation. Secondary goals are to establish&#xD;
      objective parameters for functional recovery after mild TBI.&#xD;
