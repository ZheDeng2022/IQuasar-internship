  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary infection with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) in patients with CF is often&#xD;
      associated with a more rapid decline in lung function. Because of the resistance of BCC to&#xD;
      many antibiotics, treatment options are often limited. New therapies to improve outcomes for&#xD;
      patients infected with BCC are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because of the unpredictable nature of this pulmonary infection in CF, patients with&#xD;
      BCC infection have been excluded from many CF therapeutic trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent published trials in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom have all&#xD;
      demonstrated clinical benefits from prolonged administration of azithromycin in CF. In these&#xD;
      trials, the vast majority of patients were chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with BCC were excluded from the US and UK trials, and only four patients with BCC&#xD;
      infection were enrolled in the Australian trial. Thus, the effectiveness of azithromycin in&#xD;
      CF patients infected with BCC is largely unknown and deserves further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main ways by which azithromycin is thought to help with the chronic lung infections&#xD;
      seen in CF are by [a] reducing inflammation and [b] direct effects on the bacteria, in&#xD;
      particular P. aeruginosa. BCC pulmonary infection in CF is often associated with a large&#xD;
      inflammatory response similar to or more severe than P. aeruginosa infection. If azithromycin&#xD;
      works mainly by an anti-inflammatory mechanism, it should also be helpful in CF patients&#xD;
      infected with BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, azithromycin could have a direct effect on BCC as seen with P. aeruginosa as&#xD;
      the two bacteria have many similarities.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 24 week trial of&#xD;
           azithromycin in adults with CF chronically infected with BCC. The investigational&#xD;
           therapy will be added to usual therapy in patients who are clinically stable at the time&#xD;
           of enrollment. After 168 days, the study drug will be discontinued and participants will&#xD;
           be evaluated at 196 days off of study drug for 28 days. At that visit, participants will&#xD;
           be invited to continue in an open label observational study of azithromycin for 168&#xD;
           additional days. Thus, the duration of the study will be 52 weeks (364 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 0- Day 168 on Study Drug (24 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 169- Day 196 off Study Drug (4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 197 - Day 364 on OPEN label Azithromycin (24 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary efficacy endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary efficacy endpoint will be the quantitative changes in lung function as measured&#xD;
           by FEV1 in % predicted from baseline to completion of the 24 week treatment period.&#xD;
           (refer to Appendix C for ATS guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary safety endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary safety endpoints collected over the 24 week treatment period will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events such as gastrointestinal complaints, ototoxicity, tinnitus,&#xD;
                hepatitis or leukopenia as determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
                (i) open ended questioning of study subjects at study visits (ii) laboratory tests&#xD;
                for elevated liver function tests or hematologic abnormalities,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in lung microbiology as determined by:[86] (i) Emergent B. cenocepacia&#xD;
                (genomovar III) (ii) Emergent non-B. cenocepacia genomovars (iii) Emergent NTM[87]&#xD;
                (iv) Emergent azithromycin resistant NTM (v) Emergent Aspergillus species (vi)&#xD;
                Emergent MDRO - (S. maltophilia, A. xylosoxidans, or methicillin-resistant S.&#xD;
                aureus) (vii) Emergent P. aeruginosa (viii) Emergent azithromycin resistant S.&#xD;
                aureus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary efficacy endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary efficacy endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative changes in lung function as measured by change in relative percent change&#xD;
           in FEV1 and FVC from baseline to completion of the 24 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative change in FEV1 and FVC in liters in CF study subjects treated with&#xD;
           azithromycin compared with those CF study subjects treated with placebo. FEV1 and FVC in&#xD;
           liters will be measured according to ATS criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of days until first administration of intravenous antibiotics and/or the use&#xD;
           of oral tetracycline derivatives minocycline / doxycycline for seven or more days during&#xD;
           the 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of pulmonary exacerbations as defined by need for treatment with intravenous&#xD;
           or oral tetracycline derivative antibiotics for an increase in pulmonary symptoms during&#xD;
           the 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients requiring intravenous antibiotics during the 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics given during the 24 week&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of hospital days as calculated by calendar days during the 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients requiring oral antibiotics during the 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of days of treatment with oral non-tetracycline derivative antibiotics given&#xD;
           during the 24 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in body weight from baseline to completion of the 24 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in level of inflammation as measured by the change in serum CRP and ESR from&#xD;
           baseline to the end of the 24 week treatment period.&#xD;
