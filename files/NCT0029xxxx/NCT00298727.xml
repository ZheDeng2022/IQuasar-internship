      Purpose: This study will compare the effectiveness and mediators of two different knowledge&#xD;
      transfer (KT) interventions in terms of their impact on changing knowledge and behavior&#xD;
      (utilization and clinical reasoning) related to health outcome measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Interventions: Two different KT interventions with the same curriculum will be evaluated: 1.&#xD;
      Stakeholder-Hosted Interactive Problem-Based Seminar (SHIPS), and 2. Online Problem-Based&#xD;
      course (ePBL). SHIPs will consist of face-to-face PBL (Problem-based Learning) (2Â½ days) with&#xD;
      outcome measure developers as facilitators, using 6 problems generated in consultation with&#xD;
      participants. The ePBL will consist of a 6-week web-based course with 6 generic problems&#xD;
      developed by content experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Baseline predictors including demographics, knowledge, attitudes/barriers&#xD;
      regarding outcome measures and Readiness to Change will be assessed by self-report.&#xD;
      Immediately post-intervention and 6 months later these will be re-administered. Primary&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative evaluations will be conducted 6-months post-intervention to&#xD;
      assess the relative effectiveness of KT interventions and to identify elements that&#xD;
      contribute to changing clinical behavior. Chart audits will determine the utilization of&#xD;
      outcome measures (counts). Incorporation of outcome measures into clinical reasoning will be&#xD;
      assessed using an innovative technique: chart-stimulated recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Sample: Physical and Occupational Therapists (n=144; 80% power to detect an effect&#xD;
      size of 0.5; alpha=0.05) will be recruited in partnership with the national professional&#xD;
      associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: SHIPS will be conducted in three urban centers in Canada. Participants will be block&#xD;
      allocated by a minimization procedure to either of the two interventions to minimize any&#xD;
      prognostic differences. Trained evaluators at each site will conduct chart audits and&#xD;
      chart-stimulated recall. Trained interviewers will conduct semi-structured interviews focused&#xD;
      on identifying critical elements in KT and implementing practice changes. Interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline scores as a covariate, will be used&#xD;
      to compare chart-stimulated recall scores at 6-months post-intervention. Secondary analyses&#xD;
      will also use ANCOVA with the remaining potential predictors. Qualitative content analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted iteratively until saturation is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Impact and Transfer: A strategy for optimal transfer of health outcome measures&#xD;
      into practice will be developed and shared with multiple disciplines involved in primary and&#xD;
      specialty management of musculoskeletal and childhood disability. In addition, we will work&#xD;
      with national professional organizations and Ministries of Health to use the knowledge from&#xD;
      this study to support national initiatives on implementation and to assist with best KT&#xD;
      practices in health service education.&#xD;
