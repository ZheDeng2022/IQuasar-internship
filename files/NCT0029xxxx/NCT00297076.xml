        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following are study specific eligibility criteria. In addition to these criteria,&#xD;
             investigators must exercise clinical discretion regarding selection of appropriate&#xD;
             study subjects, taking into consideration any local treatment practices or guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in the CCR104456 protocol only if all of the&#xD;
        following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infected subjects aged 18 years or older. All subjects participating in this&#xD;
             study should be counseled on the practice of safe sex throughout the study. Females&#xD;
             must fall into one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential: defined as women who are surgically sterile or post-menopausal,&#xD;
        the latter indicated by history of no menses for a minimum of one year prior to the date of&#xD;
        the screening visit; Childbearing potential: has a negative pregnancy test result (-human&#xD;
        chorionic gonadotropin; -HCG) within 35 days prior to administration of investigational&#xD;
        product (Day 1) and agrees to use a proven double barrier method of contraception (e.g.&#xD;
        spermicide + condom) during the study period (through follow-up). Hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
        will not be considered sufficient forms of contraception for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥5000copies/mL (from CCR104627 protocol). There are no CD4&#xD;
             cell count entry restrictions, however investigators must exercise clinical discretion&#xD;
             regarding selection of appropriate study subjects, taking into consideration any local&#xD;
             treatment practices or guidelines regarding CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total prior antiretroviral experience of at least three months and documented&#xD;
             genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one compound in each of the following&#xD;
             classes of antiretrovirals: NRTIs (includes NtRTI TDF), NNRTIs, and PIs. Resistance&#xD;
             mutations must be at least one major mutation according to the current International&#xD;
             AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group (refer to study reference manual&#xD;
             [SRM]). Resistance testing may be current (e.g. screening results) and/or historical&#xD;
             with verifiable documentation in source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  R5-tropic virus according to viral tropism assessment at screening in CCR104627&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current receipt of an unchanged &quot;pre-study&quot; ART regimen (i.e., unchanged medications&#xD;
             and doses) for at least four weeks prior to screening in CCR104627 protocol; this&#xD;
             pre-study regimen may be no ART. Subjects must remain on this regimen until&#xD;
             randomization (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to receive a RTV-boosted PI as part of their OBT regimen. Due to&#xD;
             the possibility of randomization to the placebo arm, investigators should consider&#xD;
             subjects for enrollment whose treatment history and resistance testing results suggest&#xD;
             that an OBT regimen can be constructed which would be anticipated to provide the best&#xD;
             possible virological response and clinical benefit for each subject. The drugs in the&#xD;
             OBT regimen will be chosen from the locally available antiretrovirals and must consist&#xD;
             of between three and six drugs, one of which must be a RTV-boosted PI. Use of&#xD;
             investigational PIs which become available through expanded-access or similar programs&#xD;
             during the conduct of this study must be authorized by the Sponsor prior to use in OBT&#xD;
             regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and&#xD;
             protocol-stated restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to initiation of pre-baseline study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in the CCR104456 protocol if any of the&#xD;
        following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma sample tests as R5/X4 (dual or mixed)-tropic, X4-tropic only, or&#xD;
             non-phenotypeable based on viral tropism assessment at screening in protocol&#xD;
             CCR104627.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at screening which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, should preclude the subject's participation in the study of an&#xD;
             investigational compound. Any Grade 4 laboratory abnormality at screening will exclude&#xD;
             a subject from study participation unless the investigator can provide a compelling&#xD;
             explanation for the laboratory result(s) and has the assent of the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that make any changes to their ART regimen during the period beginning four&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening (protocol CCR104627) until Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant blood loss (≥500mL) within 56 days prior to screening in CCR104627&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in an experimental drug and/or vaccine trial(s) within 30 days&#xD;
             or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the experimental&#xD;
             drug or vaccine - whichever is longer, prior to screening for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any prior receipt of an investigational CCR5 or CXCR4 antagonist are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant finding on screening or baseline ECG. Specifically,&#xD;
             subjects with any repolarization delay (resting QTcB interval &gt;450msec at the&#xD;
             screening or baseline [mean of triplicate values] visit) will be excluded. Subjects&#xD;
             with a history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure,&#xD;
             chronic and/or recurrent hypokalemia) will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically relevant pancreatitis or hepatitis within the previous 6 months.&#xD;
             Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
             infection will not be excluded, however investigators should carefully assess if&#xD;
             antiviral therapy specifically for HBV or HCV infection is required; subjects who are&#xD;
             anticipated to require such therapy during the study should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the&#xD;
             subject's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations&#xD;
             (including alcohol or drug abuse) or which might compromise the safety of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of active CDC Class C conditions or opportunistic infections. Subjects on&#xD;
             stable, anti-infective treatment or prophylaxis regimen are allowed in the study&#xD;
             provided the therapy is not specifically prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a drug or other allergy which, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates the subject's participation in the study or known hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             any study medication or excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 30 days&#xD;
             of investigational product administration or anticipated need for such treatment&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current severe illness, including liver and renal failure, major organ allograft,&#xD;
             malignancy requiring parenteral chemotherapy that can not be discontinued for the&#xD;
             duration of the trial, or any other conditions which would make the subject unsuitable&#xD;
             for the study. Subjects with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of&#xD;
             the cervix, or non-disseminated stable Kaposi's sarcoma may be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic immunosuppressants and/or immunomodulators within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             study Day 1. Systemic corticosteroids at replacement doses (e.g. 10mg/day prednisone&#xD;
             or equivalent) are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated continued need for prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications that&#xD;
             are on the prohibited medication list within 30 days prior to study Day 1.&#xD;
