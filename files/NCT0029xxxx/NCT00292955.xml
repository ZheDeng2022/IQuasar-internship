        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed a Washington University, Human Studies Committee (HSC)&#xD;
             approved, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have primary, histologically documented FIGO Clinical Stage IB2-IVB&#xD;
             invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix with measurable disease amendable to repeated&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients, 18 years and older, must either be not of child bearing potential or have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test within 7 days of treatment. Patients are considered not of&#xD;
             child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Women should not breast feed while on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women must have a primary diagnosis of invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Men&#xD;
             are excluded from this study as a consequence of the diagnosis being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have had no previous treatment for invasive carcinoma of the uterine&#xD;
             cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be newly diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic cervical&#xD;
             carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcl; platelets &gt;&#xD;

             placement.&#xD;

             congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any concurrent chemotherapy not indicated in the study protocol or any other&#xD;
             investigational agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator would&#xD;
             impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unresolved ureteral obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Renal abnormalities, such as pelvic kidney, horseshoe kidney, or renal transplant,&#xD;
             that would require modification of radiation fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known or documented brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer. (Patients with a&#xD;
             previous malignancy but without evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years will be allowed to&#xD;
             enter the trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Prior radiation therapy to the abdomen and/or pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Incarceration&#xD;
