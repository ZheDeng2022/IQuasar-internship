  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the significance of complete versus incomplete&#xD;
      electrical isolation of pulmonary veins by radiofrequency-induced linear lesions in patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis ist that the complete linear PV isolation ablation is superior to the&#xD;
      non-complete linear PV isolation on the outcome of patients with idiopathic drug-refractory&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. As a second hypothesis in this adaptive study design, the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the complete linear PV isolation strategy will be tested.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation can be cured by elimination of triggering events such as atrial&#xD;
      extrasystoles originating from the pulmonary veins (PV) by selective or linear radiofrequency&#xD;
      current applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although electrical isolation can be demonstrated by a circumferential mapping catheter&#xD;
      positioned at the PV ostium, longterm effect of such EP-guided PV isolation procedures&#xD;
      achieve about 60-70% of stable sinus rhythm during follow-up even in experienced centers.&#xD;
      Re-investigation of symptomatic patients after initially electrically isolated PVs&#xD;
      demonstrated a substantial amount of PV reconduction which might explain the arrhythmia&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it was demonstrated that linear lesions for PV isolation is superior to the&#xD;
      selective ablation approach, conflicting data exists on the necessity to achieve complete&#xD;
      linear lesions. The groups of Pappone et al and Oral et al both published a success rate of&#xD;
      more than 90% of patients in sinusrhythm irrespective of the line completeness, which both&#xD;
      groups estimated to be reached in only 30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several advantages and disadvantages could advocate for either the complete versus the&#xD;
      incomplete ablation strategy: Performing the complete EP-guided linear PV isolation strategy&#xD;
      might take longer (mean duration 4.5 hours vs about 2 hours) and could thereby potentially&#xD;
      result in a higher risk of procedure-associated complications (air embolism, thrombus&#xD;
      formation, perforation). In addition, three transseptal sheaths might increase the risk of&#xD;
      tamponade and might aggravate the ability to safely navigate catheters in the left atrium.&#xD;
      Certainly, the procedure costs are higher, since in addition to the 3D mapping system two&#xD;
      circular mapping catheters are mandatory to facilitate the lesion deployment and avoidance of&#xD;
      intra-PV ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an ablation strategy that does not depend on complete line deployment may be&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve stable sinus rhythm. Although, additional linear lesions between the PV&#xD;
      isolation segments and towards the mitral annulus as proposed by several centers with&#xD;
      incomplete linear PV isolation approaches might not be necessary to achieve stable sinus&#xD;
      rhythm. Potential complications such as atrio-esophageal fistula formation could be avoided&#xD;
      if no additional lesions eg. along the LA roof would be necessary. Both the costs of the&#xD;
      additional material (transseptal sheaths, circular mapping catheters) and the shorter&#xD;
      procedure duration (about 2 hours) would be reduced. On the other hand, these costs would be&#xD;
      balanced by the reduced number of re-ablation, if incomplete PV isolation would indeed lead&#xD;
      to a higher AF recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no data exist on the time course of the deployed ablation lines. Do patients with&#xD;
      recurrences of AF always have PV reconduction ? Vice versa, it also remains unclear if all&#xD;
      patients with stable sinus rhythm do experience this effect based on longterm PV isolation.&#xD;
      To assess the significance of the time course of PV isolation, the proposed study protocol&#xD;
      consists therefore of an invasive re-evaluation of all primarily ablated pts scheduled after&#xD;
      3 months of follow-up regardless of arrhythmia recurrence to investigate PV conduction&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, patients with symptomatic AF who underwent intensified ECG monitoring indicate that&#xD;
      the standard clinical procedures (assessment of symptoms and surface ECG recordings at long&#xD;
      intervals) are not sufficient to detect recurrent AF. Therefore, daily ECG monitoring is&#xD;
      planned in this trial to detect asymptomatic episodes of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study protocol aims to investigate in prospective, randomized fashion the&#xD;
      significance of complete versus incomplete PV isolation by RFC-induced linear lesions. The&#xD;
      ablation will be randomized to a linear encircling around the ipsilateral PVs with the&#xD;
      endpoint of complete PV isolation proven by two circumferential mapping catheters versus the&#xD;
      same ablation procedure which will be terminated instantaneously when total PV isolation&#xD;
      occurs, thereby allowing at least one conduction gap along the isolation line. An invasive&#xD;
      re-evaluation is scheduled after 3 months for all pts to assess longterm PV conduction&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
