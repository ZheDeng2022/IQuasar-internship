  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump enough blood to the rest of the&#xD;
      body. People with heart failure may have another condition called the &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot;(&#xD;
      having excess fat in the belly, high blood pressure, high fat in the blood, low level of good&#xD;
      cholesterol and high blood sugar). People who have both heart failure and the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome often see many doctors. A new clinic has been formed at Ben Taub General Hospital&#xD;
      that includes a specialist in heart failure (cardiologist) and in the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (endocrinologist) as well as patient teaching. The goal of this study is to randomize&#xD;
      patients with the metabolic syndrome who are admitted to the hospital for heart failure to&#xD;
      this clinic (collaborative care) versus the usual doctor appointments (usual care). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see if collaborative care is better medical care than usual care.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will see if patients in collaborative care will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. fewer admissions to hospitals for illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. better blood pressure, sugar, fat and heart failure control&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. better patient satisfaction and knowledge about their diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. lower levels of inflammation.&#xD;

      A striking feature of the Harris County Hospital District heart failure population is that&#xD;
      the prevalence of obesity (50.8%) and the metabolic syndrome (48.9%) exceeds that of the&#xD;
      general U.S. population. The metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of 3 out of 5&#xD;
      components: abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemias (↑ triglycerides and ↓&#xD;
      high density lipoprotein) and insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. Current treatment&#xD;
      recommendations for the metabolic syndrome include lifestyle modification (diet, exercise,&#xD;
      and weight control) and targeted pharmaceutical therapy for the individual components.&#xD;
      Although specialized care for the metabolic syndrome has not been reported, separately, both&#xD;
      specialty heart failure care and endocrinology care have been shown to reduce hospital&#xD;
      admissions and health care costs, increase target medication titration and disease control,&#xD;
      improve quality of life, and survival in patients with heart failure and diabetes&#xD;
      respectively. As both heart failure and the metabolic syndrome are commonly found in the same&#xD;
      patients, collaborative out-patient management of both conditions in the same clinic is novel&#xD;
      and may have a significant impact on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to usual post-discharge follow-up, collaborative treatment of heart failure patients&#xD;
      with the metabolic syndrome by a team composed of an endocrinologist, cardiologist, patient&#xD;
      educator, nurse and case manager will result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased hospital readmissions and emergency room visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health care cost savings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased achievement of treatment goals (target blood pressure, HgbA1c, lipids, and&#xD;
           heart failure medication titration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved patient satisfaction, knowledge, and compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower levels of markers of inflammation and insulin resistance&#xD;
