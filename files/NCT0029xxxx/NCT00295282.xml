    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of MDX-1100. patients with ulcerative colitis will be&#xD;
      enrolled into one of four dose cohorts, to receive of MDX-1100 at 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 10mg/kg.&#xD;
      Three to six patients will be enrolled at each dose level, starting at the lowest dose level,&#xD;
      for a maximum of 24 patients to be enrolled into the study. The study is designed to&#xD;
      establish the safety and tolerability of single doses of MDX-1100 administered in&#xD;
      dose-escalating cohorts to patients with ulcerative colitis. Other study objectives include&#xD;
      characterizing a pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic effects of MDX-1100 and&#xD;
      determination of immunogenic response to MDX-1100.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      doses of MDX-1100 administered in dose-escalating cohorts to patients with active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis (UC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of MDX-1100,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of MDX-1100 on CXCL10-related surrogate&#xD;
           markers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to obtain preliminary evidence as assessed by the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity&#xD;
           Index (DAI),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine the immunogenic response to MDX-1100, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. determine the safety and efficacy of repeat doses in patients who respond to a single&#xD;
           dose of MDX-1100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, dose-escalation study of MDX-1100 (anti-CXCL10 human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody) in patients with UC, as defined by standard clinical, endoscopic and&#xD;
      histological criteria and a DAI greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 9. Three&#xD;
      to six patients will be entered into each of 4 cohorts (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 10mg/kg). Starting&#xD;
      with the lowest dose cohort (0.3mg/kg), patients will be administered a single dose of&#xD;
      MDX-1100 at Day 1 and will be followed until 70 days from the last dose. Dose escalation may&#xD;
      proceed when the third patient in the cohort has reached Day 29 and if no dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) have occurred. Dose escalation may proceed when the sixth patient reaches&#xD;
      Day 29 and &lt;2 DLTs have occurred in the cohort. Dose escalation will continue until the last&#xD;
      cohort is enrolled or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who respond to the initial dose, as defined by a decrease in the UC disease activity&#xD;
      index (UCDAI) by greater than or equal to 3 points at Day 29 compared to baseline, will be&#xD;
      offered the option of receiving up to 3 additional doses of MDX-1100 at their originally&#xD;
      assigned dose level. Re-dosing will be permitted at the time of disease flare which is&#xD;
      defined as a worsening of the modified UCDAI of greater than or equal to 2 compared to the&#xD;
      prior nadir. In order to obtain PK data, the first re-dose may not be administered until Day&#xD;
      43 and all subsequent doses may be great than or equal to 28 days apart. A response in the&#xD;
      repeat dosing phase will be defined as a decrease in the mUCDAI of greater than or equal to 2&#xD;
      as compared to the previous baseline mUCDAI. For the second infusion, the comparison will use&#xD;
      the mUCDAI calculated at Day 29 or subsequent nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will terminate approximately 70 days after the last patient has received the last&#xD;
      dose of MDX-1100. It is anticipated that the maximum total time on study for any patient will&#xD;
      be less than 1 year.&#xD;
