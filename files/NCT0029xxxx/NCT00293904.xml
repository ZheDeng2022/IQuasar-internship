  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of a specific immunomodulatory&#xD;
      principle (QbG10) together with conventional grass pollen allergen leads to a more rapid and&#xD;
      more pronounced decrease of sensitivity against pollen than with the grass pollen allergen&#xD;
      alone&#xD;
