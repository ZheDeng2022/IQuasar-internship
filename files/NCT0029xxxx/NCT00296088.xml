  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a significant health care issue in the United States, particularly among the&#xD;
      critically ill. Preliminary research has shown that differences in ventilator management&#xD;
      exist among obese and non-obese individuals. This study will examine the effect of excess&#xD;
      weight on ventilator management and clinical outcomes in individuals in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-four percent of American adults are overweight or obese. Excess weight will soon&#xD;
      surpass smoking as the most common cause of preventable death. Despite the well-known health&#xD;
      consequences of obesity, little is known about the specific effects of obesity in critically&#xD;
      ill individuals. There are significant differences in ventilator management procedures among&#xD;
      obese and non-obese individuals in an ICU. The long-term effect of these differences,&#xD;
      however, has not been studied. Preliminary research has shown that differences in the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation process may be responsible for worse outcomes in obese individuals, as&#xD;
      compared to non-obese individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      obesity on ventilator management processes and medical outcomes in individuals in an ICU. The&#xD;
      study will also identify any increased risks for the critically ill obese and the causes of&#xD;
      their augmented mortality and morbidity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll individuals in an ICU who are receiving mechanical ventilation through&#xD;
      an endotracheal tube. Because potential participants are critically ill, and are unable to&#xD;
      provide consent to participate in the study, each participant must have a surrogate decision&#xD;
      maker who will provide consent on their behalf. Once enrolled, participants' weight, height,&#xD;
      and waist circumference will be measured. Medical outcomes and information on the processes&#xD;
      of ventilator management and care will be assessed while participants are in the ICU.&#xD;
      Information on hospital outcomes, quality of life, utility, employment, and living situation&#xD;
      will be collected upon release from the ICU, as well as during follow-up telephone&#xD;
      interviews, which will occur every 90 days for a period of up to two years.&#xD;
