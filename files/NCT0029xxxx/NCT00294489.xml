  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A relatively large proportion of patients with chronic HCV infection have normal or mildly&#xD;
      elevated ALT. Many of these patients are not being treated, and are not being sent for a&#xD;
      liver biopsy. The present study will determine the ability of Methcetin BreathID Test(MBIT)&#xD;
      to detect those patients who will be candidates for anti-viral treatment, as an alternative&#xD;
      measure for liver biopsy in decision-making prior to treatment in clinical hepatology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rational for using MBIT in the management of HCV in patients with persistently normal&#xD;
      (and slightly elevated) ALT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If MBIT is impaired, this indicates fibrosis &gt;2: a trigger to begin treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This strategy will enable treating patients with relatively severe disease that was not&#xD;
           detected by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HMOs recognize the cost-effectiveness of anti-viral therapy in these patients, as a&#xD;
           means of prevention of deterioration, cirrhosis and HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If MBIT indicates low fibrosis =&gt; treatment may be deferred, and follow-up is performed&#xD;
           to detect any possible degradation that will indicate need for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Today the AASLD guidelines allow for treatment of HCV RNA+ patients with normal ALT. In&#xD;
           view of the limited effectivity of therapy, its cost and side effects, there are likely&#xD;
           to be many individuals in whom therapy can be safely deferred, leading to cost saving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBIT may replace the need of liver biopsy for decision- making in HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Even in patients with genotype 1 and elevated ALT, or with risk of side effects,&#xD;
           treatment may be delayed in low fibrosis (e.g. &lt;2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the ability of the MBIT to improve the management of patients for liver disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine whether the Methacetin BreathID Test (MBIT) can be useful in evaluation of HCV&#xD;
      RNA positive patients with normal or minimally elevated ALT and to determine the severity of&#xD;
      their liver disease as a guide for decision-making in routine clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUC&gt;0.75 (+/-10% in 95%CI) in detection of fibrosis&gt;2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men or women&gt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with HCV RNA+ above 105 copies Patients with normal liver enzymes on two tests&#xD;
           3 months apart, or up to &lt;X1.5 of upper normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with biopsy proven HCV or (9 months prior to test with no anticipated changes&#xD;
           in liver disease since biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other liver disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of drugs that are known to induce/suppress P4501A2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumption of &gt;20cc alcohol a day prior to the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 matched controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient selection - All the patients that underwent a liver biopsy in the last 9 months&#xD;
           in each center are invited to participate in the study, assuming they meet&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo MBIT and data will be compared with the results of the different&#xD;
           fibrotic and inflammatory scores (i.e. METAVIR) on liver biopsy. One pathologist will&#xD;
           re-examine all biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oridion BreathID will provide MBIT data on 50 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substrate - A test meal consisting of 75mg PO methacetin + a known surface-active&#xD;
           ingredient routinely used in the food and drug industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test length - 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting-8 hours fast only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be attached to the BreathID device via a nasal cannula and after&#xD;
           baseline breath is measured, the test meal will be ingested and the device will continue&#xD;
           measuring the exhaled breath for 1 hour. The BreathID device automatically measures&#xD;
           changes in the 13C/12C ratio due to metabolization of the methacetin, using a&#xD;
           spectroscopic principal. The results are printed out automatically at the end of the&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • At first visit to physician, patients will perform viral load test, liver enzymes tests and&#xD;
      MBIT. A biopsy will have been performed within 9 months of these tests.&#xD;
