      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 2mg/kg administration of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, in the form of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, in early phase acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome after thoracic surgery, will reduce the postoperative&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing after thoracic surgery is usually a&#xD;
      lethal complication. The use of corticosteroid in ARDS has been the subject of great&#xD;
      controversy and debate over the years. Unfortunately, trials of short-term, high-dose steroid&#xD;
      therapy failed to show an improvement in mortality of patients at risk of, or with early,&#xD;
      ARDS. Several investigators have suggested that the use of corticosteroids in the late or&#xD;
      fibroproliferative phase of ARDS improved lung function and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently some authors have demonstrated that there is a potential for pulmonary&#xD;
      fibroproliferation during the early stages of ARDS and the use of low-dose corticosteroids at&#xD;
      these early stages has been found to lead to a complete maintenance of in vivo and in vitro&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics in acute lung injury. These articles had important implications both&#xD;
      for the study of repair mechanisms and the timing of therapies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ARDS, defined as the acute onset of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral infiltrates. The infiltrates may be patchy, diffuse, homogeneous, or&#xD;
                  asymmetric, and should be consistent with pulmonary edema or the fibrotic changes&#xD;
                  of fibroproliferation. Opacities due to pleural effusions or atelectasis should&#xD;
                  not be considered. If pneumonectomy, unilateral infiltrate is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No evidence of left atrial hypertension. If measured, PAWP ≤ 18 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Criteria a-c must occur together within a 24-hour interval. The first date that&#xD;
                  these criteria are met is defined as the onset of ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Since ARDS onset, chest infiltrates must be progressive, and chest computed&#xD;
             tomographic scan findings are consistent with postoperative ARDS findings or ground&#xD;
             glass opacities by radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Major thoracic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lung cancer; pneumonectomy, extended pneumonectomy, lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy,&#xD;
                  extended lobectomy, wedge resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Esophageal cancer; Ivor-Lewis operation, transhiatal esophagectomy, McKeown&#xD;
                  operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic lung cancer; simultaneous bilateral metastasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 on the day of E-START enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical evidence of active and untreated infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Clarifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A known, undrained abscess (e.g. Staphylococcal lung abscess or loculated empyema&#xD;
                  or intra-abdominal abscess) or a known intravascular nidus of infection (e.g.,&#xD;
                  bacterial or fungal endocarditis) will be a basis for exclusion, even if it is&#xD;
                  being treated with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A bacterial infection being treated with a standard antibiotic regimen would not&#xD;
                  be a basis for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disseminated fungal infection, even if being treated, is an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ongoing septic shock, even if on antibiotics is a basis for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Burns requiring skin grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with AIDS by CDC criteria, diagnosed by either a documented AIDS defining&#xD;
             illness or CD4&lt;200(see Appendix F); prednisolone therapy &gt;=300mg(or its equivalent)&#xD;
             cumulative dose within 21 days prior to enrollment, or &gt;15mg/day(or its equivalent)&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to enrollment; cytotoxic therapy within 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Other irreversible chronic disease or condition for which 6 month mortality is&#xD;
             estimated ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Not committed to full support.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh Class C score&gt;10 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Transplant patients with the exception of autologous bone marrow transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Extracorporeal support of gas exchange at the time of study entry (e.g., ECMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known or suspected adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Vasculitis with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.&#xD;
