      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The treatment of addiction often hinges on preventing relapse into drug-using behaviors,&#xD;
      which occurs at high rates even after prolonged abstinence. Some methadone patients continue&#xD;
      to abuse cocaine and heroin during treatment, even with extensive psychosocial services. More&#xD;
      research is needed to look at the results from earlier studies of continued drug use during&#xD;
      methadone treatment, focusing on the results of fixed vs. flexible doses of methadone to&#xD;
      reduce the likelihood of continued drug use and the role of monetary vouchers as an incentive&#xD;
      to continue abstinence from illicit substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine if the combination of flexible methadone dosing and voucher-based contingency&#xD;
      management can improve rates of abstinence from heroin and cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age or older who are dependent on opioids (cocaine&#xD;
      and/or heroin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 40 weeks. After the initial screening, participants will receive&#xD;
           daily methadone and weekly drug counseling sessions that will continue throughout the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 6 weeks of methadone treatment, participants who continue to use heroin and&#xD;
           cocaine will be randomized to one of four groups for 16 weeks of study. Each group will&#xD;
           receive a flexible or fixed dose of methadone, and one of two contingency management&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexible-dose participants will receive individualized dose increases, based on drug use&#xD;
           and withdrawal. Fixed-dose participants will be set at a specific dose of methadone that&#xD;
           will not be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The two contingency management conditions will be monetary vouchers given for regular&#xD;
           cocaine-negative urine samples, or vouchers independent of urine cocaine screen results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the study phase, participants will have 10 weeks of standard individual counseling&#xD;
           and stable doses of methadone. Urine samples will continue to be collected, but no&#xD;
           vouchers will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, participants will have the choice of transferring to a&#xD;
           community clinic or undergoing a 10-week taper from methadone.&#xD;

      Scientific goals. The primary goal is to determine if simultaneous abstinence from heroin and&#xD;
      cocaine can be elicited by combining two approaches: flexible methadone dosing and&#xD;
      voucher-based CM. Secondary goals include: 1) comparing saliva and plasma levels of&#xD;
      methadone, cortisol, and prolactin as predictors of treatment outcome; and 2) evaluating the&#xD;
      impact of methadone maintenance on renal function, lipid profile, and cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. During an initial 6-week baseline phase, cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatient&#xD;
      participants (300 enrolled; 180 evaluable) will be stabilized on methadone 70 mg/day. At the&#xD;
      end of baseline, participants who continue to use heroin and cocaine will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two dosing regimens and one of two CM conditions. In the flexible-dose regimen,&#xD;
      participants will receive individualized dose increases (15 mg/day) to a maximum of 190 mg&#xD;
      /day, based on heroin use and withdrawal. In the fixed-dose regimen, participants methadone&#xD;
      dose will be increased to 100 mg/day and remain fixed there. Dose-group assignment will be&#xD;
      double-blind: investigators will determine participants individualized dose increases, but&#xD;
      only the pharmacists will know which participants actually receive them. The two CM&#xD;
      conditions will be: vouchers contingent on cocaine-negative urine specimens, or noncontingent&#xD;
      vouchers (i.e., vouchers independent of urine cocaine screen results). The main outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the percentage of urines simultaneously negative for both cocaine and illicit&#xD;
      opiates during treatment. For the concurrently run pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic portion,&#xD;
      saliva and blood samples will be taken at regular intervals to determine levels of methadone,&#xD;
      cortisol, and prolactin as predictors of treatment outcome. For the concurrently run&#xD;
      medical-outcomes portion, urine (renal function), blood (lipid profile), and ECGs (cardiac&#xD;
      function),will be obtained at set intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. Flexible methadone dosing and voucher-based CM will be safe and result in greater&#xD;
      simultaneous abstinence from heroin and cocaine, higher treatment retention, and higher&#xD;
      health-related QOL when compared to fixed methadone dosing and the absence of CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits. Participants will receive methadone, counseling, and some medical care at no&#xD;
      charge. The methadone and voucher interventions are likely to reduce participants' use of&#xD;
      heroin and cocaine. Counseling will include management of HIV risk behaviors. The study&#xD;
      incorporates participant safety monitoring and will provide information relevant to improving&#xD;
      the health and safety of community methadone-maintenance patients. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic part of the study does not benefit participants directly, but&#xD;
      may lead to the development of more useful and less invasive drug-monitoring methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks. Participants may experience side effects from methadone, discomfort during methadone&#xD;
      withdrawal, and discomfort (or, rarely syncope) from blood draws.&#xD;
