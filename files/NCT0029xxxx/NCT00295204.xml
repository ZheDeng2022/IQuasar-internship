      Comparing the arrhythmia diagnostic yield of MCOT as compared to standard loop event monitors&#xD;
      in patients presenting with palpitations, syncope or near syncope occurring less frequently&#xD;
      than every 24 hours. Patients randomized and are enrolled for 30 days. Prior testing&#xD;
      required: 24 hours of non diagnostic monitoring,&#xD;

      Cardiac monitoring is used for diagnosing patient with symptoms. Holter monitoring or cardiac&#xD;
      loop monitoring are the tests most ofter prescribed for patients depending on the frequency&#xD;
      of symptoms. If the symptoms occur daily, a Holter may be prescribed, but when the symptoms&#xD;
      become less frequent the diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring declines greatly. The current&#xD;
      yields are approximately 5-10% depending on the indication. When the Holter is not longer an&#xD;
      option for patients with infrequent symptoms a cardiac loop event monitor is prescribed to&#xD;
      make a diagnosis. The yields on this monitoring also average approximately 25-35%. We feel&#xD;
      that the yield on the Mobile Cardiac Ouptatient Telemetry (MCOT) service proviced by&#xD;
      CardioNet is significantly higher due to the fact that every beat is analyzed using an&#xD;
      algorithm and that many times the arrhythmia causing the symptoms has ended before the&#xD;
      patient is able to press the button on the loop monitor to record the ECG. This study&#xD;
      compares the MCOT service with Patients over 18 years of age experiencing syncope, near&#xD;
      syncope or palpitations less frequently than daily. Require 24 hours of non-diagnostic ECG&#xD;
      monitoring prior to randomization. Patients remain on monitoring for 30 days unless an&#xD;
      arrhythmia diagnosis is made. The primary endpoint is confirmation of exclusion of a probable&#xD;
      arrhythmic cause of pre-syncope, syncope or palpitations experienced by the subject prior to&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. Secondary endpoints include time to diagnosis, time to detection of&#xD;
      clinically significant arrhythmias, comparison of non-clinicaly significant arrhythmias, rate&#xD;
      of asymptomatic arrhythmias both clinically and non clinically significant and a diagnosis&#xD;
      related resource utilization. The study size is 300 subjects.&#xD;
