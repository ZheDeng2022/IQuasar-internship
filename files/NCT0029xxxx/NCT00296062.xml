      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to&#xD;
      them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may&#xD;
      also block blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab&#xD;
      may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of capecitabine&#xD;
      when given together with irinotecan and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab and to see&#xD;
      how well they work in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;
      or other solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      The study was originally intended to be Phase I/Phase II but it was terminated early because&#xD;
      of toxicity of treatment and therefore never moved to the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of dose-dense and&#xD;
           dose-intense capecitabine in combination with alternating full-dose irinotecan&#xD;
           hydrochloride and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
           unresectable solid tumors. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the safety of the MTD in patients ≥ 65 years of age treated with this&#xD;
           regimen. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in patients ≥ 65 years of age. (phase&#xD;
           I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the functional status of patients ≥ 65 years of age at baseline and after&#xD;
           study treatment, in terms of performance status, independence in activities,&#xD;
           comorbidities, risk of malnutrition, and underlying depression. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the neurological status of all patients, in terms of muscle strength and&#xD;
           sensation, at baseline and after study treatment. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen. (phase&#xD;
           I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to dose-intense capecitabine in&#xD;
           combination with alternating full-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin as&#xD;
           first-line treatment leads to an improved response rate in patients with metastatic&#xD;
           colorectal cancer compared to that of published results of fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin,&#xD;
           fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan/bevacizumab, and fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan regimens.&#xD;
           (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of bevacizumab in combination with this regimen in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic colorectal cancer. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I (all solid tumor patients): Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on&#xD;
           days 1-7 and 15-21. Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on&#xD;
           days 1 and 15 during course 1 and all subsequent odd-numbered courses and oxaliplatin IV&#xD;
           over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 during course 2 and all subsequent even-numbered courses.&#xD;
           Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine (during both&#xD;
           odd- and even-numbered courses) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
           The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients (with&#xD;
           at least 1 patient &lt; 65 years of age) experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6&#xD;
           patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II (colorectal cancer patients): Patients receive capecitabine (at the MTD&#xD;
           determined in phase I) in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (during odd-numbered&#xD;
           courses) and oxaliplatin (during even-numbered courses) as in phase I. Patients also&#xD;
           receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
