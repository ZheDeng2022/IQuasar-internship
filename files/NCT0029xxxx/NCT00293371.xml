      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Vatalanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving vatalanib together with&#xD;
      docetaxel and prednisone may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vatalanib when&#xD;
      given together with docetaxel and prednisone and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of vatalanib when used&#xD;
           in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive,&#xD;
           metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer. (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine alterations in pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and vatalanib in these patients.&#xD;
           (phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of this regimen as measured by declines in&#xD;
           prostate-specific antigen, measurable disease response, time to progression, and overall&#xD;
           survival. (phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I open-label, dose-escalation study of vatalanib* followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Patients also receive oral&#xD;
           prednisone twice daily and oral vatalanib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
           every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vatalanib until the maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at&#xD;
           which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Vatalanib is administered on days 5-21 during the first course only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive prednisone, docetaxel, and vatalanib at the MTD as in phase&#xD;
           I. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 93 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
