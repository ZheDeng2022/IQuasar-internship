  <brief_summary>

      Our specific aim is to explore the effect of moderate alcohol intake on parameters of&#xD;
      glycemic index and lipid profile among patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      Successful long-term control of hyperglycemia decreases the risk for diabetic complications .&#xD;
      Although a family history of diabetes is an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      lifestyle factors also play an important role in its cause . However, physicians are poorly&#xD;
      informed about how their patients' alcohol use affects risk for or management of diabetes.&#xD;
      Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with lower risk of both cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and type 2 diabetes, and is also linked to lower cardiovascular risk among type 2&#xD;
      diabetics. Potential mechanisms have focused primarily on lipid metabolism, coagulation,&#xD;
      fibrinolysis, and insulin sensitivity. A recent systematic review of the literature to assess&#xD;
      the effect of alcohol consumption on risk for and management and complications of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus suggests that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk for&#xD;
      diabetes, whereas heavy alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased risk. Our aim&#xD;
      is to assess the effect of moderate alcohol intake on glycemic control and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease mediators among patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
