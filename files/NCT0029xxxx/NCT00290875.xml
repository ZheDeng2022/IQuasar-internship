  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many thousands of trauma patients are seen in Canadian emergency departments each year. On&#xD;
      rare occasions, such patients have a broken neck (cervical spine fracture) but in 98 percent&#xD;
      of cases the xrays ordered by the doctors are normal. The total cost of inexpensive but high&#xD;
      volume tests such as neck x-rays adds considerably to rising health care costs. In addition,&#xD;
      these patients are often immobilized with uncomfortable backboards and collars for many&#xD;
      hours, tying up valuable space and time in our crowded emergency departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research group recently developed and tested a highly accurate and reliable guideline&#xD;
      called the Canadian C-Spine Rule to help physicians be much more selective in their use of&#xD;
      neck x-rays and to minimize the period of immobilization. This research project will evaluate&#xD;
      the true effectiveness of the Rule when implemented with simple and inexpensive measures.&#xD;
      This study will involve 14,000 patients in 12 busy emergency departments across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Canadian C-Spine Rule is designed to allow physicians to be much more selective in their&#xD;
      use of neck xrays without the risk of missing a fracture or dislocation of the neck and to&#xD;
      reduce the length of time of immobilization. Widespread use of the guideline could lead to&#xD;
      large savings for our health care systems without jeopardizing patients and could greatly&#xD;
      expedite care of trauma patients in our crowded emergency departments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Physicians in Canadian emergency departments (EDs) annually treat 185,000 alert&#xD;
      and stable trauma victims who are at risk for cervical spine (c-spine) injury. Only 0.9% of&#xD;
      these patients have, however, suffered a cervical spine fracture. Current use of radiography&#xD;
      is not efficient. More than 98% of c-spine radiographs are negative and there is considerable&#xD;
      variation among hospitals and physicians in radiography use. C-spine radiographs are little&#xD;
      ticket items, low cost procedures that significantly add to health care costs due to high&#xD;
      volume. In addition, alert and stable trauma patients are often immobilized on a backboard&#xD;
      with a rigid collar and sandbags for many hours. This leads to considerable patient&#xD;
      discomfort and unnecessary use of valuable time and space in our crowded EDs. This renewal&#xD;
      application builds on previous MRC/CIHR grants to determine feasibility (phase 0, MRC&#xD;
      GR-13304D, 1995-96), develop a decision rule for c-spine radiography (phase I, MRC MT-13700,&#xD;
      1996-99, N=8,924), and prospectively validate this Canadian C-Spine Rule (phase II, CIHR&#xD;
      MT13700, 1999-2002, N=8,000), all part of the University of Ottawa Group Grant in Decision&#xD;
      Support Techniques (CIHR 2000-143). The Canadian C-Spine Rule is comprised of simple clinical&#xD;
      variables (Figure 1) and allows physicians to be much more selective in ordering radiography&#xD;
      (JAMA 2001). In the recently completed prospective validation (phase II), we confirmed the&#xD;
      accuracy and reliability of the rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of phase III is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an active&#xD;
      strategy to implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule into physician practice. Specific objectives&#xD;
      are to: 1) Determine clinical impact by comparing the intervention and control sites for: a)&#xD;
      C-spine radiography rates, b) Missed fractures, c) Serious adverse outcomes, d) Length of&#xD;
      stay in ED, and e) Patient satisfaction; 2) Determine sustainability of the impact; 3)&#xD;
      Evaluate performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, with regards to: a) Accuracy, b) Physician&#xD;
      accuracy in interpretation, and c) Physician comfort and compliance with use; 4) Conduct an&#xD;
      economic evaluation to determine the potential for cost savings with widespread&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We propose a matched-pair cluster design study which compares outcomes during 3&#xD;
      consecutive 12-month before, after, and decay periods at 6 pairs of intervention and control&#xD;
      sites (Figure 3). These 12 hospital ED sites will be stratified as teaching or community&#xD;
      hospitals, matched according to baseline c-spine radiography ordering rates, and then&#xD;
      allocated within each pair to either intervention or control groups. During the after period&#xD;
      at the intervention sites, simple and inexpensive strategies will be employed to actively&#xD;
      implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule: a) physician group discussion and consensus, b)&#xD;
      educational initiatives (lecture, posters, pocket cards), and c) a process-of-care&#xD;
      modification with a mandatory reminder of the Rule at the point of requisition for&#xD;
      radiography. These outcomes will be assessed: 1) Measures of clinical impact will compare the&#xD;
      changes from before to after between the intervention and control sites: a) C-spine&#xD;
      radiography ordering proportions (the primary analysis); b) Number of missed fractures; c)&#xD;
      Number of serious adverse outcomes; d) Length of stay in ED; e) Patient satisfaction. 2)&#xD;
      Performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule: a) Accuracy of the rule; b) Physician accuracy of&#xD;
      interpretation; c) Physician comfort and compliance. 3) Economic evaluation measures: a)&#xD;
      Radiography rate after discharge; b) Length of stay in ED and hospital; c) Hospital&#xD;
      admission; d) Operative repair. During the 12-month decay period, implementation strategies&#xD;
      will continue, allowing us to evaluate the sustainability of the effect. We estimate a sample&#xD;
      size of 4,800 patients in each period in order to have adequate power to evaluate the main&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: This implementation study (phase III) is an essential step in the process of&#xD;
      developing a new clinical decision rule guideline for health care practitioners. Phase I&#xD;
      successfully derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule and phase II confirmed the accuracy and safety&#xD;
      of the rule and, hence, the potential for physicians to improve care. What remains unknown is&#xD;
      the actual change in clinical behaviour that can be effected by implementation of the&#xD;
      Canadian C-Spine Rule and whether implementation can be achieved with simple and inexpensive&#xD;
      measures. We believe that the Canadian C-Spine Rule has the potential to significantly reduce&#xD;
      health care costs and improve the efficiency of patient flow in busy Canadian EDs.&#xD;
