      Objective: The evaluation of &quot;PD&quot; VitalOs Cement, an injectable brushite, as a stabilizer of&#xD;
      dental implants and a potential source for bone augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty (40) patients needing dental implants will be treated where needed with &quot;PD&quot;&#xD;
      VitalOs Cement gapping half of their sites whereas the other half will be gapped with Bio-oss&#xD;
      demineralized bone and BioGuide membrane.&#xD;

      Bone fractures or bone loss in specific sites are cases where a bone graft is sometimes&#xD;
      needed to provide bone augmentation. For bone fractures, these are typically metaphyseal or&#xD;
      maxillofacial fractures with risk of malunion or non-union. Bone loss can happen under&#xD;
      various circumstances: it can be a consequence of a systemic disease like osteoporosis or of&#xD;
      a surgical intervention like the extraction of a tooth or the removal of a bone cyst or&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a bone graft is required the gold standard still widely used is autogenous cancellous&#xD;
      bone. However, the graft harvesting procedure is invasive and increases patient morbidity&#xD;
      (lengthened surgical procedure, increased risk of infection). Moreover, the availability of&#xD;
      autologous grafts is limited, especially in elderly patients. This has been the rationale for&#xD;
      studying alternative sources for bone grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first alternative is allografts: they are usually obtained from cadavers. The advantages&#xD;
      include elimination of a patient donor site, hence reduced surgical time and decreased blood&#xD;
      loss and risk of infection. The principal shortcomings are the availability, the possible&#xD;
      rejection of the graft and the risk of disease transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grafts of animal origin (xenografts) are also an option, even though not totally risk-free&#xD;
      when it comes to disease transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third alternative to autologous bone is to use synthetic materials. Extensive research has&#xD;
      been performed to develop such materials since the 80's. The majority of them are based on&#xD;
      calcium phosphate compounds, made up of the same ions as those of the natural mineral phase&#xD;
      of bone. These products are readily available, eliminate the risk of disease transmission or&#xD;
      immunogenic response (allografts) and bypass the need for an additional surgical procedure&#xD;
      (autografts). These materials are presented under either of the three forms: granules,&#xD;
      pre-formed blocks or cements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Granules and pre-formed blocks are generally made up of β-TCP, Hydroxyapatite (HA), or a mix&#xD;
      of both. Depending mainly on their chemical composition, their manufacturing process and&#xD;
      their porosity, they degrade more or less rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium phosphate cements consist generally of a liquid and a powder which harden upon&#xD;
      mixing. The final product phase can be hydroxyapatite, or another calcium phosphate phase&#xD;
      like dahllite or brushite. The advantage of cements over pre-formed blocks is that they can&#xD;
      be injected, shaped and hardened in situ, ensuring optimum bone-implant contact and minimally&#xD;
      invasive surgery. Once hardened, they exhibit cohesive properties that granules cannot&#xD;
      provide. Most of the calcium phosphate cements available on the market are hydroxyapatite&#xD;
      cements. However, for some applications like periodontitis or peri-implant gap filling, their&#xD;
      resorption rate is too slow, hampering their clinical applicability for these indications.&#xD;
      The advantage of the brushite phase in the hardened cement is that it degrades faster than&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite, allowing a more rapid bone regeneration. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of &quot;PD&quot; VitalOs Cement as a primary stabilizer and bone augmenting&#xD;
      source in dental implantology.&#xD;
