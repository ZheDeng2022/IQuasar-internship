      Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids for Treatment of Refractory Epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine whether polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (PUFA) can be used safely and effectively as a treatment for epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Patients with intractable epilepsy are often on more than one medication and&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects. Fatty acids have been shown to be protective against&#xD;
      seizures in animal models, but there is little human data. Recently, however, a small case&#xD;
      series of patients with intractable epilepsy provided evidence of an anti-seizure effect&#xD;
      without major side effects. There are no controlled trials of PUFA in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methods: Patients with uncontrolled partial or generalized epilepsy characterized by&#xD;
      at least 4 seizures/month will be randomized to placebo vs. PUFA in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
      Subjects will remain on their current drug(s) while a 4-week baseline seizure count occurs.&#xD;
      Dosage will then be titrated over 1 week to 1.1 grams twice daily, and will be followed by a&#xD;
      15-week treatment phase with monthly visits, seizure counts, pill counts, AED levels, adverse&#xD;
      event reporting, and neurological examinations. Quality of life will be measured before and&#xD;
      after the study using the SF-36 and the QOLIE (Quality of Life in Epilepsy) -31. If subjects&#xD;
      wish to continue treatment, they will be given the opportunity at the end of the 20-week&#xD;
      period, and those randomized to placebo will have the opportunity to begin treatment with&#xD;
      PUFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The number of subjects achieving a 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the&#xD;
      15-week treatment period relative to the 4-week prospective baseline will be compared for&#xD;
      treated vs. control groups using Fisher's exact test. Secondary endpoints will include&#xD;
      percent seizure reduction, which will be analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, and quality of&#xD;
      life data, as measured by the SF-36 and QOLIE 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: There is sufficient preliminary data to suggest that PUFA can be an effective and&#xD;
      well-tolerated treatment for epilepsy. If efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PUFA are&#xD;
      confirmed, the proposed study will provide the foundation for a larger multi-center trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects must have at least one seizure or seizure cluster per week, or at&#xD;
             least four per month. They may have partial or generalized epilepsy as diagnosed by a&#xD;
             board certified neurologist with subspecialty training in epilepsy. Subjects must be&#xD;
             at least 18 years of age, and able to give signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects will be considered ineligible for the study if they exhibit&#xD;
             frequent vomiting, inability to swallow, an allergy to fatty acids, or a medical&#xD;
             condition that could interfere with oral medication intake. Subjects with markedly&#xD;
             elevated cholesterol levels (&gt;260) or who receive drugs that affect lipid metabolism,&#xD;
             such as HMG CoA inhibitors, will be excluded as well. Due to the theoretical&#xD;
             possibility of platelet dysfunction, subjects taking CoumadinÂ® or high doses of&#xD;
             aspirin (&gt;325mg daily) will not be considered eligible for the study. Subjects who are&#xD;
             pregnant or nursing will also be excluded due to any possible teratogenic effects on&#xD;
             the fetus.&#xD;
