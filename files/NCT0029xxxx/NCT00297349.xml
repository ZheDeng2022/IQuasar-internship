  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety of topiramate when used in&#xD;
      combination with other medications for seizures in adults and children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is a medication that is approved for the treatment of seizures. In accordance with&#xD;
      International guidelines, studies are conducted after a drug is marketed to continue to&#xD;
      evaluate and expand the knowledge regarding its safety. This is an open-label, multi-center&#xD;
      observational safety study to collect safety information for oral topiramate given in&#xD;
      addition to other medications for 3 types of seizures in adults and in children aged 2 years&#xD;
      and older.The 3 seizures types are focal epilepsy, LENNOX-GASTAUT syndrome epileptic seizures&#xD;
      and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Patients whose previous treatment for seizures (one or&#xD;
      more antiepileptic drugs) has been judged by their physician to be non-satisfactory will&#xD;
      receive 6 months of treatment with topiramate in addition to other antiepileptic medication&#xD;
      as prescribed by their physician. Topiramate will be given at low doses initially and&#xD;
      gradually increased as necessary to control seizure activity in accordance with Summary of&#xD;
      Product Characteristics (SmPC). Patients will be asked to keep a diary of adverse events and&#xD;
      seizure activity. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examinations,&#xD;
      vital signs and laboratory tests) will be performed throughout the study per investigators&#xD;
      usual standard of care. At the end of the study, the treating physician may continue&#xD;
      treatment with topiramate and other medication as appropriate. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      topiramate given in combination with other antiepileptic medications will be effective in&#xD;
      achieving and maintaining control of seizure activity and is well-tolerated. 225 adult&#xD;
      patients and children aged 2 years or older will be enrolled in the study. Study participants&#xD;
      should demonstrate focal epilepsy or epileptic seizures of the LENNOX-GASTAUT syndrome or&#xD;
      generalized tonoclonic seizures, who have undergone treatment with one or more antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs and whose treatment should be judged by the investigator as non-satisfactory.&#xD;
      Observational study - No investigational drug administered.&#xD;

        225 adult patients and children aged 2 years or older will be enrolled in the study. Study&#xD;
        participants should demonstrate focal epilepsy or epileptic seizures of the LENNOX-GASTAUT&#xD;
        syndrome or generalized tonoclonic seizures, who should have undergone treatment with one&#xD;
        or more antiepileptic drugs and whose treatment should be judged by the inverstigator as&#xD;
