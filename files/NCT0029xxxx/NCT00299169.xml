      Patients who are intolerant of statins in routine practice, but who lack objective evidence&#xD;
      of significant harm, will be randomized to receive statins by either n of 1 trials or&#xD;
      standard practice. Our hypothesis is that n of 1 trials will improve statin adherence,&#xD;
      thereby improving low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholesterol lowering medications called &quot;statins&quot; decrease heart disease in people with&#xD;
      diabetes but research shows that many patients are not taking these medications, sometimes&#xD;
      because of side effects. In our experience, the side effects attributed to statin therapy are&#xD;
      often subjective, non-specific, and not associated with objective evidence for a clinically&#xD;
      important problem. The most common example is muscle cramps despite a normal CK level, but&#xD;
      other symptoms include fatigue, GI intolerance, and neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the effects of treatments are determined using randomized controlled trials. N&#xD;
      of 1 trials minimize these biases through randomization, double-blinding, and multiple&#xD;
      crossovers, and are therefore excellent tools to evaluate adverse effects of therapies when&#xD;
      symptoms are non-specific and objective evidence for a causal relationship is ambiguous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are intolerant of statins in routine practice, but who lack objective evidence&#xD;
      of significant harm, will be randomized to receive statins by either n of 1 trials or&#xD;
      standard practice. Our hypothesis is that n of 1 trials will improve statin adherence,&#xD;
      thereby improving low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Patients in the n of 1&#xD;
      trials group will be given 1 month courses of either simvastatin or placebo. Patients in the&#xD;
      group who are receiving statins according to standard practice will be given a prescription&#xD;
      by the doctor in the usual way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, we will determine if more patients participating in n of 1 trials&#xD;
      group are taking statins compared to the patients in the conventional group and if this leads&#xD;
      to lower cholesterol levels. We plan to use the results of this small feasibility study to&#xD;
      test the methods and to plan a larger study on the same question.&#xD;
