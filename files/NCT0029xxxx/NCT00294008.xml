    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional web based registry designed to assess demographic,&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes data in patients receiving treatment with long-acting injectable&#xD;
      risperidone. One year retrospective data and 2 year prospective data will be collected.&#xD;

      This study is a multicentre, retrospective and prospective observational, cohort design,&#xD;
      determining aggregate drug usage patterns and commonly used clinical outcomes associated with&#xD;
      the use of long-acting injectable risperidone. The objectives of this study are to collect&#xD;
      sufficient retrospective outcome data to allow the evaluation of treatment outcomes with long&#xD;
      acting medication compared to previous treatments and to document clinical effectiveness and&#xD;
      long-term treatment outcomes in actual practice. Additional objectives are to prospectively&#xD;
      assess medication usage patterns and to evaluate reasons for initiation and/or&#xD;
      discontinuation of new antipsychotic medications. The study design is a non-interventional,&#xD;
      single-arm, observational survey on the use of long-acting injectable risperidone and other&#xD;
      long-acting (depot) or oral atypical antipsychotics, with the aim to assess patient outcomes&#xD;
      by existing risk or disease factors, patient characteristics, or previous medication. Having&#xD;
      reached agreement with the patient on starting treatment with long-acting injectable&#xD;
      risperidone, physicians have the opportunity to document the patient's clinical data in the&#xD;
      Registry. At baseline, data will be collected retrospectively over a minimum period of&#xD;
      12-months per patient. Data will be collected prospectively over a 24-month period per&#xD;
      patient at approximately 3-month intervals after starting treatment. This study will document&#xD;
      data of patients for whom treatment with the new antipsychotic medication is indicated, and&#xD;
      who are being treated according to the local label. The start date for collecting data is the&#xD;
      date the new antipsychotic treatment is initiated, whether as inpatient or outpatient. The&#xD;
      preceding 12 months and the next 2 years are respectively for each patient the retrospective&#xD;
      and prospective periods of interest. All patients starting with a new antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication, decided after agreement between the physician and the patient, in accordance with&#xD;
      the local label, are eligible for inclusion in this survey. While patients participating in&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials are not excluded, their participation will be noted. Data will be&#xD;
      entered by the treating physician. All data collected must be the result of the normal&#xD;
      medical care of the patient. No intervention on treatment decisions permitted. The patient's&#xD;
      baseline data will be collected within the first week following initiation of the new&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment. Prospective data collection has to occur 3 months, 6 months, 9&#xD;
      months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 21 months and 24 months after initiation of the new&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment. If a patient stops the newly initiated antipsychotic treatment the&#xD;
      reason for discontinuation has to be reported. Patients discontinuing newly initiated&#xD;
      antipsychotic treatment will continue to be followed for up to 24 months. In retrospective&#xD;
      period the following treatment outcomes will be assessed: patient characteristics, treatment&#xD;
      history with antipsychotics and other concomitant medication, hospitalization history, reason&#xD;
      for initiating the new antipsychotic treatment, treatment satisfaction, remission, clinical&#xD;
      global impression (CGI-severity), global assessment of functioning (GAF) and clinical&#xD;
      deterioration. In prospective period clinical effectiveness will be assessing the following:&#xD;
      employment status, remission, treatment satisfaction, CGI-severity, GAF, clinical&#xD;
      deterioration, hospitalization, treatment adherence and (serious) adverse events. Long-acting&#xD;
      injectable risperidone is flexible dose (25mg to 75mg), intramuscular injection given into&#xD;
      gluteus for 24 months&#xD;
