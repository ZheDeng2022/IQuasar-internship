    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
      drug (AV608) when used in subjects who have Social Anxiety Disorder. AV608 is an NK-1&#xD;
      receptor antagonist that exhibits central nervous system activity after oral administration.&#xD;
      The study will compare AV608 to placebo (a medically inactive substance) to see if AV608&#xD;
      helps the symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder. Eligible subjects will be assigned by chance&#xD;
      to take either AV608 or placebo for 12 weeks. During the study, subjects will be asked about&#xD;
      their overall health and mood and their Social Anxiety Disorder.&#xD;
