      This study will help determine whether the use of a wireless glucose meter and and an&#xD;
      internet-based automated diabetes management system to organize blood glucose values will&#xD;
      help improve glucose control during the start of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion&#xD;
      therapy by an insulin pump device in patients with type 1 diabetes. Outcome measures to be&#xD;
      determined include an assessment of glucose excursions, overall glucose control, health care&#xD;
      team staff and patient time required and a satisfaction survey.&#xD;

      The study is focused on the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether the use of the GlucoDYNAMIX™ diabetes intervention system and the&#xD;
           GlucoMON™ telemetry device will facilitate faster regulation of blood glucose excursions&#xD;
           into a well-controlled range, compared to conventional monitoring and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hemoglobin A1c at the end of the 3 month study period and again after an additional&#xD;
                3 month follow-up period to account for a possible for an extended difference&#xD;
                between the groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  magnitude of glucose excursions and fluctuations as indicated by the standard&#xD;
                deviation between glucose tests to indicate relative glucose control and the mean&#xD;
                daily glucose value over the 3 month period following the initiation of pump&#xD;
                therapy; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  frequency of severe hypoglycemia and extended hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether use of the GlucoDYNAMIX intervention system, during initiation of&#xD;
           adult insulin pump starts, results in a measured saving of staff time in support of data&#xD;
           collection, analysis and patient feedback including delivery and follow-up to monitor&#xD;
           effects on glucose control from patient implementation of prescribed changes. This&#xD;
           objective will be measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  tracking the number of interventions each day;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  estimating the amount of time spent collecting, analyzing and communicating with&#xD;
                each study patient; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  daily logs will be tallied and verified weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine through use of questionnaires administered to the patients and to the&#xD;
           professional staff whether use of the technology results in perceived improvement in the&#xD;
           quality of care and improved satisfaction for all involved. This objective is primarily&#xD;
           concerned with people's willingness to commit to using a similar technology as standard&#xD;
           practice for future initiation of insulin pump starts for adult patient with diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Description The study is designed to run for a period of 3 months of&#xD;
      intensive management for each enrolled patient as they begin insulin pump therapy plus&#xD;
      detailed glucose records beginning 4 weeks prior to the initiation of insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
      Understanding relative glucose control following intensive management requires that we&#xD;
      consider the results of the patient's HbA1c 3 months after conclusion of intensive management&#xD;
      thus extending the time frame to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A The Intervention Technology Group will be issued a GlucoMON device, a GlucoMON&#xD;
      wall-mount recharging unit, a OneTouch Ultra glucose meter, paper logbook forms and test&#xD;
      strips to support frequent testing for the 3 months following initiation of insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy. The patient will be instructed on use and care of the GlucoMON as well as the&#xD;
      OneTouch Ultra during a one-on-one session at the meeting immediately prior to initial&#xD;
      delivery of insulin via the pump start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are also issued a specially configured low-cost 2way wireless email device which&#xD;
      supports sending and receiving individual messages of up to 500 characters including the&#xD;
      ability to send canned response options for easy data marking. Real-time messaging as part of&#xD;
      the system is described in Addendum B. The intelligent logic behind the patient interaction&#xD;
      is managed on a server in Diabetech's remote data center thus allowing for easy modification&#xD;
      and centralized management of the patient interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TJU diabetes staff will initially review the patient record daily and will document the&#xD;
      results of their review including any changes prescribed to the patient and the approximate&#xD;
      amount of time involved in the handling of the encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (Control) The Conventional Technology Group will be issued a OneTouch Ultra glucose&#xD;
      meter, paper logbook forms and test strips to support frequent testing for the 3 months&#xD;
      following initiation of insulin pump therapy. The patient will be instructed on use and care&#xD;
      of the OneTouch Ultra during a one-on-one session at the meeting to begin initial delivery of&#xD;
      insulin via the pump start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to complete the logbooks and fax daily to the TJU diabetes&#xD;
      center. The TJU diabetes staff are available to review patient logs Monday thru Friday 8-5.&#xD;
      Emergency after hours help is also available. The staff will initially review the patient&#xD;
      logbook and will document the results of their review including any changes prescribed to the&#xD;
      patient and the approximate amount of time involved in the handling of the encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The data collected will include the patient's self-monitoring blood glucose&#xD;
      (SMBG) test data, time-event logging annotations to the glucose tests, baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c test results, clinical events including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and&#xD;
      results of satisfaction questionnaires and time spent for analysis by the clinical staff for&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoints to be measured include frequent blood glucose testing, as is usual when a&#xD;
      patient is initiating therapy with an insulin infusion pump, as well as HbA1c. The glucose&#xD;
      levels will be analyzed with regard to the magnitude of glucose excursions and fluctuations&#xD;
      and the mean daily glucose value over the 6 month period following the initiation of pump&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean and standard deviation of each treatment group's (intervention and control) HbA1c&#xD;
      will be calculated for each time point (0, 3, and 6 months post enrollment). Statistical&#xD;
      differences in the HbA1c values between treatment groups at each time point and between&#xD;
      different time points for each group will be sought. In addition, the change in HbA1c between&#xD;
      time points (0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 0 to 6) will be calculated. The mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      of these HbA1c changes will be calculated for each treatment group and analyzed for&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMBG data will be analyzed using glycemic control indices to compare the efficacy of both&#xD;
      treatments. The following numerical indices will be used to describe the quality of metabolic&#xD;
      control:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The mean and standard deviation of patient SMBG data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The percentage of SMBG data points that are above and below a threshold for&#xD;
           hyperglycemia (e.g., 200mg/dl) and hypoglycemia (e.g., 60mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The M-value is a quantitative index of the lack of treatment efficacy of an individual&#xD;
           patient. The index describes both mean glycemic control and glucose excursions. The&#xD;
           M-value is a logarithmic transformation of the deviation from an arbitrary standard&#xD;
           (selected by the physician) that gives extra weight to hypoglycemic values. The original&#xD;
           concept of Schlichtkrull et al. (1965)3 has been modified by Service et al. (1970) 4&#xD;
           into the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           |10 log10 (x/standard)|3 / n where x is a SMBG data point, standard is aM = glucose&#xD;
           value chosen to define the degree of metabolic control (typically 100 mg/dl), and n is&#xD;
           the number of samples. BG values below 100mg/dl cause the M-value to rise rapidly while&#xD;
           BG values above 100 mg/dl cause the M-value to rise more slowly. M-values less than 18&#xD;
           correspond to good metabolic control [Schlichtkrull J 1965].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) quantifies the amplitude and duration&#xD;
           of wide swings of BG values, diurnal variability of mean BG values, and episodes of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia as an index of diabetic instability. MAGE is calculated by taking the&#xD;
           arithmetic mean of the changes in BG when they exceed one standard deviation of the BG&#xD;
           mean over the preceding 24-hour period. Excursions less than 1 standard deviation are&#xD;
           ignored. MAGE is a valuable index of metabolic control in healthy and diabetic subjects&#xD;
           [Service 1970]. MAGE averaged 42 mg/dl in healthy subjects, 147 mg/dl in type 1 diabetic&#xD;
           patients treated with multiple injections of short-acting insulin, and 161 mg/dl in type&#xD;
           1 diabetic patients treated with a single daily injection of intermediate-acting&#xD;
           insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These indices will be computed using a moving window of data. The window will be stepped&#xD;
      across each patient's SMBG data set through the intensive management period. Those data&#xD;
      points that fall within the window will be used to compute the indices. The steps and widths&#xD;
      of the window will be set at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days. For example, with a step and width of 7&#xD;
      days, each calculation of the M-value of a patient's SMBG data would encompass 7 days and&#xD;
      there would be 12 different calculations for each week of the 3-month intensive management&#xD;
      period. Statistical differences in the indices for a given window for each treatment group&#xD;
      will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of time taken by nurses and physicians to manage each patient will be tabulated.&#xD;
      These data will be used to compute a cost associated with the management of the insulin pump&#xD;
      start for each patient. The mean and standard deviation of this cost will be calculated for&#xD;
      each treatment group and analyzed for a statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paired Student t-test or a one-way analysis of variance will be used to calculate a&#xD;
      significant difference. A p value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Care Guidelines typically involve the diabetes center distributing a handbook of&#xD;
      sorts to the patient upon diagnosis or as part of the initial visit to your center. In terms&#xD;
      of ongoing care, patients are responsible for acquiring tools on their own for managing&#xD;
      diabetes. In addition to insulin, patients must purchase their own glucose meters, test&#xD;
      strips, lancing device, lancets, alcohol, fast acting sugar of some sort to treat low blood&#xD;
      sugar, glucagon for severe hypoglycemia, etc... Depending on the form of insulin therapy, the&#xD;
      patient must also purchase syringes or an insulin pump with disposable cartridges and&#xD;
      infusion sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the duration of the study, patients enrolled as Standard Care (Group B) will be given a&#xD;
      glucose meter and test strips at no charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate communication of blood sugars and other diabetes relevant data with the center,&#xD;
      the diabetes center shares one page of a standardized logbook form on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper. It is&#xD;
      the patient's responsibility to make copies of this form for their own use and also to&#xD;
      deliver these completed forms to the diabetes center as needed. Methods for delivering this&#xD;
      logbook include faxing (a patient must purchase their own fax machine or pay/borrow as well&#xD;
      as any costs associated with fax transmission), US Mail (using their own envelope and&#xD;
      postage) or hand deliver (using their own transportation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population As a patient elects to participate they will be assigned alternatively to&#xD;
      either Group A or Group B beginning with assignment of the first patient enrolled into Group&#xD;
      A.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must reside in the Philadelphia area and participate in regular in person visits&#xD;
        to the Jefferson Diabetes Research Center. Patients must be at the stage of their treatment&#xD;
        where they are going to initiate insulin infusion pump therapy. Patients must be at least&#xD;
        18 years of age before starting the protocol and must have never used an insulin pump&#xD;
        before. Ideally, at least a few of the study participants will use English as a second&#xD;
        language. Since the technology is capable of delivering messages to the wireless email&#xD;
        device in several languages including Spanish and French, there is no English only&#xD;
        requirement. Likewise, patients not capable of operating the wireless email device will be&#xD;
        included since the GlucoMON device is specially designed to enable patient use without&#xD;
        technology aptitude typical for personal computers and interactive wireless devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients living outside the Philadelphia area and those that are not immediately going to&#xD;
        initiate insulin pump therapy wil be excluded. Patients unwilling to perform at least 4&#xD;
        blood glucose self-tests will be ineligible for participation in this study. Conventional&#xD;
        guidelines for minimum self-care will apply including criteria for discontinuance of&#xD;
        insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
