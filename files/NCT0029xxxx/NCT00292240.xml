  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, many new programs intended to prevent substance use among adolescents&#xD;
      have been developed and evaluated. There has been a recent shift towards brief interventions&#xD;
      for youth in school (Brown, 2001; D'Amico and Fromme, 2002) and health care settings, such as&#xD;
      emergency rooms and inpatient clinics (Barnett et al., 2001; Colby et al., 1998; Monti et&#xD;
      al., 1999). Although the primary care setting presents a unique opportunity to intervene with&#xD;
      youth concerning drug use, such as marijuana or inhalants, many youth are not screened for&#xD;
      use (Friedman et al., 1990; Johnson and Millstein, 2003; Middleman et al., 1995) and&#xD;
      preventive services in this setting are significantly below recommended levels&#xD;
      (Halpern-Felsher et al., 2000; Klein et al., 2001; Ozer et al., 2001). The objectives of the&#xD;
      proposed research are to: 1) explore the feasibility of adapting a brief intervention from&#xD;
      our previous work for use in the primary care (PC) setting, and 2) assess the short-term&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention in the PC setting. During year 1, focus groups of high-risk&#xD;
      youth (n=16), parents (n=8), and providers (n=8) will provide feedback on barriers to&#xD;
      implementing a substance use brief intervention in a PC setting. We define high-risk youth as&#xD;
      those who may have already developed regular patterns of use or have experienced some&#xD;
      problems due to their use. In addition, the intervention will be pilot tested with 10&#xD;
      high-risk youth who will provide feedback on intervention content. Revisions will be made to&#xD;
      the intervention curriculum based on this feedback and in year 2, the short-term efficacy of&#xD;
      the intervention will be tested with a small sample of high-risk youth (n=30). This study&#xD;
      will extend brief intervention research for youth, as it will be one of the first to examine&#xD;
      the feasibility of implementing a brief substance use intervention to PC with high-risk youth&#xD;
      and to determine the impact of this intervention on short-term outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, many new programs intended to motivate adolescents to decrease&#xD;
      substance use have been developed and evaluated. There has been a recent shift towards brief&#xD;
      interventions for youth in school (Brown, 2001; D'Amico and Fromme, 2002) and health care&#xD;
      settings, such as emergency rooms and inpatient clinics (Barnett et al., 2001; Colby et al.,&#xD;
      1998; Monti et al., 1999). Many youth who use drugs and alcohol are at risk for consequences&#xD;
      (Johnston et al., 2003). The primary care setting presents a unique opportunity to intervene&#xD;
      with substance abusing adolescents as 70% of youth age 10-18 visit a physician approximately&#xD;
      3 times a year (Gans and Newacheck, 1991; Monheit and Cunningham, 1992). However, many youth&#xD;
      are not screened for use in this setting (Friedman et al., 1990; Johnson and Millstein, 2003;&#xD;
      Middleman et al., 1995) and preventive services are significantly below recommended levels&#xD;
      (Halpern-Felsher et al., 2000; Klein et al., 2001; Ozer et al., 2001). This may be due to&#xD;
      clinician time constraints and insufficient training on substance abuse, adolescent fear that&#xD;
      parents may see the record, and clinician discomfort in asking questions about substance use&#xD;
      (Blum, 1987; Blum et al., 1996; Lustig et al., 2001; Marcell et al., 2002; Middleman et al.,&#xD;
      1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present proposal is designed to meet the objectives of the Exploratory/Developmental&#xD;
      Grants program (R21) for studies that will contribute to the development of future, more&#xD;
      intensive and larger research programs. The objectives of the proposed research are to: 1)&#xD;
      explore the feasibility of adapting a brief intervention from our previous work in schools&#xD;
      and emergency rooms for use in the primary care setting, and 2) assess the short-term&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention in the primary care setting. This project serves as our first&#xD;
      step in an innovative line of research designed to examine the viability of utilizing brief&#xD;
      interventions targeting adolescent drug use in primary care settings. Our objectives will be&#xD;
      accomplished through the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore the feasibility of adapting a brief intervention for high-risk youth in a&#xD;
           primary care (PC) setting. We will determine barriers and facilitative factors&#xD;
           associated with implementing a brief intervention in a PC setting through focus groups&#xD;
           with high-risk youth (n=16), parents (n=8), and clinicians (n=8). Intervention content&#xD;
           will be established through modifications of our previous brief intervention work in&#xD;
           school and hospital settings and from focus group feedback from adolescents, clinicians,&#xD;
           and parents. We anticipate the intervention will take 15 minutes and will be implemented&#xD;
           by a clinician (e.g., nurse) in the PC setting. The intervention will emphasize&#xD;
           motivational techniques and will address a variety of substances, including marijuana,&#xD;
           inhalants, alcohol, and cigarettes. We will pilot test the intervention with a small&#xD;
           sample of high-risk youth (n=10) to obtain feedback to discern whether the intervention&#xD;
           was difficult to implement (e.g., time constraints, comfort level) and how youth felt&#xD;
           about receiving feedback from their clinicians on their substance use (e.g., was it&#xD;
           helpful? What other topics would they have liked to discuss?). We will modify content&#xD;
           based on this feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implement and assess short-term efficacy of a brief intervention for high-risk youth in&#xD;
           a PC setting. We will implement the intervention in the PC setting with a small sample&#xD;
           of high-risk youth (n=30) and assess its potential impact on short-term outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
           perceived prevalence of peer use, self-change efforts) at a 3-month follow up. These&#xD;
           youth will be compared to an assessment only control group (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will culminate with the development of a longer-term plan for implementing and&#xD;
      evaluating the intervention more intensively with a larger sample. Products will include: 1)&#xD;
      intervention materials adapted for use with high-risk youth in primary care settings, 2)&#xD;
      pilot data on intervention feasibility and implementation, and 3) an R01 application to&#xD;
      examine the generalizability and long-term impact of the intervention.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  12-18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  english speaker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  screen positive for alcohol and/or drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        We use a brief screener to identify youth at high-risk for drug or alcohol abuse. The&#xD;
        CRAFFT was developed by Knight and colleagues to screen youth for alcohol and other drug&#xD;
        use and is a mnemonic based on the six questions it asks. The CRAFFT is comprised from&#xD;
        items from the RAFFT (Riggs and Alario, 1989), DAP (Drug and Alcohol Problems) (Klitzner et&#xD;
        al., 1987) and POSIT (Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers) (Rahdert, 1991).&#xD;
        The CRAFFT is brief, highly correlated with the Personal Involvement with Chemicals Scale&#xD;
        (PICS), a criterion standard (r = .84), and is practical for use in a primary care setting&#xD;
        as it takes only a few minutes to administer (Knight et al., 1999). The measure includes&#xD;
        the following Yes/No questions: 1) have you ever ridden in a car driven by someone&#xD;
        (including yourself) who was high or had been using alcohol or drugs?, 2) do you ever use&#xD;
        alcohol or drugs to relax, feel better about yourself, or fit in?, 3) do you ever use&#xD;
        alcohol or drugs while you are by yourself (alone)?, 4) do you ever forget things you did&#xD;
        while using alcohol or drugs?, 5) have you ever gotten into trouble while you were using&#xD;
        alcohol or drugs?, and 6) do your family and friends ever tell you that you should cut down&#xD;
        on your drinking or drug use?. The six items have a cut-off score of 2 or greater with a&#xD;
        sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 82.5% for long-term treatment need (as identified&#xD;
        by PICS scores) (Knight et al., 1999). We use a cut-off of 1 or greater, reflecting a less&#xD;
        stringent criterion for &quot;high-risk&quot; that includes adolescents with potential problems who&#xD;
        could benefit from a brief intervention in the primary care setting.&#xD;
