  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2000, a pneumococcal conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine (PCV) was licensed for use in children and is now part of the routine childhood&#xD;
      vaccine schedule. PCV is known to reduce invasive disease and protect against nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      (NP) acquisition of vaccine serotype pneumococci; it also results in an increased risk of&#xD;
      nonvaccine serotype carriage. This study proposes to assess the longterm impact of vaccine on&#xD;
      NP carriage in a setting where there is intense antibody pressure on the ecology of the&#xD;
      pneumococcus. A cross sectional study of pneumococcal NP colonization among American Indian&#xD;
      children will be combined with surveillance for invasive disease in the same population. The&#xD;
      purpose is to determine the impact of community wide PCV use on NP colonization and the&#xD;
      relationship with invasive disease. This longterm safety issue needs to be assessed to fully&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of vaccine on NP ecology and invasive disease.&#xD;

      There are four specific aims for this study: (1) to determine the overall and serotype&#xD;
      specific prevalence and incidence of pneumococcal carriage among children and adults at high&#xD;
      risk for carriage and disease in the era of routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) use&#xD;
      compared with those measures in the same population prior to use of PCV vaccine; (2) to&#xD;
      characterize the intrafamilial NP transmission of clones among those living with children&#xD;
      less than 8 years of age; (3) to determine the immune correlates of protection from serotype&#xD;
      specific pneumococcal carriage among individuals immunized and not immunized with PCV; and&#xD;
      (4) to determine the relative invasiveness of serotypes of pneumococcus during an era of&#xD;
      widespread PCV use and compare this to the relative invasiveness of serotypes prior to&#xD;
      routine use of PCV.&#xD;
