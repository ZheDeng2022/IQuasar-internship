    <measure>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Response (Clinical Response or Remission) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>CDAI Response is presented as the percentage of subjects with clinical response at Week 6 or remission at Week 6. Clinical response is defined as at least a 100-point decrease from the Week 0 CDAI score, where change = (CDAI score at Week 6) - (CDAI score at Week 0). Remission is defined as a CDAI of &lt;= 150 at Week 6.</description>

    <measure>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's Disease. The CDAI score can range from 0-600 (600 indicating the worst disease). It is the sum of 8 subscores, only the summary score is used here. A CDAI score of 150 or less is considered as remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease. A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <title>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's Disease. The CDAI score can range from 0-600 (600 indicating the worst disease). It is the sum of 8 subscores, only the summary score is used here. A CDAI score of 150 or less is considered as remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease. A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <title>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's Disease. The CDAI score can range from 0-600 (600 indicating the worst disease). It is the sum of 8 subscores, only the summary score is used here. A CDAI score of 150 or less is considered as remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease. A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity.</description>
