  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia is frequently seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&#xD;
      Hyperphosphatemia usually results in a high calcium-phosphorus product (CPP) which may&#xD;
      subsequently lead to artery and become a risk factor of cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
      Alendronate, due to its effect of inhibiting osteoclasts, is approved for treatment of&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Previous reports found the use of bisphosphonates could suppress arterial&#xD;
      calcification in hemodialysis dialysis patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of alendronate to suppress coronary artery and aortic calcifications, as&#xD;
      well as to improve bone density in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include ESRD patients who had received maintenance PD for more than 3 months,&#xD;
      have high CPP level (≧55), and have chest X-ray proven aortic calcification or coronary&#xD;
      artery calcification. All participants are randomly allocated to either group 1 or group 2.&#xD;
      Group 1 patients receive alendronate 70 mg once weekly in the first 16 weeks, while group 2&#xD;
      patients receive the same dose of drug every week in the second 16 weeks. The extent of&#xD;
      coronary artery and aortic calcification is evaluated by using multi-detector spiral computed&#xD;
      tomography, whereas bone mineral density is measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.&#xD;
      Both examinations are performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each participant. Laboratory studies&#xD;
      and possible adverse reactions were regularly monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that alendronate can alleviate the progression of arterial calcification or even&#xD;
      improve it. Bone density may also be improved after treatment. Besides, we wish to find the&#xD;
      independent factor(s) influencing the efficacy of alendronate. These results may help&#xD;
      clinical physicians for early intervention and prevention of cardiovascular complications in&#xD;
      ESRD patients.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to determine if long-term use of alendronate can&#xD;
      suppress coronary artery and aortic calcification in chronic PD patients. The effect of&#xD;
      alendronate on bone mineral density in this patient group is also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients To be eligible for the study, patients have to meet all of the following&#xD;
           criteria: (1) have received maintenance PD for more than 3 months at Far Eastern&#xD;
           Memorial Hospital, (2) have high CPP level (≧55), and (3) have chest X-ray proven aortic&#xD;
           calcification or coronary artery calcification proven before. Patients are excluded if&#xD;
           they have any one of the following conditions: (1) had been hospitalized in recent 3&#xD;
           months due to severe comorbid diseases, (2) are hypersensitive to alendronate or any of&#xD;
           its components, (3) have esophageal diseases (4) are not able to stand or sit upright&#xD;
           for 30 minutes, (5) have refractory hypocalcemia, or (6) patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each eligible participant has to give his/her written informed consent before the start&#xD;
           of study. The study should be approved by the Institutional Review Board of the&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design The study is a prospective, randomized cross-over study. Fifty patients&#xD;
           will be included. All participants are randomly allocated to either group 1 or group 2.&#xD;
           Each group consists of 25 patients. Group 1 patients receive alendronate 70 mg once&#xD;
           weekly since the first week till the 16th week of the study, while group 2 patients&#xD;
           receive the same dose of drug every week since the 17th week till the 32nd week. Group 1&#xD;
           patients will not receive alendronate since the 17th week till the 32nd week, and group&#xD;
           2 patients will not receive alendronate since the first week till the 16 week. The&#xD;
           extent of coronary artery and aortic calcification is evaluated by using multi-detector&#xD;
           spiral computed tomography, whereas bone mineral density is measured by dual-energy&#xD;
           X-ray absorptiometry. Both examinations are performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each&#xD;
           participant. Serum level of calcium should be kept within normal limits and serum level&#xD;
           of phosphorus should be kept below 6 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （3）Administration of Alendronate One tablet of alendronate (70 mg per tablet) should be&#xD;
      swallowed by each patient once every week with water at least 30 minutes before breakfast,&#xD;
      beverage or medication of the day during the treatment period. Patients must not lie down for&#xD;
      at least 30 minutes after taking the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （4）Measurement of Coronary Artery and Aortic Calcification Multi-detector spiral computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) of the chest is performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each participant to&#xD;
      measure the extent of coronary and aortic calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （5）Measurement of Bone Density Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is performed at week 0, 16&#xD;
      and 32 for each participant to measure the density of bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （6）Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Patients characteristics such as age&#xD;
      and sex are documented. Clinical parameters including body height, body weight, duration of&#xD;
      dialysis, calcium concentration of dialysate, and medication under use are recorded. Blood&#xD;
      pressure is measured at each clinical visit for 3 times after the patient has sit for at&#xD;
      least 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （7）Collection of Laboratory Data Fasting serum levels of albumin, phosphorus, calcium,&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase (ALP), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and hemoglobin level of each&#xD;
      patient are checked at study entry and once every month. Fasting serum levels of&#xD;
      triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol), low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) of each&#xD;
      patient are checked at study entry and once every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （8）Record of Adverse Effects of Alendronate Any adverse effect of alendronate is recorded&#xD;
      every month at clinic visit. （9）Compliance of Patients Compliance of the patients is&#xD;
      monitored by using telephone call once every week during the treatment period with&#xD;
      alendronate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      （10）Statistical Analysis All values are expressed as mean ± SD. All data are tested for&#xD;
      normal distribution before analysis. Differences between mean values of the 2 groups are&#xD;
      tested by means of analysis of variance. Group comparisons of categorical variables are&#xD;
      analyzed using chi-square test. Multivariate regression is applied to identify independent&#xD;
      determinants of coronary artery and aortic calcification. A probability less than 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
