      This proposal is designed to achieve the following specific aims and will test the associated&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To compare walking ability, standing posture, gait initiation and functional standing&#xD;
      and stepping of twenty children with typical development to that of twenty children with&#xD;
      spastic diplegia or hemiplegia, CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with CP will demonstrate impaired coordination as compared to children of&#xD;
           typical development. In addition, children with CP will demonstrate inappropriate foot&#xD;
           contact area, decreased velocity and step length as compared to children of typical&#xD;
           development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with CP will demonstrate impaired postural control as compared to children of&#xD;
           typical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with CP will demonstrate an impaired gait initiation motor program as compared&#xD;
           to children with typical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with CP will take more time to complete the timed up and go test and&#xD;
           demonstrate decreased reaching distances in the functional reach test as compared to&#xD;
           children of typical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Using a single-blinded, randomized, controlled study design, to assess the ability of&#xD;
      a 12-week at-home electrical stimulation gait training program to improve walking ability,&#xD;
      standing posture, gait initiation, functional standing and stepping, and satisfaction with&#xD;
      walking ability for a group of 10 children with spastic diplegia or hemiplegia CP as compared&#xD;
      to a group of 10 children with spastic diplegia or hemiplegia CP who undergo a 12-week&#xD;
      at-home gait training program without electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ES gait training group will demonstrate improved joint coordination as compared to&#xD;
           the group undergoing a gait training program without ES. The ES gait training group will&#xD;
           demonstrate improved foot contact area, increased self-selected walking velocity and&#xD;
           greater step length as compared to the group undergoing a gait training program without&#xD;
           ES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ES gait training group will demonstrate improved postural control as compared to the&#xD;
           group undergoing a gait training program without ES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ES gait training group will demonstrate improved gait initiation as compared to the&#xD;
           gait training group without ES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ES gait training group will demonstrate decreased times on the Timed Up and Go and&#xD;
           an increase in functional reach as compared to the group undergoing a gait training&#xD;
           program without ES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ES gait training group will demonstrate greater satisfaction and self-perceived&#xD;
           performance on everyday tasks related to walking function and posture as measured by the&#xD;
           COPM compared to the group that undergoes a gait training program without ES.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded, randomized, controlled pre-test/post-test study design (Figure 4).&#xD;
      The twenty children with spastic diplegia or hemiplegia CP will be randomized by a&#xD;
      statistician to one of two treatment groups. One group will undergo a 12-week at-home gait&#xD;
      training program with ES, subjects/guardians can choose either the surface or percutaneous&#xD;
      stimulation subgroup, and the second group will undergo a 12-week at-home gait training&#xD;
      program without ES. For both groups, data will be collected at five points: just before gait&#xD;
      training, after 4 and 8 weeks of gait training, at the conclusion of gait training (after 12&#xD;
      weeks), and 4 weeks after gait training has been discontinued (16 weeks post initiation of&#xD;
      gait training). Data collection at each follow-up point will include the kinetics and&#xD;
      kinematics of walking, standing posture, gait initiation, plantar pressures, the&#xD;
      administration of the Timed Up &amp; Go and Functional Reach Test, and the assessment of lower&#xD;
      extremity muscle strength using a hand-held dynamometer. The Canadian Occupational&#xD;
      Performance Measure (COPM) will be applied before and after the 12-week gait training program&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after the gait training has been discontinued. For the 20 children with typical&#xD;
      development, the same data will be collected (except for the COPM) and used for comparison to&#xD;
      the pre-training data collected from all 20 children with CP.&#xD;
