    <textblock>
      Although it is possible to cure bowel cancer when it is detected at an early stage, in many&#xD;
      cases it may spread to involve other organs and in these cases is generally incurable.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves quality of life in such patients, but standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy for this disease has not been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several possible chemotherapy treatments for patients with bowel cancer, which has&#xD;
      spread to other organs. However, these treatments are only partly effective and only work for&#xD;
      a limited period of time. Most treatments are associated with a number of possible side&#xD;
      effects which may have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Thus, it is imperative that&#xD;
      more effective treatments with the lowest possible risk of side effects are developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that the addition of a new type of antibody treatment&#xD;
      (bevacizumab) to an intensive combination chemotherapy regimen improved survival in patients&#xD;
      with advanced bowel cancer and extended the time before tumours began to grow. However,&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy is likely to only be a suitable treatment for a proportion of patients&#xD;
      with bowel cancer, because intensive chemotherapy causes a high rate of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares a gentle chemotherapy treatment (capecitabine chemotherapy tablets given&#xD;
      by mouth) with the combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab and the combination of&#xD;
      capecitabine, bevacizumab and intravenous mitomycin C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that a gentle chemotherapy treatment or a gentle chemotherapy treatment&#xD;
      combined with bevacizumab would be an appropriate treatment for both young and fit patients&#xD;
      as well as older and less fit patients who would not easily tolerate intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;

      Aims - The phase II stage of the study aims to determine the relative toxicity of the&#xD;
      combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab and the combination of capecitabine, mitomycin C&#xD;
      (MMC) and bevacizumab with that of capecitabine monotherapy and to assess tumour response&#xD;
      rate (RECIST criteria) for each arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase III stage the primary objective is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) on&#xD;
      the three arms. Secondary objectives are to determine treatment related toxicity; to&#xD;
      determine tumour response rates (RECIST criteria); to determine overall survival for each&#xD;
      treatment arm; to compare disease related symptoms and Quality of life and to determine cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of bevacizumab containing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan Synopsis - Trial Design: Randomised, stratified multicentre phase II/III study.&#xD;
      The study will proceed in 2 phases, initially a randomised phase II stage evaluating safety&#xD;
      after 60 patients (approx 20 per arm) and 150 patients (approx 50 per arm) have completed at&#xD;
      least 6 weeks' treatment. This will continue with a randomised phase III stage evaluating&#xD;
      activity, toxicity and quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments: Patients will be randomised to treatment in either one of the three arms: I)&#xD;
      Capecitabine as monotherapy ; 2) Capecitabine and bevacizumab; or 3) Capecitabine and&#xD;
      bevacizumab and MMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration: Arm 1: Capecitabine 2500mg/m2/d (in 2 divided doses) d1-14 q3weekly. Arm&#xD;
      2: Capecitabine administered as per Arm 1 plus Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg q3weekly. Arm 3:&#xD;
      Capecitabine and Bevacizumab administered as per Arm 2 plus Mitomycin C 7 mg/m2 q 6weekly&#xD;
      (maximum dose 14 mg, maximum 4 treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: A total sample size of 333 patients (111 per group) will be required to detect an&#xD;
      improvement of at least 3.1 months in progression free survival from 5.5 to 8.6 months using&#xD;
      a 2-tailed comparison, 2.5% level of significance, 3-year accrual and 1-year follow-up. The&#xD;
      12-month survival rate for patients on capecitabine alone is 50%. A sample size of 111 per&#xD;
      arm will have 80% power to detect an increase of 17% in the 1-year rate from 50% to 67% based&#xD;
      on a significance level of 2.5%, 3-year accrual and 1-year follow-up. For both endpoints (PFS&#xD;
      and survival) the difference between capecitabine alone and the regimen containing MMC is&#xD;
      expected to be greater (in the order of 4.5 months) which will yield &gt; 80% power to detect&#xD;
      the difference in PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst not a primary comparison, the study will nevertheless still have 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      5.5 month difference between the two experimental arms as a secondary comparison based on a&#xD;
      level of significance of 1.7%. Secondary endpoints include treatment related toxicity.&#xD;
      Toxicity analyses will include treatment-received population, which includes all patients who&#xD;
      received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Toxicity will be described by tabulating the&#xD;
      proportions of patients with a worst toxicity grade of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 for each of the&#xD;
      relevant NCI CTC AE scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Confidence intervals for the difference in the incidence of bevacizumab and MMC&#xD;
      associated grade 3/4 toxicities on the three arms will be calculated. If the incidence of&#xD;
      these toxicities in the triple combination regimen (Capecitabine/MMC/ bevacizumab) exceeds&#xD;
      the rate of toxicity experienced in the capecitabine/bevacizumab combination by more than 20%&#xD;
      then consideration will be given to dose adjustment or stopping recruitment into the triple&#xD;
      combination arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: The PFS for capecitabine chemotherapy alone is expected to be about 5.5 months and&#xD;
      this is expected to increase to 9 months with the addition of bevacizumab, which is&#xD;
      considered to be clinically meaningful. Using an overall 95% confidence level and 80% power&#xD;
      and a 2.5% significance level for each comparison 111 patients per arm are required to detect&#xD;
      differences based on a 36-month accrual and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Significance - This randomised phase II/III study aims to compare capecitabine&#xD;
      monotherapy with capecitabine plus bevacizumab and capecitabine plus bevacizumab plus MMC in&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of either MMC or bevacizumab to 5FU based chemotherapy appears to result in improved&#xD;
      activity without substantial increases in toxicity. Thus regimens incorporating these agents&#xD;
      could have significant activity and be well tolerated. These regimens could be suitable as a&#xD;
      low toxicity palliative regimen for a broad range of the population of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer including older patients with co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is anticipated that rates of acute toxicity with each regimen will be lower than those&#xD;
      observed with oxaliplatin or CPT-11-based regimens, the target population may be more broad&#xD;
      ranging than most other studies. Thus, it may include older patients, patients with limited&#xD;
      performance status (PS2), patients with co-morbidities or patients in whom there are concerns&#xD;
      relating to toxicity with oxaliplatin or CPT-11-based combination chemotherapy. However, it&#xD;
      is not restricted to this population and younger, fitter patients may also be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study as a lower rate of side effects is likely to be associated with improved quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
