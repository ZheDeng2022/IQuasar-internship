      Background: Fracture of several ribs in more than one place as the result of trauma, leads to&#xD;
      paradoxical movement of the chest wall and ventilatory failure. The mainstay of management in&#xD;
      these patients has traditionally been analgesia and positive pressure ventilation to splint&#xD;
      the chest wall and allow healing of the ribs to begin. However, this management option leads&#xD;
      to prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay with increasing complication rates as patients&#xD;
      remain on a ventilator for prolonged periods. Patients often remain on a ventilator for two&#xD;
      to three weeks while waiting for enough rib healing to provide sufficient chest wall&#xD;
      stability to allow the patient to take over all their breathing themselves. Until that time,&#xD;
      patients are at risk of pneumonia and sepsis and other complications. Long term disabilities&#xD;
      which have been reported in these patients include ongoing pain syndromes, inability to&#xD;
      return to work, particularly manual type labour and cosmetic chest wall deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative treatment strategy is to operatively fix the ribs. By fixing the ribs&#xD;
      operatively, the patient no longer requires internal pneumatic stabilization (provided by&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation) and can be weaned from the ventilator within days rather than weeks.&#xD;
      This can potentially lead to earlier discharge from the intensive care unit, and an avoidance&#xD;
      of the multiple complications which arise in the ventilated patient. Rib fixation may also&#xD;
      lead to less pain and deformity, improved mobility in the post injury phase and earlier&#xD;
      return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: that early operative fixation of ribs in patients presenting with flail chest&#xD;
      secondary to trauma will result in less mechanical ventilatory requirements, earlier&#xD;
      discharge from the intensive care unit and lower rate of complications associated with&#xD;
      prolonged mechanical ventilation. This will lead to cost savings in the treatment of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
