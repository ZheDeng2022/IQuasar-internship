  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what percentage of patients receiving high-dose&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide may experience a halt in the worsening of their disease or experience&#xD;
      improvement of their disease and for how long the benefit may last.&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major disabling neurologic disease of young adults,and&#xD;
      represents the most common immune-mediated inflammatory and demyelinating disorder of the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS). Active inflammatory lesions contain components that include T&#xD;
      cells, macrophages, and activated microglia. Within these lesions myelin is removed, axons&#xD;
      are damaged and oligodendrocytes may be lost. In lesions undergoing inflammatory&#xD;
      demyelination axonal injury also occurs. The disability MS produces is underscored by the&#xD;
      nearly fifty percent of patients who will require ambulatory aids within 15 years after&#xD;
      disease onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no cure for MS. Therapy is targeted at changing the short-term natural&#xD;
      history of MS: to decrease attack rates and to postpone long-term disability. At present,&#xD;
      interferon beta and glatiramer acetate form the foundation of therapy for relapsing MS.&#xD;
      Mitoxantrone is approved for more severe cases of relapsing MS, such as those with rapidly&#xD;
      accumulating neurologic impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose cyclophosphamide (HDC) is a non-bone marrow transplant treatment option for those&#xD;
      afflicted by severe, refractory immune-mediated illnesses by pathologic autoreactive&#xD;
      lymphocytes. The goal of this therapy is to induce immunoablation without myeloablation: that&#xD;
      is, to eradicate offending B and T cells responsible for the illness while sparing the&#xD;
      pluripotent blood stem cell of any ill effect. Since 1966, multiple publications on numerous&#xD;
      immune-mediated illnesses have shown HDC without stem-cell rescue to decrease disease&#xD;
      activity and improve quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol we study HDC for severe, refractory MS. The primary goal is to assess the&#xD;
      safety of HDC in this population, where no data exists regarding the tolerability of&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy without stem-cell rescue. The treatment goal is not to induce disease&#xD;
      regression (resolution of fixed neurologic deficits), but rather to stop disease progression&#xD;
      without further remittive therapy.&#xD;
