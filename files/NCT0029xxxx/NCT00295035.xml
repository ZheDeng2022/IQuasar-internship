    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a major health concern in the Western world with an estimated lifetime&#xD;
      risk of 5-6%. The goal of achieving effective cancer prevention is driven by the prediction&#xD;
      that CRC will become the leading cause of death (surpassing heart disease) in this decade,&#xD;
      with an estimated 1,000,000 new cases and over 500,000 deaths per year, worldwide. Despite&#xD;
      continuing advances in diagnosis and therapy, long-term survival rates have not improved&#xD;
      significantly over the last four decades. Nearly 50% of all CRC patients will die of the&#xD;
      disease. Preventive strategies offer the best hope, at least until our understanding of the&#xD;
      biology of cancer matures to the point where it can be implemented into therapy. The search&#xD;
      for new chemopreventive compounds with minimal toxicity raises particular interest in&#xD;
      phytochemicals.Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a natural compound derived from the rhizome of&#xD;
      Curcuma Longa, an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. It has been shown to possess&#xD;
      potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, for which it has a long history of&#xD;
      dietary use as a food additive. Curcumin has also a potent anti-proliferative effects against&#xD;
      a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro, which stem from its ability to modulate many&#xD;
      intracellular signal transduction pathways. Human phase I-II studies found curcumin to be&#xD;
      safe, and indicated no dose-limiting toxicity when taken by mouth at doses up to 10 g/day.&#xD;
      This data, together with the dismal therapeutic options available for colon cancer patients,&#xD;
      suggest that curcumin warrants investigation in this setting. The present study evaluates&#xD;
      gemcitabine in combination with curcumin and celecoxib for patients with colon cancer.&#xD;

      The primary end point of the study is time to tumor progression. The study is designed to&#xD;
      detect increase in median time to tumor progression from 2.7 months to 4.0 months, with 80%&#xD;
      power at a significance level of 5%. This requires approximately 100 patients. The median&#xD;
      time to tumor progression of 2.7 months was found in the Investigational New Drug (IND)&#xD;
      treatment program for gemcitabine, which enrolled 3023 patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic colon cance&#xD;
