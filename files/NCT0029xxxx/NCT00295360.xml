  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The expression of transporters involved in bile acid homeostasis is differentially regulated&#xD;
      during obstructive cholestasis. Bile acids are also substrates of the drug efflux transporter&#xD;
      breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) that is highly expressed in the human intestine.&#xD;
      Therefore we intend to analyze whether intestinal BCRP expression could be altered during&#xD;
      cholestasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCRP is capable of transport bile acids and may indicate that this transporter is involved in&#xD;
      bile acid homeostasis. As an efflux pump, it could protect the enterocytes from potential&#xD;
      toxic bile acid concentrations. During cholestasis, where the enterohepatic circulation is&#xD;
      disrupted, there occurs an adaptive regulation of transporters for bile acids, bilirubin and&#xD;
      cholesterol. These changes take place in liver, kidney, as well as in the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using real-time RT-PCR analysis we determine BCRP mRNA expression levels in duodenal tissue&#xD;
      of healthy subjects and cholestatic patients. BCRP protein levels will be determined by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects and cholestatic patients are enrolled in the study after giving informed&#xD;
      consent. Control subjects with an indication for a gastrointestinal tract endoscopy within a&#xD;
      cancer-screening program and patients with obstructive cholestasis with an interventional&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are included in this study. During&#xD;
      endoscopy four biopsy specimens are obtained from the distal part of the duodenum. Biopsies&#xD;
      are immediately stored at -70°C until further processing.&#xD;
