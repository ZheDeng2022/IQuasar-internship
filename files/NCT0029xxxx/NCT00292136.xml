      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment of addiction often hinges on preventing relapse into drug-using behaviors,&#xD;
           which occurs at high rates even after prolonged abstinence. Research has shown that&#xD;
           constant reporting through personal data-collection devices, such as electronic diaries,&#xD;
           can help prevent relapse and reinforce abstinence. This constant reporting is known as&#xD;
           Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researchers here at NIDA have already completed two major arms of the study,&#xD;
           focusing on patterns of craving and drug use during methadone maintenance, and on&#xD;
           whether electronic diaries could help remind outpatients to complete treatment tasks. An&#xD;
           ongoing arm of the study is examining connections among drug craving/use, stress, and&#xD;
           geographical location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate the role of stress associated with geographical location in drug craving and&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age or older who are dependent on opioids (cocaine&#xD;
      and/or heroin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 28 weeks. After the initial screening, participants will receive&#xD;
           daily methadone and weekly drug counseling sessions that will continue throughout the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 3 weeks of methadone treatment, participants will have 15 weeks of EMA in which&#xD;
           they will record both event-triggered cravings and daily responses (3 per day). EMA will&#xD;
           consist of event-triggered recordings (initiated by participants whenever they use&#xD;
           heroin or cocaine, or whenever they feel an urge to do so) and random-signal-triggered&#xD;
           recordings (3 per day). During EMA, participants will begin a voucher-based program to&#xD;
           encourage abstinence from heroin and cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also carry global positioning system (GPS) units to record their&#xD;
           locations during these 15 weeks, and will complete questionnaires about stress levels at&#xD;
           specific intervals during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, participants will have the choice of transferring to a&#xD;
           community clinic or undergoing an 8-week taper from methadone.&#xD;

      Background. We have already completed the original, major arm of this protocol (a&#xD;
      natural-history study of craving and lapse). Still open for enrollment is the second minor&#xD;
      arm (a within-subject trial of PDA-based treatment-task reminders). In the third arm there&#xD;
      will be enhanced assessment of mood, stress, and geographical location to further study&#xD;
      craving and lapse. All arms of the study have developed from either or both of two aspects of&#xD;
      the original arm: (1) Our growing appreciation of the technical possibilities of electronic&#xD;
      data collection in participants daily environments, and (2) our growing interest in having&#xD;
      participants provide descriptive data about the day-to-day experience of addiction and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major completed arm of the protocol has provided a wealth of descriptive data on drug&#xD;
      craving and lapse via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), in which participants carry&#xD;
      handheld data-collection devices (electronic diaries, EDs) on which they report, in real&#xD;
      time, their activities and moods. Beyond data monitoring, EDs can be used to complement&#xD;
      behavioral interventions. The data-collection devices can be additionally programmed to&#xD;
      prompt completion of therapist-assigned homework exercises; by extending support outside the&#xD;
      therapy session, clinical outcome may be improved. Furthermore, there is an evidenced&#xD;
      association between completion of homework exercises and therapeutic outcome. Adapting&#xD;
      existing homework assignments to make them more engaging may increase homework completion&#xD;
      and, in turn, general compliance with therapy (Arm 2). The rationale for the third arm of the&#xD;
      study is to broaden the perspective of the examination of the natural history of drug&#xD;
      cravings and lapses by refining our assessments of geographical location and the stressors&#xD;
      associated with it. In doing so, we intend to investigate determinants of addiction that are&#xD;
      not reducible to individual-level traits but are instead reflective of broader socioeconomic&#xD;
      problems manifested in differences among neighborhoods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals. Arm 1) To investigate the relationships between putative triggers and drug&#xD;
      craving and lapse; Arm 2) To investigate interactive effects of electronic-diary reminders,&#xD;
      and simplified therapy-assigned homework tasks, on homework completion and therapeutic&#xD;
      outcome; Arm 3) Using refinements in our assessment methods, to investigate the role of&#xD;
      stress associated with geographical location in drug craving and use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. Arm 2: 35 cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatients. Arm 3: 50&#xD;
      cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatients (separate from those in Arm 2). Target&#xD;
      enrollment for both arms will include 40% women and 60% minorities (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods. After 3 weeks of stabilization on daily methadone,&#xD;
      outpatients will undergo 25 weeks of EMA. EMA will consist of event-triggered recordings&#xD;
      (initiated by participants whenever they use heroin or cocaine, or whenever they feel an urge&#xD;
      to do so) and random-signal-triggered recordings (3 per day). Target quit dates for heroin&#xD;
      and cocaine will occur, respectively, on the first and third weeks of EMA. Two days after the&#xD;
      cocaine quit date, all participants will begin 12 weeks of intensive voucher-based&#xD;
      contingency management to reinforce abstinence from heroin and cocaine. Arm 2: During the&#xD;
      same 12 weeks, a within-subjects manipulation will occur: participants will receive&#xD;
      simplified versions of the current counselor-assigned homework tasks, and participants will&#xD;
      receive a daily reminder via the PDA to complete their homework tasks (whether they are&#xD;
      standard or simplified versions). The simplified homework tasks and reminders will be given&#xD;
      during two separate, counterbalanced, three-week blocks. Arm 3: Starting at week 4 and&#xD;
      continuing through week 18 participants will answer enhanced EMA questions regarding stress,&#xD;
      mood, location, drug craving and use. Additionally, participants in Arm 3 will carry GPS&#xD;
      units to record their locations during these 15 weeks. GPS location will be examined with&#xD;
      their drug use, craving and self-reported mood. They will also complete retrospective stress&#xD;
      questionnaires at week 3 and then at 4-week intervals throughout the completion of the study:&#xD;
      week 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27. After the 12-week homework (Arm 2) or enhanced EMA phase (Arm&#xD;
      3) ends, participants will have the choice of transferring to a community clinic or&#xD;
      undergoing an eight-week taper from methadone. For participants in Arm 2 who choose to detox&#xD;
      at Archway, EMA may continue. However, for participants in Arm 3, no EMA or GPS data will be&#xD;
      collected during the pre-detox or detox phase (weeks 19-28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society. Direct benefits to participants include&#xD;
      psychological and pharmacologic assistance for decreasing illicit drug use. The methadone&#xD;
      administered during the study will decrease the participants intravenous opiate use. The&#xD;
      contingency management and psychotherapy procedures may further reduce drug use and HIV risk&#xD;
      behaviors. The decrease in HIV risk behaviors should result in lower incidence of HIV&#xD;
      disease. Benefits to society include an increase in scientific understanding of the&#xD;
      precipitants and process of craving, lapse, and relapse, and an improvement in our ability to&#xD;
      assess the clinical effectiveness of relapse-prevention medications in future clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants. Participants on methadone may experience side effects of sedation,&#xD;
      constipation, or mild euphoria. The risks of overmedication will be reduced by gradually&#xD;
      increasing the dose of methadone over the first week. The methadone dose used in Arm 2 of&#xD;
      this protocol, 100 mg, is within the limits allowed by the FDA guidelines and within the dose&#xD;
      range used in methadone clinics in Baltimore. For Arm 3 of the protocol, there is no ceiling&#xD;
      methadone dose. Methadone doses will be adjusted by the MRP as clinically indicated based on&#xD;
      participant feedback, withdrawal signs/symptoms, reported cravings, and urine toxicology&#xD;
      results. If a patient shows signs of intoxication, the MRP will reduce the methadone dose&#xD;
      until evidence of intoxication has subsided. Methadone will be discontinued if a participant&#xD;
      experiences severe side effects. Participants who are withdrawn from methadone will&#xD;
      experience opiate withdrawal symptoms, but these symptoms will be minimized by the long detox&#xD;
      period of 8 to 12 weeks. Other risks are the inconvenience of carrying and using the EDs, and&#xD;
      possible embarrassment from providing urine samples under observation, and concern about the&#xD;
      collection of GPS data.&#xD;
