      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone,&#xD;
      quetiapine and ziprasidone in treating a broad spectrum of symptoms in schizophrenia as well&#xD;
      as their lower likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms have led to an increased use of these&#xD;
      substances. However there is an ongoing debate whether treatment with atypical antipsychotics&#xD;
      is associated with a higher risk for metabolic abnormalities. The FDA stated in 2003 that all&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics increase the risk for glucose abnormalities. For olanzapine many, but&#xD;
      not all studies report an increased risk for the development of metabolic abnormalities, such&#xD;
      as glucose intolerance, insulin-resistance and consequentially NIDDM&#xD;
      (Non-Insulin-Dependent-Diabetes Mellitus). Ziprasidone on the other hand seems to be&#xD;
      associated with a more favorable metabolic safety profile.Glucose intolerance and insulin&#xD;
      resistance being risk factors for the development of NIDDM and cardiovascular disease, the&#xD;
      exact determination of putative effects of atypical antipsychotics on insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      resistance is of great need. An innovative technique, microdialysis, allows for the&#xD;
      measurement of various analytes in the interstitial space, i.e. to assess insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      directly at the responsible compartment, which is the human skeletal muscle. With the use of&#xD;
      microdialysis it is possible to determine the arterial to interstitial gradient, a suitable&#xD;
      marker for plasma glucose extraction of peripheral tissue, and thus detect insulin resistance&#xD;
      directly at the site of insulin action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effects of treatment with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and&#xD;
      ziprasidone in steady-state conditions on the arterial to interstitial skeletal muscle&#xD;
      gradient for glucose in human skeletal muscle during euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp&#xD;
      conditions in male healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open, randomized, mono-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will undergo euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp and microdialysis before&#xD;
      and after administration of 10mg olanzapine or 80mg ziprasidone during 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 healthy volunteers will participate in each arm of the study, summing up to a total of 30&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial to interstitial skeletal muscle glucose gradient before and during euglycaemic&#xD;
      hyperinsulinaemic clamp conditions, before and after administration of 10mg olanzapine or&#xD;
      80mg ziprasidone under steady-state conditions.&#xD;
