  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study was set up to evaluate the tolerability and safety of 25% human albumin&#xD;
      (HA) therapy in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is estimated that 37,500&#xD;
      people in the USA have SAH every year. SAH is associated with a 51% mortality rate and one&#xD;
      third of survivors are left functionally dependent. Cerebral vasospasm (CV) has been&#xD;
      identified as the most important reason for neurological deterioration. CV may be due to&#xD;
      multiple molecular mechanisms. The use of a neuroprotective agent with various actions, likes&#xD;
      HA, would be important for prevention of CV and improved clinical outcome in patients with&#xD;
      SAH. The proposed open-label, dose-escalation study will have important public health&#xD;
      implications by providing necessary information for a definitive phase III clinical trial&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of treatment with HA in patients with SAH. The study was to enroll a&#xD;
      maximum of 80 patients with SAH who meet the eligibility criteria. Four dosages of HA (0.625,&#xD;
      1.25, 1.875, and 2.5 g/kg) administered daily for seven days will be evaluated. The lowest&#xD;
      dosage was to be evaluated in the first group of 20 subjects. A specific safety threshold was&#xD;
      defined based on data from previous studies. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board approved or&#xD;
      disapproved advancing to the next higher HA dosage based on the evaluation of the rate of&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF). The study assessed three outcomes: safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the HA dosages and the functional outcome. The primary tolerability outcome was defined as&#xD;
      the subject's ability to receive the full allocated dose of HA without incurring frank CHF&#xD;
      that requires termination of treatment. Secondary safety outcomes were serious adverse events&#xD;
      (including neurological and medical complications, and anaphylactic reactions). Neurological&#xD;
      complications comprise incidence of CV, rebleeding, hydrocephalus, and seizures after&#xD;
      treatment. The three-month functional outcome determined, by Glasgow Outcome Scale, Barthel&#xD;
      Index, modified Rankin Scale, NIH Stroke Scale and Stroke Impact Scale was measured to obtain&#xD;
      a preliminary estimate of the treatment effect of HA. The timeline of the study is three&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
