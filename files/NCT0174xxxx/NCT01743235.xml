    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Lybridos in the domestic setting in healthy female subjects with hypoactive&#xD;
      sexual desire disorder and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the efficacy of Lybridos will be evaluated in the domestic setting in&#xD;
      healthy female subjects with HSDD and maladaptive activity of sexual inhibitory mechanism(s).&#xD;
      Sexual satisfaction and other aspects of sexual functioning will be measured within 24 hours&#xD;
      after each sexual activity. The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lybridos, as compared to placebo, will significantly increase the number of satisfying sexual&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of satisfying sexual events will not differ significantly between subjects treated&#xD;
      with placebo and subjects treated with 0.5 mg testosterone alone and/or 10 mg buspirone&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lybridos, as compared to placebo, will significantly increase sexual desire/arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual desire/arousal will not differ significantly between subjects treated with placebo and&#xD;
      subjects treated with 0.5 mg testosterone alone and/or 10 mg buspirone alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lybridos, as compared to testosterone alone and buspirone alone, will significantly increase&#xD;
      the number of satisfying sexual events and sexual desire/arousal.&#xD;
