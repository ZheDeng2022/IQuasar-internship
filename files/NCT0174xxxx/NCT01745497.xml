  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by difficulties in language, social&#xD;
      communication, and repetitive and restricted behaviors. ASD affects as many as 1 in 90-150&#xD;
      children. Sleep issues/insomnia is very common in children with ASD (50-80%). Insomnia has a&#xD;
      negative impact on both the developmental and behavioral function of the child and the&#xD;
      quality of life for the family. Causes of insomnia in children with ASD are multifactorial&#xD;
      and can be difficult to treat effectively. Low iron stores, as manifest by low serum ferritin&#xD;
      levels, is also common in children with ASD. Both insomnia and low iron stores are associated&#xD;
      with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement of Sleep (PLMS). Children with&#xD;
      ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography (Sleep Study).&#xD;
      This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children with ASD.&#xD;

      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by difficulties in language, social&#xD;
      communication, and repetitive and restricted behaviors. ASD affects as many as 1 in 90-150&#xD;
      children. Sleep issues/insomnia is very common in children with ASD (50-80%). Insomnia has a&#xD;
      negative impact on both the developmental and behavioral function of the child and the&#xD;
      quality of life for the family. Causes of insomnia in children with ASD are multifactorial&#xD;
      and can be difficult to treat effectively. Low iron stores, as manifest by low serum ferritin&#xD;
      levels, is also common in children with ASD. Both insomnia and low iron stores are associated&#xD;
      with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement of Sleep (PLMS). Children with&#xD;
      ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography (Sleep Study).&#xD;
      This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children with ASD.&#xD;
      Because polysomnography is not well tolerated in children with ASD and cannot measure sleep&#xD;
      over time in a natural environment, improvements in sleep with treatment with iron will be&#xD;
      measured by standard actigraphy (a watch that measures movements during sleep) and sleep&#xD;
      diaries. The investigators also propose to evaluate periodic limb movement index (PLMI) as a&#xD;
      predictor of response to iron treatment for insomnia in children with ASD, as measured by the&#xD;
      PAM-RL, an actigraph designed to measure PLMS. The investigators will collect secondary data&#xD;
      regarding attention and behavior over the course of the study to monitor improvement in&#xD;
      daytime functioning in both groups. Many clinicians will empirically treat children with ASD,&#xD;
      insomnia and low ferritin levels (&lt; 50ng/ml) with iron. This is based on data from a previous&#xD;
      open label trial demonstrating subjective improvement in restless sleep in children with ASD&#xD;
      with low/low normal ferritin levels who were treated with iron. In order to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of such treatment, The investigators propose a randomized placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      of oral elemental iron for treatment of insomnia in children with ASD and ferritin levels&#xD;
      that are low but above the laboratory cut off for deficiency. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment of insomnia with oral ferrous sulfate (iron) at a dose of 3mg/kg&#xD;
      divided twice per day for 3 months compared to placebo.&#xD;
