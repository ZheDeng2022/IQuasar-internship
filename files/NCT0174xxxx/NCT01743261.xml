      The aim of this study was to compare the cost/utility ratio of a management model of&#xD;
      integrated, graded, intensive rehabilitation (GIR) versus usual care (UC) for patients with&#xD;
      acquired Severe Brain Injury (SBI).&#xD;

      Materials and methods Study design This study was an organizational assessment of an&#xD;
      integrated system of care (GIR) for patients with SBI and was designed as a prospective,&#xD;
      randomised trial. An individual record was created for each patient with SBI; this record&#xD;
      contained the patient's personal data, information prior to admission to intensive care or&#xD;
      neurosurgery, clinical characteristics, the presence of devices, complications, time of&#xD;
      hospitalisation in an Intensive Care Unit, and cognitive conditions. Once it had been&#xD;
      determined that the study entry criteria were met, the patients were entered in the register&#xD;
      and prospectively in parallel-group randomised to two different management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concealment of allocation was guaranteed by the availability of beds in the ward.&#xD;
      Patients and health care providers and assessors were blinded to the study designed to&#xD;
      compare the strategies management. Data analysts were blinded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size requirements for this study are intended to provide adequate&#xD;
      power for the analysis of the primary objective ( decrease event-related mortality). The&#xD;
      simulation were run in statsoft six sigma software according to the following hypotheses: the&#xD;
      mortality of severe brain injury used as a Null hypothesis was 58%. This percent value is&#xD;
      expected to decrease at 40% in the study arm. The target type-I error(α) was 0.05. A sample&#xD;
      size of 119 patients per group would allow a power of 80% to detect an individual risk score&#xD;
      ratio of 0.70 with a type -I error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the availability of beds in the ward, two groups were formed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) the UC patients who, while meeting the criteria for access into the Graded Intensity of&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Unit for patients with SBI (SBI-GIRU), did not enter the department because no&#xD;
      beds were free and were, therefore, discharged from the Intensive Care Unit into the&#xD;
      management models available, such as acute care, Intensive Brain Injury rehabilitation ( cod&#xD;
      75) brain injury rehabilitation (code 56) ( hospital admission, lasting on average 60 days,&#xD;
      in which intensive rehabilitation care is delivered prior to transfer to another structure),&#xD;
      long-term care, home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) The GIR patients who met the criteria for access into the SBI-GIRU and for whom a bed&#xD;
      was available in the Unit, where an individualised programme of intensive rehabilitation care&#xD;
      was structured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for assessing the effectiveness of the two different forms of management&#xD;
      was mortality; secondary outcomes included the improvement of quality of life evaluated using&#xD;
      a classification system based on the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (8) and the number of days&#xD;
      of hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients with acquired SBI referred to our unit between January 2007 and January&#xD;
      2010 were considered for this study. The diagnosis of acquired SBI was made on the basis of&#xD;
      the clinical history, physical examination, clinical symptoms, Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt;8&#xD;
      and neuro-radiological investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having been entered into the register, patients in the UC group began the monitoring&#xD;
      phase, while the patients in the GIR group were submitted to clinical evaluation, prognostic&#xD;
      stratification, and clinical and instrumental investigations, after which an individualised&#xD;
      rehabilitation plan was made, characterized by structured multidisciplinary interventions&#xD;
      that were periodically reviewed. The alternative management strategies are described in&#xD;
      greater detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care In this case patients were managed according to the organization of the management&#xD;
      model which took on the care of the patient. The organization of these models is&#xD;
      characterized by one or two professional figures (physiatrists, neurologist), with&#xD;
      hierarchical relationships, in spaces limited to a specific pathology; access is determined&#xD;
      by clinical stability; the instruments of governance are guidelines and consensus and the&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme is focused on functional and cognitive areas; the medical care&#xD;
      process is governed by hierarchy. The technology in this model is limited to a specific&#xD;
      specialty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graded intensive rehabilitation This is a result-oriented management model; it is&#xD;
      multidisciplinary and has the purpose of determining the appropriateness of hospitalization&#xD;
      and the patients' needs through the use of a ranking; the management is &quot;disease-based&quot;, and&#xD;
      the instruments of governance are the diagnostic-therapeutic rehabilitation pathways (DTRP),&#xD;
      the quality system and product standards; the medical care process has separate strands with&#xD;
      result-oriented autonomy; the technology present in this model is identified on the basis of&#xD;
      health needs and support of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classifying patients In relation to their clinical conditions and complexity of care needs,&#xD;
      three profiles of patients with SBI have been identified: the critically patient, the complex&#xD;
      patient and the frail patient. The critically ill patient is a patient with abnormal vital&#xD;
      parameters who requires constant monitoring and may need immediate therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
      The complex patient is an individual with significant comorbidities who requires complicated,&#xD;
      expensive and often invasive diagnostic investigations and/or numerous therapies sometimes&#xD;
      conflicting with each other with a strong risk of interactions. The complexity of care&#xD;
      increases in &quot;frail patients&quot;. Frail patients have: (i) a marked susceptibility to develop&#xD;
      acute illnesses that are manifested by atypical clinical pictures;(ii) rapid fluctuations of&#xD;
      health, even in the same day, with a strong tendency to develop complications (failure&#xD;
      cascade); (iii) a high risk of adverse events and iatrogenic events; (iv) slow and, almost&#xD;
      always, only partial recovery; (v) continued requirements for medical interventions, need for&#xD;
      ongoing assistance; and (vi) a high risk of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of intensity of care On the basis of the above-described evaluation, the patient is&#xD;
      assigned to the most appropriate of the following settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1 (intensive): the patient is critical and unstable, dependent or potentially dependent&#xD;
      on technological aids and at high risk of complications. Area of competence - red: monitored&#xD;
      beds, single rooms, infusion pumps, telemetry, daily medical round, and intensive nursing&#xD;
      activities 24 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 2 (medium): the patient is clinically unstable and requires constant monitoring of&#xD;
      vital parameters. Highly complex medical activities and intensive nursing care are prevalent.&#xD;
      Area of competence - yellow: rooms with two beds, infusion pumps, telemetry, daily medical&#xD;
      round, intensive, structured nursing activities, physiotherapy and speech therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 3 (low): the patient is clinically stable and does not require constant monitoring of&#xD;
      vital signs or the continuous presence of a doctor. Activities are prevalently physiotherapy&#xD;
      and nursing care. Area of competence - green.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 4 (minimum): the patient is clinically stable and requires only social and nursing care&#xD;
      for discharge. Area of competence - white.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transition between different levels is determined by clinical criteria that define the&#xD;
      area of competence required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff The staff of the SBI-GIRU consists of a neurologist, an internist, a physiatrist, a&#xD;
      cardiologist, a speech physician, twelve nurses with specific skills, a chief nurse, a&#xD;
      nutritionist, two speech therapists, three physiotherapists, a psychologist and a social&#xD;
      worker. The aim of the multidisciplinary approach is to facilitate recovery from disability&#xD;
      caused by SBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each member of the team has the duty to control, analyse and redesign the organization that&#xD;
      supports the activities and processes set out in the individual rehabilitation plan. Three&#xD;
      types of intervention - medical, nursing and physiotherapeutic - can be identified in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation plan and are strongly integrated in order to achieve the rehabilitation&#xD;
      objectives. The healthcare and rehabilitation processes are founded on guidelines and the&#xD;
      criteria of evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehabilitation process The treatment plan is discussed in collaboration with the whole&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team. An individual rehabilitation plan is drawn up which outlines: (i) the&#xD;
      appropriateness of access; (ii) the type of access (SBI of traumatic, anoxic one, ischaemic&#xD;
      or haemorrhagic nature); (iii) the objectives of the rehabilitation process (prognostic&#xD;
      stratification, therapy optimization, prevention of secondary injury, management of devices,&#xD;
      management of cognitive impairment, prevention of damage by immobility, recovery of motor&#xD;
      function); (iv) use of the instruments to implement the plan (multi-disciplinary meeting,&#xD;
      electroencephalogram, physiotherapy briefings, diagnostic radiology, consultancy, monitoring&#xD;
      systems, infusion systems); (v) time-course of the plan; (vi) result indicators in the short&#xD;
      to medium term; (vii) results indicators in the long-term; (viii) the method of discharge;&#xD;
      and (ix) management counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up A monitoring form was used for each patient to record the following information:&#xD;
      personal data, outcome measures, employment issues, degree of socialisation, commitment of&#xD;
      caregivers and the results of the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Three types of outcomes were considered: management outcomes, functional results and&#xD;
      a hard end-point (survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management outcomes. The management outcomes considered were: access time, number of&#xD;
      structures involved in the management of the patient, the healthcare path, the number of days&#xD;
      spent in hospital, the type of management to which the patient was subsequently addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional results. These included the number of devices at discharge, the Glasgow Outcome&#xD;
      Scale (GOS) score, the Barthel Index score and any change in quality of life, assessed using&#xD;
      the classification system based on the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 Survival. The patient's&#xD;
      death related to the event index was considered as a hard event. In the survival analysis the&#xD;
      two management models were considered as predictors of mortality. These predictors were&#xD;
      adjusted for confounding variables (age, sex, aetiology, GOS score, Level of Cognitive&#xD;
      Functioning score and indices of organ function). The association between independent&#xD;
      predictors and outcome was assessed by comparing the follow-up data with a Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards regression model. The end-point of the study was event-related mortality. The&#xD;
      distribution of the time function of the events was analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost analysis The cost/utility analysis was performed from the payer's prospective (the&#xD;
      health authority). Hospital admissions for the implementation of the process and for health&#xD;
      care - in particular, admissions to intensive care, acute care, rehabilitation and the social&#xD;
      welfare sector - were considered. Management costs incurred at home were excluded. The prices&#xD;
      used for calculations were those of the average daily cost of hospitalisation per type of&#xD;
      management as listed in the Interregional Tariff Agreement [Tariffa Unica Convenzionale, TUC]&#xD;
      2009 for hospital healthcare services. The QALY was determined by calculating the years of&#xD;
      life gained in management models adjusted for the quality of life. The difference in QALYs&#xD;
      between the two models was obtained by considering the average increase of life derived from&#xD;
      the survival curves (difference between the areas of the survival curves) adjusted for the&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating the cost/utility&#xD;
      ratio using the extremes; in particular, changes in QALY and costs were evaluated by&#xD;
      considering the extremes (confidence limits of the variations of the mean).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis To compare the clinical and functional parameters between the two groups&#xD;
      we used the one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables and chi-square tests for&#xD;
      categorical variables. For the analysis of prognostic indicators, the two management&#xD;
      strategies were considered as independent predictors of outcome. The analysis was adjusted&#xD;
      for confounding factors. event-related mortality was considered as an end-point of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between independent predictors and outcome was assessed by comparing the&#xD;
      follow-up data with a Cox proportional hazards regression model. The assumption of the&#xD;
      proportionality of risk during the observation time, has been evaluated using the analysis of&#xD;
      residues of Schoenfeld. Deaths from causes unrelated to the SBI were treated as censored&#xD;
      observations. The distribution of the time function of the events was analysed using the&#xD;
      method of Kaplan-Meier. The prognostic information is presented as relative risk with 95%&#xD;
      confidence limits. Descriptive statistics are expressed as the mean value ± standard&#xD;
      deviation. Probability values &lt;0.05 are considered statistically significant.&#xD;
