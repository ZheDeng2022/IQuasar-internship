      The objective of this work was to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one&#xD;
      Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system,&#xD;
      on the (1) balance, (2) gait, (3) functionality and (4) cognition ability in older adults. It&#xD;
      is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research&#xD;
      of the courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo&#xD;
      University. Thirty-two older adults are randomly in control and experimental group, 16 each&#xD;
      one. The study includes only participants scoring at least 24 in the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination to rule out effects of dementia; without the presence of depression, according to&#xD;
      the Geriatric Depression Scale of Yesaváge - version 15 (GDS-15 ≤ 5) and scores on the Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale (EBB ≥ 41).&#xD;

      The objective of this work is to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one&#xD;
      Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system,&#xD;
      on balance, gait, functionality and cognition ability in older adults. It is a prospective,&#xD;
      single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the courses of&#xD;
      Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo University. Thirty-two&#xD;
      older adults are randomly in control and experimental group, 16 each one. Both groups&#xD;
      performed 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session is composed of a&#xD;
      30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and axial mobility&#xD;
      exercises. After this, both groups performed more 30 minutes of balance training: the control&#xD;
      group performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or auditory feedbacks or&#xD;
      cognitive stimulations; the experimental group performed the balance training with 10 Wii Fit&#xD;
      games which stimulated motor and cognitive functions. The main outcome measures are: (1)&#xD;
      Mini-BESTest of Dynamic Balance Evaluation; (2) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI); (3) Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and (4) Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I).&#xD;

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed in order to detect mild degrees of cognitive impairment. The instrument assesses different cognitive domains such as attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuo-constructive skills, calculations, and orientation.</description>
