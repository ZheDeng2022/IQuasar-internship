      This is a phase I / II for the evaluation of the safety and feasibility of intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of mesenchymal cells from autologous bone marrow in patients with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous administration of autologous mesenchymal cells of bone marrow is feasible and&#xD;
      safe and can be effective in treating patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of a total of 30 patients diagnosed with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis, who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion set and express their&#xD;
      agreement to participate in the study by signing the informed consent of those whose results&#xD;
      can be clinically evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected patients who consent will be enrolled in the trial and randomized to one of the&#xD;
      following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 receiving a single intravenous administration of cellular product on Day 0 and&#xD;
           placebo infusion on day + 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 receiving a placebo infusion on day 0 and a single cell product administration&#xD;
           on day +180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be 1:1, so that 15 patients will receive the cellular product on Day 0&#xD;
      (Group 1) and 15 patients on day +180 (group 2), always maintaining at all times the&#xD;
      double-blind status of the test (patients and researchers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone marrow will be extract from all patients immediately after inclusion in the study,&#xD;
      under local anesthesia with sedation. For patients in group 1 autologous mesenchymal cells&#xD;
      will be obtained from the bone marrow and infuse immediately after the time necessary for&#xD;
      their production. For patients in group 2, bone marrow cells will be frozen for later&#xD;
      procedure of mesenchymal cells and their infusion after six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated by clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological as well as&#xD;
      detailed in section 8 corresponding to Development Test and Evaluation of Response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that the inclusion period is approximately 12-18 months, and each patient&#xD;
      tracking another twelve months. Therefore the total duration of the study will be about 24 to&#xD;
      30 months from the inclusion of the first patient to completion follow-up period of the last&#xD;
      patient included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objectives: 1. To evaluate the safety of intravenous infusion of autologous bone&#xD;
           marrow mesenchymal cells in multiple sclerosis patients diagnosed by evaluating&#xD;
           complications and adverse effects of the therapy itself and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Assessing the difference in the number of lesions on magnetic resonance image with&#xD;
           gadolinium, between the groups undergoing treatment at weeks 4, 12 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives: 1. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the indication of&#xD;
           the treatment by analysis comparative results and exploratory clinical variables of&#xD;
           patients at baseline (pretreatment) and at 6 and 12 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Compare the results of safety, feasibility and efficacy between the administration&#xD;
           initial cell therapy treatment (day 0) and that delayed (day +180).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Evaluating the immunomodulatory effect of treatment by quantifying cell subsets and&#xD;
           cytokines, functional analysis of the immune response. Cerebrospinal fluid metabolomic&#xD;
           profile of gene expression of the cells present in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, with&#xD;
           the aim of identifying new biomarkers with diagnosis of interest, prognosis or&#xD;
           monitoring, and potential therapeutic targets that can be derived from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Providing our results to the study proposed by the International Mesenchymal Stem&#xD;
           Cell Transplant Study Group under whose directives will be performed the test.&#xD;
