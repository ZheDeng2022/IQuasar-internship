  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will seek to enroll 372 adult otherwise healthy subjects presenting with&#xD;
      influenza-like illness (ILI). Subjects will enter the study based on listed&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, including a positive Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) for influenza&#xD;
      virus (IFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups: a DAS181 30 mg total dose&#xD;
      group (DAS181-F02 formulation), a DAS181 60 mg total dose group (DAS181-F04 formulation) or a&#xD;
      placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified intent to treat (mITT) analysis set will include subjects with confirmed&#xD;
      influenza as documented by qPCR or TCID50. The full analysis set will be used for activity&#xD;
      analysis and will include all randomized subjects with baseline and treatment data. Per&#xD;
      protocol, the safety analysis sets are described below in statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subpopulation of 60 participants will also have additional PK and Immunogenicity blood&#xD;
      samples collected. For this subgroup, PK and Immunogenicity samples will be collected at all&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;

    <description>Because of the possibility of unacceptable or excessive defined serious adverse events during the treatment period or the study enrollment period, a stopping rule for safety/tolerability has been introduced in the design.&#xD;
The following two stopping rule criteria will initiate an ad hoc DSMB data evaluation.&#xD;
5% with a related SAE post-dose Day 1 through Day 28 , or&#xD;
15% with related DAIDS toxicity Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities post-dose Day 1 through Day 28&#xD;
Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities in hematology or serum chemistry, excluding absolute neutrophils and absolute lymphocytes.&#xD;
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities in hematology or serum chemistry including absolute neutrophils and absolute lymphocytes&#xD;
Changes (absolute and percent) from baseline in influenza viral load from Day 1 to Day 2 as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from pharyngeal wash and nasal wash samples.</description>
