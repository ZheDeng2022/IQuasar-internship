  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present study was to examine the haemodynamic changes in primary&#xD;
      hypertension and secondary hypertension (renal diseases, endocrine diseases,&#xD;
      obesity-associated hypertension) with a non-invasive haemodynamic measurement protocol&#xD;
      utilizing radial pulse wave analysis and whole-body impedance cardiography in both supine&#xD;
      position and during head-up tilt. For comparison, haemodynamics of subjects with chronic&#xD;
      fatigue syndrome will also be recorded.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated blood pressure (BP) and related cardiovascular complications are the leading causes&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality in the modern world. In routine clinical practice, the&#xD;
      haemodynamic status is commonly assessed by measuring heart rate and blood pressure at rest,&#xD;
      which provides only limited information about functional haemodynamic status. In addition,&#xD;
      the haemodynamic changes resulting in similar elevations of BP may differ substantially&#xD;
      between patients and disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we investigated the haemodynamic changes in primary and secondary hypertension and&#xD;
      in the control subjects with non-invasive radial pulse wave analysis and whole-body impedance&#xD;
      cardiography. The method includes the determination of volume status using bioimpedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy, determination of peripheral and central BP, cardiac function, vascular&#xD;
      resistance, arterial compliance and indices of pulse wave reflection. Besides the&#xD;
      measurements performed in the supine position, passive orthostatic challenge is included in&#xD;
      the protocol to assess the upright functional haemodynamic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repeatability and reproducibility of the protocol was first examined with a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized protocol in 35 subjects (methodological study group), and after that the&#xD;
      administration of research drugs has been open-label. The effects of single doses of two&#xD;
      largely endothelium-dependent agents, inhaled salbutamol and intravenous L-arginine, and one&#xD;
      endothelium-independent agent, sublingual nitroglycerin, were investigated. However,&#xD;
      challenges with the acute dosing of all medical compounds was terminated at the end of&#xD;
      December 2016. Thereafter, the measurement protocol has included supine and upright&#xD;
      recordings on the tilt-table, followed by supine measurements during paced breathing (15&#xD;
      breaths per minute for 5 minutes, 6 breaths per minute for 5 minutes) that modulate the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population has consisted of subgroups described below. The study protocol of each&#xD;
      subgroup has been approved by the ethics committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District (Ethics&#xD;
      committee ID's above), and the administration of research drugs has also been approved by the&#xD;
      Finnish Agency for Medicines (EudraCT-numbers above).&#xD;
