      Assess whether therapy with axitinib, a potent angiogenic inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      receptors of VEGF bioavailable by oral administration, is capable of improving PFS in&#xD;
      patients with advanced G1-G2 NETs of nonpancreatic origin with progressive disease documented&#xD;
      in the 12 months prior to entering the study.&#xD;

      Phase II/III, prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of axitinib in patients diagnosed with advanced G1-G2&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors (WHO 2010) of nonpancreatic origin that have presented documented&#xD;
      disease progression in the 12 months prior to entering the study. In the first part of the&#xD;
      study (Phase II), 105 patients were enrolled. The second part of the study is the expansion&#xD;
      to Phase III, which is expected to include 148 additional patients. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive Sandostatin LAR with axitinib or Sandostatin LAR with placebo until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Randomization will be stratified by the&#xD;
      time from diagnosis to enrollment in the study (more vs less than or equal to 12 months), the&#xD;
      origin of the primary tumor (gastrointestinal tract vs non-gastrointestinal tract [lung or&#xD;
      other sites]) and ki-67 (&lt; 5% vs &gt; 5%).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects must be evaluated with regard to the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The following types of endocrine tumors will not be included: paraganglioma, adrenal&#xD;

                  months without evidence of resolution documented by endoscopy or colonoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malabsorption syndromes;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current or anticipated need for treatment with drugs that are potent inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 (grapefruit juice, verapamil, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole,&#xD;

             nelfinavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, and delavirdine) unless&#xD;
             they can be replaced by another medication with minimal potential for CYP3A4/5&#xD;
             inhibition. The use of low-dose oral steroids (&lt; 5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) is&#xD;
             allowed. Co-administration of steroids may increase plasma concentrations of axitinib.&#xD;

             they can be replaced by another medication with minimal potential for CYP3A4&#xD;
             induction. Co-administration of CYP3A4/5 inducers may decrease plasma concentrations&#xD;
             of axitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Need for anticoagulant therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists. Low doses of&#xD;
             anticoagulants to maintain the patency of a central venous access device or to prevent&#xD;
             deep vein thrombosis are permitted. Use with therapeutic doses of low molecular weight&#xD;
             heparin is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically relevant history of bleeding in the last 6 months, including severe&#xD;
             hemoptysis or hematuria, unless it has been due to a treated cause (e.g., completely&#xD;
             resected bleeding intestinal tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active epilepsy or evidence of brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serious uncontrolled illness or active infections that may interfere with the&#xD;
             patient's ability to receive the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any of the following events in the 12 months prior to administration of the study&#xD;
             drug: myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina, implantation of a coronary or&#xD;

             attack. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ongoing grade ≥ 2 cardiac arrhythmias according to NCI CTCAE: atrial fibrillation of&#xD;
             any grade or QTc interval &gt; 450 ms for men or &gt; 470 ms for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired&#xD;
             immunodeficiency syndrome-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior history of cancer except those treated with curative intent for non-melanoma&#xD;
             skin cancer in situ, breast or cervical cancer in situ, or those treated for any&#xD;
             cancer with curative intent and no evidence of disease in the last 5 years prior to&#xD;
             enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that could prevent compression, or&#xD;
             submission of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any severe, acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with participation in the study or&#xD;
             with study drug administration, or that may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             results, and that could interfere with the patient's ability to take part in this&#xD;
             study in the investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The patient's participation or intention to participate (in the 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             starting drug administration) in a study in which the patient will receive an&#xD;
             investigational medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects who are institutionalized by governmental or by judicial decision, or&#xD;
             subjects who are dependent of the sponsor, the investigator or the trial site will be&#xD;
             excluded from participation.&#xD;
