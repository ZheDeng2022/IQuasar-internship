  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of OZURDEX (dexamethasone&#xD;
      intravitreal implant) 0.7 mg administered immediately after phacoemulsification and&#xD;
      intraocular lens implantation in type 1 or 2 diabetic patients to prevent the occurrence of&#xD;
      post-surgical macular edema (ME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group: 24 patients will receive an intravitreal injection of OZURDEX at the end of&#xD;
      cataract surgery Patients will be seen at 1 week pre-operatively (baseline visit), and on the&#xD;
      same day post-surgery (visit 1), at 1 week (visit 2), 1 month (visit 3) and 3 months (visit&#xD;
      4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCVA, IOP and SD-OCT will be performed at each visit.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Type 1 or 2 diabetic patients for cataract surgery with &gt; grade 3 cataract type using&#xD;
             the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Patients with onset of diabetes before&#xD;
             the age of 30 years and minimal or absent endogenous insulin production were&#xD;
             classified as having type 1 diabetes. The remaining patients were classified as having&#xD;
             type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diabetics included must have at least level 20 (microaneurysms only) of diabetic&#xD;
             retinopathy, defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be healthy enough to undergo cataract surgery as decided by their&#xD;
             physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be 18 years older and must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections including most viral&#xD;
             diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, including active epithelial herpes simplex&#xD;
             keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial infections, and&#xD;
             fungal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with advanced glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of this product or to other&#xD;
             corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with ACIOL (Anterior Chamber Intraocular Lens) and rupture of the posterior&#xD;
             lens capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have aphakic eyes with rupture of the posterior lens capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Diabetic patients without any retinopathy and those with active uncontrolled&#xD;
             proliferative disease will be excluded. We are excluding normal retinas of diabetics&#xD;
             since we do not feel they are at particular risk for ME when compared to those who&#xD;
             have some form of the disease. A grading of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is&#xD;
             based on the criteria made by the ETDRS study, which includes presence of either 1/3&#xD;
             optic disc neovascularization or Ã≠â√∂ optic disc area of neovascularization anywhere&#xD;
             elsewhere in the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with clinical significant macular edema (CSME) measured with OCT prior to&#xD;
             surgery will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Panretinal photocoagulation within the prior 3 months or anticipated need for&#xD;
             panretinal photocoagulation within the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with retinal diseases, other than diabetes, that can affect ME will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Eyes with uveitis, a history of any other intraocular surgery or a history of&#xD;
             uncontrolled glaucoma (baseline IOP higher than 21 mmHg or those using more than one&#xD;
             type of glaucoma medication) or steroid responders will not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Eyes with cataract precluding proper optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement&#xD;
             pre-operatively will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who will experience longer than usual operating time, complicated surgery,&#xD;
             rupture of the posterior capsule, and iris or corneal burns will be managed&#xD;
             accordingly but will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who are pregnant, breast feeding, or are unable to attend the schedules&#xD;
             follow-up appointments will also be excluded&#xD;
