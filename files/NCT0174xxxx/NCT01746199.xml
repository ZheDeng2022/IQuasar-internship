  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the resistance emergence of malaria in pregnant women receiving intermittent preventive&#xD;
      treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPT-SP) and the burden of this infection among&#xD;
      pregnant women infected by HIV it is urgent to seek a more effective alternative treatment to&#xD;
      optimize the prevention of malaria. Cotrimoxazole (CTM), actually administered daily as a&#xD;
      prophylactic mean to opportunistic infections for HIV infected patients, showed encouraging&#xD;
      results in preventing malaria in pregnant women. However, these results must be confirmed by&#xD;
      randomized trials, particularly in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of cotrimoxazole (CTM),&#xD;
      administered once daily with IPT-SP (3 curative doses spaced one month) on placental&#xD;
      parasitaemia in pregnant women infected with HIV and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) &gt; 350&#xD;
      cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more effective than IPT-SP&#xD;
      for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma concentration of&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven, cotrimoxazole could be&#xD;
      recommended as prophylaxis for HIV-positive pregnant women, whatever their CD4+ cell count.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will also test the hypothesis that the strains of Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum isolated from HIV-positive pregnant women express more dhfr and dhps resistance&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ascertainment of HIV serological status has become a prerequisite for better prevention of&#xD;
      malaria. Studies reported that cotrimoxazole reduces malaria episodes in adults (other than&#xD;
      pregnant women), and in children. Furthermore, several studies showed a good clinical and&#xD;
      parasitological response to cotrimoxazole in treated children. Therefore, preventive&#xD;
      treatment with SP for all HIV+ patients (including pregnant women) who are receiving&#xD;
      treatment containing cotrimoxazole is superfluous and is even contraindicated because of the&#xD;
      increase risk of severe adverse reactions. Few studies, however, have described the efficacy&#xD;
      of cotrimoxazole in the prevention of malaria in pregnant women, particularly in an area&#xD;
      where the frequency of therapeutic failures with SP in cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria&#xD;
      is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence and augmentation of the frequency of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to SP,&#xD;
      which has already been observed in numerous countries of sub-Saharan Africa and in the&#xD;
      Central African Republic, challenges the short-term usefulness of this drug combination in&#xD;
      the prevention of malaria in pregnant women. The resistance is due to accumulation of point&#xD;
      mutations at various sites on the genes coding for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and&#xD;
      dihydropteroate synthase (dhps). The number of mutations correlates with the extent of&#xD;
      resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to SP in vitro. In studies carried out in Bangui, the&#xD;
      prevalence of therapeutic failure was estimated to be 23.8% after 14 days of follow-up among&#xD;
      children with uncomplicated malaria, while the resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to&#xD;
      pyrimethamine in vitro was reported to be 38.3%. The frequency of mutations in dhfr and dhps&#xD;
      alleles is correlated with in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum strains to SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy and HIV infection increase the risk for emergence of mutated strains that are&#xD;
      resistant to SP, because a wide variety of types and clones are found in parasitaemia in&#xD;
      pregnant women (genetic diversity). Furthermore, some studies raised concern about the&#xD;
      possible development of cross-resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to both cotrimoxazole and&#xD;
      SP because of the similarity of their mode of action, although this hypothesis has not been&#xD;
      proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national malaria programme in the Central African Republic recommends the use of IPT-SP&#xD;
      since 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more&#xD;
      effective than SP for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma&#xD;
      concentration of cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven,&#xD;
      cotrimoxazole could be recommended as prophylaxis for HIV+ pregnant women, whatever their&#xD;
      CD4+ cell count. In this study, the investigators will also test the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      strains of Plasmodium falciparum isolated from HIV+ positive pregnant women express more dhfr&#xD;
      and dhps resistance markers.&#xD;
