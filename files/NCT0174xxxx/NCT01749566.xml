      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV prevention strategy in which HIV medicines are used&#xD;
      by a person before they are exposed to HIV in order to decrease his or her chance of getting&#xD;
      infected. In this study, we will investigate a new PrEP strategy in women using a drug called&#xD;
      maraviroc, a medicine used in the treatment of HIV infection called a CCR5 antagonist. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that maraviroc could be a particularly good drug for PrEP because it achieves&#xD;
      high concentrations in the genital tract in women and decreases the number of HIV-susceptible&#xD;
      cells in the genital tract, and thus could potentially be dosed in more favorable ways than&#xD;
      the current PrEP drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further evaluate this PrEP strategy, we plan to measure the amount of maraviroc&#xD;
      in the blood and genital tract of HIV-negative healthy female volunteers before, during, and&#xD;
      after they are given maraviroc dosed either in the standard (twice a day) or reduced (once a&#xD;
      day) dose for 7 days compared with women who are not given maraviroc. We will also study&#xD;
      immune cells from the blood and genital tract from these women to see if maravoric has an&#xD;
      effect on these cells that would prevent them from becoming infected with HIV.&#xD;

      RATIONALE Globally, over half of HIV-infected adults are women, and in the United States, 25%&#xD;
      of all HIV/AIDS cases occur in women. Women often lack control over many available prevention&#xD;
      measures, underscoring a critical need to enhance HIV prevention options for women.&#xD;
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV prevention strategy in which antiretroviral (ARV)&#xD;
      drugs are used prior to potential HIV exposure to reduce the likelihood of infection. This&#xD;
      strategy, which usually contains the drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), has recently&#xD;
      shown promise, but efficacy data suggest room for improvement, particularly for women, in&#xD;
      whom these data are conflicting. This study aims to prospectively examine ARV pharmacology&#xD;
      and mucosal immunology in order to evaluate a novel PrEP strategy in women - blockade of HIV&#xD;
      entry from its target cells at the mucosal surface using the CCR5 receptor antagonist&#xD;
      maraviroc (MVC). These actions of CCR5 receptor antagonism, if validated, could lead to&#xD;
      reduced HIV acquisition risk at more favorable dosing strategies than available for current&#xD;
      PrEP. Knowledge of pharmacological modulation of mucosal immunity and HIV acquisition risk is&#xD;
      fundamental to understanding, improving, and designing new PrEP strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a prospective, observational cohort study with an intensive pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      component conducted in HIV-negative healthy women. Genital tract and whole blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected before, during, and after treatment with 7 days of oral MVC, dosed at 300mg&#xD;
      twice daily (standard) or 300mg daily (reduced) compared with no treatment (control). Genital&#xD;
      tract and plasma MVC concentration will be measured using intensive pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
      to generate concentration-time profiles. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and&#xD;
      endocervical cells harvested from whole blood and cervicovaginal lavage respectively will be&#xD;
      analyzed for CCR5 receptor occupancy, the number of CCR5-expressing HIV target cells, and&#xD;
      level of T cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION 21 days after the first visit of the last participants. Enrollment is expected to&#xD;
      take 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE 30 subjects (10 subjects per study group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION HIV-negative healthy women, age 18 years or older, with normal menses.&#xD;
