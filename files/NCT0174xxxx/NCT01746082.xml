      This is a Phase II open-label study in approximately 200, and up to 240, healthy males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, aged 18 years and older. This study is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza H3N2v vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. Subjects will be stratified by age&#xD;
      (approximately 100 (up to 120) subjects 18-64 years old and approximately 100 (up to 120)&#xD;
      subjects &gt;/= 65 years old) to receive two doses of vaccine, delivered intramuscularly as&#xD;
      15mcg HA/0.5mL dose, 21 days apart. The duration of the study for each subject will be&#xD;
      approximately 7 months.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II open-label study in approximately 200 (up to 240) healthy males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, aged 18 years and older. This study is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza H3N2 variant (H3N2v) vaccine (MIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. Subjects will be&#xD;
      stratified by age (approximately 100 (up to 120) subjects 18-64 years old and approximately&#xD;
      100 (up to 120) subjects &gt;/= 65 years old) to receive two doses of H3N2v MIV, delivered&#xD;
      intramuscularly as 15 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA)/0.5 milliliter (mL) dose, 21&#xD;
      days apart (see Table 1). Subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine prior to&#xD;
      (2 weeks if given the inactivated vaccine or 4 weeks if given the live, attenuated vaccine)&#xD;
      the first H3N2v vaccination. Alternatively, subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccine at any time after completion of the Day 42 visit or following an early termination&#xD;
      visit. Safety will be measured by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic&#xD;
      reactogenicity on the day of each H3N2v vaccination through 7 days after each H3N2v&#xD;
      vaccination, adverse events through 42 days after the first H3N2v vaccination, and serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 7 months after the&#xD;
      first H3N2v vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and&#xD;
      prior to each H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21), approximately 8 days after each H3N2v&#xD;
      vaccination (Days 8 and 29), and approximately 21 days after the second H3N2v vaccination&#xD;
      (Day 42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a subset of healthy adult subjects (up to 30 volunteers 18-64 years old enrolled at the&#xD;
      Emory VTEU site who consent to blood donation for the immunology exploratory assays), an&#xD;
      additional volume of venous blood will be drawn on Days 0, 8, 21, 29 and 42 to determine the&#xD;
      specificity/cross reactivity of antibodies from H3N2v-reactive B cells with other influenza&#xD;
      subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic HA) and most recent H3 seasonal HA to define the molecular&#xD;
      profile of antibody repertoire changes in circulating B cells after H3N2v vaccination, and to&#xD;
      characterize the antibody-secreting cell (ASC), monoclonal antibody (mAb), and CD4+ T cell&#xD;
      responses to H3N2v vaccination. The duration of the study for each subject will be&#xD;
      approximately 7 months. Parent protocol to sub-study 12-0089 and 12-0015.&#xD;
