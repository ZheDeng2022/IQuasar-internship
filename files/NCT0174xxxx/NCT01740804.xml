      Primary endpoint To observe the dynamic changes of CTC during the process of platinum based&#xD;
      chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome of chemotherapy (ORR and&#xD;
      PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint To study the relationship between CTC and overall survival. To study the&#xD;
      molecular feature of CTC, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, CD117, etc.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational non-intervention study evaluating the dynamic CTC count&#xD;
      during the chemotherapy. Patients provide written informed consent and pass the screening.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be drawn before and after the first line chemotherapy. Analyze the&#xD;
      relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome. The time points of blood drawing are set&#xD;
      as following: once prior to 1st cycle of chemotherapy, once 1 week prior to 2nd cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, posterior to 4th cycle (or less than 4th cycle) of chemotherapy and once when&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD). The specific blood tube CellSave Tube will be used, 7.5ml blood&#xD;
      sample every time. One follow-up (including by phone) be made every 3 month after PD until&#xD;
      death. The clinical outcome of first line chemotherapy will be ultimately obtained.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically documented, locally advanced or recurrent (stage IIIb and&#xD;
             not amenable or combined modality treatment) or metastatic (stage IV) non-small cell&#xD;
             lung cancer.&#xD;
