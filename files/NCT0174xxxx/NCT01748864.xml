  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, single-center, open-label, single arm, baseline-controlled (for safety) study in&#xD;
      normal volunteers. Study will determine biodistribution and excretion of the radioactive drug&#xD;
      substance and evaluate the safety and tolerability of 99mTC-Etarfolatide in normal&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
