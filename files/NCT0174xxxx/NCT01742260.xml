      Formal study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranial reconstruction using mesenchymal stromal cells and resorbable biomaterials, will&#xD;
      result in the patient producing their own bone to fill the void which will reduce the risk of&#xD;
      infection and resorption, lead to a better cosmetic result and obviate any long term&#xD;
      consequence of having a synthetic material in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several reasons that parts of the skull may need to be removed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After trauma to relieve brain swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During brain surgery (for brain cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After trauma where the bone is so badly fractured/fragmented it needs to be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all but the last case the bone flap is temporarily stored in a freezer and once the brain&#xD;
      swelling has subsided it is reinserted. This procedure is called &quot;autologous cranioplasty&quot;;&#xD;
      autologous, because it originally came from the patient and cranioplasty, referring to the&#xD;
      repair. Although this is a straightforward procedure, there are a number of complications&#xD;
      including infection and bone resorption that can occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stromal cells have a proven ability to aid in bony healing. Furthermore stromal cells on a&#xD;
      ceramic framework encased in a plastic scaffold have been shown in a small clinical trial to&#xD;
      lead to healing of skull defects. In the present study, it is proposed to add stromal cells&#xD;
      from a suitable donor to medical grade ceramic granules, place them in between specially&#xD;
      moulded plastic scaffolds and insert the sandwich into the skull. Both the ceramic and&#xD;
      plastic materials are medical grade and commonly used in reconstructive surgery, the ceramic&#xD;
      for packing into bony defects due to trauma or removal of cancer and the polymer in bony&#xD;
      reconstruction. Both materials are approved by the TGA. They are designed to dissolve away&#xD;
      over time as the body's own blood vessels and cells populate the sandwich and create the&#xD;
      patient's new bone. It has been proven that without the encouragement of the cells and&#xD;
      temporary scaffold materials, a hole in the skull will not heal. Given the incidence of bone&#xD;
      resorption/infection and metal plate infection using traditional methods, it would seem&#xD;
      prudent to provide a construct that will allow controlled replacement with the patient's own&#xD;
      bone, thus negating any adverse long-term complications with synthetic materials that remain&#xD;
      for life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cranial bone defects are often left following brain surgery, usually to allow&#xD;
      swelling of the brain to recover before subsequently re-implanting a protective covering of&#xD;
      the brain at a later time (cranioplasty). These procedures are performed anywhere over the&#xD;
      cranial vault, either unilaterally or bilaterally. The original piece of bone (autologous&#xD;
      bone plate = bone flap) is placed in a sterile container and stored in a refrigerator at&#xD;
      temperature of -40oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks or months later, when the brain is relaxed, the scalp well healed and the patient's&#xD;
      medical condition permits, the individual is taken back to the operating room and the bone is&#xD;
      reimplanted (A procedure known as an autologous cranioplasty). The aim of the procedure is to&#xD;
      restore cosmesis and protection to the underlying brain and it can sometimes also improve&#xD;
      neurological symptoms by unknown mechanisms. Unfortunately these aims are not always achieved&#xD;
      and whilst technically straightforward the procedure is known to be associated with a number&#xD;
      of complications. Two of the most significant of these are infection (such that the bone flap&#xD;
      needs to be removed and replaced) and resorption (such that the protective function is&#xD;
      compromised). Overall 10% of autologous bone patients become infected, 10% require&#xD;
      replacement due to resorption and 12% become significantly resorbed, then in 32% of case the&#xD;
      autologous bone has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each case of cranioplasty failure the patient requires readmission, a second operation to&#xD;
      remove the bone flap, prolonged antibiotic therapy (in the case of infection), and then a new&#xD;
      custom-made plate and readmission for a third surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases synthetic materials such as polymethylmethacrylate and titanium mesh are used&#xD;
      for reconstruction. Commonly reconstruction is carried out by the surgeon using such&#xD;
      materials to sculpt the cranioplasty. More recently, hydro formed titanium plates have been&#xD;
      used. This entails a process of CT scanning the defect, virtual reconstruction, 3D printing&#xD;
      of moulds, pressing the plate and hand finishing. Whilst highly successful in treating more&#xD;
      than 150 patients, the titanium cranioplasty remains in the patient for life and, as a&#xD;
      non-biological material, presents as a preferential site for infection (approximately 5% of&#xD;
      cases). In addition, medical CT images for assessment and treatment of neurological&#xD;
      conditions are compromised for life due to metal artefacts arising from the plates.&#xD;
      Furthermore, interference with metal scanning equipment commonly used for security purposes&#xD;
      also remains a life time issue. The patients with an infected titanium cranioplasty require a&#xD;
      fourth admission to remove the metal or polymer plate, extended antibiotic treatment and then&#xD;
      a fifth surgical procedure to reinsert a new cranioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC): MSC are multipotent adult cells capable of differentiating&#xD;
      down multiple mesenchymal lineages. They are adherent fibroblastoid-like cells with an&#xD;
      extensive capacity for expansion. They reside within the connective tissue of most organs and&#xD;
      have been isolated from bone marrow, placenta, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, amniotic&#xD;
      fluid, circulating blood, various foetal tissues, skeletal muscle synovia, dental pulp,&#xD;
      liver, spleen, lung and dermis. Most work has focussed on MSC derived from bone marrow,&#xD;
      however, there are also some clinical reports using adipose tissue and placental derived MSC.&#xD;
      MSC from different sources may not be functionally equivalent or exhibit the same&#xD;
      differentiation potential. The main functions for bone marrow derived MSC with regards to the&#xD;
      present study is the ability to differentiate down the osteogenic lineage. It is this ability&#xD;
      to differentiate that has seen them applied to bony non-union and the treatment of critical&#xD;
      size bone skeletal deficits, and in particular the reconstruction of cranial voids. In the&#xD;
      current proposal Cell and Tissue Therapies W.A. at Royal Perth Hospital have extensive&#xD;
      experience and have applied for an TGA (Therapeutics Goods Administration, the Australian&#xD;
      Government regulatory authority) licence to manufacture and provide MSC for patient&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC are not immunogenic and escape recognition by alloreactive T cells and NK cells. They&#xD;
      have low level expression of HLA class I and no expression of HLA class II. They do not&#xD;
      express co-stimulatory molecules and are unable to induce T cell mediated immune response,&#xD;
      and therefore can be used as universal donor cells. Allogeneic cells have been widely used in&#xD;
      clinical trials in both immune modulation and tissue repair. The advantage of using&#xD;
      allogeneic cells is that donor age can be controlled. The literature indicates that MSC&#xD;
      harvested from donors older than 40 years are inferior. Since many of the patients being&#xD;
      treated with a cranioplasty are greater than 40 years of age, the use of allogeneic cells in&#xD;
      this study is preferable. Clinical human trials and animal studies support the use of&#xD;
      allogeneic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranioplasty: The Department of Medical Engineering and Physics at Royal Perth Hospital is a&#xD;
      world leader in providing custom made implants and has been supplying custom made titanium&#xD;
      cranioplasties for fifteen years. The basic methodology which has been used to treat over 150&#xD;
      patients includes the reconstruction of the void using advanced software based on the&#xD;
      patients CT scan. Once the void has been reconstructed a female mould is created to press the&#xD;
      titanium plate. The plate is then hand finished and checked for fitment on a premade defect&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioceramic: Resorbable bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite and beta tri-calcium phosphate have&#xD;
      been used in the treatment of bony deficit for many years. For example, ChronOS (Synthes&#xD;
      GmbH, Oberdorf) bone graft substitute is a fully synthetic and resorbable bone graft&#xD;
      substitute consisting of beta-tricalcium phosphate with a compressive strength similar to&#xD;
      that of cancellous bone. The interconnected porosity acts as an osteconductive matrix for the&#xD;
      ingrowth of bone cells and blood vessels. Such materials are used for filling of bone defects&#xD;
      after trauma, reconstruction or correction in non-load bearing indications and commonly these&#xD;
      materials prescribe a method of perfusion of the granules in the operating room with the&#xD;
      patient's own bone marrow. Resorption of the bioceramics has been shown to occur over a&#xD;
      period of 6-18 months (Buser 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymer Scaffold: There are a myriad of polymer materials used for surgery including in the&#xD;
      area of cranio-maxillofacial surgery. The most common polymer is poly(lactic acid). PLA such&#xD;
      as 70:30 poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) are made from a amorphous biodegradable copolymer&#xD;
      which will ultimately resorb in vivo. The bioceramics and polymer materials are approved by&#xD;
      the TGA for this indication.&#xD;
