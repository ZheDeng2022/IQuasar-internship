  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICH E14 recommends that a thorough QT/QTc (TQT) study should be performed to determine&#xD;
      whether intensive monitoring of QT interval in target patient populations is required during&#xD;
      later stages of development. The current study is designed to ascertain whether CP-690,550 is&#xD;
      associated with QTc prolongation.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Time-Matched Difference in QTcF Intervals Between CP-690,550 Compared to Placebo at 0.25 Hour Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>0.25 hour post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to the beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using the QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR). Data is reported as Least Squares (LS) mean difference (CP-690,550 minus Placebo, baseline-adjusted).</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The QT interval was adjusted for RR interval using the QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR).
