  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on hemodialysis (HD) exhibit an immensely increased cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      associated with extensive vascular calcification (VC). In the past years the development of&#xD;
      VC was discovered to be actively regulated and as being influenced by inhibitors of&#xD;
      calcification (e.g. matrix-Gla-protein, fetuin-A). MGP is produced by vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells and needs post-translational modification by vitamin K dependent gamma-carboxylation to&#xD;
      be fully active. Based on the demonstration of increased PIVKA-II levels, about 97% of all HD&#xD;
      patients exhibit insufficient carboxylation activity. We therefore aim in this randomized,&#xD;
      controlled study to retard the progress of coronary and aortal calcification as assessed by&#xD;
      thoracic multislice-CT by the thrice weekly administration of 5 mg vitamin K1 (phylloquinone)&#xD;
      to about 100 HD patients over a period of 18 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients on hemodialysis (HD) exhibit an immensely increased cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      associated with extensive vascular calcification (VC). This forms - at least partially - the&#xD;
      reason for the excessively increased cardiovascular mortality in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past years the development of VC was discovered to be actively regulated and as being&#xD;
      influenced by inhibitors of calcification (e.g. matrix-Gla-protein, fetuin-A). Matrix Gla&#xD;
      protein (MGP) is a powerful vascular wall-based inhibitor of VC. MGP is produced by vascular&#xD;
      smooth muscle cells and needs post-translational modification by vitamin K dependent&#xD;
      gamma-carboxylation to be fully active. The role of MGP was discovered in knock-out mice,&#xD;
      which died from rupture of a massively calcified aorta. Functional vitamin K deficiency&#xD;
      induced by administration of warfarin leads to the development of VC, which in turn can be&#xD;
      inhibited by subsequent administration of vitamin K1. Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K&#xD;
      mediated gamma-carboxylation, which leads to the production of noncarboxylated and inactive&#xD;
      MGP (ucMGP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warfarin is widely used due to its inhibitory capacity on the activation of coagulation&#xD;
      factors. Now it has been discovered that the use of vitamin K inhibitors influences vascular&#xD;
      health: long-term use of warfarin is associated with an increased prevalence and extent of VC&#xD;
      in the normal population and HD patients. Warfarin is also a crucial risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of calciphylaxis, a life-threatening complication in HD patients characterised by&#xD;
      calcified cutaneous vessels. In turn, administration of vitamin K1 was accompanied by reduced&#xD;
      intima-media-thickness (IMT) and increased elasticity of vessels in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the demonstration of increased PIVKA-II levels, about 97% of all HD patients exhibit&#xD;
      insufficient carboxylation activity. Together with the increased VC they represent an ideal&#xD;
      population for interventional trials in the vitamin K system. Recently we were able to&#xD;
      demonstrate that supplementation of vitamin K1 in such patients is well tolerated, shows only&#xD;
      very few side effects and induces a dose dependent decrease of the inactive form&#xD;
      Dephosphorylated noncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dpucMGP) in serum over a six weeks&#xD;
      period. In this trial we also observed that all dialysis patients included had insufficient&#xD;
      vitamin K serum levels, indicating no substantial influence of food intake on vitamin K&#xD;
      deficiency. In addition, this demonstrates that all patients have insufficient vitamin K&#xD;
      levels to facilitate adequate MGP carboxylation.&#xD;
