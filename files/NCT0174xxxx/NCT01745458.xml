      This study is designed to assess whether inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 activity impacts&#xD;
      platelet function as assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregation tests and in vivo plasma&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SB-659032 is a selective and orally active inhibitor of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase&#xD;
      A2 (Lp-PLA2) that is being developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This study is&#xD;
      designed to assess whether inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 activity impacts platelet function as&#xD;
      assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregation tests and in vivo plasma biomarkers. Blood samples&#xD;
      for PK analysis and measurement of Lp-PLA2 activity will also be collected. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be completed to evaluate the frequency of odorrelated AEs with non-enteric coated&#xD;
      formulation of SB-659032 relative to placebo. This will be a double blind, repeat dose,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, two period, period balanced, crossover study. There will be a&#xD;
      minimum of a 21 day washout period between dosing in each period.&#xD;
