  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has unparalleled efficacy in treating severe depression that&#xD;
      is resistant to common modalities of treatment, such as antidepressant medication. Although&#xD;
      treatment with ECT has benefited many individuals with treatment resistant depression (rates&#xD;
      as high as 50-75%), its more widespread use is hindered by the social stigma associated with&#xD;
      the treatment, as well as by its significant cognitive side effects. Moreover, ECT cannot be&#xD;
      precisely targeted, since it produces a widespread activation of the brain surface, in turn,&#xD;
      affecting many different functional areas. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is currently being&#xD;
      investigated as an alternative to ECT, as it is more focused to one area of the brain. Rather&#xD;
      than applying electrical stimuli to induce a seizure, as is done in ECT, MST uses repetitive&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation to produce the seizure. Preliminary research suggests that MST can&#xD;
      result in therapeutic effects comparable to those produced by ECT, but without the negative&#xD;
      side effects on cognition. The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial, in which the&#xD;
      efficacy and side effect profile of MST will be compared to those of ECT. If successful, the&#xD;
      results of this study may lead to increased treatment availability and accessibility, as well&#xD;
      as lessen the substantial health care costs associated with treatment resistant depression.&#xD;
