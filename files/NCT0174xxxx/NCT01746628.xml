    <textblock>
      When having certain types of outpatient surgery inside the uterine cavity some women&#xD;
      experience heavy bleeding. The only method presently available for controlling such bleeding,&#xD;
      short of removing the uterus, involves the placement of a balloon pressure device inside the&#xD;
      uterine cavity. The pressure along with the patient's own natural clotting ability will&#xD;
      generally stop the bleeding. However, this treatment usually requires at least a 24 hour stay&#xD;
      in the hospital. The investigators are researching the use of a compound (FloSeal) already&#xD;
      approved for use in other areas of the human body, as a method of controlling bleeding. The&#xD;
      use of FloSeal in the uterine cavity has not yet been tested and therefore is not yet an FDA&#xD;
      approved indication for its safe use to control bleeding from the uterine cavity. In this&#xD;
      study, The investigators want to find out what effect(s) FloSeal has on the uterine cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty individuals will be included in this study at Northwest Hospital Center. All twenty&#xD;
      individuals will be treated in the same fashion except ten of the participants will randomly&#xD;
      be assigned to receive FloSeal and ten will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are individuals currently scheduled to have a hysterectomy procedure,&#xD;
      which involves surgically removing the uterus from the body for a previously determined&#xD;
      standard of care treatment for a non- cancerous medical problem. Before performing the&#xD;
      hysterectomy and evaluating the effects of FloSeal upon the tissues within the uterine cavity&#xD;
      the following will be done. Once under anesthesia the uterine cavity will be subjected to a&#xD;
      curettage (sharp scrapping) to produce a minor amount of bleeding from the lining of the&#xD;
      uterus. Ten of the 20 study participants, randomly chosen, will then have FloSeal placed into&#xD;
      their uterine cavity. The study participants will not know whether they received FloSeal or&#xD;
      not. A balloon pressure device will then be placed into the uterine cavity of all 20&#xD;
      individuals and left in place for 5 minutes. After the allotted time, the balloon device will&#xD;
      be removed. The hysterectomy will then be completed appropriately using standard methods and&#xD;
      techniques. The uterus, once removed will be evaluated pathologically to determine the&#xD;
      effects of the FloSeal upon the tissues of the cavity in those so treated and compared to the&#xD;
      same analysis in those individuals who did not receive FloSeal. The pathologist will not know&#xD;
      which patients received or did not receive FloSeal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This use of FloSeal is not currently an FDA approved use of the compound. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to obtain FDA approval for use in this situation.&#xD;

      Patients will be followed until fully recovered from surgery, usually 6 to 8 weeks. Any&#xD;
      complications will be duly noted and treated appropriately. The final end point for follow up&#xD;
      will be when the patient is finally discharged from care having achieved what is usually&#xD;
      perceived as a return to all normal activity.&#xD;
