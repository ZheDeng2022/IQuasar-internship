      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational drug, in this case an investigational drug combined with standard drug&#xD;
      therapy. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug&#xD;
      to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and&#xD;
      taht research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has&#xD;
      not approved the drug for use in patients, including people with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BKM120 is a drug that inhibits the ability of tumors to grow and survive, which may lead to&#xD;
      better outcomes in many types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate is a drug that is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer, and&#xD;
      works by inhibiting an enzyme found in prostate tumor tissue. While taking abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate, individuals must also take a glucocorticoid such as prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer will receive treatment with docetaxel,&#xD;
      after which treatment with the combination of abiraterone and prednisone has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective. Evidence has shown an interaction between the pathways through which BKM120 and&#xD;
      abiraterone act on cancer. Therefore, it is thought that the treatment of castrate-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer will be enhanced by combining BKM120 with abiraterone plus prednisone. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose for the combination of daily oral BKM120,&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate, and prednisone in patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer who have received prior treatment with docetaxel.&#xD;

      You will undergo a screening process to determine if you are eligible to participate in this&#xD;
      trial. This process will include the following procedures: Tumor Biopsy, including a bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy, which is used to determine the kinds of cancer cells in your tumor and a&#xD;
      Physical Examination, including weight, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body&#xD;
      temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely&#xD;
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have docetaxel resistant&#xD;
      CRPC, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the&#xD;
      study drug. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled&#xD;
      in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in this research study, you will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for&#xD;
      each treatment cycle. There will be a 14 day lead in phase of BKM120 alone to assess for&#xD;
      toxicity from this agent. After the lead in phase, the standard dose of abiraterone and&#xD;
      prednisone will be added to the BKM120 treatment regimen. Treatment cycles will last 4 weeks&#xD;
      (28 days), during which time you will be taking the study drug in combination with the&#xD;
      standard drug therapy once daily. Your time of participation in the study will be based on&#xD;
      how well you tolerate the experimental drug. You could be participating in the study for a&#xD;
      period of days, or years, depending on the course of your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment cycle, you will be required to return to see your research doctor for a&#xD;
      study visit on Day 1 of each cycle. For Cycle 1, you will also need to return on Days 8, 15&#xD;
      and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be performed and samples will be collected at 1 or more study&#xD;
      visits: Evaluation of side effects, Vital sign measurement, Heart function tests,&#xD;
      Neuropsychologic exams, Performance status assessment, Tumor biopsy, Assessment of tumor,&#xD;
      Blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life. We would&#xD;
      like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing. Keeping&#xD;
      in touch with you and checking your condition every year will help us look at the long-term&#xD;
      effects of the research study. You will be required to return to see your research doctor for&#xD;
      an end of study visit, which will take place 4-8 weeks after you undergo prostatectomy.&#xD;
