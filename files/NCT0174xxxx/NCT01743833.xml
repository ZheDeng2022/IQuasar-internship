  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement has been identified as the most common cause of shoulder pain in the&#xD;
      adult general population. Sometimes therapeutic pushing on the middle part of the back&#xD;
      (manual therapy) decreases shoulder pain in someone experiencing shoulder impingement. We do&#xD;
      not known what causes the decreased shoulder pain. It could be that the therapeutic pushing&#xD;
      makes things move better. It may be that the person getting their back treatment thinks they&#xD;
      are better or the physical therapist who provides the manual treatment thinks it works.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement has been identified as the most common cause of shoulder pain in the&#xD;
      adult general population. High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude Thrust Manipulations (HVLATM) of the&#xD;
      thoracic spine and ribs result in increased shoulder ROM, as well as decreased pain and&#xD;
      disability in patients suffering shoulder impingement. The quality of the sparse publications&#xD;
      is low and lacking control or comparison groups regarding the use of HVLATM in the management&#xD;
      of shoulder impingement. Further higher quality randomized clinical trials are needed.&#xD;
      Moreover, no research has investigated the effects of the patients beliefs and different&#xD;
      types of verbal messages conveyed by the clinician to the subjects in regard to the effects&#xD;
      of HVLATM of the thoracic spine on shoulder pain and function. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate, in subjects with signs and symptoms of shoulder impingement: (1) the effects of&#xD;
      a series of the prone thoracic spine High Velocity Low Amplitude Thrust Manipulation (HVLATM)&#xD;
      as compared to the HVLATM directed at the scapula, on shoulder pain, impingement symptoms,&#xD;
      and functional outcomes; (2) the effect of the type of message and language used by the&#xD;
      clinician in regard to thoracic HVLATM on shoulder pain, impingement symptoms, and functional&#xD;
      outcomes; (3) the effect of subject's expectation of outcome of thoracic and scapula HVLATM&#xD;
      on shoulder pain, impingement symptoms, and functional outcomes; (4) if these potential&#xD;
      immediate improvements will be sustained at 6 to 9-day follow up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A consecutive convenience sampling of patients with complaints of shoulder pain that&#xD;
             are not post-surgical will be screened at their initial evaluation. Subjects between&#xD;
             the ages of 18 and 69 years will be included if they present with a painful arc of&#xD;
             shoulder active ROM. Additional requirements for inclusion will be (1) shoulder pain&#xD;
             greater than 1/10 but less than 9/10 at time of testing; (2) shoulder active ROM above&#xD;
             horizontal; (3) the ability to lie prone with arms at their side; and (4) at least one&#xD;
             of the following signs or symptoms: (1) a positive Hawkins-Kennedy Sign; (2) a&#xD;
             positive Neer Impingement Sign; (3) painful resisted abduction; (4) painful resisted&#xD;
