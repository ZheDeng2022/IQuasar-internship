  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no reliable, bedside, and non-invasive method for assessing connectivity&#xD;
      changes in electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related&#xD;
      pathologies, e.g., concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related&#xD;
      Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of&#xD;
      cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a&#xD;
      method, as they provide both a non-invasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs&#xD;
      provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally&#xD;
      been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial&#xD;
      resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will&#xD;
      combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern&#xD;
      recognition methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and&#xD;
      synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision making in&#xD;
      brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been&#xD;
      developed to fill this gap.&#xD;
