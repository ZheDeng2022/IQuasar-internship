  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease in smokers. COPD has a&#xD;
      slowly deteriorating course, punctuated by exacerbations- acute events characterized by&#xD;
      increasing shortness of breath and putrid sputum. Exacerbations of COPD may be precipitated&#xD;
      by several factors, most commonly infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exacerbation frequency generally increases with declining lung function. However, some&#xD;
      patients with COPD consistently experience a higher rate of exacerbations than others despite&#xD;
      similar severity of COPD. This has led researchers to postulate the existence of a distinct&#xD;
      subgroup of &quot;frequent exacerbators&quot; . Recent work has also brought attention to a subset of&#xD;
      patients who experience remarkably few exacerbations despite significantly impaired lung&#xD;
      function. Careful characterization of both of these extreme subgroups of COPD may offer&#xD;
      additional insights into why certain patients are prone to frequent exacerbations while&#xD;
      others remain relatively protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haptoglobin (Hp) is a protein produced predominately by the liver . In humans two types of&#xD;
      genes for Hp exist (1 and 2) with possible combinations of these two genes- 1-1, 1-2, or 2-2.&#xD;
      The Hp 2 gene is believed to have arisen from the Hp 1 gene in human evolution. Subsequently&#xD;
      the prevalence of the Hp 2 allele has spread throughout the world, probably as a result of&#xD;
      its ability to provide a selective advantage against infectious disease. The Hp 1-2&#xD;
      combination is a very common one. In most western countries, the prevalence of the Hp&#xD;
      genotypes is 16% Hp 1-1, 36% Hp 2-2 and 48% Hp 2-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hp gene form has been shown to be associated with disease. Specifically, Hp phenotypes&#xD;
      have been found to affect propensity to atherosclerosis in Diabetic individuals. There have&#xD;
      been several studies suggesting that the Hp 2-2 phenotype is associated with a protection&#xD;
      against infectious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the importance of respiratory infections on COPD exacerbations, and of the gained&#xD;
      knowledge of Haptoglobin subtypes on propensity to infection, we propose to investigate&#xD;
      whether Haptoglobin subtypes are in correlation with the &quot;frequent exacerbator&quot; phenotype of&#xD;
      COPD. We postulate that, since people with Hp 1-1 are more prone to infection, the frequency&#xD;
      of the Hp 1-1 phenotype will be higher in &quot;frequent exacerbators&quot; of COPD than in &quot;non-&#xD;
      exacerbators&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis we propose to determine Hp phenotype in two groups of COPD patients:&#xD;
      one with frequent exacerbations and one with no exacerbations, and compare the relative&#xD;
      frequency of the 1-1 phenotype in the two groups.&#xD;

      Laboratory Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 ml of Serum will be collected and stored at 4 degrees Celsius (up to one week) or minus 20&#xD;
      degrees Celsius until delivery to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haptoglobin phenotype will be determined at the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, the&#xD;
      B. Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, 1 Efron st. Haifa, Israel. The method for phenotypin Hp is&#xD;
      protein gel electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum remaining will be kept frozen in minus 70 degrees Celsius for 5 years in a freezer&#xD;
      shelf dedicated for the Pulmonology Institute at the Serology Laboratory in Carmel Medical&#xD;
      Center for future analysis of proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haptoglobin Electrophoresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haptoglobin protein is separated based on size. Hp 2-2 is the largest therefore was&#xD;
      expected to travel the shortest distance in the gel and Hp 1-1 is the smallest and therefore&#xD;
      would travel the farthest down the gel. The gel that is used for the electrophoresis was a&#xD;
      Polyacrylamide gel. Two concentrations are used in order to provide loading and separating&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower gel is a Polyacrilamide gel that contains 10.8 ml 1M Tris pH 8.8, 3.55 ml of&#xD;
      Acrylamide 40%, 11.5 ml of dH2O, 225 μl of Ammonium persulfate (APS) 10%, and 18 μl of&#xD;
      tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). The upper gel is a Polyacrylamide gel that contains 937.5&#xD;
      μl of 1M Tris pH 6.8, 787.5 μl of Acrylamide 40%, 5.7 ml of dH2O, 75 μl of APS 10%, and 7.5&#xD;
      μl of TEMED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower gel is poured in between two glass plates and left for 30 minutes to solidify. Once&#xD;
      lower gel is solidified upper gel is poured on top of it, and left for 30 min to solidify.&#xD;
      Wells comb placed superiorly to upper gel in order to create wells for sample placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample for each patient is prepared using 10 μl of the serum, 2 μl of Hemoglobin, and 12&#xD;
      μl of a commercial loading buffer. The sample is then carefully placed in the prepared wells&#xD;
      using a pipette. 4 wells are reserved for 3 controls of Hp 2-2, Hp 2-1, and Hp 1-1 followed&#xD;
      medially by an empty well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The western blot analysis is run in a Protean II xi cell by BIO-RAD. The apparatus is&#xD;
      assembled and an electrophoresis running buffer is added. The running buffer contains 15.1 g&#xD;
      of Tris, 72 g of Glycine, and 1000 ml of DDW. The running buffer was then placed in the upper&#xD;
      and lower reservoir of the Protean II. The electrophoresis was run at 240 Volts for 3 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the samples are finished running, the gel is removed from between the glass plates. The&#xD;
      gel was then stained using a color staining solution. The Solution was made using 40 mg of&#xD;
      3,3'-5,5' tetramethyl benzidine and 20 ml of methanol. This was left to mix for 15 minutes.&#xD;
      Next 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide is added and left to mix for 5 min. This was followed by the&#xD;
      addition of 40 ml of acetic acid 5% which is made of 2 ml AA and 38 ml of DDW. Next 40 mg of&#xD;
      potassium fericyanide dissolved in 4 ml of DDW are added. Finally 600 μl of H2O2 is added to&#xD;
      the staining solution and left to mix for 10 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the staining solution is ready, the gel is placed in a 22 cm by 32 cm tray and the&#xD;
      staining solution is poured over the gel. The tray is then placed on a shaker for 25 minutes.&#xD;
      Once the Gel is finished being stained it is legible. Nevertheless, the gel is photographed&#xD;
      for image enhancement and data storage. The gel is removed from the tray and placed in an&#xD;
      Image Analyzer (Imagequant LAS 4000) for imaging, or Canon powershot sx40 hs digital camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Tabulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data - the Haptoglobin phenotype with corresponding IDs - is gathered and tabulated into&#xD;
      a Microsoft excel table.&#xD;
