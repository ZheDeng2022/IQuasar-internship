    <textblock>
      This study assesses risk factors for depressive relapse in women undergoing fertility&#xD;
      treatment with histories of major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder. The study is&#xD;
      focused on the acute risk factors of depressive relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that risk for depressive relapse will be greater among women&#xD;
      who stop antidepressants compared to those who continue treatment with these agents.&#xD;

      This study hopes to address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To delineate the relative risk of relapse in women undergoing IVF, IUI, or&#xD;
      other infertility treatments who discontinue antidepressant therapy for depression, compared&#xD;
      to those who maintain treatment with these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Risk for depressive relapse will be greater among women who stop antidepressants&#xD;
      compared to those who continue treatment with these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To identify predictors of depressive relapse among women receiving IVF, IUI,&#xD;
      or other infertility treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Relapse rates will be greater among those who have: 1) histories of more&#xD;
      recurrent depressive illness, 2) longer duration of attempt to conceive, and 3) a lower&#xD;
      degree of perceived support from respective partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3 (exploratory): To describe the trajectory of depressive symptoms in women&#xD;
      with histories of depression across the course of IVF, IUI, or other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Specific phases of the IVF cycle will have differential effects on the burden of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. Specifically, these phases include: 1) the phase prior to egg retrieval,&#xD;
      2) the phase after embryo transfer while a woman waits for the pregnancy test or her&#xD;
      menstrual period, and 3) the phase after the experience of a negative pregnancy test (when&#xD;
      applicable) following an IVF cycle. We seek to characterize factors associated both with&#xD;
      vulnerability to more depressive symptoms and to resilience in the context of the different&#xD;
      phases of IVF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #4 (exploratory): To identify biological markers of stress, including HPA axis&#xD;
      dysregulation and inflammation associated with depressive relapse, during IVF, IUI, or other&#xD;
      infertility treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, evidenced by increases&#xD;
      in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns and markers of inflammation, will be associated with&#xD;
      higher&#xD;
