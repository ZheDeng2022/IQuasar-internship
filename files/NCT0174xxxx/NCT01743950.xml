  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of Pulse Reduced Dose Rate (PRDR) radiation when given in 27&#xD;
      fraction over 5.5 weeks with concurrent bevacizumab followed by adjuvant bevacizumab until&#xD;
      time of progression in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas (grade III and grade IV).&#xD;
      Patients will be placed in 1 of 4 groups based on their histologic diagnosis and prior&#xD;
      exposure to bevacizumab.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and then approximately every 8 weeks for 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE survey is a clinician facilitated instrument scored on a scale of 0-30 where scores of 0-17 indicate severe cognitive impairment, 18-23 indicate mild cognitive impairment, and 24-30 indicate no cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant Reported FACT-BR Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and then approximately every 8 weeks for 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-BR) instrument is a 50-item survey with each item scored on a 5 point likert scale where 0 is 'not at all' and 4 is 'very much'. The total possible range of scores is 0-200 where higher scores indicate higher quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Participant Reported FACIT-F Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and then approximately every 8 weeks for 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) instrument is a 13-item survey with each item scored on a 5 point likert scale where 0 is 'not at all' and 4 is 'very much'. The total possible range of scores is from 0-52 where higher scores indicate better quality of life. A score of less than 30 indicates severe fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Karnofsky Performance Status</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and then approximately every 8 weeks for 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Karnofsky Performance Status measures a cancer patient's ability to perform ordinary tasks. It is score from 0-100 where 0 means a person has died, less than 40 is various degrees of unable to care for oneself, 50-70 is unable to work but can care for personal needs with variable assistance, and 80-100 is able to carry on normal activity with variable symptoms of disease.</description>
