  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown differences in health-related outcomes by dietary pattern. These&#xD;
      patterns have included those participants following vegan (no meat, poultry, fish, dairy, or&#xD;
      eggs), vegetarian (no meat, poultry, or fish), pesco- vegetarian (no meat or poultry),&#xD;
      semi-vegetarian (red meat and poultry â‰¥ 1 time/month and &lt; 1 time/week), or omnivorous diets.&#xD;
      These studies have shown that of these dietary patterns, vegans have the lowest BMIs, lowest&#xD;
      prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, and lowest amount of weight gain over 5 years. In addition,&#xD;
      vegetarians have significantly better metabolic risk factors as compared to non-vegetarians.&#xD;
      While these initial observational studies have shown benefits to consuming more plant-based&#xD;
      diets, there have been no randomized trials examining the differences in health outcomes&#xD;
      among these dietary patterns. To begin exploring this research area, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a pilot study which will randomize participants to one of the 5 dietary approaches.&#xD;
      Participants (n=75) in the NEW DIETs Study will be recruited to follow their randomly&#xD;
      assigned diet for 8 weeks and attend weekly sessions to learn about nutrition and cooking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study involves five groups. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of these&#xD;
      groups. All groups will receive information on a dietary approach aimed at losing weight. All&#xD;
      groups will be asked to favor foods that are low fat and have a low glycemic index, which&#xD;
      means they will be asked to favor foods that don't cause a quick rise in blood sugar (for&#xD;
      example, choosing oatmeal over cornflakes for breakfast). All groups will also be asked to&#xD;
      take a vitamin B-12 supplement each day of their choosing (can be a multivitamin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are eligible on the online screener will be contacted by phone to complete a&#xD;
      few additional screening questions and invited to an orientation meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below are the steps in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants are accepted into the study, participants will come to the study site&#xD;
           (USC Public Health Research Center) to learn more about the study, have their weight and&#xD;
           height measured, learn how to complete questionnaires online, and complete their consent&#xD;
           form. This meeting will last approximately 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then complete some questionnaires that measure their diet and physical&#xD;
           activity levels on a computer at home or other location where participants have&#xD;
           computer/internet access. We will also ask participants to keep all their grocery and&#xD;
           restaurant receipts during this time to bring back with participants to the next&#xD;
           meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come back for a meeting to have their weight measured again and&#xD;
           participants will find out their diet group assignment. Participants will receive a 1.25&#xD;
           hour overview of the diet participants have been assigned to and be provided with&#xD;
           materials on this diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants are assigned to the vegan, vegetarians, pesco-, or semi-vegetarian&#xD;
           diets, they will complete the following over the 8-week study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Participants will attend weekly meetings over 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. We will obtain their weight and collect online questionnaires at weeks 4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. During the 8-week study, we will ask participants to complete an online weekly&#xD;
                questionnaire which will assess if participants are following the diet and their&#xD;
                weight. This will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants are assigned to the omnivorous diet, they will only come in for meetings&#xD;
           at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. We will obtain their weight and collect online questionnaires at weeks 4 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Participants will receive e-mailed lessons of their diet plan each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. During the 8-week study, we will ask participants to complete an online weekly&#xD;
                questionnaire which will assess if participants are following the diet, and their&#xD;
                weight. This will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. At week 8, participants will also be provided with information about the other 4&#xD;
                diets in case participants would like to try these dietary patterns after the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All diet groups will be asked to collect and turn in all grocery store and restaurant&#xD;
           receipts for 2 weeks prior to the start of the intervention and for the 8 weeks during&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At study completion (8 weeks), participants will receive an incentive for participating&#xD;
           ($20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in all groups will be asked to take a daily multivitamin (or other reliable&#xD;
           source of vitamin B-12) over the course of the study. You are responsible for choosing&#xD;
           and purchasing this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, we will ask you to keep your physical activity levels constant (keep&#xD;
           your levels the same as what you were doing at study entry).&#xD;
