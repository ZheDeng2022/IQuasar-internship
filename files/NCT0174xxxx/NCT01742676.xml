        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients who meet the following inclusion criteria should be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who received a kidney at least within 12 months of their study enrollment&#xD;
             (from a deceased or living donor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients whose tacrolimus dose have not been changed in at least 12 weeks from their&#xD;
             study enrollment and whose minimum blood tacrolimus concentration mean value is within&#xD;
             3-10 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female patients who showed a negative result in the serum pregnancy test and who&#xD;
             agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are clinically stable based on the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who were given enough information regarding the study, understood the&#xD;
             objectives and risks of the study, and signed the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who fall under any of the following criteria should not be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who had received any other organ except a kidney&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who showed an acute rejection reaction within 12 weeks of their enrollment or&#xD;
             who showed an acute rejection reaction that required antilymphocyte antibody therapy&#xD;
             within 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who were diagnosed with a newly developed malignant tumor (Patients with&#xD;
             successfully treated squamous cell/basal cell carcinoma can be enrolled, though.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have a known allergy to the investigational drug (the test/control drug)&#xD;
             or to tacrolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have an unstable medical condition that may affect the evaluation of the&#xD;
             study's objectives based on the investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have any form of drug abuse or mental illness that might complicate&#xD;
             communication with the investigators based on the investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are currently participating in another clinical trial or who received the&#xD;
             investigational drug in another trial within 28 days of their enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who are receiving prohibited concomitant medications or who received those&#xD;
             medications within 28 days of their enrollment&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Patients who had been HIV-positive&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who are considered non-compliant with the scheduled study visits in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who have abnormal kidney functions or a serum creatinine level higher than&#xD;
             1.6 mg/dL/GFR (MDRD) or less than 30 mL/min at the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who have &quot;Creeping creatinine&quot; (a 20% increase in their creatinine for six&#xD;
             months before their enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who have abnormal liver functions: i.e., whose SGPT/ALT and/or SGOT/AST&#xD;
             and/or bilirubin is twice higher than the normal range in the center, and who have&#xD;
             liver cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients who have an underlying disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&#xD;
             (FSGS) or type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (Type II MPGN)&#xD;
