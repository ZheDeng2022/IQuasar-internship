      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The brain has natural rhythms called brain waves. An electroencephalogram (EEG) can record&#xD;
      these rhythms. When people identify the picture of a familiar object shown on a computer&#xD;
      screen, the communication between certain regions of the brain increases. An EEG can detect&#xD;
      these communication brain waves. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can affect these&#xD;
      brain waves by slightly changing the brain s rhythms. Researchers want to see if changing&#xD;
      brain rhythms with TMS interferes with the ability to identify pictures of familiar objects.&#xD;
      This study will provide more information about how TMS can affect brain waves and behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if TMS can interfere with the brain s ability to identify pictures of familiar&#xD;
      objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires two visits to the clinical center. The first visit will last about 2&#xD;
           hours. The second visit will last about 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will have an object recognition test. Participants will&#xD;
           look at pictures of several objects on a computer screen. They will then have to state&#xD;
           whether the objects they see on the screen are familiar. The object recognition test&#xD;
           will be done along with TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will have an EEG while taking the object recognition&#xD;
           test. Brain waves will be monitored during the test. They will then repeat the test&#xD;
           while having repetitive TMS to study its effect on object recognition. The participants&#xD;
           will then take the object recognition test alone for a final time. This will make sure&#xD;
           that TMS effects (if any) on the ability to identify familiar object images are no&#xD;
           longer present.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inter-hemispheric coherence (IHC) is one of the electroencephalography (EEG) parameters that&#xD;
      measures synchronization of oscillations originating from brain regions of different&#xD;
      hemispheres and thereby the functional connectivity between them. We know that object&#xD;
      discrimination is associated with transient increase in IHC. In this study we will interfere&#xD;
      with the transient IHC that is associated with midline object discrimination by using&#xD;
      rhythmic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study the effects of entrainment by unilateral or bilateral, synchronous or&#xD;
      asynchronous TMS pulses on behavior. The goal of the study is to determine if entrainment by&#xD;
      TMS will affect task performance. If the results show that TMS by entrainment influenced&#xD;
      behavior, then we can expect TMS to be a useful technique to explore the behavioral impact of&#xD;
      specific neuronal oscillations under physiological as well as pathological conditions.&#xD;
      Further, TMS could also find applications in rehabilitation or treatment of behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study 11 adult healthy volunteers on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will first participate in a screening session where the threshold TMS&#xD;
      intensity for blocking object discrimination and the optimal coil orientation will be&#xD;
      determined using single pulse TMS. Later they will attend the main experiment session where&#xD;
      they will be asked to perform the object discrimination task in four blocks, of which the&#xD;
      second, third and fourth will be in random order. During the first block, the individual&#xD;
      coherence frequency will be determined by recording EEG during the task. During the second,&#xD;
      third and fourth blocks, the subjects will receive either unilateral, bilateral or sham rTMS&#xD;
      in a random order while EEG is being recorded. Short trains of 7 TMS pulses will be delivered&#xD;
      during each trial. TMS pulses will be administered over left and/or right LOG at 80% of&#xD;
      threshold intensity blocking object discrimination or 60% maximum stimulator output whichever&#xD;
      is smaller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that short trains of TMS will affect IHC depending on whether the pulses are&#xD;
      synchronous or asynchronous. By modulating IHC, we expect changes in object discrimination&#xD;
      task performance. The primary outcome measure in this study includes object discrimination&#xD;
      task performance. During the study, we will also compute the individual frequency at which&#xD;
      maximum coherence occurs, the threshold intensity and optimal coil direction for blocking&#xD;
      object discrimination and the spatio-temporal characteristics of EEG waves during the rTMS&#xD;
      trains to confirm that entrainment is occurring.&#xD;
