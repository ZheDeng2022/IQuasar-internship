  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of dasatinib and crizotinib that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is designed to block certain proteins from causing cancer cells to grow out of&#xD;
      control. This may cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crizotinib is designed to block certain abnormal genes found in cancer cells. This may cause&#xD;
      the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of leukemia. Crizotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the&#xD;
      treatment of lung cancer. The combination of dasatinib and crizotinib is currently being used&#xD;
      for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 176 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a either&#xD;
      Arm A or Arm B based when you joined this study, the disease type, and the drugs you have&#xD;
      taken in the past. Up to 5 dose levels of the study drug will be tested in each arm. Up to 6&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in each dose level of arms A and B. The first group of&#xD;
      participants in Arm A will receive the FDA approved dose of crizotinib plus the lowest dose&#xD;
      level of dasatinib. The first group of participants in Arm B will receive the FDA approved&#xD;
      dose of dasatinib plus the lowest dose level of crizotinib. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose of the study drug combination than the group before it, if no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug&#xD;
      combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose level of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the highest tolerable dose level of the study drug combination for each arm is found,&#xD;
      up to 10 additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion group and will&#xD;
      receive the highest dose of the study drug combination that was tolerated in the dose&#xD;
      escalation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take dasatinib by mouth 1 time each day. You will take this drug alone&#xD;
      on Day 1 of Cycle 1, before the first day you receive the study drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then starting on Day 2 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking crizotinib by mouth 1 time daily, 1&#xD;
      time every other day, or 2 times daily depending on the dose level of the study drug you are&#xD;
      assigned to. You should take dasatinib and crizotinib at least 1 hour before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have study visits on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, and again before you begin each new&#xD;
      cycle (once every 28 days). At each study visit, you will be asked about any drugs you may be&#xD;
      taking and any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood/Tumor Samples and Imaging Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the dose expansion group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
           testing before your take the first dose of study drug. PD testing measures how the level&#xD;
           of study drug in your body may affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are one of the first ten patients enrolled in your cohort, you will take&#xD;
           Dasatinib only on your first day of treatment (Day -1 of Cycle 1). On Day -1 and on Day&#xD;
           1 of Cycle 1, blood (about ½ teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
           testing before you take the drug and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after you take the drug. PK&#xD;
           testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are one of the first ten patients enrolled in your cohort, on Day 1 of Cycle 3&#xD;
           and beyond, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing before you take the&#xD;
           study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are one of the first 10 patients enrolled in your cohort, you will have a biopsy&#xD;
           at screening and after Cycle 1. The type of biopsy you have will be based on the type of&#xD;
           disease you have. The procedure, and its risks, will be discussed with you in more&#xD;
           detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Week 3 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 28 of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 4 of Cycle 2 and then every 2-3 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, and/or a bone scan to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease. The actual type of scan you have will depend on what types of scans were&#xD;
           taken at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if intolerable side effects&#xD;
      occur or if you are unable to follow study directions. If the disease gets worse, you may be&#xD;
      eligible to continue taking the study drug. The study doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit and&#xD;
      the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan,&#xD;
           and/or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. The effects of Dasatinib and Crizotinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;

             weeks between finishing radiation and initiation of study drugs. Palliative radiation&#xD;
             will not be allowed during cycle 1 of treatment but is permitted in this study during&#xD;
             following cycles as long as there are evaluable lesions that are not being irradiated&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Patient is pregnant or lactating. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because&#xD;
             dasatinib and crizotinib are agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects (Pregnancy category D).&#xD;
