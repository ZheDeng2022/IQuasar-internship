      Catheter-associated urinary infections are the most common hospital-acquired infections and&#xD;
      can be prevented by early catheter removal. This study evaluates tamsulosin to reduce the&#xD;
      failure of early catheter removal has been studied in elderly women hospitalized for an acute&#xD;
      condition and experiencing acute urinary retention: 448 women 75-year old or more without an&#xD;
      anatomical or neurological cause of urinary retention will be randomized to a 6 days course&#xD;
      of tamsulosin 0.4 mg or placebo. Catheter removal will be attempted after the third dose of&#xD;
      tamsulosin and the need to replace another catheter within 72 hours will define a failed&#xD;
      attempt.&#xD;

      Background: Urinary tract infections are the most frequent hospital-acquired infections. A&#xD;
      majority is catheter-associated and the main risk factor is the duration of catheterization.&#xD;
      Early removal is therefore a priority. Treatment with alpha-blockers in men with acute&#xD;
      urinary retention due to prostatic disease increases the rate of successful early catheter&#xD;
      removal. No intervention has been studied in elderly women in whom urinary retention is&#xD;
      usually favored by an acute health issue. However, alpha-blockers have proved effective in&#xD;
      other circumstances, as the prevention of acute urinary retention after hysterectomy and the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic voiding disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the benefit of tamsulosin for 6 days in older women hospitalized for&#xD;
      an acute medical condition and experiencing urinary retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Rate of failed early catheter removal (day 3), requiring placement of&#xD;
      another catheter within the following 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: rate of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, rate of hypotension,&#xD;
      length of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blind and multicentric randomized controlled trial (tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day or&#xD;
      placebo orally for 6 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: We assume a 40% failure rate of early catheter removal in the placebo&#xD;
      group. Expecting a 10% dropout rate, 448 patients need to be randomized to show a reduction&#xD;
      of this rate by one third in the tamsulosin group with two-sided alpha level at 5% and beta&#xD;
      level at 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 75-year or older women hospitalized in an internal medicine or geriatric&#xD;
      ward and with a bladder catheter for less than 48 hours for acute urinary retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria: chronic urinary retention; acute retention with an anatomical (pelvic&#xD;
      tumor, pelvic surgery) or neurological cause (peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord compression,&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease); catheter placed for&#xD;
      another indication (pressure ulcer protection, urine output monitoring); patients at the end&#xD;
      of life; contra-indication to alpha-blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course of the study: The patient receives a treatment dose in the evening inclusion (day 0)&#xD;
      and the five following evenings. The catheter is removed after the third dose, between&#xD;
      midnight and noon. The patient is followed up until day 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total time: 36 months (35 months of inclusion + 12 days of participation per patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participating centers: 8 Expected number of inclusions per month and center: 2-4&#xD;
