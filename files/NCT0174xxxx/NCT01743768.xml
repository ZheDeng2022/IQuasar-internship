  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway&#xD;
      hyper-responsiveness (respiratory hypersensitivity), airway inflammation, and intermittent&#xD;
      airway obstruction. One of the characteristics of the disease is an inflammatory reaction of&#xD;
      the immune system caused by cytokine production. A substantial number of asthma patients do&#xD;
      not satisfactorily respond to steroid therapy and consequently have an unmet medical need for&#xD;
      novel targeted therapies with improved specificity, tolerability, and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting&#xD;
      early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of asthma. The&#xD;
      transcription factor GATA-3 plays a key role in mediating the asthmatic immune response and&#xD;
      has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the production of cytokines interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The active drug substance of the investigational medicinal product&#xD;
      SB010 is hgd40. SB010 belongs to a new class of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, the&#xD;
      10-23 DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)zymes (antisense oligonucleotide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNAzymes are catalytically active nucleic acids that cleave complementary RNA (ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid) molecules. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA, hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and&#xD;
      thereby reduces key features of allergic airway inflammation. DNAzymes are generated&#xD;
      completely by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)&#xD;
      controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs, i.e. they are not generated by&#xD;
      use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria. The molecules are highly&#xD;
      water-soluble and will be applied as solution directly in their synthesized form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of inhaled SB010 in male&#xD;
      patients with mild asthma.&#xD;

    <description>After 28 days of treatment with SB010 or placebo, patients will undergo allergen bronchoprovocation [allergen challenge (AC)]. The results from AC on Day 28 will be compared to results obtained on Enrolment (Day -1).&#xD;
Allergen for AC will be selected based on skin prick test performed at Screening. The dose of selected allergen will be determined based on skin prick dilution test.&#xD;
After the AC, serial spirometry will be used to assess the influence of inhaled SB010 on the area under the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) curve during the late asthma response (LAR, 4 - 7 hours); measurement time points will be at 4, 5, 6, and 7 hours after AC.&#xD;
The spirometric parameters FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC), obtained during pulmonary function testing, will be used to derive the primary efficacy variable AUC4-7 FEV1.</description>
