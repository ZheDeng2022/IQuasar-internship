  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deferiprone (DFP) is the most extensively studied oral iron chelator to date. It has been&#xD;
      authorised in Europe in 1999 for the treatment of iron overload in patients with&#xD;
      beta-thalassaemia major when DFO is contraindicated or inadequate. Despite a wide experience&#xD;
      of DFP there are limited experimental data available on DFP in children and no&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data in children under 6 years of age. On the basis of the existing data in&#xD;
      adults and adolescent, in the DEEP-1 trial a pharmacokinetic bridging model was developed to&#xD;
      support the dose selection in children aged less than 6 years affected by transfusion&#xD;
      dependent haemoglobinopathies. The study consisted of two phases, namely an experimental&#xD;
      phase, during which patients received a single dose and a modeling phase, during which PK&#xD;
      data obtained after single dose in patients &lt; 6 years of age were analysed in conjunction&#xD;
      with historical PK data in adults and older children and adolescents. The model-based&#xD;
      analysis of the data obtained after single dose enabled the assessment of the dosing regimen&#xD;
      required for the purpose of accurate pharmacokinetic bridging. The ratio between the&#xD;
      predicted systemic exposure parameters (AUC and Cmax) in the target population and reference&#xD;
      group were used as basis for recommendation of the dose in the target population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deferiprone (DFP) was investigated as therapy for children from 1 month to less than 6 years&#xD;
      of age. The study was a multicenter randomised, single blind, and single dose PK study. The&#xD;
      patients were randomised according to a stratification scheme in which three different dose&#xD;
      levels were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of DFP in&#xD;
      paediatric patients aged from 1 month to less than 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify dose levels yielding deferiprone exposures comparable to adults and define&#xD;
           the dose rationale in children aged from 1 month to less than 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate safety and tolerability of deferiprone after single dose administration in&#xD;
           children aged from 1 month to less than 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of demographic covariates on DFP disposition and estimate the&#xD;
           clearance distribution across the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: The primary endpoints of the study were pharmacokinetic and included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  primary PK parameters: CL/F, Vd/F, Ka&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  secondary PK parameters: AUC, Cmax, Tmax, Css and Cmin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints were assessment of clinical safety and tolerability .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty-three patients were enrolled and 18 of those ( 9 males and 9 females)&#xD;
      completed the study. The patients were administered at three dose levels ( 6 patients / each&#xD;
      dose):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 1: 8.3 mg/kg as a single dose (every 8 h) for a total daily dose of 25mg/kg Dose&#xD;
      level 2: 16.7 mg/kg as a single dose (every 8 h) for a total daily dose of 50 mg/kg Dose&#xD;
      level 3: 33.3 mg/kg as a single dose (every 8 h) for a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for PK analysis were taken at 6 sampling time intervals, different depending on&#xD;
      the dose group: predose; in the range 10 -20 min; in the range 40-55min; in the range&#xD;
      1.05-1.15 h;in the range 1.25-5.30 h;in the range 6-8h after the first dose administration.&#xD;
      The concentration of deferiprone was determined by a validated HPLC method. A population PK&#xD;
      model approach was applied and the time course of deferiprone concentrations was analysed&#xD;
      with Nonlinear mixed effects modelling in NONMEM, version 7.2.0. Model building included the&#xD;
      assessment of the influence of relevant demographic covariates (i.e:body weight , age,&#xD;
      height) on the disposition of deferiprone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the pharmacokinetic model developed for the paediatric population in this study in&#xD;
      conjunction with a model previously developed for 55 adult subjects , simulations were&#xD;
      performed to evaluate drug exposure in children below 6 years of age and across a standard&#xD;
      thalassaemic adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were used to summarise adverse events, vital signs and clinical lab&#xD;
      data (haematology, biochemistry and virology)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was found to best describe the&#xD;
      disposition of deferiprone. The choice of three dose levels enable to assess linearity of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic across the dose range. The disposition parameters estimated through the&#xD;
      pop-PK model included CL/F , V/F. In addition to the final model parameter estimates, the&#xD;
      secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were derived based on the individual predicted&#xD;
      concentration vs. time profiles and were summarised per dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight was found to be a good predictor of inter-individual differences in the&#xD;
      population under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As expected from the known safety profile of the drug, no Serious Adverse Events were&#xD;
      observed during the DEEP-1 PK Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the simulation analysis performed, a similar exposure is achieved in adults and&#xD;
      children in terms of AUC and Css when receiving the current dosing regimen both at 75 and 100&#xD;
      mg/kg/day, while a considerable increase in Cmax was observed in children when compared to&#xD;
      the adult population. However, exposure is the parameter related to clinical response rather&#xD;
      than Cmax. Indeed, simulations suggested that a dosing regimen of 25 mg/kg t.i.d. (75&#xD;
      mg/kg/day) is recommended for children aged from 1 month to &lt; 6 years, with the possibility&#xD;
      of titration up to 33.3 mg/kg t.i.d. (100 mg/kg/day), if necessary.&#xD;
