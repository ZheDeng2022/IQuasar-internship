  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the intracoronary transplantation of&#xD;
      autologous mononuclear and CD 133 + bone marrow cells will improve left ventricular&#xD;
      contractile function and will reduce the combined end points after the primary STEMI&#xD;
      (mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was randomized, opened, controlled. 85 patients with the first STEMI were enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients were divided to three groups. On admission all patients were received thrombolytic&#xD;
      therapy by 1,5 million U streptokinase. Transplantation of autologous mononuclear bone marrow&#xD;
      cells (BMMCs) and аutologous CD133 + cells by balloon catheter placed into infarct-related&#xD;
      artery (IRA) was performed at once after stent implantation in 28 patients patients (1st&#xD;
      group) and in 10 patients (2nd group) on the 7-21 days of STEMI. Another 47 patients (3nd&#xD;
      group) undergo only stent implantation into IRA the same day of STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous BMMCs were obtained from bone marrow aspirate by gradient centrifugation.&#xD;
      Echocardiography, Holter monitoring were performed. Plasma concentration of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, 6,8,10), of the growth factors (stem&#xD;
      cell factor - SCF, vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor - HGF,&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor - FGF, insulin-like growth factor - IGF), the number of circulating&#xD;
      CD34 +38-, CD133 +, СD117 +, CD90 +34- stem cells were determined in these patients in the&#xD;
      acute and sub-acute myocardial infarction period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is going 7 years after the beginning of planned to evaluate left ventricular function of&#xD;
      these patients, incidence of cardiovascular end points (death, recurrent myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke) and their combinations, to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      transplantation of autologous BMCs (formation of intra-myocardial tumor or neoplastic&#xD;
      processes of other sites) after 7 years from the beginning of study.&#xD;
