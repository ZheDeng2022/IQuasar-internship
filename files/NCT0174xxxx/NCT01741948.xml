  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been reports in the medical literature demonstrating a link between the&#xD;
      development of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), a sexual pain disorder, and hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptive (HC) use. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the prevalence of HCs&#xD;
      induced PVD among a HC na√Øve population, to evaluate which of the components of the HCs are&#xD;
      associated with a higher risk of the development of PVD, and to evaluate which clinical and&#xD;
      genetic factors predispose the patient to HCs induced PVD. Assessments will be made through&#xD;
      patient questionnaires, physical examinations, and blood tests. Microarray techniques will be&#xD;
      employed to characterize, on a global level, the gene expression profiles of women who&#xD;
      develop PVD in comparison to those who do not develop PVD. Patients will be followed for a&#xD;
      year. Results will be used to develop a larger clinical trial.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), previously called vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, is clinically&#xD;
      defined as chronic, unexplained, vulvar pain or discomfort, confined to the vulvar vestibule,&#xD;
      in response to contact or pressure. As a result, women with PVD experience pain on sexual&#xD;
      intercourse, and many patients also have pain in response to non-sexual activities. The&#xD;
      actual prevalence of PVD is unknown, but current evidence indicates that the lifetime&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of vulvodynia approaches 15%. Currently, PVD is thought to be the&#xD;
      leading cause of dyspareunia in premenopausal women. Once a woman with PVD develops the&#xD;
      syndrome, symptoms may last for years; as a result, PVD has a profound effect on women's&#xD;
      sexuality and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of PVD is usually made by assessing for the presence of the modified&#xD;
      Friedrich's criteria. These criteria consist of 1) a history of vulvar pain, dyspareunia or&#xD;
      pain with tampon insertion, 2) tenderness of the vestibule when being touched with a&#xD;
      cotton-tip applicator, and 3) no other identifiable cause for the pain (such as vaginitis,&#xD;
      dermatitis etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of this condition remains unknown. Proposed causes include chronic inflammation,&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy, genetic, immunologic and\or hormonal factors, infection, psychological&#xD;
      disorders, sexual dysfunction, or disturbance in the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of developing PVD secondary to hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptive (HC) usage. The relative risk of developing PVD seems to rise with an increased&#xD;
      duration of HCs use (at least up to 2-4 years of use), first use of HCs at a young age (&lt;16&#xD;
      years), and the hormonal composition of HCs, specifically the progestogenic, estrogenic, and&#xD;
      androgenic potency of the pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mechanisms of action have been suggested for HCs induced PVD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alteration of vestibular hormonal receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alterations of the morphological pattern of the vestibular mucosa(13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alteration of serum free hormones levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the actual prevalence of HCs induced PVD in a prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate which of the components contained in the HCs (oral contraceptives,&#xD;
           transdermal patch, vaginal ring) are associated with higher risk of HCs induced PVD,&#xD;
           specifically; the dose of ethinyl estradiol (15, 20 and 30 mcg) and the progesterone&#xD;
           component.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate which factors predispose the patient to HCs induced PVD. We will analyze&#xD;
           both clinical (age, age at menarche, length of use, body mass index etc.), hormonal (E2,&#xD;
           testosterone etc.) and altered gene expression factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a preliminary investigation aimed at estimating the rate of HCs induced&#xD;
      PVD. The data from this study will enable the determination of the number of patients needed&#xD;
      to obtain statistical significance in a future, larger study regarding patients' risk factors&#xD;
      for developing PVD and HCs formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this pilot study the investigators will evaluate 200 patients and follow them for a total&#xD;
      of 1 year after HC initiation. Since this is a novel study that has not been investigated,&#xD;
      nor is there available statistics in the medical literature, the investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that 200 patients will provide enough data regarding incidence of PVD development secondary&#xD;
      to HCs use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions and measures to be used to diagnose HC induced PVD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. New onset of vulvar pain suggestive of PVD, i.e. symptoms of pain on vaginal penetration&#xD;
           (insertional dyspareunia and/or pain with tampon insertion), following initiation of&#xD;
           HCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On exam, tenderness localized within the vestibule when being touched with a cotton-tip&#xD;
           applicator. The exam will be performed on defined points of the labia minora, labia&#xD;
           majora and the vestibule in 5 defined points (1,5,6,7,11), with patients reporting pain&#xD;
           verbally by a rating scale of 0 to 10 at each point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No identifiable cause for the pain, such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, desquamative&#xD;
           inflammatory vaginitis (DIV), herpes, dermatitis or vulvar dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame for completion: The investigators anticipate one year for patients' enrollment and&#xD;
      another year for follow up. Data analysis and microarray analyses will be done during the&#xD;
      third year. Data should be available within 3 years of study initiation.&#xD;
