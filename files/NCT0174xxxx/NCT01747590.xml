      The primary goal of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects functional&#xD;
      neuroimaging study is to examine the extent to which the hypnotic zolpidem decreases brain&#xD;
      activity in regions of the brain known to process emotional information. Although zolpidem is&#xD;
      an effective sleep-aid, its ability to engender anti-anxiety effects is equivocal, yet&#xD;
      promising. Zolpidem's activity during tasks that engage anxiety-related processes in the&#xD;
      brain will be compared to that of the known anxiolytic drug alprazolam, a positive comparator&#xD;
      caffeine, and placebo. A secondary goal of this study is to compare the subjective drug&#xD;
      effects, or how individuals feel, following the interventions. These measures will be used to&#xD;
      determine the existence of brain-behavior relationships, thus demonstrating that imaging is&#xD;
      an important tool for informing us about how drugs produce their effects in the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZs) and related drugs commonly are prescribed for treating anxiety and&#xD;
      sleep disorders. Their clinical utility is based on their behavioral effects which are&#xD;
      attributed to positive allosteric modulation of the GABA-A receptor. Multiple subtypes of the&#xD;
      GABAA receptor exist, and recent research has focused on understanding the role of&#xD;
      BZ-sensitive GABAA receptors (i.e., receptors containing alpha-1, alpha-2, alpha-3, and&#xD;
      alpha-5 protein subunits) in the behavioral effects of BZ-type drugs. Results from a body of&#xD;
      work suggests that the anxiolytic or anti-anxiety effects of BZ-like drugs likely involve&#xD;
      alpha-2- and/or alpha-3-containing GABAA receptors, while their sedative-like effects are&#xD;
      attributable to alpha-1GABAA receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to BZs, the BZ-like hypnotic zolpidem exhibits relative selectivity for alpha-1GABAA&#xD;
      receptors. Although this selectivity is believed to underlie its superior hypnotic ability,&#xD;
      zolpidem's ability to engender anxiolytic-like effects has been inconsistent. Zolpidem's&#xD;
      primary effects should not include anxiolysis given its preference for interacting with&#xD;
      alpha-1GABAA receptors and their abundant distribution in sensorimotor cortex and&#xD;
      extrapyramidal motor areas relative to the more enriched distribution of the other receptor&#xD;
      subtypes throughout the limbic system, anterior thalamus, and caudate nucleus. However, in&#xD;
      the amygdala, a brain region that has been shown to be intricately involved in&#xD;
      anxiety-related neuronal processes, high levels of alpha-1 GABAA receptors as well as alpha-2&#xD;
      and alpha-3GABAA receptors are expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the anxiety-related processes typically studied empirically, the ability to recognize&#xD;
      emotion is an important proxy for psychopathology. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the&#xD;
      ability to process emotional stimuli requires coordinated activity between the amygdala,&#xD;
      insula, and prefrontal cortical regions. Individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders&#xD;
      exhibit an impaired ability to recognize facial emotion, which has been associated with&#xD;
      aberrant amygdala activation. Importantly with respect to pharmacological manipulation of&#xD;
      anxiety-related brain function, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies&#xD;
      examining the neural correlates of emotional processing by employing acute challenge with&#xD;
      potent anxiolytics have demonstrated significant reductions in the blood oxygen&#xD;
      level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the amygdala and insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study outlined in this protocol is to demonstrate drug-induced&#xD;
      differences in limbic activation during an fMRI-based emotional face recognition task&#xD;
      following acute administration of zolpidem, alprazolam, and the positive control caffeine in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Although zolpidem may exhibit a similar behavioral pharmacological&#xD;
      profile to the conventional BZs in many instances, its relative GABAA receptor selectivity&#xD;
      distinguishes it from its non-selective counterparts. Thus it is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      anxiolytic alprazolam (1 mg) will reduce the BOLD response to emotional faces within the&#xD;
      amygdala and insula similar to other anxiolytics (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam, and pregabalin),&#xD;
      while the hypnotic zolpidem (10 mg) will not cause such a reduction. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      further that because adenosine receptors have been localized to the amygdala and caffeine has&#xD;
      been shown to be anxiogenic, an acute challenge with a moderate dose of caffeine (200 mg)&#xD;
      will enhance the BOLD response in the amygdala and/or insula during the face recognition&#xD;
      task. The data that will be collected in this aim will provide the first in vivo brain&#xD;
      imaging evidence for different actions based on the different GABAA receptor pharmacological&#xD;
      profiles of zolpidem and alprazolam, and will support their clinical roles in the treatment&#xD;
      of insomnia and anxiety, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this project is to collect information regarding the subjective drug&#xD;
      effects of each of the four interventions. This information, in conjunction with data showing&#xD;
      how each treatment affects brain activity, permits the visualization of the neurobiological&#xD;
      substrates of drug action. For instance, in a previous study we found that zolpidem-induced&#xD;
      increases in self-reported ratings of &quot;like&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, and intoxication were related to&#xD;
      increased brain activity in specific limbic networks. Our data were consistent with those&#xD;
      areas shown previously to undergo hemodynamic or metabolic alterations in association with&#xD;
      the subjective states of intoxication following administration of cocaine, alcohol, and&#xD;
      hydromorphone, and they speak to a body of literature implicating limbic, paralimbic, and&#xD;
      mesocortical regions in mediating the actions of psychotropic drugs. Because alprazolam is&#xD;
      known to possess more abuse potential in general, results from the present study may confirm&#xD;
      our previous findings while also demonstrating that investigating pharmacological effects on&#xD;
      brain activity may help identify the neural correlates of drug action and behavior, thereby&#xD;
      revealing the functional significance of GABAergic modulation on intrinsic brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 12 healthy normal drug-na√Øve volunteers will be enrolled at McLean Hospital to&#xD;
      participate in this 5-visit (1 screening visit, 4 study visits) double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study. Participants will be between 21 and 40 years of age, they can be&#xD;
      either male or female, and there are no restrictions regarding ethnic background.&#xD;
      Participants will have no past or current neurological or psychiatric disorders (including&#xD;
      any substance abuse and/or dependence), no family history of alcoholism, no medical&#xD;
      conditions that could affect drug disposition, and they will not be taking any medications.&#xD;
      Participants also cannot have any MRI scanning contraindications (including pregnancy). They&#xD;
      must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will visit the laboratory for a screening visit during which s/he will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form, and undergo both physical and psychiatric exams. The second, third,&#xD;
      fourth, and fifth visits will involve pre-study assessments, a standard breakfast,&#xD;
      questionnaire sets, drug treatment, one scanning session, and lunch. After a baseline period&#xD;
      during which participants will answer computerized questionnaires, they will receive a study&#xD;
      medication (zolpidem [10 mg], alprazolam [1 mg], caffeine [200 mg], or placebo) and then&#xD;
      answer the questionnaires. At 60-min post-medication, participants will be positioned within&#xD;
      the scanner, and while in there they will perform tasks, blood pressure/heart rate will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously, and an eye-tracking device will assess if their eyes are open. The&#xD;
      scanning session will last approximately 1 hr, and it will be followed by hourly&#xD;
      questionnaires sets until 6-hrs post-medication. Participants will take a taxicab home at&#xD;
      that time. The entire visit will last approximately 8 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exhaustive screening procedure ensures that participants entering the study have no&#xD;
      contraindicating conditions. All procedures are performed by experts specifically trained in&#xD;
      their respective areas to minimize risks, discomfort, and adverse events. Participants are&#xD;
      well informed of the potential risks of the study. The informed consent form is detailed and&#xD;
      explicit. Participants are provided with unlimited time to read the consent and study&#xD;
      personnel review it in detail before participants sign. In addition, participants have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions before, during, and after consent and at any time during the&#xD;
      study. Participants can earn up to a total of $500 for completing the study.&#xD;
