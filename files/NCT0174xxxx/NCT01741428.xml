      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been established that the major risk factors of coronary artery disease are modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors. The international Case control study across 52 countries has identified that&#xD;
      90% of the risk of acute myocardial infarction in males and 94% in females were modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors as smoking habits, presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abdominal&#xD;
      obesity, psychological and social stress and hyperlipidemia (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that interventions to promote physical activity and dietary changes&#xD;
      could have beneficial effect in the reduction of incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD)&#xD;
      (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that for persons on medium to high risk of CHD an early&#xD;
      intervention using lifestyle and drugs over a period of three years can reduce the patients&#xD;
      risk to develop CHD as estimated by risk score and some established risk factors of CHD as&#xD;
      secondary surrogate end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major End Point&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the major end point change in NORRISK Score (3) a systematic review of the literature to&#xD;
      estimate sample size for a power estimate was done in association with a pilot study to&#xD;
      estimate the variability of the score. The outcome variable is difference in risk score&#xD;
      between baseline and three years follow-up. Considering the analysis of the pilot study, the&#xD;
      investigators estimated the variability of the score difference (delta) of NORRISK to be&#xD;
      standard deviation = 6.18%. As the median age of this sample was 51 years it is considered a&#xD;
      change in the probability of ten years cardiovascular death of 1.5% to be clinically&#xD;
      interesting. For a power of 90% and a type-I error of 5% the study will need two times 358&#xD;
      patients. Accepting a 10% dropout in the actual population, the corrected sample size will be&#xD;
      two times 394. A total of 800 patients, two times 400, could be enough to pinpoint&#xD;
      substantial risk change between baseline and three years follow-up for the NORRISK score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have done an extensive research of the literature as far the effect of&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention on different surrogate end points as change in Systolic Blood Pressure&#xD;
      (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), weight in kg, change in waist circumference in cm&#xD;
      and change in TG, HDL-, LDL- Cholesterol, and HBA1C. (4, 5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the literature the estimated change between baseline and one year of intervention are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in weight for the intervention is - 4.2kg (SD=5.1) and in percent - 4.75 %&#xD;
           (SD=5.4). For the control group it is - 0.8 kg (SD=3.7) and - 0.9% (SD=4.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in waist circumference in cm for the intervention is - 4.4 cm (SD=5.2) for the&#xD;
           control - 1.3 cm (SD=4.8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in serum lipid in mg/dl:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol mg/dl for the intervention - 5mg/dl (SD=2.8) for the control - 1.3 mg/dl (SD=2.8)&#xD;
      HDL in mg/dl for the intervention 2 mg/dl (SD=7) for the control 1 mg/dl (SD=6) TG in mg/dl&#xD;
      for the intervention -18 mg/dl (SD=51) and intervention -1 mg/dl (SD=60) d) Change in BMI in&#xD;
      percent after one year for the intervention group -6.7% and the control -1.4% according to&#xD;
      (6))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering those figure from the literature for a power of 80% and a type - I error of 5%&#xD;
      the investigators will need the following minimum sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in weight in kg 2*27 = 54 patients, in percent 2*48 = 96 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in SBP and DBP in mmHg:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBP mmg 2*207 = 414 patients DBP mmg 2*318 = 636 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in BMI in percent 2*214 = 428 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in Triglycerides (TG) 2*169 = 338 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial there will surely be enough power with a sample size of' 2*220 = 440&#xD;
      patients for the major surrogate outcomes except for changes in Cholesterol and HDL. As the&#xD;
      intervention time is longer than three years instead of one year, those power estimates could&#xD;
      under estimate the &quot;de facto&quot; power at the end of the three years observation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All persons who are selected from the general practitioner physician (GP) offices in all&#xD;
      Norway. This study use the NORRISK Score (3), a new guideline for prevention of&#xD;
      CardioVascular Disease (CVD) that includes calculation of total risk. This new risk model&#xD;
      based on updated Norwegian data, as the European SCORE function, overestimates the risk of&#xD;
      fatal CVD in Norway. NORRISK for 10-year CVD mortality is presented. It includes gender, age,&#xD;
      smoking and levels of systolic blood pressure and serum total Cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten - year risk estimates calculated from NORRISK fall between SCORE high- and low risk&#xD;
      estimates and increase strongly with age. Very few persons below 50 years of age have a 10 -&#xD;
      year risk above 5% (European limit for high risk). More than half of men aged 60 years have&#xD;
      estimated risks above this limit, while only 7% of 60-year-old women exceed the limit. Even&#xD;
      if the risk limit is reduced to 1% for younger age groups, very few women below 50 years of&#xD;
      age have risks above the limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NORRISK is more adapted to the current situation in Norway than the SCORE model and may be a&#xD;
      useful and relevant tool in Norwegian clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to intervention or usual care. Randomization will be in permuted&#xD;
      block randomization with utilization of concealed opaque envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information&#xD;
&#xD;
      At randomization the patient receives verbal and written information about the study. This&#xD;
      information will be repeated verbally. The patients sign a formula &quot;Consent to participate&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      The committee may look into the database during the study to assess data quality and to&#xD;
      evaluate the quality of end points. If necessary the inclusion period or follow up time could&#xD;
      be prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      All case report forms (CRF) will be kept for the analysis in Feiring Heart Clinic before&#xD;
      their introduction to the database electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CRF's are checked centrally for validity and completeness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disclosure of data and publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information obtained as a result of the study will be regarded confidential until&#xD;
      appropriate analysis and review is performed. The results will be published and presented&#xD;
      internationally. As far authorship and contribution, the investigators will follow the&#xD;
      recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editor&#xD;
      (ICMJE)(www.ICMJE.org). After publication of the initial report, participating investigators&#xD;
      may prepare and publish sub analysis. All sub studies must be approved by the steering&#xD;
      committee. All participant investigators will be acknowledged by name in the main&#xD;
      publication.The recommendations of the STROBE group will be followed all the way (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in the study are insured in accordance with the official Norwegian&#xD;
      insurance regulations.&#xD;
