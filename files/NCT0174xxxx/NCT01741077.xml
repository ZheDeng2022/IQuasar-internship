  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine whether or not physical changes or&#xD;
      adaptations occur in response pregnancy or to the higher intakes of folic acid from&#xD;
      supplementation typically consumed during the reproductive period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Higher folate requirements during pregnancy to support growth and development are well&#xD;
      established but it is unknown what metabolic changes occur in 1-carbon metabolism to provide&#xD;
      sufficient nucleotides for DNA/RNA synthesis. Periconceptual folic acid (FA) supplementation&#xD;
      and fortification of the food supply have been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancies with&#xD;
      neural tube defects but conversely expose women to high FA intakes for extended periods of&#xD;
      time. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to establish if physiological adaptations&#xD;
      occur in folate metabolism in response to pregnancy or higher intakes of FA typically&#xD;
      consumed among women during the reproductive period. A convenience sample of thirty-two women&#xD;
      (n=8/group) were recruited to compare the total concentrations and forms of folate&#xD;
      (tetrahydrofolate [THF], 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF and 5, 10-methenylTHF) in red blood cells&#xD;
      in four groups: a) pregnant women (PW, 30-36 weeks gestation) taking 1.0 mg of FA b)&#xD;
      non-pregnant women (NPW) taking 0 mg of FA c) NPW taking 1.0 mg FA and d) NPW taking 5.0 mg&#xD;
      FA. Blood samples were taken at a single time point and compared across groups. Total red&#xD;
      blood cell concentrations were measured using both microbiological assay and liquid&#xD;
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis. LC/MS/MS analysis was used to&#xD;
      determine folate form concentrations.&#xD;
