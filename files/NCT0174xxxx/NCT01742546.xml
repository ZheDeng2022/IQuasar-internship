      To assess the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound combine transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (TENS) and therapeutic ultrasound in treatment of myofascial pain syndrome in&#xD;
      upper trapezius muscle measured by mean change between pre and post treatment of pressure&#xD;
      pain threshold (PPT), patient's complaint in pain intensity and the number of total tablet&#xD;
      usage of acetaminophen in both groups.&#xD;

      Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal pain and&#xD;
      can affect any skeletal muscles in the body.Myofascial pain is not fatal condition but it can&#xD;
      significant reduced quality of life and is a major cause of time lost from work. There are&#xD;
      various treatments, which divided into invasive and non-invasive therapies. In the recent&#xD;
      clinical practice, there is a new type of combine treatment unit which composes of&#xD;
      electrotherapy and ultrasound therapy in one unit. However, there is no conclusive evidence&#xD;
      for supports the effectiveness of this combine therapy compare with the conventional&#xD;
      ultrasound in treatment of myofascial pain especially in aspect of pain relief.&#xD;

    <description>Use therapeutic ultrasound with simultaneous TENS for 10 minutes/session for 10 sessions/course.&#xD;
The therapeutic ultrasound machine in this study was Sonopuls 492 TM (Enraf-Nonius), this device has treatment head described by the manufacturers as having surface area as 5.8 cm2, ERA (Effective Radiating Area) of 5.0 cm2 and BNR (Beam Non-uniform Ratio) as max. 5.0. For electrotherapy unit which composes of 2 channels, output characteristics are constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV), resolution of output signal is in steps of 0.2 mA and timer is limited to 30 minutes during ultrasound and combination therapy are operated.</description>

    <description>Use ultrasound treatment parameters as continuous mode, 1 MHz in frequency and 1 w/cm2 for intensity and circular stroking of sound head over affected upper trapezius muscle throughout treatment period. For simultaneous TENS parameters as pulse frequency 100-150 pps, pulse duration 50- 80 Âµs and adjust amplitude as produce tingling for 10 minutes. The skin electrode should be placed near the active trigger in area of trapezius muscle. And the control group received sham TENS by turn-off electrical current.&#xD;
