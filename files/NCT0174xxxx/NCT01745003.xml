      The main goal of this Collaborative Proposal is to investigate biochemical, functional, and&#xD;
      structural neuroimaging changes following non-invasive brain stimulation in patients with&#xD;
      chronic widespread pain: fibromyalgia (FM). The fact that multiple therapeutic modalities&#xD;
      which focus on central mechanisms provide modest relief for these patients raises the&#xD;
      possibility that the cause for the chronicity of this debilitating disorder may lie within&#xD;
      the brain itself. We propose that changes in the cortical milieu may result from prolonged&#xD;
      experience of pain and suffering. Our previous results suggest changes in excitatory&#xD;
      neurotransmitter levels, connectivity between multiple brain networks, and cortical thickness&#xD;
      coincide within central neural loci related to pain perception and modulation in FM.&#xD;
      Interestingly, modulation of cortical activity can be achieved noninvasively by a novel tool,&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which has been reported to produce lasting&#xD;
      therapeutic effects in chronic pain, especially FM. We propose to study the long-term effects&#xD;
      of tDCS application on multiple levels of the central nervous system in FM patients. This&#xD;
      project has significant clinical relevance and has the support of collaborators from&#xD;
      University of Michigan and Harvard University&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Fibromyalgia (FM):&#xD;
&#xD;
                *Fibromyalgia is the second most common rheumatologic disorder, behind&#xD;
                osteoarthritis, afflicting 2-4% of the population of industrialized&#xD;
                countries.(Jacobsen and Bredkjaer, 1992; Wolfe et al., 1990) To fulfill the&#xD;
                criteria for FM established by the American College of Rheumatology in 1990, an&#xD;
                individual must have both chronic widespread pain involving all four quadrants of&#xD;
                the body (and the axial skeleton), and the presence of 11 of 18 pre-defined &quot;tender&#xD;
                points&quot; on examination. A positive tender point is identified when an individual&#xD;
                complains of pain when approximately four kilograms of pressure is applied to one&#xD;
                of these points by an examiner. FM is the prototypical &quot;central&quot; or&#xD;
                &quot;non-nociceptive&quot; pain syndrome. Research performed within the past decade has&#xD;
                clarified a number of important issues regarding this condition. Multiple studies&#xD;
                suggest neurological dysfunction as a hallmark of this disease (Clauw and Crofford,&#xD;
                2003), and this is supported by a number of objective functional neuroimaging&#xD;
                abnormalities. (Gracely et al., 2002; Harris et al., 2007; Mountz et al., 1995)&#xD;
                Overall the data suggest that the primary abnormality in FM is a generalized&#xD;
                disturbance in central nervous system pain processing, leading individuals to sense&#xD;
                pain throughout the body in the absence of inflammatory or patho-anatomic damage.&#xD;
                (Clauw and Chrousos, 1997; Yunus, 1992) Most FM neuroimaging studies to date have&#xD;
                examined brain responses to a painful stimulus, as the imaging of endogenous&#xD;
                chronic pain is notoriously difficult. (Baliki et al., 2007). However few studies&#xD;
                have examined the modulation of specific brain regions and how this impacts&#xD;
                neurotransmitter levels, network connectivity, and structural changes such as&#xD;
                cortical thickness within the same subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS):&#xD;
&#xD;
                *Therapies that directly modulate brain activity in specific neural networks might&#xD;
                be particularly suited to relieve chronic pain in individuals with FM. Ultimately,&#xD;
                this underlies the interest in neurostimulation approaches, which are being&#xD;
                explored at multiple levels of the neuroaxis, including the peripheral nerves,&#xD;
                spinal cord, deep brain structures, and cortex.(Lefaucheur, 2004) Among the methods&#xD;
                of central neurostimulation, two of them, repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
                stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are&#xD;
                particularly appealing as they can change brain activity in a non-invasive,&#xD;
                painless and safe way. TMS is a method of brain stimulation that was developed in&#xD;
                1985 (Barker et al., 1985). It is based on a time-varying magnetic field that&#xD;
                generates an electric current inside the skull where it can be focused and&#xD;
                restricted to small brain areas by appropriate stimulation coil geometry and&#xD;
                size.(Pascual-Leone et al., 1999). This current, if applied repetitively,&#xD;
                repetitive TMS (rTMS), induces a cortical modulation that lasts beyond the time of&#xD;
                stimulation.(Pascual-Leone et al., 1999) Although tDCS has different mechanisms of&#xD;
                action, it induces similar modulatory effects. Several animal studies in the 1960s&#xD;
                showed that this technique changes brain activity reliably (Nitsche et al., 2003a,&#xD;
                2003b). tDCS is based on the application of a weak direct current to the scalp that&#xD;
                flows between two relatively large electrodes-anode and cathode. Some studies have&#xD;
                shown that the efficacy of tDCS depends critically on parameters such as electrode&#xD;
                position and current strength.(Nitsche et al., 2003a, 2003b) In fact, application&#xD;
                of tDCS for 13 min to the motor cortex can modulate cortical excitability for&#xD;
                several hours.(Nitsche and Paulus, 2000; Nitsche and Paulus, 2001) In addition,&#xD;
                this technique can be used to obtain clinical gains in neuropsychiatric disorders&#xD;
                such as stroke and epilepsy.(Fregni and Pascual-Leone, 2007) In this study we will&#xD;
                investigate the modulatory effect of 5 daily tDCS sessions on biochemical,&#xD;
                functional, and structural systems and its association with the clinical output in&#xD;
                FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (H-MRS) in FM:&#xD;
&#xD;
                *H-MRS neuroimaging obtains chemical spectra from multiple volume-image elements,&#xD;
                or voxels, within the human brain using radiofrequencies that excite protons. (Ross&#xD;
                and Sachdev, 2004) Specific molecules are identified by their characteristic&#xD;
                resonance frequency in the spectrum. Once acquired, spectra are analyzed to&#xD;
                determine the relative concentrations of different molecules or central nervous&#xD;
                system metabolites within the voxel or region of interest. Typical metabolites&#xD;
                identified are: glutamate (Glu), N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline&#xD;
                (Cho), lactate, lipid, myoinositol, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamine&#xD;
                (Gln). Glu and GABA are of particular importance to brain neurophysiology as they&#xD;
                are components of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, respectively. Glu&#xD;
                binds to both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors located on postsynaptic neurons&#xD;
                and causes excitability (i.e. depolarization). Moreover changes in the strength of&#xD;
                Glu neurotransmission are typically indicative of synaptic plasticity, a process&#xD;
                proposed to be involved in chronic pain.(Zhuo, 2008) H-MRS methods display multiple&#xD;
                features which are amenable to longitudinal studies. High-resolution anatomical&#xD;
                scans can be used to isolate identical brain regions on successive sessions that&#xD;
                are even weeks apart. Measurement of metabolites within the central nervous system&#xD;
                has been largely understudied in the field of pain. Grachev et al. has reported&#xD;
                that the level of NAA, a marker for neuronal viability and also function (Nakano et&#xD;
                al., 1998; Sager et al., 2001), is lower within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
                of individuals with chronic low back pain as compared to healthy controls.(Grachev&#xD;
                et al., 2000) In addition, a recent investigation has begun to implement H-MRS&#xD;
                technology to assess functional changes in the concentrations of Glu in response to&#xD;
                evoked pain stimuli.(Mullins et al., 2005) Mullins et al. have observed that Glu&#xD;
                levels increase by as much as 10% in the anterior cingulate in response to cold&#xD;
                pain applied to the foot. Glu in the central nervous system may play a role in FM&#xD;
                pathophysiology. A study by Peres et al. found that cerebrospinal fluid levels of&#xD;
                Glu were elevated in FM patients possibly having consequences for glutamatergic&#xD;
                neurotransmission.(Peres et al., 2004) Administration of ketamine, a glutamate&#xD;
                channel blocker, has been found to reduce experimental pain (Graven-Nielsen et al.,&#xD;
                2000) and clinical pain (Cohen et al., 2006) in FM. Moreover our group recently&#xD;
                demonstrated that long-term treatment of FM patients with acupuncture can lead to&#xD;
                changes in Glu levels within the posterior insula and that these changes are highly&#xD;
                correlated with changes in pain: greater reductions in Glu are associated with&#xD;
                greater reductions in both experimental and clinical pain (Harris et al., 2008). In&#xD;
                addition, we have recently compared posterior insula Glu and combined Glu + Gln&#xD;
                (Glx) between FM patients and matched controls and have demonstrated that the&#xD;
                patients have elevated Glx (and Glu) levels. (Harris et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Resting state networks (RSNs) in FM:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Previous studies have found that in a task-free state (i.e. rest scan),&#xD;
                     multiple distributed brain areas demonstrate temporal correlation of the fMRI&#xD;
                     signal or &quot;functional connectivity&quot; in low frequency ranges.(Biswal et al.,&#xD;
                     1995; Fransson, 2005) In one of the first such studies, Biswal et al. found a&#xD;
                     significant correlation in resting fMRI signal from sensorimotor cortices of&#xD;
                     opposite hemispheres.(Biswal et al., 1995) This resting state network (RSN)&#xD;
                     has been referred to as the sensorimotor network, or SMN. (Beckmann et al.,&#xD;
                     2005) FM pain is somatic in localization (usually soft tissue), hence resting&#xD;
                     connectivity in the SMN may demonstrate increased connectivity to the pain&#xD;
                     processing regions. Other RSNs have also been described, including one&#xD;
                     anatomically consistent with the Default Mode Network (DMN) (Greicius et al.,&#xD;
                     2003) [for review see (Buckner and Vincent, 2007; Vincent et al., 2007)]. This&#xD;
                     network involves brain regions putatively engaged in self-referential&#xD;
                     cognition that is &quot;deactivated&quot; (more active at rest than during a task state)&#xD;
                     during a variety of externally focused task conditions. Typically, the DMN&#xD;
                     (Figure 1) includes the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (~BA 40, 39), the&#xD;
                     posterior cingulate cortex (~BA 40, 39), the posterior cingulate cortex (~BA&#xD;
                     30, 23, 31) and precuneus (~BA 7), areas of the inferior, medial and superior&#xD;
                     frontal gyri (~BA 8, 9, 10, 47), the hippocampal formation, and the lateral&#xD;
                     temporal cortex (~BA 21)(Buckner and Vincent, 2007). Resting fluctuations in&#xD;
                     the DMN have demonstrated decreased connectivity in Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
                     (Greicius et al., 2003) and increased connectivity in depression (Greicius et&#xD;
                     al., 2004), compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, resting state&#xD;
                     connectivity in the DMN has also been shown to change in response to an&#xD;
                     intervention or task.(Waites et al., 2005) Waites et al. found increased&#xD;
                     connectivity between the middle frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate (a&#xD;
                     component of the DMN) in resting fMRI data following an active (cognitive)&#xD;
                     task. While the functional significance of spontaneous fluctuations in the DMN&#xD;
                     remains controversial, Fox and Raichle suggest that resting connectivity in&#xD;
                     the DMN is fundamental to balancing excitatory and inhibitory inputs to&#xD;
                     multiple brain networks, thereby setting the &quot;gain&quot; for future task-related&#xD;
                     response. (Fox and Raichle, 2007) Positive correlations in fMRI signal refer&#xD;
                     to putatively excitatory connections whereas negative correlations imply&#xD;
                     putative inhibitory connectivity. We propose that application of tDCS with&#xD;
                     decrease connectivity in the pain matrix regions that may result in a change&#xD;
                     within the gain set by the DMN for brain processing within the pain matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. White (WM) and Gray Matter (GM) Plasticity in Fibromyalgia:&#xD;
&#xD;
                *The cortical mantle is a highly specialized, folded structure composed of a thin&#xD;
                layer of GM. Abnormal variations in the thickness of the cortical mantle might&#xD;
                reflect pathophysiological changes of intrinsic structure and integrity of the&#xD;
                cortical laminae. Recently, some studies have shown this correlation in chronic&#xD;
                pain diseases such as back pain (Apkarian et al., 2004), migraine (DaSilva et al.,&#xD;
                2007b; Granziera et al., 2006) and trigeminal neuropathic pain (see preliminary&#xD;
                data). The implications of an alteration in these diseases are either degenerative&#xD;
                processes or neuroplasticassociated mechanisms. Apkarian and colleagues (Apkarian&#xD;
                et al., 2004) found reduction in the gray matter of DLPFC of chronic back pain&#xD;
                patients when compared to healthy controls using a volumetric based approach. More&#xD;
                recently, such GM volume reduction was also found in the parahippocampus, and&#xD;
                cingulate cortex of patients with fibromyalgia when compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
                However, it seems that similar changes observed in the GM of fibromyalgia patients&#xD;
                may be more related to comorbid affective disorders than the pain endurance (Peres&#xD;
                et al., 2004; Wood et al., 2009). Using more sensitive and reliable neuroimaging&#xD;
                tools in trigeminal neuropathic pain patients our group found cortical thickness&#xD;
                changes that were spatially co-localized with functional allodynic (brush induced&#xD;
                pain) activation. In addition, this pattern of concurrent structural and functional&#xD;
                changes in chronic pain patients is influenced by somatotopic localization&#xD;
                (sensorimotor cortex), known functionality of the specific region&#xD;
                (sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational), underline&#xD;
                activation/deactivation following allodynic stimulation and the duration of the&#xD;
                disorder (see preliminary data). In another study of migraine patients, we found&#xD;
                increased cortical thickness of caudal sensorimotor cortex in migraineurs compared&#xD;
                to controls (DaSilva et al., 2007a). In the cortical mantle, the thickness changes&#xD;
                in the sensory cortex could be due to the chronic sensory stimulation provoked by&#xD;
                chronic pain. This is in line with a recent study that showed cortical thickening&#xD;
                after sustained stimulation of the motor system (Draganski et al., 2004). In this&#xD;
                study, volunteers who have learned to juggle showed transient and selective&#xD;
                thickening of the motor cortex, as well as the motion-visual areas (MT/V5), as&#xD;
                compared to the pre-learned phase. This suggests that overstimulation of the&#xD;
                sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational neuronal systems in chronic pain&#xD;
                may induce structural alterations in the cortex that is co-localized with&#xD;
                inefficient pain modulation by the opioidergic system at a molecular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Evaluation of Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls (DNIC):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  There is a body of evidence that suggests that the spontaneous pain and&#xD;
                     hyperalgesia associated with CMI is due to a dysregulation of intrinsic&#xD;
                     analgesic systems. The most well known intrinsic analgesic system is the&#xD;
                     endogenous opioid system, which appears to function normally in CMI. Another&#xD;
                     system, termed DNIC (Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls), is characterized by&#xD;
                     widespread analgesia evoked by a noxious stimulus applied to anywhere on the&#xD;
                     body, such as tourniquet ischemia, or immersion of in painfully hot or cold&#xD;
                     water. The widespread nature of the DNIC effect, involving convergent second&#xD;
                     order neurons and a spinal-brain loop, is consistent with the diffuse&#xD;
                     widespread pain of CMI disorders such as FM. The results of several studies&#xD;
                     suggest that DNIC may be altered in CMI. Lautenbacher and Rollman observed&#xD;
                     that DNIC evoked by hot water immersion decreased the sensitivity to painful&#xD;
                     electrical stimuli in healthy control subjects but had no effect in patients&#xD;
                     with FM. Marchand [unpublished observations] has reported a similar effect&#xD;
                     using immersion of an arm in painfully hot water as both the conditioning and&#xD;
                     pain stimulus. This method shows an effect of DNIC on pain ratings in healthy&#xD;
                     controls but no effect in FM. Kosek and Hansson found that the DNIC&#xD;
                     manipulation of tourniquet ischemia decreased the sensitivity to painful&#xD;
                     pressure in control subjects but not in patients with FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the pain and&#xD;
                     tenderness in FM may be due to tonically inactive DNIC analgesic systems.&#xD;
                     These results, however, do not specify causality and could also represent a&#xD;
                     mechanism in which DNIC is tonically activated in CMI in response to the&#xD;
                     widespread ongoing pain of the disease. These alternative mechanisms cannot be&#xD;
                     separated using conventional psychophysical tests. Performing the tests in the&#xD;
                     fMRI scanner will differentiate these mechanisms because in one case the DNIC&#xD;
                     system remains &quot;OFF&quot; in the patient populations, in the other case the DNIC&#xD;
                     system is constantly &quot;ON.&quot; fMRI analysis of activity in brainstem regions&#xD;
                     (e.g., caudal medulla) implicated in intrinsic DNIC analgesia will provide&#xD;
                     evidence for tonic ON or OFF activity in these regions, and in addition&#xD;
                     further specify the neuroanatomical locus of this abnormal pain processing.&#xD;
                     The fMRI analysis will provide crucial evidence of whether FM results from a&#xD;
                     DNIC defect or whether the DNIC abnormality is simply one of the signs of the&#xD;
                     disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RATIONALE (proposed research, and potential benefits to patients and/or society):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. There is not much information about FM disease and treatment options available.&#xD;
                This study seeks to gain a better, more wholesome understanding about Fibromyalgia.&#xD;
                People who suffer from this disease experience constant, chronic pain; which&#xD;
                ultimately results in absence from school, work, etc. If a feasible treatment is&#xD;
                available for Fibromyalgia sufferers, they will have an increase in life&#xD;
                satisfaction and the bio-power (people able to work and perform more tasks) will&#xD;
                increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SPECIFIC AIMS (Research Objectives):&#xD;
&#xD;
           a.The main goal of this Collaborative Proposal is to investigate biochemical,&#xD;
           functional, and structural neuroimaging changes following non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
           in patients with chronic widespread pain: fibromyalgia (FM). Additionally, we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           *Determine the effects of tDCS on the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu) within&#xD;
           the insula (posterior and anterior) and thalamus in individuals with FM. Glu levels&#xD;
           within the insula and thalamus will be reduced following tDCS, reflecting a down&#xD;
           regulation of excitatory neurotransmission in these pain regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigate whether long-term therapy with tDCS normalizes gray matter thickness in&#xD;
                target and cortical areas associated with pain perception and modulation in FM.&#xD;
                Cortical thickness in FM patients, will return to comparable age- and sex-matched&#xD;
                pain-free control participant levels following tDCS. These effects will be&#xD;
                specifically detected in pain modulatory regions (e.g. dorsal lateral prefrontal&#xD;
                cortex) of FM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explore the effects of long-term tDCS on intrinsic connectivity between pain&#xD;
                processing and modulatory regions and other brain networks (e.g. default mode&#xD;
                network, sensory motor network) in FM. Our preliminary data suggest that FM&#xD;
                patients display enhanced connectivity between various pain processing regions and&#xD;
                the default mode network, a specific brain network that is active during periods of&#xD;
                inactivity. We propose that tDCS will decrease connectivity between pain modulatory&#xD;
                regions and other networks such as the default mode network thus resulting in a&#xD;
                reduction in pain symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RECRUITMENT METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a.Potential subjects will be recruited by public advertisement in the School of&#xD;
           Dentistry clinics, including MCOHR, and the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center in&#xD;
           addition to other University of Michigan clinics. They will also be recruited via&#xD;
           UMClinicalStudies.org, the DaSilva lab webpage (with a flyer for the study listed under&#xD;
           current research), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. In&#xD;
           addition, subjects may be recruited by the PI or study staff in a private setting. The&#xD;
           potential subject's healthcare providers will be able to suggest the availability of the&#xD;
           study and inform them of a place where they will be able to find more information about&#xD;
           participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. This study requires a total of 15 visits, broken down by the following: 1 baseline&#xD;
                visit, 3 MRI visits, 10 tDCS testing visits, and 1 final follow-up/debriefing&#xD;
                visit. Patient participant will last for a total of 5 consecutive weeks. During&#xD;
                this time, we will be collecting clinical and psycophysical evaluation: the MRI&#xD;
                photo imaging, DNIC/MAST pain tolerance data (computerized), and pain&#xD;
                questionnaires (verbal), Quantitative Sensory Test (QST).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. No drugs will be administered during this study&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Devices used will include: MRI, tDCS, MAST/DNIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. RISKS/DISCOMFORT:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. While these therapies are non-invasive, study participants may experience&#xD;
                unpleasantness from the constant stimulus from the MAST/DNIC procedures; however,&#xD;
                the pressure is not enough to cause any damage to the nail bed. The study&#xD;
                participant is encouraged to inform the researchers of any discomfort/side effects&#xD;
                they experience during any point of the study as the priorities of the research&#xD;
                team is to keep the study participant safe. With regards to the tDCS testing, the&#xD;
                participant may experience a temporary tingling sensation and minor skin&#xD;
                irritation/redness as a result of the brain stimulation pads&#xD;

        The inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women who have met American College of Rheumatology (1990) criteria for the diagnosis&#xD;
             of FM (Wolfe, Smythe et al. 1990) for at least 1 year. To fulfill the criteria for FM&#xD;
             established by the American College of Rheumatology in 1990, an individual must have&#xD;
             both chronic widespread pain involving all four quadrants of the body (and the axial&#xD;
             skeleton), and the presence of 11 of 18 pre-defined &quot;tender points&quot; on examination. A&#xD;
             positive tender point is identified when an individual complains of pain when&#xD;
             approximately four kilograms of pressure is applied to one of these points by an&#xD;
             examiner&#xD;
&#xD;
