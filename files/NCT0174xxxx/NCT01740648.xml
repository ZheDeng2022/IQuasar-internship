    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib when given together&#xD;
      with fluorouracil and radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      rectal cancer. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving trametinib&#xD;
      together with fluorouracil and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller&#xD;
      and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximally tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of trametinib to be&#xD;
      used in combination with 5FU (fluorouracil) and radiation in patients with rectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine a recommended phase II dose of trametinib to be used with 5FU chemoradiation&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluation of the tolerability and safety of the combination of trametinib and 5-FU&#xD;
      chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluation of post-therapy pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluation of the rate of local control, disease-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Analysis of biomarkers - total mutations in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene&#xD;
      homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1(BRAF), and neuroblastoma RAS&#xD;
      viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS), as well as RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)&#xD;
      and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene&#xD;
      homolog 1 (AKT) pathway signaling pathways to potentially correlate with clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -14 to -10 and 1-38 and&#xD;
      fluorouracil intravenously (IV) continuously 5 days a week from days 1-38. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week on days 1-33. Patients then undergo surgery 6-10&#xD;
      weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving negative surgical margins after complete resection of tumor receive&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV&#xD;
      continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15 OR oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and&#xD;
      then annually for 3 years.&#xD;
