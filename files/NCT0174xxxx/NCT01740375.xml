    <textblock>
      To investigate the role of esophagectomy in complete responders to preoperative&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      either observation or esophagectomy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, patients will be reassed and visited to&#xD;
      multidisciplinary clinic, then, randomized to either observation or esophagectomy.&#xD;
