  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of long-term&#xD;
      infusion of lyophilized landiolol (LDLL600) against esmolol (Brevibloc) by measurement of&#xD;
      blood concentrations of landiolol, esmolol and their metabolites, and by monitoring systemic&#xD;
      cardiovascular and local tolerability, blood pressure (BP), ECG including heart rate (HR) and&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      12 subjects will be administered LDLL600 and Brevibloc in a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      cross-over setting. PK, systemic cardiovascular and local tolerability and safety of 24-hour&#xD;
      long infusions of three dose levels of both Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) during&#xD;
      each treatment period will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment period will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 1 (LOW) for 2 hours (h) Dose level 2 (MEDIUM)for 2 hours Dose level 3 (HIGH)for 2&#xD;
      hours PK and tolerability observation at dose level 3, 2 or 1 will be continued for 18 hours&#xD;
      in order to end up with a total infusion period of 24 h Post-infusion follow-up (FU)for 6&#xD;
      hours after infusion termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the wash-out period between treatment periods will be at least two days. Each&#xD;
      subject, if confirmed eligible, will complete two treatment periods in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of poor tolerability, alternative dosing schemes will be followed.&#xD;
