    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Dovitinib(TKI258) in patients&#xD;
      with castration resistant prostate cancer after failure of docetaxel-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Further correlative study for metabolic response using PET image and change in serum&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor 23(FGF23) will be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growth factor signals are important in carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer, and&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factors (FGF) have important roles in this regard. FGF ligands (FGF1, -2,&#xD;
      -6, -8, and -17) and FGF receptors (FGFR1 and FGFR4) have all shown to be significantly&#xD;
      overexpressed in prostate cancer1-5. And, the recent studies have demonstrated that the&#xD;
      critical roles of the FGF family members are mediated by the signaling between epithelial and&#xD;
      stromal compartments, thus, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)6,7. Moreover, a&#xD;
      recent study has shown that FGF-2 is a mediator of second wave angiogenesis and tumor&#xD;
      progression in men during the formation of castration-resistant tumors. Therefore, inhibition&#xD;
      of signaling via FGF axis might be a viable strategy for the treatment of&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TKI258, an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor is known to potently&#xD;
      inhibit the class III, IV, and V RTKs, showing biochemical 50 percent inhibitory&#xD;
      concentration(IC50) values &lt;20 nmol/L for VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3); the&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β); fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3 (FGFR-1,2,3); fetal liver tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT-3); and KIT Ret, tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase A (TrkA), and csf-1 RTKs. Due to the unique inhibitory activity on FGF pathways,&#xD;
      TKI258 has shown significant activity in a variety of tumor xenograft models in athymic mice,&#xD;
      including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and colon- and prostate-derived models9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) are one of the challenges in oncology practice.&#xD;
      Although there have been advances in chemotherapy10, new hormonal agents11, and&#xD;
      immunotherapeutics12, patients in this subgroup still have limited life expectancy.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets and clinical development&#xD;
      of target agents for the treatment of CRPC. For this end, sorafenib has been tested in&#xD;
      multiple phase II studies earlier13-17; however, the clinical efficacy was very limited. The&#xD;
      low efficacy of sorafenib might be partly explained by the lower potency in inhibition of&#xD;
      RTKs. Considering nanomolar concentration range of IC50 for TKI258 compared with micromolar&#xD;
      concentration for other multi-TKIs, the efficacy of TKI258 should be evaluated in CRPC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
