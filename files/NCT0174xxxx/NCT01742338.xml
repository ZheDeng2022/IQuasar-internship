  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a long-lasting lung disease usually caused by&#xD;
      long-term smoking. COPD can get worse, making people sick enough to need hospitalization.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are very effective and are almost always used, but nobody knows the right&#xD;
      dose. High doses may work better but could cause more side effects than low doses. Typical&#xD;
      treatment lengths last at least one week. This study will be comparing two common regimens:&#xD;
      either 40mg of corticosteroids daily (low dose), or 80mg of corticosteroids daily (high&#xD;
      dose). It is unknown which regimen works better..&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of the study is to determine whether a high-dose corticosteroid regimen in patients&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital with COPD exacerbations is associated with better clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and at acceptable risk of adverse effects compared to a low-dose corticosteroid regimen. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that high-dose corticosteroids is associated with a decreased rate of treatment&#xD;
      failure, shorter length of hospital stay, and improved quality of life with similar risk of&#xD;
      adverse effects. The study population includes patients ≥ 40 years-old with a ≥ 10 pack-years&#xD;
      smoking history and a diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis who present to the&#xD;
      emergency room with increased dyspnea, increased sputum, or increased cough that requires&#xD;
      admission to the hospital. We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to&#xD;
      determine if a high-dose corticosteroid regimen, which is already in use in clinical&#xD;
      practice, decreases treatment failure compared to a low-dose corticosteroid regimen that is&#xD;
      based on national consensus guidelines.&#xD;
