  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Scotland and the Western World.&#xD;
      Approaches to improve the identification of vulnerable or ruptured coronary atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaques are urgently needed to help risk stratification, to identify patients for intensive&#xD;
      therapies, and to provide novel biomarkers for the development of anti-atherosclerotic drug&#xD;
      interventions. Using positron emission tomography, we have recently shown that sodium&#xD;
      18-fluoride uptake holds major promise as a novel marker of plaque vulnerability and rupture.&#xD;
      Here we wish to characterise coronary atherosclerotic plaque using 128-multidetector computed&#xD;
      tomography combined with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and sodium 18-fluoride positron emission&#xD;
      tomography and Virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound in 80 patients with stable and&#xD;
      unstable coronary artery disease. This has the potential to provide an innovative and highly&#xD;
      valuable translational model with which to test novel therapeutic interventions targeted at&#xD;
      reducing atheroma and plaque rupture. This could have major implications for the future&#xD;
      treatment of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients with ACS have focal 18F-NaF uptake and high tissue to background ratio(TBR) and standardised uptake values (SUV) in the culprit vessels.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 month of index event</time_frame>
    <description>Using PET/CT, the investigators will assess if there is presence of focal uptake at the areas of plaque ruptures in patients presenting with ACS. Standardised uptake values and Tissue to Background ratios of the culprit vessels with be compared with non-culprit lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Using VH-IVUS, the investigators will look at the morphological characteristics of plaques that have higher SUVs and TBRs. Additional information about the plaque characteristics will be derived from CT coronary angiogram</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Is there a co-relation between the two PET/CT tracers(18FDG and 18F NaF) as measured as Tissue to background ratio or standardised uptake value.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Is there a difference between the coronary and aortic TBR/SUVs in stable and unstable patients</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will look for differences in activity in stable angina and ACS patients using 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG</description>

    <measure>Will patients with higher 18F-NaF uptake as measured by SUV/TBR will have higher levels of cardiac biomarkers such as hsCRP or Troponin</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Blood collected from volunteers in the study will be analysed for inflammatory biomarkers such as hsCRP and Troponin</description>

        The investigators will recruit two populations of 40 patients each. The first population&#xD;
        will be patients with known stable coronary heart disease. They will have previously&#xD;
        documented and angiographically proven coronary artery disease (≥70% luminal stenosis of a&#xD;
        major epicardial vessel). The second population will be patients with a recent (within 30&#xD;
        days) acute myocardial infarction defined by the Universal definition of myocardial&#xD;
        infarction. The culprit plaque will be defined according to the invasive coronary angiogram&#xD;
        appearances, electrocardiogram and clinical features by two cardiologists blinded to the&#xD;
        results of positron emission tomography.&#xD;
