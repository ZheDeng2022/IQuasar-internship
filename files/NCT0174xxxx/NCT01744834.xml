  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall goal of this study is to scrutinize the relation of learning behavior and related&#xD;
      brain activity to the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers aim is to characterise a representative sample (200 men at age 18) with&#xD;
      regard to learning parameters and their respective neural correlates which are thought to be&#xD;
      indicators for the risk to develop an alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a large multi-center study on alcohol dependency (in Dresden &amp; Berlin, Germany)&#xD;
      the researchers will characterize the sample and then prospectively assess alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and development of AUDs over a period of three years plus additional follow-ups&#xD;
      after that period, depending on future funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other hypotheses it is expected that increased activation of striatal and prefrontal&#xD;
      brain regions by the Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer process is related to increased risk&#xD;
      of developing an AUD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are extremely prevalent in&#xD;
      industrialized countries, affecting about 6 million individuals in Germany alone. The onset&#xD;
      of most cases occurs during adolescence and early adulthood. Therefore, targeted prevention&#xD;
      would be desirable especially in young people who are at high risk to develop AUDs. Since our&#xD;
      knowledge about predisposing factors is limited, this project aims to identify mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying liability for dysfunctional alcohol consumption (i.e. hazardous alcohol use,&#xD;
      alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence). Based on the hypothesis that addiction is a disorder&#xD;
      due to aberrant learning, the researchers expect that inter-individual differences in&#xD;
      learning behavior should be associated with liability for as well as resiliency against AUD.&#xD;
      To test the hypotheses, the researchers will characterize 200 men at age 18, and then&#xD;
      prospectively assess alcohol consumption and development of AUDs over a period of three&#xD;
      years. At baseline, the researchers will study three clusters of predictive variables: (i)&#xD;
      individual learning parameters, estimated by computational modeling of behavioral performance&#xD;
      in learning tasks such as Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, probabilistic reversal&#xD;
      learning, and habitization-devaluation; (ii) individual neural correlates of learning,&#xD;
      assessed by functional brain imaging during learning; and (iii) already established risk&#xD;
      factors such as family history of alcoholism and impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to test a set of related hypotheses. The researchers assume that high&#xD;
      risk for AUD at baseline (cross-sectional design), increase of alcohol consumption after 3&#xD;
      years and incidence or progression of AUD during follow-up (prospective data) will be&#xD;
      associated with decreased reward sensitivity, decreased punishment sensitivity, increased&#xD;
      Pavlovian approach behavior ('sign tracking'), increased 'go' effect of conditioned&#xD;
      appetitive stimuli, increased habitization, increased activation of striatal and prefrontal&#xD;
      brain regions by the Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer process, decreased correlation&#xD;
      between striatal brain activity and prediction error during reversal learning.&#xD;
