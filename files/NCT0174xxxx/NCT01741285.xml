    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that extra-fine particle treatment with HFA-QVAR will be superior in improving&#xD;
      small airways dysfunction, especially in ex-smokers and smokers with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this, we will perform a study comparing the efficacy of extra-fine particle&#xD;
      HFA-QVAR 200 µg b.i.d. to an equipotent dose of course particle HFA-beclomethasone&#xD;
      (HFA-Clenil) 400 µg b.i.d. and with coarse particle HFA-fluticasone (GSK) 250 µg in&#xD;
      ex-smokers and smokers with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study will be an open-label, randomised, three-way cross-over, two-center&#xD;
      study. 20 smokers and 20 ex-smokers with asthma will receive the following treatments for two&#xD;
      weeks:&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far, most clinical studies investigating the effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in&#xD;
      asthma have concentrated on non-smoking asthmatics. However, a considerable proportion of&#xD;
      asthma patients smokes. Cigarette smoke consists of ultra-fine particles with a diameter&#xD;
      between 0.1 and 1 µm and therefore reaches even the smallest airways. In line with this, it&#xD;
      has been reported that smoking is associated with small airways dysfunction. The latter may&#xD;
      help to explain the observation that treatment with course particle inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
      is less effective in smokers with asthma. Recently, extra-fine particle aerosols such as&#xD;
      hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone (HFA-QVAR) have become available for the treatment of&#xD;
      asthma, which are more likely to reach the smaller airways. Based on the above, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that extra-fine particle treatment with HFA-QVAR will be superior in improving&#xD;
      small airways dysfunction, especially in ex-smokers and smokers with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To perform a study comparing the efficacy of extra-fine particle HFA-QVAR 200 µg&#xD;
      b.i.d. to an equipotent dose of course particle HFA-beclomethasone (HFA-Clenil) 400 µg b.i.d.&#xD;
      and with coarse particle HFA-fluticasone (GSK) 250 µg in ex-smokers and smokers with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open-label, randomised, three-way cross-over, two-center study. 20&#xD;
      smokers and 20 ex-smokers with asthma will receive the following treatments for two weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period A: 2-week treatment with HFA-QVAR (TEVA Pharma) 200 μg b.i.d. Treatment&#xD;
      period B: 2-week treatment with HFA-Clenil (Chiesi) 400 μg b.i.d. Treatment period C: 2-week&#xD;
      treatment with HFA-Fluticasone (GlaxoSmithKline) 250 μg b.i.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 smokers and 20 ex-smokers with asthma, aged 18-65 years, will receive the following&#xD;
      treatments for two weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: 2-week treatment with HFA-QVAR (TEVA) 200 μg b.i.d. B: 2-week treatment with HFA-Clenil&#xD;
      (Chiesi) 400 μg b.i.d. C: 2-week treatment with HFA-Fluticasone (GlaxoSmithKline) 250 μg&#xD;
      b.i.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary end-parameter is the decrease in peripheral&#xD;
      airways resistance (R5-R20) at the provocative dose of small particle adenosine causing the&#xD;
      Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) to drop with 20%. The co-primary end-parameter&#xD;
      is the PD20 small particle adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will attend 7 visits to the outpatient clinic. At baseline and after treatment,&#xD;
      the following investigations will be performed: PC20AMP, PD20 small particle adenosine,&#xD;
      spirometry, IOS, body plethysmography, blood collection, filling in of questionnaires, and&#xD;
      nasal epithelial brushings.&#xD;
