  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-coronary adenosine or sodium&#xD;
      nitroprusside (SNP) delivered selectively via a thrombus aspiration catheter (or if&#xD;
      unsuccessful via a coronary microcatheter) following thrombus aspiration in Primary&#xD;
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (P-PCI) reduces microvascular obstruction (MVO) parameters&#xD;
      and infarct size as measured with cardiac MRI, compared with standard treatment following&#xD;
      thrombus aspiration in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &gt;100,000 patients suffering STEMI present in the UK each year. P-PCI in the UK is increasing&#xD;
      exponentially. In 2004 there were &lt;1500 P-PCI and in 2007 and 2008 these figures had&#xD;
      increased to 5902 and 9224 respectively (BCIS database).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although P-PCI delivered quickly is more effective than thrombolysis, the efficacy of this,&#xD;
      essentially mechanical, technique is limited by the unpredictable phenomenon of no-reflow and&#xD;
      the under-stated lesser degrees of MVO. As more UK centres adopt P-PCI the dilemma of how to&#xD;
      attenuate MVO will remain. Currently there is no consensus on the optimal management to&#xD;
      prevent or attenuate MVO particularly when thrombus laden lesions are treated with P-PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is divergent clinical practice, even within institutions, in the UK and worldwide. This&#xD;
      is because there is no solid evidence base to inform clinicians. The current options for&#xD;
      interventional cardiologists are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routinely aspirate thrombus and give IC vasodilator during the intervention but only in&#xD;
           high burden thrombus formation lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform a standard P-PCI only and then give IV vasodilator if angiographic no-reflow&#xD;
           develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routinely consider that angiographically silent MVO (i.e a grade below true &quot;no-reflow&quot;)&#xD;
           may have important impact on infarct size and clinical outcome and treat&#xD;
           prophylactically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few if any clinicians follow this thinking. Indeed, it appears impossible to predict the&#xD;
      incidence of (no-reflow/MVO) from the presenting angiogram (pre- or post- wire or balloon)&#xD;
      and it can be argued that irrespective of thrombus burden it would be better to undertake&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment in all patients, following the use of aspiration catheter, with&#xD;
      delivery of agents able, in theory at least, to reduce (angiographically undetectable) MVO.&#xD;
      Several studies of IC adenosine or SNP have shown favourable effects in attenuating MVO.&#xD;
      However, the size of effect with either drug and whether indeed there is a difference between&#xD;
      them in reducing MVO and infarct size is undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of our proposed study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether adjunctive pharmaco-therapy at time of P-PCI and following thrombus aspiration,&#xD;
           reduces CMR-determined MVO and infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether there is a difference between adenosine and SNP in reducing CMR-detected MVO and&#xD;
           infarct size, both given selectively and distally via a thrombus aspiration catheter or&#xD;
           a coronary microcatheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The correlation of angiographic, including the recently designed computer-assisted&#xD;
           myocardial blush quantification 'Quantitative Blush Evaluator'(QuBE), and other&#xD;
           myocardial perfusion markers, with CMR detected MVO and infarct size, as well as with&#xD;
           clinical outcome (MACE) at 30 days.&#xD;
