      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the occlusive heat patch&#xD;
      for the treatment of verrucae (warts).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that causes verrucae, or warts, on the skin,&#xD;
      particularly of the distal extremities, and lesions of the mucous membranes. Warts are highly&#xD;
      prevalent, occurring in up to 13% of the general population and in around 25% of otherwise&#xD;
      healthy children. About 67% of warts resolve spontaneously within two years; however more&#xD;
      than 25% will persist for many years, some resulting in pain or dysfunction and some&#xD;
      imparting significant psychosocial problems. Localized hyperthermia (warming) has been&#xD;
      reported to be effective in the treatment of HPV-induced warts for nearly two decades. A&#xD;
      novel method of treating warts with heat is the use of an occlusive patch that contains a&#xD;
      mixture of chemicals (ferric chloride), which in the presence of oxygen reacts to generate&#xD;
      reproducible thermal warming of the skin to a temperature of 42-43ºC for at least two hours.&#xD;
      The heat is believed to alter the immune response and kill the HPV virus in the wart tissue.&#xD;

    <description>Efficacy will be determined by the percent reduction in verruca diameter (Lesion Measurement). A severity grade will be given to the target and control warts using the Investigator Global Improvement Score (IGIS). IGIS scale scores are as follows: 4 = Same or worse, 3 = Minimal Improvement, 2 = Marked Improvement, 1 = Almost Clear, 0 = Clear.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or non-pregnant female 5 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written consent (adults) and written assent (minors).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a minimum of two clinically diagnosed verrucae 4 cm in diameter or less&#xD;
             in a similar treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to apply the occlusive heat patch(s) as directed,&#xD;
             comply with study instructions and return to the clinic for required visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use an effective form of birth&#xD;
             control for the duration of the study (abstinence, stabilized on oral contraceptives&#xD;
             or contraceptive patches for at least three months, implant, injection, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, NuvaRing®, condom and spermicidal or diaphragm and spermicidal). Abstinence is&#xD;
             an acceptable form of birth control for subjects who are not sexually active. Subjects&#xD;
             that become sexually active during the trial must agree to use an effective,&#xD;
             non-prohibited form of birth control for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are immunocompromised for any reason or are known to be HIV+ based on&#xD;
             medical history taken at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have used any anti-verruca treatments within 4 weeks. These include but&#xD;
             are not limited to topical salicylic acid preparations, imiquimod (Aldara),&#xD;
             podophyllin containing preparations, surgical procedures, immunotherapy, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;

             their assessment of their verrucae.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any underlying disease(s) or a dermatological condition of the affected&#xD;
             area(s) that requires the use of interfering topical or systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with verruca, for treatment, that are located in the periungual, genital, or&#xD;
             head regions or have mosaic warts.&#xD;
&#xD;

             from prior therapy in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unable to communicate or cooperate with the Investigator due to&#xD;
             language problems, poor mental development, or impaired cerebral function.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of allergy or sensitivity to any of the components or the&#xD;
             patches (including the adhesives).&#xD;

          -  Subjects who are currently enrolled in a clinical drug or device research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been treated with another investigational device or drug within 30&#xD;
             days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
