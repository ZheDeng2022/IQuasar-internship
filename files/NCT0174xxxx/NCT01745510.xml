  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid is effective in&#xD;
           the prevention or reducing severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm&#xD;
           neonates &lt; 1500 g at birth who are starting enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if NEC is prevented, this study will measure whether hospital stay is also reduced in&#xD;
           neonates who receive Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Preterm neonates with birth weight less than 1500 g are in higher risk to develop NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NEC is an inflammatory condition that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Is the medical urgency most frequent of gastrointestinal tube that requires&#xD;
                neonatal intensive care&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. may perforate infant´s bowel requiring surgery from 20% to 60% of the cases&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. may cause infant's death in 20% to 42% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. has no adequate treatment worldwide, therefore prevention is needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DHA by enteral feeding has been administrated by our research group to attenuate&#xD;
           inflammatory response in septic and surgical neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our results showed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. lower Interleukin(IL)-1 beta in septic neonates, but in surgical neonates, they&#xD;
                also showed less IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1ra, after&#xD;
                adjusting by confounders&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. increased weight, length and fat mass gain in septic neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. decreased organic failures in surgical neonates, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. lower stay at neonatal intensive care in surgical neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHA has not been used as unique intervention at a high but physiological dose; in addition,&#xD;
      our previous results found an anti-inflammatory effect in neonates.Therefore, we expect that&#xD;
      preterm infants may have a reduced bowel inflammatory response and lower NEC events and or&#xD;
      severity&#xD;
