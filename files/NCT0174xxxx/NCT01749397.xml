      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together&#xD;
      with floxuridine in treating patients with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal cavity, or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Veliparib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as floxuridine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving veliparib together with floxuridine may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) and&#xD;
      intraperitoneal (IP) floxuridine in adult patients with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal&#xD;
      or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the adverse event profile associated with this treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess for preliminary evidence of efficacy, such as tumor responses, of the treatment&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 and floxuridine when given in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess whether the presence of mutations in the homologous recombination pathway or loss&#xD;
      of expression of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components correlates with response to&#xD;
      floxuridine + ABT-888.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 and floxuridine IP on&#xD;
      days 3-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Disease confined to the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal cavity; Note: nodal&#xD;
             disease below the diaphragm, implants adherent to the surface of the liver or&#xD;
             intrahepatic lesions will not be exclusionary; patients remain eligible if all&#xD;
             intrahepatic tumor is debulked or ablated by the time treatment is initiated&#xD;
&#xD;
