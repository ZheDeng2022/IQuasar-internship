  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to quantify the loss of in vivo biological&#xD;
      potency of a depigmented polymerized (DPP) allergenic cat epithelial extract versus the&#xD;
      native allergenic extract (N).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different concentrations of three different cat epithelial allergenic extracts,&#xD;
      together with a positive and negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride and a&#xD;
      glycerated phenol saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every subject on the volar&#xD;
      surface of the forearm.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in the study only if all of the following criteria&#xD;
        are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject (and/or legal representative, where applicable) has given written, signed&#xD;
             and dated informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of either sex and of any race or ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years and &lt; 60 years on the day of inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive clinical history of allergy to cat epithelia (i.e., rhinitis, conjunctivitis,&#xD;
             rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, urticaria, etc. ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive prick-test (mean diameter of papule ≥ 3 mm or area of papule ≥ 7 mm2) with&#xD;
             a commercial extract of cat epithelium. The results of the prick-test will be valid if&#xD;
             they were obtained in the year prior to inclusion of the subject in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive specific IgE test (&gt; 0.70 KU/l) for cat epithelium. The results of the IgE&#xD;
             test will be valid if they were obtained in the year prior to inclusion of the subject&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will NOT be eligible for inclusion in the study if any of the following criteria&#xD;
        are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunotherapy in the last 5 years involving allergens known to be able to interfere&#xD;
             with the test allergen (e.g., cat extract).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs that can interfere with the skin response before and during the study&#xD;
             (e.g., antihistamines), within the intervals established in section 9.1 and appendix&#xD;
             1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any of the following medicines: tricyclic or tetracyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants or MAOIs (Monoamine oxidase inhibitors), beta-blockers or chronic use&#xD;
             of oral corticosteroids or use of corticosteroids via either the oral or the&#xD;
             parenteral route in repeated and intermittent dosing regimens (&gt; 10 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women and women with a positive pregnancy test in visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dermographism affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to the&#xD;
             study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to&#xD;
             the study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urticaria affecting the skin of the test site, in either of the two visits to the&#xD;
             study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant immune system diseases (both autoimmune disorders and immune&#xD;
             deficiencies). (Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hypothyroidism well controlled through&#xD;
             thyroid hormone therapy does not necessarily represent a contraindication. Graves'&#xD;
             disease (hyperthyroidism) would be an exclusion criterion due to the potential risk in&#xD;
             the event adrenaline must be used.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious uncontrolled diseases that may increase the safety risk of the subjects&#xD;
             participating in the study, including but not limited to the following: heart failure,&#xD;
             serious or uncontrolled respiratory diseases, endocrine disorders, clinically relevant&#xD;
             liver or kidney diseases, or haematological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patents with diseases or conditions that limit adrenaline use (coronary disease,&#xD;
             severe arterial hypertension, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious psychiatric, psychological or neurological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medication, alcohol or illegal drug abuse in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other clinical trial during the 30 days (or 5 times the&#xD;
             biological half-life of the investigational product - whichever is longest) prior to&#xD;
             inclusion of the subject in this study.&#xD;
