      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Influenza (flu) is a virus that causes people to get sick. Most of the time, the flu causes&#xD;
      only a mild illness, but some people can become seriously ill or even die from it. Currently,&#xD;
      some pills and inhaled powders can be used to treat the flu, but they only make flu symptoms&#xD;
      end about a day sooner. More treatment choices for the flu are needed, especially for those&#xD;
      who become seriously ill. Researchers want to test a new drug, AVI-7100, that might keep a&#xD;
      person who takes it from having a more serious case of the flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how healthy adult volunteers tolerate the AVI-7100 anti-influenza drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers of normal weight between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. A heart function test will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have either AVI-7100 or a placebo infusion. They will not know which&#xD;
           infusion they have. . Participants will stay at the clinical center for a total of 8&#xD;
           hours after the infusion. Blood samples will be collected 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after the&#xD;
           end of the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return on Days 1, 2, 4, 10, and 28 after receiving the drug. Blood and&#xD;
           urine samples will be collected. A heart function test will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a second part of the study that is separate from the first one. Additional&#xD;
           people will receive either AVI-7100 or placebo to test their reactions to a specific&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite currently available antivirals, influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (estimated 36,000 deaths each year in the United States alone). More agents are needed in the&#xD;
      armamentarium of anti-influenza medications including novel mechanisms of action and&#xD;
      parenteral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety of a novel RNA based therapeutic AVI-7100. Beginning with&#xD;
      a low single-dose, subjects are randomized to receive either AVI-7100 or placebo and&#xD;
      evaluated on Study Days 0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 28. The safety and tolerability is evaluated using&#xD;
      symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, ECG, and pharmacokinetics. Utilizing a series of&#xD;
      stopping rules and a medical monitor, the dose will be escalated as safety and tolerability&#xD;
      are established. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established in the first part of&#xD;
      this study (either limited by adverse effects or up to maximum anticipated dose), the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of multi-dose administration will begin (replicating anticipated clinical&#xD;
      use). Subjects again are randomized to either AVI-7100 or placebo daily for 5 days, and&#xD;
      evaluated on Study Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 32. The dose used in the multi-dose&#xD;
      cohorts will also be escalated as safety and tolerability are established.&#xD;
