  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of acute and chronic coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. Aspirin was the first such therapy to prove its benefits in acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Compared to aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, a&#xD;
      thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitor, has been demonstrated to reduce adverse event rates among&#xD;
      patients with acute coronary syndromes (with or without ST-segment elevation) and those&#xD;
      receiving intracoronary stents. In the Triton-TIMI 38 trial a novel thienopyridine,&#xD;
      prasugrel, was compared to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Although prasugrel significantly reduced recurrent&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, bleeding rates were increased and no improvement in cardiac or&#xD;
      all-cause mortality was demonstrated. However, in 2009, the authors of the PLATO trial&#xD;
      demonstrated an unexpected cardiovascular mortality benefit with ticagrelor over clopidogrel,&#xD;
      an endpoint not previously met by any other antiplatelet agent against an active comparator.&#xD;
      Based on the reproducible adverse events seen in the DISPERSE, DISPERSE-2, and PLATO trials,&#xD;
      an adenosine-mediated effect of ticagrelor is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor produces&#xD;
      pharmacologic ischemic preconditioning, an undescribed potential off-label property of&#xD;
      ticagrelor that could represent a plausible mechanism for its effects on cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
