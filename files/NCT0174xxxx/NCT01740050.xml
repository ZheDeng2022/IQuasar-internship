    <textblock>
      While exposure to an obesogenic environment has increased for almost every individual in&#xD;
      western society, not everyone is equally susceptible to overeating and not everyone becomes&#xD;
      obese. Teasing apart the physiological underpinnings of those individual seemingly&#xD;
      protective- differences may contribute to the development of successful preventive measures&#xD;
      and treatment. Neuroimaging studies started to deliver important insights into the&#xD;
      neuroanatomical determination of individual eating behavior. However, food intake is not only&#xD;
      determined by the brain, but is orchestrated by an interaction of peripheral hormones with&#xD;
      neural circuits and decision-making processes. This interactive axis is also referred to as&#xD;
      the gut-brain axis. While individual aspects of the axis have been studied extensively,&#xD;
      detailed insight in the interaction of gut and brain in the regulation of food intake is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The current study aims to investigate the effect of a) caloric restriction (very&#xD;
      low calorie diet (VLCD)); b) caloric restriction with mechanical restriction (Laparoscopic&#xD;
      adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)); and c) caloric restriction with mechanical restriction&#xD;
      and physiological changes through malapsorption (Roux- en- Y bypass (RYGB) surgery) on&#xD;
      gut-brain interactions to find an optimal balance for weight loss and long-term sustained&#xD;
      weight maintenance.&#xD;

      Rationale: While exposure to an obesogenic environment has increased for almost every&#xD;
      individual in western society, not everyone is equally susceptible to overeating and not&#xD;
      everyone becomes obese. Teasing apart the physiological underpinnings of those individual&#xD;
      seemingly protective- differences may contribute to the development of successful preventive&#xD;
      measures and treatment. Neuroimaging studies started to deliver important insights into the&#xD;
      neuroanatomical determination of individual eating behavior. However, food intake is not only&#xD;
      determined by the brain, but is orchestrated by an interaction of peripheral hormones with&#xD;
      neural circuits and decision-making processes. This interactive axis is also referred to as&#xD;
      the gut-brain axis. While individual aspects of the axis have been studied extensively,&#xD;
      detailed insight in the interaction of gut and brain in the regulation of food intake is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The current study aims to investigate the effect of a) caloric restriction (very&#xD;
      low calorie diet (VLCD)); b) caloric restriction with mechanical restriction (Laparoscopic&#xD;
      adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)); and c) caloric restriction with mechanical restriction&#xD;
      and physiological changes through malapsorption (Roux- en- Y bypass (RYGB) surgery) on&#xD;
      gut-brain interactions to find an optimal balance for weight loss and long-term sustained&#xD;
      weight maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In a repeated measures design a total of 45 obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 ≤&#xD;
      45) study participants will be investigated. All participants will undergo a weight loss&#xD;
      period of 10% of initial body weight by means of VLCD intervention (n=15), RYGB surgery&#xD;
      (n=15) or LAGB surgery (n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population is composed out of people qualifying for a surgical&#xD;
      weight loss procedure (RYGB or LAGB). A total of 45 obese (BMI &gt; 35 ≤ 45) study participants&#xD;
      between age 18 and 60 will be investigated Intervention: One subject group (n=15) will&#xD;
      undergo a diet intervention, which consists of a very low calorie diet (VLCD; Modifast)&#xD;
      containing 2.1MJ/d for 1 to 2 months, until they lost 10% of their initial body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will be compared with 2 other weight loss groups; one group will undergo&#xD;
      RYGB surgery and one group will undergo LAGB surgery. However, these surgical procedures will&#xD;
      proceed as planned and according to the standard clinical practice, and will in no way be&#xD;
      changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: To determine the optimal interaction of gut hormones and&#xD;
      brain activity for successful weight loss and sustained weight maintenance this study will&#xD;
      examine the effect of interaction of gastrointestinal hormone release on neural network&#xD;
      activation through a) caloric restriction; b) caloric restriction with physiological&#xD;
      restriction; and c) caloric restriction with malapsorption on food reward processing and&#xD;
      decision making in the brain as well as on gastrointestinal hormone release.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main parameters contributing to efficient, effective and satisfactorily weight&#xD;
           maintenance at the same time is the change in satiety and in food reward upon an&#xD;
           iso-energetic test-meal. This will be the main factor contributing to compliance and&#xD;
           preventing reversal, (measured by visual analog scales (VAS), changes in ad libitum meal&#xD;
           intake, representation in the brain of food reward processing and decision making,&#xD;
           computer test, TFEQ for cognitive restraint, disinhibition and hunger).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary contributions to this main parameter are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Possible changes in the gut-microbiota population, interacting with neuronal&#xD;
                signaling for satiety and reward;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The weight loss itself, changes in body-composition, and changes in resting- and&#xD;
                diet-induced energy expenditure, all underscoring weight maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Possible changes in the endocannabinoid profile, interacting with neuronal&#xD;
                signaling for satiety and reward Nature and extent of the burden and risks&#xD;
                associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: This research is&#xD;
                beneficial to the subjects, in that they all, being obese, will loose body-weight.&#xD;
                Subjects included in the diet induced weight loss group will lose 10% of their&#xD;
                initial weight, which is beneficial for the operation, as it will decrease the&#xD;
                risk. This will however not compromise their possibility to undergo surgery if&#xD;
                their BMI decreases below 35, as the intake for surgery is based upon the initial&#xD;
                screening, proving that they are not able to be weight stable and that they already&#xD;
                tried to be at a healthy stable weight with other weight loss methods. All&#xD;
                participants will have to come visit the metabolic research unit Maastricht (MURM)&#xD;
                on 4 different occasions, twice before the weight loss procedure and twice after.&#xD;
                These visits will be combined with regular hospital visits as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMRI is a non-invasive standard method for to determine blood oxygenation in areas of&#xD;
      interest without any significant risks (See document section K6 for standardized and approved&#xD;
      methods for conducting fMRI experiments involving human subjects). It is a technique that&#xD;
      utilizes magnetic fields and low-energy radio frequencies to visualize brain structures and&#xD;
      brain function. Through careful screening procedures subjects with metallic fragments in&#xD;
      their body will be excluded from the study since the fMRI magnet exerts a force on&#xD;
      ferromagnetic objects. During test day 2 (before and after the weight loss procedure) a&#xD;
      canula will be inserted for blood sampling. Blood sampling in this study does not include any&#xD;
      other risks for the subjects, other than its usual risk of minor bruising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One subject group will lose 10% of initial body weight using a VLCD. There are no risks for&#xD;
      the subjects in consuming the VLCD (Modifast, together with the recommended fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables) as the macronutrient composition and vitamins/minerals content meet the Dutch&#xD;
      recommended daily allowance. This VLCD will demand some energy from the subjects at home.&#xD;
      However, due to extensive experience with VLCD in our laboratory and due to the benefit of&#xD;
      weight loss for the participants we anticipate enough will-power to complete these 2 months&#xD;
      VLCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will be compared with 2 other weight loss groups; one group will undergo&#xD;
      RYGB surgery and one group will undergo LAGB surgery. RYGB is an operation that first divides&#xD;
      the stomach into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower &quot;remnant&quot; pouch and then&#xD;
      re-arranges the small intestine to connect to both, in this way bypassing part of the small&#xD;
      intestine. With LAGB an inflatable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to&#xD;
      create a smaller stomach pouch. This slows and limits the amount of food that can be consumed&#xD;
      at one time giving the opportunity for the sense of satiety to be met. It does not decrease&#xD;
      gastric emptying time. However, both surgical procedures will proceed as planned and will in&#xD;
      no way be changed. Therefore, further explanation is beyond the scope of this protocol.&#xD;
