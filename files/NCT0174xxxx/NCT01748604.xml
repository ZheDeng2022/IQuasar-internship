      The purpose of this multicenter randomised controlled study is to determine whether manual&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage (MLD) brings any benefit when added to intermittent pneumatic compression&#xD;
      (IPC) plus multilayer, multicomponent bandages (MB) in the decongestive lymphatic therapy&#xD;
      (DLT) in patients with lymphedema&#xD;

      Study Design: the study was a multicenter, randomized controlled study conducted at three&#xD;
      university hospitals in Spain. Potential subjects were identified at Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Department where physicians were responsible for screening subjects for eligibility and&#xD;
      enrolling into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and signed up the informed consent were&#xD;
      stratified within 2 stratums, upper and lower limb lymphedema, and then were randomized to&#xD;
      one of the three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of randomization was a total randomization with ratio 1:1:1 and the method used to&#xD;
      generate the random allocation sequence was a computer-generated random numbers table.&#xD;
      Adequate randomization includes calling a central office once eligibility has been&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physicians that assessed the outcome and the statistic who analyzed de data were blinded&#xD;
      to the subjects' treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital La Fe. It&#xD;
      was conducted according to the ethical principles laid down in the declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (52nd World Medical Association General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000) and the&#xD;
      rules of best clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Regimens: Patients were randomized to one of the following treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A or control group: Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) with Földi's technique by an&#xD;
           expert therapist during 45 minutes; intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) with&#xD;
           multicompartmental pump between 50 to 80 mmHg during 30 minutes, followed by multilayer,&#xD;
           multicomponent bandages (MB) until next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Pneumatic massage with Lymphapress-Plus(TM) device that was lent during the&#xD;
           duration of the study during 20 minutes, and was supposed to open the proximal&#xD;
           lymphatics at the root of the limb; IPC (50 to 80 mmHg during 30 minutes), followed by&#xD;
           MB until next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: IPC (50 to 80 mmHg during 30 minutes) followed by MB until next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were planned to receive 20 sessions of treatment (5 per week in consecutive days&#xD;
      during 4 consecutive weeks) and were trained in skin care and daily exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After DLT, garments were prescribed and their adaptation was checked to warrant the&#xD;
      maintenance of the results. The garments were flat knitted, custom made, generally class 2&#xD;
      (18-21 mmHg) for upper limb, and class 3 (36-46 mmHg) for lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Statistical analyses: This trial compares the efficacy of two treatment&#xD;
      modalities without MLD (experimental group B and C) with a standard trimodal therapy (control&#xD;
      group A). The expected effect size in percentage reduction in excess volume (PREV), primary&#xD;
      end point, for the control group (MLD+IPC+MB) was defined from the review of literature and&#xD;
      was 50 to 70% (mean 60%) with a standard deviation of 20 to 30 (mean 25). Our hypothesis was&#xD;
      that there are no differences between experimental and standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size for the study was 177 patients or 59 subjects per group to detect&#xD;
      differences greater than or equal 15% in the percentage reduction in excess volume (PREV)&#xD;
      between control and experimental groups, if exists; considering differences less than 15% as&#xD;
      not clinically significant. It was based on an alpha error of 5% and a power of 90%. We&#xD;
      estimated a drop-out rate of 10%. Therefore, 17 patients were added, resulting in a sample&#xD;
      size of 194 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare baseline characteristics between three groups we use two-way ANOVA test for&#xD;
      continuous variable and Pearson's chi2 for categorical data, to detect potential confounding&#xD;
      factors. Outcome data were analyzed utilizing a two-way ANOVA test to assess differences&#xD;
      between treatment groups with a 5% level of significance (p≤0.05) and two-tailed tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory subgroup analysis was made to identify factors associated with response&#xD;
      (PREV). Factors for initial screening were identified by univariate linear regression model&#xD;
      with a p value &lt;0.1. In order to determine the independent predictive factors, a multivariate&#xD;
      linear regression analysis was applied.&#xD;

    <description>It is obtained with the following formula: [(Initial EV - Final EV)/ Initial EV] x 100; where Excess Volume (EV) is the difference between Lymphedematous (VL) and Healthy limb volume (VH).&#xD;
Volumes were calculated with tape perimeter measurements (C) taken from the dorsum of the hand (C1) and repeated for every 4 cm proximally until the axilla (Cn), using Kuhnke formula, as the disk model is considered the method of choice in clinical practice.&#xD;
We assessed the change from baseline in PREV during Decongestive Lymphedema Treatment (DLT)and during 12 months of follow-up after DLT.</description>
