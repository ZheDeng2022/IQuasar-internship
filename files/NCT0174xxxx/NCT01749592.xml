  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postlingual single-sided deafness (SSD) is a type of hearing impairment with normal hearing&#xD;
      in one ear and severely impaired hearing in the other ear. The condition induces multiple&#xD;
      changes of neural plasticity in central auditory pathways. One manifestation reflects an&#xD;
      increased common activation of the contralateral and ipsilateral pathways after stimulation&#xD;
      of the normal hearing ear which is correlated with an increased activity between the&#xD;
      contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. As the left and right hemisphere are specialized&#xD;
      for different auditory tasks, the proposed study aims at demonstrating different consequences&#xD;
      of right or left-sided deafness for the affected individual. Furthermore, the question should&#xD;
      be answered if auditory deficits and plastic changes can be partially reversed by cochlear&#xD;
      implantation of the deaf ear. It is assumed that some changes induced by SSD can be detected&#xD;
      only by reversal through a cochlear implant.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria: • Patients with acquired single sided sensorineural deafness due to&#xD;
        cochlear damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18-70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of SSD within 6 months to 10 years before Study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal hearing on the contralateral ear (Hearing thresholds 0.125-2 kHz 25 dB HL or&#xD;
             better, 4-8 kHz 35 dB HL or better, 100% speech discrimination at 80 dB SPL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular middle ear function on the hearing ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular structure of the cochlea and the cochlear nerve (as demonstrated by MRI, MRI&#xD;
             scans are included in the basic assessment of SSD and are no study-specific&#xD;
             investigations).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluency in the German language.&#xD;

             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a trial with conventional acoustic measures in SSD (CROSS, BAHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria: • Uncertainty of correct diagnosis of SSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Retrocochlear cause of SSD (Deafness due to lesions of the acoustic nerve or central&#xD;
             auditory pathways).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active middle ear infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ossification of the cochlear that prevents electrode insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tympanic membrane perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric comorbidities such as depression or cognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe coexisting illness with a medium survival of less than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to radiation with a cumulative effective dose of 5 mSV within the last 5&#xD;
             years (including the ongoing year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased risk profile for general anesthesia due to cardiovascular comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metallic implants constituting an exclusion criterium for MEG procedures of the brain.&#xD;
