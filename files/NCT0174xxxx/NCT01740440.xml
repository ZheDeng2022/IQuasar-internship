      Safety and clinical performance of the BMR Face device (manufactured by Bio-Medical Research)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the efficacy of the BMR Face device in relation to facial appearance at 12 weeks&#xD;
      compared to baseline. Efficacy will be assessed by overall facial improvement assessed live&#xD;
      by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Global&#xD;
      Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a five-grade subjective test. The physician and&#xD;
      patient independently describe the degree of improvement in facial appearance. Possible&#xD;
      responses were (1) Significantly marked improvement, (2) marked improvement, (3) moderate&#xD;
      improvement, (4) slight improvement, (5) no improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety and further evaluate the subject's and&#xD;
      investigator's satisfaction (both a live and blinded assessor) with the BMR Face treatment.&#xD;
