  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that lenalidomide and romidepsin (and dexamethasone for patients with&#xD;
      myeloma) will have an acceptable toxicity profile and that in combination will have&#xD;
      sufficient activity in the target population (including those previously refractory to HDACi&#xD;
      monotherapy) to warrant further investigation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Summary of rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. As individual agents, both the histone deacetylase inhibitors and lenalidomide have&#xD;
           significant activity in each of the diseases in this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is potential for the agents to synergize (to improve upon the response rates as&#xD;
           there are both overlapping and disparate mechanisms of action.) Both agents may&#xD;
           synergize to induce cell death through caspase 8-mediated and other mechanisms; both&#xD;
           induce p21 and cell cycle arrest; both agents have anti-angiogenic effects; both are&#xD;
           likely to interfere with PI3K/Akt signaling. One particularly attractive aspect of this&#xD;
           combination is the potential for synergistic immunological effects, particularly related&#xD;
           to T-cell polarization, NK cell activation, STAT signaling and cytokine production, as&#xD;
           discussed above;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. With respect to PTCL, CTCL and HL, there is a clear path for further drug development&#xD;
           and registration if this trial proves that this is a safe and efficacious combination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Myeloma is incurable and this is due to the persistence of a drug-resistant sub-clone of&#xD;
           tumor-propagating cells that is drug insensitive. Preclinical data suggests that both&#xD;
           HDACi and lenalidomide may target these tumor-propagating cells. This argues for&#xD;
           examining this combination as part of early treatment in these diseases. This trial is&#xD;
           the first step to examine the feasibility of combining an HDACi with what is front-line&#xD;
           therapy in myeloma in the USA - lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Incorporating three separate arms (as opposed to three separate studies) will allow;&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. The investigators to accumulate data on this novel combination across the three&#xD;
           groups and evaluate the toxicity profiles to make informed decisions around&#xD;
           dose-escalation. Because it is a single study, valid comparisons can be made across the&#xD;
           groups, which would not be possible if they were separate studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. combined and simplified collection of correlative tests across the three studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study was terminated and Phase 2 portion never was initiated.&#xD;
