    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage III-IV melanoma that has spread to other places in the body and usually&#xD;
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Vaccines made from peptides or&#xD;
      antigens may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and clinically appropriate dose of human heat&#xD;
      shock protein (hsp)110-gp100 chaperone complex melanoma vaccine (recombinant hsp110-gp100&#xD;
      chaperone complex vaccine) to recommend a phase II dose in stage IIIB/C and stage IV&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effect of the recombinant human hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine on&#xD;
      measurable clinical tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine gp100 and hsp110 specific cell mediated and humoral immune responses&#xD;
      elicited by the chaperone complex vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effect of dose and serial administration of the chaperone complex&#xD;
      vaccine on cell mediated and humoral immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To quantify patient characteristics (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] subtype, immune cell&#xD;
      function, etc.) that may correlate with immune response to the chaperone complex vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine intradermally (ID) on&#xD;
      days 1, 15, and 43 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.&#xD;
