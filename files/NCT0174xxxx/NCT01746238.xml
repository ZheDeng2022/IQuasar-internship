      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose,&#xD;
      and effectiveness of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because bevacizumab is not considered standard therapy for sarcomas, it can only be given to&#xD;
      subjects with sarcoma who are enrolled in this research study and may only be administered&#xD;
      under the direction of doctors who are investigators in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done because sarcomas can recur after surgical resection (surgery for&#xD;
      removal of the tumor), radiation therapy and chemotherapy. This recurrence can occur in the&#xD;
      same location as the original tumor or in distant sites such as the lung. Thus better&#xD;
      treatments are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational drug, combination of drugs, or combination of drugs with radiation. Phase&#xD;
      I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs and radiation is still&#xD;
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means&#xD;
      that the FDA has not approved bevacizumab with doxorubicin and radiation for your type of&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      In order to determine if patients are eligible for this study patients will undergo some&#xD;
      screening procedures, including a medical history, physical examination, performance status,&#xD;
      assessment of tumor, chest CT scan, blood tests, urine test, electrocardiogram and&#xD;
      echocardiogram. Patients will also undergo blood tests and a tumor biopsy to look for markers&#xD;
      for your particular type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is determined that patients are eligible to be in the study they will need to have a&#xD;
      central venous line (CVL), peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), or portacath&#xD;
      placement. Doxorubicin administration requires a central venous line, peripherally inserted&#xD;
      central catheter (PICC) or portacath to be placed to allow continuous infusion of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the investigators are looking for the highest tolerable dose of the study drug,&#xD;
      bevacizumab, that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in&#xD;
      participants that have sarcoma, not everyone who participates in this research study will&#xD;
      receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose patients get will depend on the number of&#xD;
      participants who have been enrolled in the study and how well they have tolerated their&#xD;
      doses. The dose of doxorubicin and radiation therapy will be the same for all subjects&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be given as an intravenous infusion (IV). The first infusion will take about&#xD;
      90 minutes. All other bevacizumab infusions will take either 60 or 30 minutes, if tolerated.&#xD;
      The first infusion will be given on a Monday (excluding holidays). Patients will receive the&#xD;
      second infusion 2 weeks later and then every 2 weeks after that for a total of 3 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin will be given as an intravenous infusion (IV). It will be given through a port&#xD;
      via an infusion pump about the size of a large wallet that can fit into a front-pack or&#xD;
      &quot;fanny-pack&quot; around their waist. This pump will be connected to their body. The nurses in the&#xD;
      infusion room will start the pump and disconnect it after 4 days. The first bolus infusion&#xD;
      take will be given 1-2 hours after their first bevacizumab infusion and will take about 30&#xD;
      minutes. This will be followed by a continuous IV infusion of doxorubicin over 4 days. The&#xD;
      first bolus infusion will be given on a Monday (excluding holidays) and the continuous&#xD;
      infusion will go until Thursday. Patients will receive a second bolus infusion followed by a&#xD;
      4 day continuous infusion every week for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will begin radiation therapy after their first bevacizumab and doxorubicin infusion&#xD;
      on Monday (excluding holidays). Radiation therapy will be delivered five days per week&#xD;
      (Monday through Friday-excluding holidays) over a period of 6 weeks. This is done as an&#xD;
      outpatient procedure. Each 2-week period will be considered a separate treatment cycle.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with radiation therapy for a maximum of 3 cycles (6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be done during the study during weeks 2, 4 and 6 and&#xD;
      before surgery: a medical history, physical examination, performance status, blood tests,&#xD;
      urine tests and assessment for any side effects. Patients will have additional CT scans of&#xD;
      their chest and tumor before surgery. An ECG will be repeated at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surgeon will evaluate the tumor by reviewing radiologic studies before study treatment to&#xD;
      determine if surgical removal is possible. After patients complete study treatment with&#xD;
      radiation therapy and bevacizumab, a surgeon will repeat the evaluation of the tumor by&#xD;
      reviewing radiologic studies to determine if surgical removal is still possible. Patients&#xD;
      will have surgery 6-7 weeks after they finish radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have additional radiation therapy if the research doctor thinks that some&#xD;
      cancer cells may have been left in their body in the area where the tumor was removed. The&#xD;
      radiation may be given while patients are in surgery or about two weeks after the surgery.&#xD;
      This will be determined by the surgeon and or radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be in this research study for about 3 months. After the last dose of the study&#xD;
      drug the investigators would like to keep track of their medical condition for 10 years. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to do this by calling patients by telephone once a year to see how&#xD;
      they are doing. Keeping in touch with them and checking their condition every year helps the&#xD;
      investigators look at the long term effects of the research study.&#xD;
