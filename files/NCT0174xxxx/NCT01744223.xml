  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with blood cell cancers who are going to have an allogeneic&#xD;
      (donor) blood stem cell transplant from a partially matched relative. The research study will&#xD;
      test whether immune cells, called T cells, which come from the donor relative and are&#xD;
      specially grown in the laboratory and then given back to the patient along with the stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (T cell addback), can help the immune system recover faster after the transplant.&#xD;
      As a safety measure, these T cells have been &quot;programmed&quot; with a &quot;self-destruct switch&quot; so&#xD;
      that if, after they have been given to the patient, the T cells start to react against the&#xD;
      tissues (called &quot;graft versus host&quot; disease, GVHD), the T cells can be destroyed.&#xD;

      This is a Phase1/2 dose escalation study evaluating the safety and feasibility of BPX-501&#xD;
      infused after partially mismatched, related (haploidentical), T cell-depleted HSCT. The&#xD;
      purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether BPX-501 infusion can facilitate&#xD;
      engraftment, enhance immune reconstitution and potentially improve the graft versus leukemia&#xD;
      (GVL) effect, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration of severe acute graft&#xD;
      versus host disease (GvHD). The trial will evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the infusion of&#xD;
      dimerizer drug (Rimiducid) in those subjects who present with GvHD that does not adequately&#xD;
      respond to standard of care therapy.&#xD;
