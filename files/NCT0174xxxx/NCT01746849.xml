  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help determine if palifermin and leuprolide acetate can help&#xD;
      the immune system recover faster following a stem cell transplant. Blood stem cells are very&#xD;
      young blood cells that grow in the body to become red or white blood cells or platelets. The&#xD;
      transplant uses stem cells in the blood from another person. The donor can be a family member&#xD;
      or a volunteer donor. This is called an allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to see if palifermin and leuprolide acetate can help the immune system&#xD;
      recover faster after an allogenic transplant because experiments have shown they may be able&#xD;
      to do this.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to one of two arms: palifermin with Lupron, and control. The&#xD;
      control arm consists of a standard TCD allo-HSCT without the addition of palifermin or&#xD;
      Lupron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to receive Lupron will receive a three month depot dose 3-6 weeks prior&#xD;
      to the start date of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients assigned to receive&#xD;
      palifermin will receive this drug at 60mcg/kg/day IV on three consecutive days, 24 hours&#xD;
      apart with the last dose administered no less than 24 and no more than 48 hours prior to the&#xD;
      start of cytoreduction. The preparative regimen to be used for transplants will consist of:&#xD;
      hyperfractionated TBI administered in 11 doses over 4 days for a total of 1375 cGy, thiotepa&#xD;
      5 mg/kg/day IV x 2 days and cyclophosphamide with mesna prophylaxis 60 mg/kg/day IV x 2 days.&#xD;
      All patients will receive ATG for two doses prior to transplant, except recipients of&#xD;
      mismatched grafts (in the GVHD vector) will receive three doses. G-CSF mobilized CD34 PBSCs&#xD;
      obtained from the HLA compatible donor will be infused on day 0. Patients assigned to receive&#xD;
      palifermin will receive three additional daily doses of the drug, the first approximately 6&#xD;
      hours after the stem cell infusion on day 0, followed by two daily doses given at 24 hour&#xD;
      intervals on d+1 and d+2. Patients assigned to receive Lupron will receive a further 3-month&#xD;
      depot injection approximately 3 months (+/- one week) post the first dose. Supportive care&#xD;
      will be administered as per the BMT Service guidelines. The conditioning regimen may be&#xD;
      modified to allow an extra day during conditioning or prior to the graft infusion if required&#xD;
      by donor and/or patient scheduling restrictions.&#xD;
