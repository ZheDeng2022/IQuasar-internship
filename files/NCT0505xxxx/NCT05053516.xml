  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Now, there are few researches on the ability of social workers who work with drug addicts /&#xD;
      drug users in China, and the sample size is small and the content is not deep enough.The&#xD;
      existing studies suggest that the professional knowledge and ability of social workers who&#xD;
      work with drug addicts / drug users are insufficient and the vocational training is not&#xD;
      standardized. On the other hand, the ability of social workers who work with drug addicts /&#xD;
      drug users workers is related to the effectiveness of anti-drug in communities. So the large&#xD;
      sample survey will help to understand the current working status and working ability of&#xD;
      social workers who work with drug addicts / drug users in China.The development of the&#xD;
      standardized training programs for social workers who work with drug addicts / drug users can&#xD;
      improve the professional knowledge and ability of anti-drug social workers, so as to better&#xD;
      help community drug rehabilitation personnel and finally reduce the relapse rate.&#xD;
