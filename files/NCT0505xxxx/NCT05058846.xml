    <textblock>
      This study investigates how often abnormal findings from routine magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      occur in people with genetic mutations in BReast CAncer gene. (BRCA), ataxia telangiectasia&#xD;
      mutated gene (ATM), or PALB2 screened for pancreatic cancer. This study may lead to a greater&#xD;
      understanding of cancer and potentially, improvements in cancer screening and treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the event rate of abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in&#xD;
      screened study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rates of high-grade pancreatic neoplasia precursors (intraductal&#xD;
      papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-high-grade dysplasia (HGD)) and pancreatic intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia-3 [PanIN-3]) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) among all study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To understand rates of procedures (biopsies and surgeries) among all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To create a biorepository of all participants through the collection of saliva, blood, and&#xD;
      tissue, combined with imaging findings and robust clinical annotation of patient health&#xD;
      behaviors in all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore knowledge, attitudes, and anxiety related to pancreatic cancer screening at&#xD;
      annual intervals in all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Participants may opt to undergo MRI/ magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&#xD;
      (MRCP) annually for 10 years or complete questionnaires over 10 minutes and undergo blood,&#xD;
      saliva and tissue sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Participants undergo MRI/MRCP screening annually for 10 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Scores on the Pancreatic Cancer Knowledge Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, approximately 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Pancreatic Cancer Knowledge Survey is a 3-item, multiple choice questionnaire designed to gauge participant knowledge on the risk for pancreatic cancer in patients with inherited cancer risk mutations, specifically pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and given to participants at time of enrollment. Scores range from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating a greater knowledge of general pancreatic cancer information.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Pancreatic Cancer Worry Scale is a 4-item, multiple choice questionnaire which assesses the participants level of worry about developing or existing pancreatic cancers. Scores for each item range from 1='rarely or never'/'not at all' to 4=&quot;All of the time / very concerned&quot; for a total score range of 4-16. Higher scores indicate a greater level of worry.</description>

Participants may undergo annual MRI/MRCP screening and may also elect to get an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) every other year. Participants also have the opportunity to co-enroll in the UCSF BRCA Center Biorepository for biospecimen/biomarker collection and will complete surveys, including the optional eGene questionnaire, which involves co-enrollment in the eGene Study.</description>
