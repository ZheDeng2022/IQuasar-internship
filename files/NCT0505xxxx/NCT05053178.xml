      Students will be divided into groups of 6-10 and mandala activities will be carried out. 3&#xD;
      weeks of mandala activity, breathing exercises, affirmations, etc. a therapeutic application&#xD;
      program was created and implemented. For the students in the control group, the standard&#xD;
      support program given by the school administration and course instructors will be applied for&#xD;
      clinical problems. At the end of the study, it is planned to apply mandala activities among&#xD;
      the students in the control group. The research is based on Watson's &quot;Human Caring&quot; theory.&#xD;
