  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress, anxiety, depression and burnout have been studied extensively in public school&#xD;
      personnel. Effective and implementable strategies are urgently needed to address poor mental&#xD;
      health and to foster positive health characteristics in this population. Mindfulness based&#xD;
      stress reduction (MBSR) is an evidence-based intervention that supports whole person health.&#xD;
      Currently, no studies have examined remote MBSR feasibility among public school educators.&#xD;
      This study will develop, pilot and evaluate the feasibility and effects of an 10-session&#xD;
      (8-week) virtual MBSR program for public school educators.&#xD;
