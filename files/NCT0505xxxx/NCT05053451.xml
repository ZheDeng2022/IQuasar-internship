    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of non-invasive brain stimulation,&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), on auditory hallucinations, negative symptoms&#xD;
      and cognition in schizophrenia. Clinical measures will be used to assess clinical symptoms&#xD;
      and cognitive performance to test the hypothesis that a course of tDCS can reduce auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo diagnostic (clinical) interviews to rate their symptom severity using measures including, but not limited to, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (rated 1-7, with a high rating indicating more severe symptoms), the Scale of the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (rated 0-5, with a high rating indicating more severe symptoms), and the Scale for the Assessment or Negative Symptoms (rated 0-5, with a high rating indicating more severe symptoms).</description>

    <description>In tDCS, saline-soaked electrodes are temporarily affixed to the scalp and connected to a battery-powered current generator. A weak (2 mA) constant current is then briefly applied (20 minutes) to stimulate the targeted brain area (e.g. the DLPFC, TPJ, Occipital Cortex) depending on the phase of the study.</description>
