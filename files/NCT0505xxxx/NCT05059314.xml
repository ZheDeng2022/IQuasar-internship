  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is design To determine the effectiveness of moderate physical activity on Hb,&#xD;
      Physical fitness and psychological well-being in females.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of literature showed that level of physical activity is associated with Hb&#xD;
      level. But there is paucity in the literature regarding the cause and effect relationship of&#xD;
      PA and Hb. Literature shows lacking that there is any defined physical activity, which can&#xD;
      affect the Hb concentration. According to literature, different studies conduct at Hb level&#xD;
      in individuals with different diseases i.e. rheumatic arthritis, Diabetes mellitus etc. The&#xD;
      aim of my study is to determining the cause and effect relationship of moderate physical&#xD;
      activity on Hb level in healthy female population, one of the easiest moderate physical&#xD;
      activity is brisk walk. Brisk walk is an aerobic exercise. People do get best physiological&#xD;
      results of aerobic exercise with intensity of exercise 60-70% of the maximum pulse with&#xD;
      longer time duration as well as increase frequency of exercise, which increase no of&#xD;
      hemoglobin level due to this need more oxygen to performing physical activity in return basal&#xD;
      metabolic rate increases and achieve physical fitness and gain relieve from the psychological&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
