  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial tests whether relugolix and radiation therapy works to shrink tumors in&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer that has spread in a limited way to 1 to 5 other parts of the&#xD;
      body (oligometastatic). Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Relugolix&#xD;
      lowers the amount of testosterone made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells that need testosterone to grow. Giving relugolix with radiation therapy may help lower&#xD;
      the chance of prostate cancer growing or spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare conventional radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) for positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)-detected, biochemically recurrent, oligometastatic, castration-sensitive&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients treated with stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR)&#xD;
      plus placebo versus (vs.) SABR plus relugolix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare conventional or PET-based radiological progression-free survival (prPFS) between&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare patient-reported sexual and hormonal quality of life as assessed by corresponding&#xD;
      Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) domains between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare other measures of quality of life obtained from the European Quality of Life&#xD;
      Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ5D-5L), European Organization for Research&#xD;
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-30), Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue instruments between the two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare time to salvage therapy and time to castration-resistance between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Compare local progression (SABR-targeted lesion), biochemical progression, distant&#xD;
      metastases, prostate cancer-specific mortality, metastasis-free survival, and overall&#xD;
      survival between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine adverse events rates and compare rates between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate genomic and peripheral tissue and blood markers of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive placebo orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-180 and undergo SABR&#xD;
      for 1-3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive relugolix PO QD on days 1-180 and undergo SABR for 1-3 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months, every 6&#xD;
      months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
