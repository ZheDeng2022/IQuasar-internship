  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a common and standard urological surgical&#xD;
      procedure for managing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Although surgical technology&#xD;
      improved in recent decades, severe complications such as TURP syndrome, hematuria, and&#xD;
      postoperative hemorrhage were still considerable. Coagulopathy is one of rare but devastating&#xD;
      complication which may contribute to bleeding during and after TURP. Although the exact&#xD;
      pathophysiological condition of coagulopathy is not clear, there are several possible&#xD;
      mechanisms of TURP associated coagulopathy including: urokinase- (u-PA) and tissue-type&#xD;
      plasminogen activator (t-PA)-related fibrinolysis; absorption of irrigating fluid associated&#xD;
      dilutional coagulopathy; release of prostatic particles rich in tissue thromboplastins into&#xD;
      the circulation causing secondary Ô¨Åbrinolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy&#xD;
      (DIC); sepsis with DIC associated with bacteria entering the circulation due to prostatic&#xD;
      venous sinuses opening and the using of high pressure irrigation. On the other hand, platelet&#xD;
      are essential to hemostasis and thrombosis and its activation also contributes to leukocyte&#xD;
      recruitment and DIC. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that activated platelets&#xD;
      could express TLR4, CD40L, P-selectin and induce platelet-leukocyte aggregation (PLA), which&#xD;
      were considered important for systemic inflammatory responses and DIC development. Currently,&#xD;
      no study investigating the association of prostate particle and platelet activation. Here, we&#xD;
      tested the hypothesis that prostate tissue may induce inflammatory responses through platelet&#xD;
      activation by measuring the expression of TLR4, CD40L, P-selectin and PLA on platelets.&#xD;
