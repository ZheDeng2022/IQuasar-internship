    <textblock>
      Participants in school communities who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 will be tested for&#xD;
      COVID-19 on the day of exposure (day 1) and at days 3, 5, and 7 following initial known&#xD;
      exposure. Mitigation practices including masking, the context of exposure (classroom, school&#xD;
      bus, after school sporting event, lunch, etc.), and results of COVID-19 test will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional study with a primary objective of evaluating severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission following exposure in&#xD;
      Kindergarten through 12th grade schools. Participants will be tested with a COVID-19 testing&#xD;
      kit that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized under an emergency use&#xD;
      authorization (EUA) for non-prescription use for both symptomatic and asymptomatic evaluation&#xD;
      in children and adults. Participants who consent to participate in this study will be tested&#xD;
      at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 following a known COVID-19 exposure on day 0. If a participant does&#xD;
      not know of the exposure until more than one day following they exposure, they will be tested&#xD;
      on the day they become aware of the exposure and then resume the aforementioned testing&#xD;
      schedule (e.g. participant identifies exposure 3 days after the exposure, test on day 3, day&#xD;
      5, and day 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the COVID-19 tests are negative, the participant will remain in the school environment. A&#xD;
      positive COVID-19 test or the development of symptoms on any day after exposure would require&#xD;
      isolation according to school, local and state guidelines. Demographic information, daily&#xD;
      presence or absence of symptoms, whether the infected person or close contact was masked,&#xD;
      setting of the exposure, test results, and school absences will be collected following&#xD;
      consent. Data regarding school level mitigation practices will also be collected. Data&#xD;
      collected from this study may be combined with school-provided data and publically available&#xD;
      community data.&#xD;
