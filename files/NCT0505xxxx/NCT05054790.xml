  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if autologous &quot;neo-bladder&quot; construct for&#xD;
      the treatment of fibrotic and/or contracted bladder can improve bladder compliance and be&#xD;
      safe long term. The neo-bladder is like a reservoir or pouch that will be surgically attached&#xD;
      to the bladder to assist with urine collection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-group clinical study. All subjects will have&#xD;
      non-neurogenic, fibrotic contracted bladder that is refractory to medical treatment and&#xD;
      require augmentation cystoplasty for preventing long-term sequelae (i.e., kidney failure)&#xD;
      that result from persistently high intravesical pressure. Subjects will undergo an open full&#xD;
      thickness bladder biopsy from which autologous urinary bladder smooth muscle and urothelial&#xD;
      cells will be procured and expanded ex vivo. After approximately 5 - 7 weeks, expanded cells&#xD;
      will be seeded on a biodegradable scaffold to produce the neo-bladder construct that will be&#xD;
      surgically implanted onto an opened native bladder during an augmentation cystoplasty.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 36 months.&#xD;
