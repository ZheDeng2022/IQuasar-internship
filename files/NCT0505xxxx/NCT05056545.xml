  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial wants to address high unmet need for postpartum family planning (PPFP) in Rwanda.&#xD;
      A previous pilot study tested the intervention (informed by formative work with&#xD;
      couples/clients, clinic providers, champions, and community health workers), which&#xD;
      significantly increased the use of PPFP in government clinics. This study now proposes to use&#xD;
      an implementation science framework to test the hypothesis that the proposed PPFP&#xD;
      intervention is adaptable to large-scale implementation, cost-effective, and sustainable.&#xD;
      This PPFP could dramatically reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion and improve birth&#xD;
      spacing and maternal and newborn health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2017-2018, the study team worked closely with the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MOH) to&#xD;
      develop and pilot test a theory-based, multi-level intervention targeting postpartum family&#xD;
      planning (PPFP) supply and demand in 5 government health facilities in Kigali, the capital.&#xD;
      This innovative PPFP intervention was informed by clients, clinic providers, champions, and&#xD;
      Community Health Workers. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), the intrauterine&#xD;
      device (PPIUD) and implant, are fundamental to PPFP programs. LARCs are highly effective and&#xD;
      are the only reversible methods that may be safely used in early postpartum period by&#xD;
      breastfeeding women. During the pilot, LARC uptake among postpartum women increased&#xD;
      significantly (172% for PP implant, 2,687% for PPIUD), PPFP feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      were high among providers and clients, and side-effects were rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team now proposes to use an implementation science framework to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of different PPFP demand creation strategies and test the hypothesis that our&#xD;
      PPFP intervention is adaptable to large-scale implementation, cost-effective, and&#xD;
      sustainable. In a Type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study, we will evaluate facility&#xD;
      organizational readiness prior to implementing the PPFP intervention in a clinic randomized&#xD;
      trial in 12 high-volume health facilities in Kigali, Rwanda (Aim 1). Adaptability and&#xD;
      sustainability within government facilities is a critical aspect of the proposal, and the MOH&#xD;
      and other local stakeholders will be engaged from the outset. It is expected that this&#xD;
      project will deliver PPFP counseling to over 21,000 women/couples during the project period.&#xD;
      They will then evaluate the PPFP intervention effectiveness and implementation processes&#xD;
      using RE-AIM (Aim 2). The team hypothesizes that the PPFP intervention will significantly&#xD;
      increase the number of stakeholders engaged, PPFP providers and promoters, couples/clients&#xD;
      receiving information about PPFP (reach), and LARC uptake (effectiveness) comparing&#xD;
      intervention versus standard of care. It is expected that PPFP client satisfaction will be&#xD;
      high and side-effects will be rare. The independent effectiveness of each demand creation&#xD;
      strategy on LARC uptake will be estimated. Assessment of measures of PPFP intervention&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, and maintenance at the patient-, provider- and stakeholder-level to&#xD;
      assess PPFP intervention sustainability will be completed by the study team. Finally, this&#xD;
      project will evaluate PPFP intervention cost-effectiveness and develop a national costed&#xD;
      implementation plan to guide Rwandan MOH decision-making for nationwide roll-out of PPFP&#xD;
      services (Aim 3). This trial hypothesizes that the PPFP intervention will be cost-saving&#xD;
      relative to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention represents an important contribution to the Rwanda Family Planning 2020&#xD;
      goals and the MOH are enthusiastic to see our successful pilot efforts expanded to a larger&#xD;
      number of facilities for greater and sustained impact. The new PPFP implementation model is&#xD;
      designed to be replicable and expandable to other countries in the region which similarly&#xD;
      have high unmet need for PPFP.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This step-wedge clinical trial will train all nurse/midwives working in antenatal care (ANC), labor and delivery (L&amp;D), infant vaccination (IV), or postpartum services at one of the study facilities in PPFP promotions or provision. The study team will train 'Happy Clients' (postpartum women who received promotions and selected a PPFP method) and community health workers affiliated with the intervention facilities as PPFP promotional agents. Women eligible for PPFP services in this study will be at any stage of pregnancy or up to 14 weeks postpartum, and receiving ANC, L&amp;D, IV, or postpartum services at one of the intervention facilities.</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>C4 Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>C4 Intervention, is an innovative form of Post Partum Family Planning (PPFP). PPFP methods include: the copper intrauterine device, hormonal implant, tubal ligation, and (after 6 weeks post-partum in breastfeeding women) Depo-Provera and oral contraceptive pills. These are provided as current, standard of care in Rwanda, are procured by the government, and administered by trained nurses and doctors.&#xD;
The C4 training will occur at the 5 pilot facilities. Training will include a 2-day didactic session covering PPFP provision, follow-up, use of the C4 counseling flipchart; mock counseling sessions; and PPIUD and PP implant insertion and removal trainings. The study team will train government clinic staff in family planning, ANC, L&amp;D, and IV to promote C4 at the selected facilities. 'Happy Clients' will be recruited from women who received promotions and selected PPFP to join a clinic-based PPFP promotions team. Women interested in PPFP will be referred to the facility by their CHW.</description>
