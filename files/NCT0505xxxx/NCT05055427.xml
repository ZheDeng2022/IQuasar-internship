  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes&#xD;
      COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Patients with COVID-19 may experience various clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, from no symptoms to critical illness such as severe pneumonia and acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). So far, there is no specific medication for COVID-19;&#xD;
      hence, the current available treatments mostly aim at symptoms management and supportive&#xD;
      care. From traditional medicine perspective, COVID-19 is classified as warm-disease (Wen-yi).&#xD;
      The main points of treatment for COVID-19 in early stage based on traditional medicine&#xD;
      perspective are strengthen the Protective Qi (Wei Qi - the body immune system), and restore&#xD;
      the balance of Qi, which is vital biological energy to prevent the invasion of external&#xD;
      pathogens, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang have including Gan Cao&#xD;
      Gan Jiang Tang (GGT) with the addition of Ginseng. This formula is originated from Shang Han&#xD;
      Lun (Treatise on Febrile Diseases Caused by Cold) by Zhang Zhong-jing, used to enhance the&#xD;
      Protective Qi, treat the early stage of Febrile Diseases, This clinical trial aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang on mild and moderate COVID-19 patients&#xD;

      The main objectives of this clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the efficacy of Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang (Gan Cao Gan Jiang Tang with Ginseng) in&#xD;
           addition to the standard of care on reducing duration and severity of symptoms compared&#xD;
           with the standard of care in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the efficacy of Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang (Gan Cao Gan Jiang Tang with Ginseng) in&#xD;
           addition to the standard of care on reducing the proportion of patients progressed to&#xD;
           severe level compared with the standard of care in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the efficacy of Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang (Gan Cao Gan Jiang Tang with Ginseng) in&#xD;
           addition to the standard of care on reducing the time required to meet discharge&#xD;
           standards compared with the standard of care in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is investigated by the following hypotheses: combining Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang&#xD;
      (Gan Cao Gan Jiang Tang with Ginseng) with the standard of care is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      duration and severity of symptoms, reducing the proportion of patients progressed to severe&#xD;
      level, and reducing the length of hospital stay on mild and moderate COVID-19 patients&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial, we recruited patients with Covid-19 from five temporary for COVID-19 treatment in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.&#xD;
The protocol was designed based on the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and The Declaration of Helsinki. Number of Participants have 150 mild COVID-19 patient and 150 moderate COVID-19 patient. In each group of mild or moderate patients, we plan to randomize in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in the investigational group will receive Shen Cao Gan Jiang Tang in addition to the Standard of Care (SOC) for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the Vietnam Ministry of Health guideline. Subjects in the controlled group will receive the Standard of Care (SOC) for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the Vietnam Ministry of Health guideline.</intervention_model_description>
