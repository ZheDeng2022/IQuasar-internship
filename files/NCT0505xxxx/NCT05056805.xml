    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effectiveness of a home-based exercise and nutrition&#xD;
      monitoring program called Pt Pal in improving strength in patients with pancreatic or stomach&#xD;
      cancer receiving chemoradiation therapy before surgery. Pt Pal is a mobile health technology&#xD;
      used to facilitate communication between the care team and the patient/caregiver, by allowing&#xD;
      the care team to send from their web-portal, exercise routines, activities of daily living,&#xD;
      diet recommendations, surveys and educational material to the patient/caregiver's mobile&#xD;
      device. The Pt Pal application (app) then captures the patient/caregiver activity adherence&#xD;
      data and reports those results back to the care team. The Pt Pal program may help improve&#xD;
      overall strength in patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic and stomach cancer relative to&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. In patients with pancreatic and gastric cancer undergoing preoperative chemoradiation and&#xD;
      potentially curative resection, compare the change in dynamic lower muscle strength as&#xD;
      measured by the 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) leg press between the time of enrollment and&#xD;
      prior to resection in those who: a. Are offered aerobic exercise encouragement prior to&#xD;
      surgery b. Are offered aerobic exercise encouragement, nutrition monitoring, and a structured&#xD;
      strength exercise program prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the change in dynamic muscle strength as measured by the 1-RM for the chest&#xD;
      press, seated row, and leg extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare upper and lower body muscle endurance as defined by the maximal number of&#xD;
      repetitions performed at 70% of the pre-exercise 1-RM for the chest and leg press.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the change in the six minute walk test (6MWT) distance of patients between&#xD;
      the time of enrollment and prior to resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare physical function (patient-reported based on the Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form and objectively based on&#xD;
      grip strength) between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, patients with&#xD;
      hepatobiliary cancer [FACT-Hep]) between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare exercise motivation (Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire [BREQ]-3)&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To compare anthropometric measures (e.g., weight, skeletal muscle, visceral fat and&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat) using SliceOMatic software from usual care computed tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess the incidence of perioperative adverse events that occur within 90 days&#xD;
      between groups (Accordion score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To compare changes in physical activity between the time of enrollment and immediately&#xD;
      prior to surgery based on the Modified Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To evaluate feasibility of patient completion of 24-hour recall via Automated&#xD;
      Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To measure adoption of nutrition recommendations as compared to baseline. XII. To compare&#xD;
      adherence to nutrition recommendations within and between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIII. To compare &quot;usual care&quot; laboratory studies including those that are indicators of&#xD;
      nutritional status within and between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIV. To compare the vascular and tumor structure, and immune cell infiltration in tumors&#xD;
      between patients in different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XV. To compare potential biomarkers of angiogenesis and inflammation that correlate with&#xD;
      exercise, disease pathology, and/or clinical and functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XVI. To store in a research bank any remaining tissue or blood (collected for the purposes of&#xD;
      the above objectives) for the possibility of future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients are encouraged to complete at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, at least 3 times per week. Patients receive nutrition consultation with a&#xD;
      registered dietitian and monitor dietary intake. Aerobic exercises and nutrition are tracked&#xD;
      in the Pt Pal app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients complete at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (such as&#xD;
      brisk walking or stationary bike cycling) at least 3 times per week. Patients also complete&#xD;
      strength exercises with resistance tubes/bands at least 2 times per week, with at least 2&#xD;
      sets of 8-15 repetitions of the exercises taught. Patients receive nutrition consultation&#xD;
      with a registered dietitian and monitor dietary intake. Patients also consume a high protein&#xD;
      snack/meal/shake (15-25 grams) within 1 hour after any strengthening exercises. Exercise&#xD;
      activities and nutrition are tracked in the Pt Pal app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks.&#xD;
