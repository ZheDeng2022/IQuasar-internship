      Nurses who intensive care unit will be entered. Participants will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Progressive muscle relaxation; Arm 2: control. Hypothesis: Progressive muscle&#xD;
      relaxation will decrease occupational stress, headache and improve well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous reports have revealed that non-pharmacological approaches such as aromatherapy,&#xD;
      massage, meditation, music therapy, breathing exercises, yoga and progressive muscle&#xD;
      relaxation exercises (PGE) have been used to reduce stress and fatigue of individuals and&#xD;
      improve their well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there have been limited studies that directly focus on supporting intensive care&#xD;
      nurses who face serious problems with intense work tempo, experience excessive stress,&#xD;
      headache, tension, fatigue, are open to psychosocial problems such as anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, till date, no study has been conducted to determine the effects of progressive&#xD;
      relaxation exercise on occupational stress, headache and well-being for intensive care&#xD;
      nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study investigates the effects of progressive muscle relaxation in a single-site,&#xD;
      2-arm, assessor-blinded randomized, controlled study of 100 intensive care nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: relaxation; Arm 2: Attention matched control. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      progressive muscle relaxation will decrease the severity of occupational stress and headache&#xD;
      and improve well-being.&#xD;

    <description>Intensive care nurses will apply 20 minutes of online (zoom meeting) progressive muscle relaxation exercise twice a week, for 8 weeks, for a total of 16 group sessions. In order to support nurses' adaptation to the research, the group counselor will remind the nurses by phone twice a week during the implementation process, and their regular participation in online sessions will be supported.</description>

    <description>Progressive muscle relaxation exercise is a type of exercise in which tense muscles in your body gradually relax and relax. It is an application that allows you to forcefully stretch every muscle group in your body, hold it tight for 5 seconds, and then relax it. Visualize your tense muscles throughout this exercise and imagine that the feeling of relaxation spreads to all your muscles in the form of a wave and the tension is relieved. Keep breathing throughout the entire exercise.</description>
