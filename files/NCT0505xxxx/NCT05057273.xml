      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to assess the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of omilancor (BT-11) in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease (CD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate target engagement and the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of BT-11 compared to adalimumab in subjects with moderately to severely&#xD;
      active CD.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind, phase II study intending to evaluate omilancor (BT-11).&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at multiple sites within the Icahn School of Medicine system at&#xD;
      Mount Sinai. 40 subjects with moderate to severe CD will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      omilancor (BT-11) or adalimumab. The duration of treatment will be 12 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to visit the medical facility at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. At each visit&#xD;
      blood, urine and fecal samples will be collected as well as an overall assessment of symptoms&#xD;
      and patient reported outcomes. Participants will be asked to visit the facility at weeks 4,&#xD;
      8, and 10 for dosing on adalimumab and SC placebo. At screening and 12 weeks, subjects will&#xD;
      undergo an endoscopy to assess endoscopic response and collect colonic biopsies. After&#xD;
      completing week 12 of the study, subjects may be given the chance to be in an optional&#xD;
      open-label extension study. All eligible subjects will receive treatment with omilancor&#xD;
      (BT-11) 1000 mg daily. Participants who are classified as non-responders will be discontinued&#xD;
      from the study. Participants who continue to respond to study treatment will have the option&#xD;
      of remaining on omilancor (BT-11) until the therapy becomes commercially available or the&#xD;
      sponsor decides to terminate the study.&#xD;
