  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary peritonitis is a frequent abdominal emergency that is still associated with a high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rate due to surgical site infections (SSI) and sepsis. Early surgical&#xD;
      source control is crucial to avoid sepsis and worse outcomes. The current randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of peritoneal lavage with super-oxidized&#xD;
      solution (SOS) on SSI and mortality in patients undergoing emergency surgery for secondary&#xD;
      peritonitis. The investigators hypothesize that peritoneal lavage with SOS reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of SSI and mortality in this patient population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Secondary peritonitis is a frequent abdominal emergency that is associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and complications, especially surgical site infections (SSI). If not treated&#xD;
      promptly and efficiently, secondary peritonitis may progress from a contained abdominal&#xD;
      infection to systemic disease, i.e., sepsis and eventually septic shock. Early surgical&#xD;
      source control is crucial to avoid sepsis and worse outcomes. Super-oxidized solution (SOS)&#xD;
      has been shown to have a strong antimicrobial activity while being safe for medical use in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the effect of peritoneal lavage with&#xD;
      SOS vs. the current standard solution (Ringer's lactate) on SSI and mortality in patients&#xD;
      undergoing emergency abdominal surgery (EAS) for secondary peritonitis. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that peritoneal lavage with SOS during EAS will reduce the incidence of SSI and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for EAS with secondary peritonitis due to suspected hollow-viscus&#xD;
      perforation, anastomotic insufficiency, or abdominal abscess, including patients with the&#xD;
      named abdominal emergencies as a complication after elective surgery, will be assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility. All patients included will be treated according to the current standard of care&#xD;
      for secondary peritonitis. This includes the insertion of intravenous lines, start of&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, infusion of crystalloid solutions, monitoring of vital signs, and EAS.&#xD;
      EAS will be performed by laparoscopy or laparotomy, or started laparoscopically with a&#xD;
      conversion to laparotomy during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will take place during EAS after the surgical procedure including regular&#xD;
      peritoneal lavage have been performed. If a hollow-viscus perforation, anastomotic&#xD;
      insufficiency, or abdominal abscess is encountered intraoperatively, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized and undergo additional peritoneal lavage with either SOS (SOS group) or Ringer's&#xD;
      lactate (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SOS group, the abdominal cavity will be irrigated with 2 liters of SOS (Micodacyn60Â®),&#xD;
      followed by aspiration of the product and abdominal closure. In the control group, the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity will be irrigated with two liters of Ringer's lactate solution, followed by&#xD;
      aspiration of the solution and abdominal closure. The only difference in treatment between&#xD;
      the two groups will be the additional peritoneal lavage with SOS or Ringer's lactate at the&#xD;
      end of the procedure. After surgery, there will be no difference in the further management of&#xD;
      the SOS and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this RCT will be the incidence of SSI and mortality as a composite&#xD;
      outcome at 30 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be in-hospital and 30-day mortality, surgical site infections within&#xD;
      30 days, the time to occurrence of the primary outcome, sepsis as defined by the Sepsis-3&#xD;
      guidelines at 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days postoperatively, septic shock as defined by the Sepsis-3&#xD;
      guidelines at 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days postoperatively, organ dysfunction over time (14 days,&#xD;
      as measured by the SOFA and/or qSOFA scores), biomarkers of inflammation over time (14 days,&#xD;
      including C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and body temperature), postoperative&#xD;
      fascial dehiscence at 30 days postoperatively, intestinal fistula at 30 days postoperatively,&#xD;
      re-intervention for postoperative complications within 30 days postoperatively, days to first&#xD;
      postoperative bowel movement, and total hospital and Intensive Care Unit length of stay.&#xD;
