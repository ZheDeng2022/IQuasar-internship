    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate and compare garlic extract antibacterial effect when used as an&#xD;
      intra-canal medicament in infected mature anterior teeth with calcium hydroxide and a mixture&#xD;
      of calcium hydroxide and garlic, using real time PCR analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six permanent mature necrotic incisors associated with apical periodontitis in male&#xD;
      children were selected. Teeth were randomly divided into three groups (n=22) according to&#xD;
      intra canal medications used; group I: Ca OH2, group II: garlic extract and group III:&#xD;
      mixture of Ca OH2 and garlic extract. After access preparation, four microbiological samples&#xD;
      (S) were taken using sterile absorbent paper points as follows; (S1): were taken before canal&#xD;
      instrumentation and irrigation. (S2): after cleaning and shaping, Then, the third samples&#xD;
      (S3) and forth samples (S4) were taken after placement of the tested intracanal medications&#xD;
      into the corresponding canals, for 7 and 14 days respectively. Total DNA was extracted from&#xD;
      microbiological samples and relative quantitive real time PCR reactions were done to quantify&#xD;
      the relative gene expression levels (FC) for Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis species.&#xD;
      Data was statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Freidman's tests, followed by&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon singed rank tests at significance level p â‰¤ 0.05.&#xD;
