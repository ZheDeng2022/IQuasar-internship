      Investigation of the correlation between the success of obtaining unilateral spinal&#xD;

      Target sites for spinal anesthetics are spinal nerve roots and spinal cord. Differences in&#xD;
      the anatomy of the nerve roots may explain the variability that occurs during spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is the cessation of nerve conduction for a while by injection&#xD;
      of local anesthetic drug into the cerebrospinal fluid. It is one of the most effective and&#xD;
      oldest regional anesthesia techniques. Unilateral spinal anesthesia, on the other hand, aims&#xD;
      to limit the distribution of the spinal block to the operated side for all operations&#xD;
      involving only one lower extremity. Reducing the dose of local anesthetic, pencil-point&#xD;
      needles, injection speed, lateral decubitus position and non-isobaric anesthetic solution are&#xD;
      the main factors in the formation of a unilateral spinal block. It requires slightly longer&#xD;
      preparation time compared to standard spinal anesthesia, but provides fewer hemodynamic side&#xD;
      effects with higher cardiovascular stability, increased postoperative autonomy and better&#xD;
      patient acceptance. Perfusion index (PI) is a numerical value showing the ratio between&#xD;
      pulsatile and nonpulsatile blood flow. PI works by measuring changes in finger peripheral&#xD;
      perfusion via pulse oximetry. If the procedure is successful in patients undergoing spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia, vasodilation occurs in the lower extremities due to sympathetic nerve blockage&#xD;
      and perfusion increases. Pulse oximetry perfusion index (PI) was used in our study to&#xD;
      indicate vasodilation associated with sympathectomy. We will examine whether the success of&#xD;
      unilateral anesthesia in the spinal anesthesia performed in our hospital correlates with the&#xD;
      increase of the perfusion index value measured with the finger probe, except for&#xD;
      patient-based methods, and whether the perfusion index shows more objectively the block&#xD;
      success than other patient-based traditional methods.&#xD;
