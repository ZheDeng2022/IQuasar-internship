  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current design provides a window to analyze the impact of the ACT001+Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      combination on the tumor microenvironment and disease outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b: The identified RP2D of combined ACT001 with Pembrolizumab will be determined by&#xD;
      standard 3+3 dose escalation methodology among three ACT001 dosages (200mg, 400mg and 800mg,&#xD;
      BID) with standard Pembrolizumab dosage. Patients will be dosed approximately 2 weeks prior&#xD;
      to surgical resection with a single dose of Pembrolizumab and ACT001. Tumor resection will be&#xD;
      performed and a biopsy will be obtained from the resected tumor tissue to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of the study drugs on the TME. After recovery from surgery, patients will resume ACT001 and&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab until tumor progression (assessed by iRANO) or an AE requiring discontinuation&#xD;
      of study drug. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the data available from all&#xD;
      evaluable patients at each dose level prior to recommending escalation to the next dose&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2a: Using the same dosing schedule and ACT001 dosage as determined in Phase 1b.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive either Pembrolizumab only treatment (Arm A, 10&#xD;
      patients) or ACT001 plus Pembrolizumab treatment (Arm B, 20 patients).&#xD;
