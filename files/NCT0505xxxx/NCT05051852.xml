  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has become one of the most important health problems&#xD;
      faced by women all over the world. A large number of studies have shown that women's&#xD;
      cervical, vaginal and perianal precancerous lesions, related cancers, condyloma acuminatum&#xD;
      and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are closely related to HPV infection. Among&#xD;
      them, the persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is closely related&#xD;
      to the occurrence of invasive cervical cancer. Previous studies have shown that there are&#xD;
      significant differences in the effects of multiple HPV infection and persistent infection of&#xD;
      different types (such as type-16, -18, -39 and -52) on different levels of cervical lesions,&#xD;
      and there is a certain correlation between HPV load in the process of persistent infection&#xD;
      and the degree of cervical lesions. In addition, other studies have shown that HPV-16 viral&#xD;
      load has certain clinical significance in predicting Cin2 / CIN3 high-grade cervical lesions,&#xD;
      and HPV viral load level is significantly different in cervical low-grade squamous&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).&#xD;
      The above biological changes such as HPV infection type, quantity and proportion can promote&#xD;
      the occurrence and development of cervical precancerous lesions and related cancers to&#xD;
      varying degrees. It can be seen that the study of the relationship between HPV viral load and&#xD;
      cervical lesions is of great significance for clinical disease development prediction and&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening.&#xD;

      Based on our previous studies and clinical practice, this study carried out a multi center&#xD;
      cohort study in Fujian Province, China. In this study, six research including Fujian&#xD;
      Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Mindong Hospital of Ningde City, Zhangzhou affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou First Hospital Afflicated to Fujian Medical&#xD;
      University, Xiamen Maternity and Child Health Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and&#xD;
      Ningde Municipal Hospital of Ningde Normal University were included, each of which included&#xD;
      500 individuals, with a total of 3000 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion&#xD;
      were enrolled. For the first time, the researchers will collect 2 samples of cervical&#xD;
      exfoliated cells (one of which will be sub packed into 3) and 4 samples of vaginal fornix&#xD;
      swabs from subjects, then at the 6th, 12th and 24th months after the first sampling, the&#xD;
      subjects need to return to the hospital, collect 2 samples of cervical exfoliated cells (one&#xD;
      of which will be sub packed) and 4 samples of vaginal fornix swabs again in order to observe&#xD;
      and record the development of the disease. During this process, if abnormal cervical lesions&#xD;
      are found, the subjects will be biopsied under colposcopy according to relevant guidelines.&#xD;
      Samples from cervix would be sent for PCR-sequencing, HPV tests and Thinprep cytologic test&#xD;
      (TCT). And samples from vaginal fornix would be sent for sequencing and bioinformatic&#xD;
      analysis. A prospective cohort study was conducted to explore the correlation between the&#xD;
      characteristics, progression and prognosis of female genital tract lesions and HPV infection&#xD;
      type, load and vaginal microenvironment.&#xD;
