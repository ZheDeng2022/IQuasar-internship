    <textblock>
      Septic shock is associated with a high mortality risk. Fluid overload occurs when fluids are&#xD;
      administered to fluid unresponsive patients, but also when inappropriate resuscitation goals&#xD;
      are pursued. Alongside, evidence confirms that abnormal peripheral perfusion after&#xD;
      resuscitation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Targeted resuscitation&#xD;
      associates with lower mortality, less organ dysfunction, and less intensity of treatment.&#xD;
      Over-resuscitation may contribute to a worse outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients remain hypovolemic after initial resuscitation. Others present very low&#xD;
      diastolic arterial pressures (DAP) reflecting profound vasoplegia and may benefit from early&#xD;
      norepinephrine (NE) instead of fluids. Administering fluids in this setting could increase&#xD;
      the risk of fluid overload. In addition, relevant myocardial dysfunction is present in a&#xD;
      significant number of patients. Pulse pressure (PP) and DAP evaluation may help clinicians to&#xD;
      individualize initial management sparing unnecessary fluid loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To test if a CRT-targeted resuscitation based on clinical hemodynamic phenotyping&#xD;
      can improve a hierarchical clinical outcome - mortality, time to cessation of vital support,&#xD;
      and length of hospital stay, all within 28 days - in septic shock patients as compared to&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2 is a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a CRT-targeted,&#xD;
      hemodynamics-based resuscitation strategy with usual care in patients with early septic shock&#xD;
      during a 6 h intervention period. A sample size of 1500 patients was calculated to detect a&#xD;
      6% absolute reduction in mortality in the CRT group, and the win-ratio method will be used to&#xD;
      test the superiority in the hierarchical outcomes mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of a CRT-targeted strategy with a clinical hemodynamic phenotyping may aid to&#xD;
      personalize initial resuscitation with potential additional fluid-sparing effects. To&#xD;
      categorize patients at baseline according to PP may conduct patients with low PP (&lt;40mmHg) to&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness (FR) assessment and eventually fluid boluses, while patients with normal&#xD;
      PP will be treated according to DAP, adjusting NE when to avoid further fluids loading in&#xD;
      patients who normalize CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid resuscitation will be focused on FR+ hypoperfused patients to prevent harmful fluid&#xD;
      administration in FR- patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      I. Introduction Septic shock is associated with a high mortality risk related to progressive&#xD;
      tissue hypoperfusion. However, despite extensive research on the best monitoring and&#xD;
      resuscitation strategies, many uncertainties remain. Over-resuscitation, particularly when&#xD;
      inducing fluid overload, might contribute to a worse outcome. Fluid overload more likely&#xD;
      occurs when fluids are administered to fluid unresponsive patients, but also when&#xD;
      inappropriate resuscitation goals are pursued, or a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; strategy is followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a hemodynamic point of view, several pathogenic mechanisms determine a progressive&#xD;
      circulatory dysfunction. While loss of vascular tone and relative hypovolemia predominate in&#xD;
      early phases, more complex mechanisms such as endothelial and microcirculatory dysfunction,&#xD;
      progressive vasoplegia, and myocardial dysfunction may be involved later. In effect, from a&#xD;
      clinical point of view, many patients despite been fluid loaded in pre-intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) settings, are still evidently hypovolemic and benefit from further administration of&#xD;
      fluid boluses. Others, however, present very low diastolic arterial pressures (DAP)&#xD;
      reflecting profound vasoplegia, and recent data suggest that these patients may benefit from&#xD;
      early norepinephrine (NE) instead of fluids on the contrary, administering fluids may fail to&#xD;
      correct vascular tone and increase the risk of fluid overload. In addition, a recent&#xD;
      echocardiography-based study confirmed that a relevant myocardial dysfunction is present in a&#xD;
      significant number of patients and that several cardiovascular phenotypes with a potentially&#xD;
      different therapeutic approach may be recognized. Despite research efforts, no universally&#xD;
      applicable clinical phenotyping method for septic shock patients has been translated to usual&#xD;
      practice. This is particularly problematic since echocardiography is not immediately&#xD;
      available in the majority of centers worldwide, and therefore initial decisions on fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation are usually based on clinical grounds and tend to follow the&#xD;
      &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; principle, leading to the risk of fluid overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Study The excellent prognosis associated with CRT recovery, its&#xD;
      rapid-response time to fluid loading, its relative simplicity, its availability in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings, and its capacity to change in parallel with perfusion of&#xD;
      physiologically relevant territories such as the hepatosplanchnic region, constitute strong&#xD;
      reasons to consider CRT as the target for fluid resuscitation in septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANDROMEDA-SHOCK was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing CRT- versus&#xD;
      lactate-targeted resuscitation in patients with early septic shock. The main outcome was&#xD;
      28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included organ dysfunction and treatment intensity.&#xD;
      The hypothesis was that targeting CRT would lead to decreased mortality and organ dysfunction&#xD;
      due to less fluid administration and treatment intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRT-targeted resuscitation was associated with lower mortality (34.9% vs. 43.4%), beneficial&#xD;
      effects on organ dysfunction, and less intensity of treatment. The superiority of this&#xD;
      strategy was also supported by a subsequent Bayesian analysis. The key novelty of A2 is to&#xD;
      combine a CRT-targeted strategy with a clinical hemodynamic phenotyping that may aid to&#xD;
      personalize initial resuscitation with potential additional fluid-sparing effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Rationale for ANDROMEDA-SHOCK-2 intervention strategy. There are four relevant actions&#xD;
      that may increase the efficacy of A2 intervention strategy to decrease mortality and organ&#xD;
      dysfunction due to potential fluid-sparing effects or at least by promoting a more rational&#xD;
      septic shock resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of CRT as a target A key aspect of ANDROMEDA-SHOCK was a more rational approach to&#xD;
           fluid resuscitation based on selecting a more appropriate target such as CRT. In fact,&#xD;
           almost a 25% of patients assigned to the CRT arm had a normal CRT at baseline, and thus&#xD;
           received no further fluid resuscitation. This fact is per se fluid sparing. In addition,&#xD;
           a significant number of patients corrected CRT at 2h with initial fluid boluses. This&#xD;
           rapid response of CRT to flow-increasing maneuvers makes CRT particularly suitable as a&#xD;
           target. In addition, a recent clinical-physiological study suggested that normalization&#xD;
           of CRT was associated to resolution of profound tissue hypoperfusion as assessed by&#xD;
           hypoxia surrogates, and regional/sublingual microcirculatory variables. For these&#xD;
           reasons and other considerations described elsewhere, a CRT-targeted resuscitation will&#xD;
           be applied as the intervention arm of A2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical hemodynamic phenotyping Hypotension assessed by mean arterial pressure (MAP) is&#xD;
           the hallmark of sepsis-related acute circulatory dysfunction, and since duration of&#xD;
           hypotension is related to morbidity and mortality, current guidelines recommend fluids&#xD;
           and vasopressors administered in a stepwise fashion to increase MAP levels to &gt;65 mmHg&#xD;
           to ensure minimal organ perfusion pressure. This &quot;MAP-driven strategy&quot; has probably led&#xD;
           to an unwanted side-effect, a reductionist approach to clinical hemodynamic monitoring&#xD;
           where among numerous variables provided by the blood pressure signal, only MAP is&#xD;
           considered for decision-making at the bedside. Moreover, this standardized resuscitation&#xD;
           strategy is debatable since septic shock patients are highly heterogeneous. For example,&#xD;
           a recent report showed that 30% of septic shock patients admitted to ICU were already&#xD;
           fluid unresponsive, and others have suggested that early start of NE instead of fluids&#xD;
           could be associated with better outcomes in predominantly vasoplegic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pulse pressure (PP) as a surrogate of stroke volume. In normal conditions, DAP is mainly&#xD;
           determined by vascular tone and it remains nearly constant from the ascending aorta to&#xD;
           the peripheral vessels. Thus, detection of low DAP at peripheral vessels should reflect&#xD;
           systemic vasodilation as long as the aortic valve is competent. However, DAP is not&#xD;
           considered for septic shock definition, and with few exceptions, its relationship with&#xD;
           clinical outcomes has not been widely described. Nevertheless, evaluation of the loss of&#xD;
           vascular tone through the severity of diastolic hypotension could have profound&#xD;
           implications on therapeutic decisions since there are not robust clues to rapidly&#xD;
           predict when hypotension will be sustainably corrected with fluid loading. Thus, rapid&#xD;
           assessment of severity of vasodilation could influence therapeutic decisions such as the&#xD;
           early introduction of NE, which theoretically may avoid unnecessary fluid administration&#xD;
           while promptly restoring tissue perfusion. A low DAP (&lt;50 mmHg) may impair myocardial&#xD;
           perfusion of the left ventricle (LV), especially in the case of tachycardia where&#xD;
           diastolic time is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Systematic and repeated assessment of fluid responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid administration is the first line therapy to reverse sepsis-induced tissue&#xD;
           hypoperfusion. For this purpose, fluids are administered either as fluid loading at the&#xD;
           emergency department, or later as fluid challenges during advanced ICU-based&#xD;
           resuscitation. However, as any other drug, fluids have a narrow therapeutic index.&#xD;
           Insufficient fluid resuscitation may lead to progressive tissue hypoperfusion and organ&#xD;
           dysfunction, while excess fluids could induce detrimental fluid overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid responsiveness (FR) is a physiological cardiovascular condition where an increase&#xD;
           in preload induced by a fluid bolus leads to an increase in cardiac output (CO) by more&#xD;
           than 10-15%. In non-fluid responsive (FR-) patients, fluid administration does not&#xD;
           significantly increase CO and may contribute to congestion and fluid overload. The&#xD;
           rationale to assess FR is then to try to optimize fluid resuscitation in critically ill&#xD;
           patients by focusing fluid boluses in FR+ hypoperfused patients and by preventing&#xD;
           harmful fluid administration in FR- patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multiple tests have been described to assess FR at the bedside. They allow to determine&#xD;
           the position of the patient's heart on its systolic function curve and are based upon&#xD;
           changes in cardiac output or stroke volume resulting from various changes in preload&#xD;
           conditions, induced by heart-lung interactions, postural maneuvers or by the infusion of&#xD;
           small amounts of fluids. By applying the appropriate tests, FR can be assessed in a wide&#xD;
           variety of clinical settings. However, despite their relative simplicity, lack of cost,&#xD;
           and side effects, the use of FR tests has not completely permeated into routine clinical&#xD;
           practice. One of the contributing factors is that even under the optimal conditions of&#xD;
           their use, their sensitivity and specificity is not perfect, and all have significant&#xD;
           limitations. This may be linked to the unreliability of the test, but also to the lack&#xD;
           of precision of the measurement method used to estimate its effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In A2, FR assessment will be performed systematically in every patient with abnormal CRT&#xD;
           randomized to the intervention arm and presenting a low PP. FR assessment will be&#xD;
           repeated after every fluid bolus (500 ml of crystalloids in 30 minutes) to decide on&#xD;
           further fluid administration if CRT target was not achieved. A FR- status or a safety&#xD;
           issue may command to move to other steps of the intervention algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Selective Critical Care Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Usual Care group Recruited centers for A2 should exhibit a historical mortality for&#xD;
      septic shock of &lt;40%. Patients allocated to the control (usual care) group will be managed by&#xD;
      the clinical staff according to usual practice at their sites including decisions about&#xD;
      hemodynamic and perfusion monitoring, and all treatments, but should follow general&#xD;
      recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign to avoid extremes of clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data regarding insertion of invasive monitoring devices, intravenous-fluid resuscitation,&#xD;
      vasoactive support, mechanical ventilation, and other supportive therapies will be collected&#xD;
      by the study coordinator or monitors. Lead investigators at a site will not serve as the&#xD;
      bedside treating physician for patients in the usual-care group.fluid administration in FR-&#xD;

This includes basic hemodynamic targets such as a MAP &gt;65 mmHg, heart rate (HR) &lt;120 beats per minute (BPM), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) &gt;94%, Hb &gt; 7 gr/dl, and the use of NE as the first vasopressor and crystalloids as the fluid of choice.</description>
