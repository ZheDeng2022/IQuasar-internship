  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) occur at significantly higher rates in&#xD;
      Veterans compared to the general population. Chronic pain often persists despite engagement&#xD;
      in opioid agonist treatment (OAT), the first line treatment for OUD. Recent VA guidelines&#xD;
      strongly recommend non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic pain, but individuals with OUD are&#xD;
      frequently excluded from pain treatment studies. There is a need for evidence-based pain&#xD;
      treatments that compliment OAT for Veterans with chronic pain and OUD. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine feasibility and acceptability for a behaviorally focused pain&#xD;
      treatment that includes pain education and a pedometer assisted adaptive walking program for&#xD;
      Veterans receiving OAT for OUD. Potential treatment outcomes will be repeatedly assessed&#xD;
      using a mobile device, and study-provided pedometers. By offering pain treatment within OAT&#xD;
      clinical care, the investigators hope to decrease stigma and increase access for Veterans&#xD;
      with chronic pain and OUD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will address the pain treatment knowledge gap in Veterans with opioid use&#xD;
      disorder (OUD) by piloting a behaviorally-based walking pain treatment for Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic pain and OUD. Steps to Change (S2C) is a pain-focused treatment comprised of weekly&#xD;
      60-minute group sessions held over four consecutive weeks within the a Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration opioid agonist treatment (OAT) clinic. To date, no study has evaluated a&#xD;
      pedometer-assisted walking program in individuals with chronic pain and OUD engaged in OAT.&#xD;
      Topics for S2C include biopsychosocial pain education, pacing activities, benefits of&#xD;
      physical activity, and an adaptive walking program derived from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      for chronic pain (CBT-CP) modules. The health education control will be matched for treatment&#xD;
      exposure and complexity of treatment material. Veterans in both groups will be provided a&#xD;
      pedometer to record daily step counts as an objective measure of physical activity.&#xD;
      Importantly, pain is a dynamic process that is known to vary over time and context. Veterans&#xD;
      in both groups will complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys, where behavior is&#xD;
      repeatedly sampled using a mobile device. The primary treatment outcome (i.e., pain&#xD;
      interference) will be collected using EMA. The use of EMA offers considerable benefits&#xD;
      relative to in-clinic measurement including significantly reducing recall bias and&#xD;
      substantially improving reliability of measurement. For example, compared to a single rating,&#xD;
      a composite of five daily pain ratings over 2 weeks increased reliability from 0.65 to&#xD;
      0.90.55 Importantly, multiple studies have demonstrated that repeatedly asking about pain&#xD;
      (e.g., 3 to 12 prompts per day for 2 weeks) does not increase pain reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives align closely with the description of a Stage IB pilot trial. Stage IB&#xD;
      research determines feasibility and pilot testing of an adaptation or refinement of an&#xD;
      existing intervention. Walking is a core component of CBT-CP and physical activity has a&#xD;
      strong evidence base as a pain treatment for individuals with chronic pain; however, a&#xD;
      walking program for chronic pain has not been evaluated in Veterans with chronic pain and OUD&#xD;
      receiving OAT. Aim 1 will determine feasibility of study procedures including randomization,&#xD;
      retention, fidelity, and proposed study outcomes of S2C and health education control.&#xD;
      Evaluating the feasibility of group treatment and best practices for how quickly Veterans can&#xD;
      be screened, consented, and randomized to start group treatment is a critical step to inform&#xD;
      a larger Stage II efficacy trial. In addition, the investigators will evaluate group&#xD;
      attendance and retention in both S2C and health control conditions to determine feasibility&#xD;
      as well as discrimination of groups for fidelity. The investigators will also collect data on&#xD;
      mobile phone ownership and compare EMA survey response rates between conditions to inform&#xD;
      future efficacy studies. The investigators expect that group attendance, retention, and&#xD;
      survey responses for S2C will be equal to or superior then health education control. Aim 2&#xD;
      will establish acceptability of S2C and health education control by assessing intervention&#xD;
      credibility and satisfaction at post-treatment. The investigators expect that Veterans in&#xD;
      both groups will report treatment as credible and satisfying. Since S2C is explicitly&#xD;
      intended to increase daily step count, credibility of S2C will also be evaluated by expect&#xD;
      greater increases (compared to control) in mean daily step count from baseline to&#xD;
      post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will determine preliminary efficacy for whether S2C, compared&#xD;
      to health education control, reduces pain interference assessed via EMA. Primary endpoint&#xD;
      will be at post-treatment, but the investigators will also evaluate durability or sleeper&#xD;
      effects on pain interference assessed via EMA at 3- and 6-month follow up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Recruitment strategies will occur in waves to minimize the amount of time between screening visit and group treatment start date. For each recruitment wave, screening visits for multiple Veterans will be scheduled within a 1-2 week period. Once 8 to 10 Veterans have been screened, these Veterans will begin a 7 day baseline EMA run-in period leading up to the start of the treatment week. We anticipate that groups will start within 3 weeks of screening visit. The feasibility of these procedures will be evaluated in Aim 1. Veterans who provide pedometer and EMA survey data on at least 3 days during baseline EMA will be randomized. Veterans will be randomized to either S2C or health education control in a 1:1 ratio using permuted block randomization stratified by OAT type (1=buprenorphine, 2=methadone) and sex (1=male, 2=female). A variable block size of 2 and 4 will be used to maintain balanced assignment to condition.</intervention_model_description>

Study title on informed consent and recruitment materials will be &quot;Enhancing self-management skills for individuals with opioid use disorder.&quot; Study measures (both in clinic and EMA) will be described as collecting data on problems that Veterans with OUD commonly report (e.g., negative mood, pain, quality of life, stress, etc.) and may improve with increased engagement in treatment. All in person assessment for post-treatment, 3 month follow up, and 6 month follow up will be collected by a research staff member who is blind to study condition.

    <description>The health education control will be matched for treatment exposure and complexity of treatment material. Topics for control sessions will be selected modules from the VA Healthy Living manual. Session 1 will focus on the module &quot;Be Involved in Your Healthcare&quot; which includes strategies to retain information from multiple healthcare visits and improve self-advocacy. Session 2 will utilize the &quot;Manage Stress&quot; module that will cover the definition of stress and negative health impact of chronic stress. Session 3 will use the &quot;Eat Wisely&quot; module that will discuss health conditions associated with poor diet and key recommendations to maintain a healthy diet. Session 4 will use the &quot;Be Safe&quot; module that discusses ways to prevent falls, self-harm, sexually transmitted diseases, and intimate partner violence. All of these modules are designed to provide information about improving health and self-management skills without explicitly discussing pain or setting goals for treatment.</description>
