  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, which has a quasi-experimental, prospective, and open-label randomized controlled&#xD;
      design, was conducted to examine the effect of cold application on the development of&#xD;
      phlebitis in patients receiving IV amiodarone infusion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses H0-1: There is no difference in the rate of development of phlebitis between&#xD;
      the patients who received and who did not receive cold application during amiodarone IV&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0-2: There is no difference in the grade of phlebitis between the patients who received and&#xD;
      who did not receive cold application during amiodarone IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0-3: There is no difference in the time of development of phlebitis between the patients who&#xD;
      received and who did not receive cold application during amiodarone IV infusion.&#xD;

    <description>After starting amiodarone treatment, cold application was applied a total of 12 times on the infused PVC with cold gel packs for 15 minutes at 2-hour intervals. At all stages of the study, the researcher closely monitored the patients. During the treatment, the development of phlebitis after cold application during the 24-hour infusion was evaluated every 2 hours by the researcher using the &quot;Visual Infusion Phlebitis Scale&quot; and recorded. After starting the amiodarone infusion, the patients were observed for the development of phlebitis for 24 hours until the end of the procedure and for 2 hours after the end of the treatment.</description>

    <description>the patients who were started on amiodarone infusion were observed for the development of phlebitis, receiving no intervention. During the treatment, phlebitis development was evaluated and recorded by the researcher using the &quot;Visual Infusion Phlebitis Scale&quot; every 2 hours during the 24-hour infusion. After starting the amiodarone infusion, the patients were observed for the development of phlebitis for 24 hours until the end of the procedure and for 2 hours after the end of the treatment.</description>
