  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new training program for nurses called PACT&#xD;
      (Partnership, Assessment, Care, and Transition) will be effective and relevant in helping&#xD;
      nurses gain the skills needed to provide high-quality family-centered care. Family-centered&#xD;
      care skills include engaging family caregivers as partners in patient care, and strengthening&#xD;
      their capacity for caregiving by assessing family support needs and facilitating access to&#xD;
      resources when needed. The study will also look at whether the quality of nurses'&#xD;
      family-centered care skills is associated with improved outcomes for family caregivers. Both&#xD;
      nurses and family caregivers will be enrolled in this study. Participants will be&#xD;
      nurses/caregivers who care for advanced GI cancer patients admitted to Memorial Sloan&#xD;
      Kettering.&#xD;

    <description>Partnership, Assessment, Care and Transition to psychosocial resources. Nurses who participate in PACT will receive 8 hours of training in a single, full-day workshop. We will train nurses in clusters of 10-12 nurses at one time, which will allow for cross-coverage with minimal disruption to workflow, and provide a more intimate, small-group learning environment.</description>
