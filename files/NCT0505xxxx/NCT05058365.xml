  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      mindfulness course on the psychological well-being of preschoolers (i.e., attention and&#xD;
      impulsivity, prosocial behavior, empathy, emotion regulation and conduct). Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to either intervention (dots Curriculum) or wait-list control condition.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a computerized task and they will be interviewed to complete a&#xD;
      scenario test before (baseline) and after the intervention. The parents and class teacher&#xD;
      will also be invited to complete a survey at baseline and after the intervention.&#xD;
