  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is the core symptom of unipolar and bipolar depression, which seriously&#xD;
      affects the prognosis of the disease and the rehabilitation of social function. There is no&#xD;
      unified conclusion in the field and severity of cognitive impairment, and the cause of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment is unknown, which may be related to many factors. In this study,the&#xD;
      THINC-it tool was used to study the characteristics of cognitive impairment in unipolar and&#xD;
      bipolar depression by longitudinal follow-up, which provides a theoretical basis for the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of unipolar and bipolar depression. Early identification and&#xD;
      intervention of risk factors can improve the prognosis of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      there is some cognitive impairment in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. There is&#xD;
      no unified conclusion in the field and severity of cognitive impairment, and the cause of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment is unknown, which may be related to many factors. The THINC-it is a&#xD;
      simple, fast and free cognitive assessment tool for cognitive impairment screening of&#xD;
      unipolar and bipolar depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes three steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. baseline: demographic data, theTHINC-it tool , clinical&#xD;
           scales（HAMD-17,HAMA、YMRS、SDS、PSQI） evaluation and Laboratory examination（blood glucose,&#xD;
           blood lipids, BMI）&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. follow-up (4 week): Clinical scales and THINC-it tool were evaluated in unipolar and&#xD;
           bipolar depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. follow-up (12 weeks): all patients with bipolar depression were evaluated by clinical&#xD;
           scales, THINC-it test.&#xD;
