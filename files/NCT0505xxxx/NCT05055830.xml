  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OPTIC is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized study of multiple medications administered&#xD;
      to approximately 2000 children in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) per&#xD;
      routine clinical car by their treating provider. The purpose of this study is to characterize&#xD;
      the PK of drugs routinely administered to children per standard of care using opportunistic&#xD;
      and scavenged samples. The prescribing of drugs to children will not be part of this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the child/adult (&lt;21 years of age) is consented/enrolled, demographic and clinical data&#xD;
      will be extracted from the EHR. Biospecimen information (including date and time of sample&#xD;
      collection) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be conducted on all participants with at least 2 evaluable samples. The&#xD;
      protocol represents minimal risk to the children/adults who provide body fluid for this&#xD;
      study, including potential loss of confidentiality (samples will be assigned a unique&#xD;
      accession number) and risks associated with blood draws. Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events (SAEs) caused by the study specimen collections will be monitored and recorded in the&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.&#xD;

    <description>The goal of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of understudied drugs for which specific dosing recommendations and safety data are lacking. The prescribing of drugs to children will not be part of this protocol. Taking advantage of procedures done as part of routine medical care (i.e. blood draws), this study will serve as a tool to better understand drug exposure in children receiving these drugs per standard of care.</description>
