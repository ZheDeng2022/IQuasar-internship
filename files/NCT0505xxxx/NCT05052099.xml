  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to establish if patients with advanced bile duct cancer,&#xD;
      who have already received a line of treatment for their disease, will receive any associated&#xD;
      benefits from the combination of mFOLFOX6, bevacizumab and atezolizumab as a second-line&#xD;
      therapy All patients who meet the criteria to participate in the study shall receive the&#xD;
      following drugs intravenously every 14 days: mFOLFOX6 combined with Atezolizumab 840 mg and&#xD;
      Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These drugs will be administered until one of the following situations arises: disease&#xD;
      progress, intolerable side effects, pregnancy or if the patient or the doctor decide to stop&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is an antibody that operates on an important receptor of the immune system&#xD;
      (PD1/PD-L1 axis). Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) has already been approved in a number of&#xD;
      countries to treat a range of tumours, although it has not yet been approved for bile duct&#xD;
      tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is an antibody that is joined to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&#xD;
      Bevacizumab was approved for the first time in the USA in 2004 and is now approved in over&#xD;
      100 countries around the world for a variety of conditions. However, it has not yet been&#xD;
      approved for treating bile duct cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mFOLFOX6 is a chemotherapy regime used to treat many kinds of gastrointestinal tumours,&#xD;
      including bile duct cancer, since it is a treatment approved for this type of tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of mFOLFOX6 with atezolizumab and bevacizumab (trial drugs), may bring more&#xD;
      information about an anti-tumour immune response that could improve the results of mFOLFOX6,&#xD;
      which backs up the research on this treatment combination with cancer patients.&#xD;
