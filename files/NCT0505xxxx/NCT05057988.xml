  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current pilot study is to examine a feasibility and the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of Empowered Relief (ER) class when it is delivered 'virtually' to patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain who are on medication treatment for opioid disorder disorder (MOUD). The ER&#xD;
      class is a single-session pain management class, which has demonstrated to be effective in&#xD;
      improving pain and pain-related distress in patients with chronic low back pain, but its&#xD;
      efficacy has not been examined in patients with MOUD and chronic pain. Class participants&#xD;
      will learn self-regulatory skills and develop a personalized plan to use the skills every&#xD;
      day. The current study will examine a feasibility and participant's perception and&#xD;
      satisfaction of this class at post-class. The study will also follow participants 3 months by&#xD;
      administering 5 surveys (baseline, 2 weeks and 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment) to determine whether the class confers the short-term and medium-term&#xD;
      benefits across various aspects of health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a highly prevalent health condition in people receiving medication treatment&#xD;
      for opioid use disorder (MOUD). It is observed that up to 68% of people with MOUD have&#xD;
      chronic pain condition. However, people with MOUD frequently face limited availability of&#xD;
      clinicians offering non-pharmacological pain management programs. Thus, a brief&#xD;
      internet-based pain relief skills program may be one option that can overcome such treatment&#xD;
      barrier. A recent randomized control trial on patients with chronic low back pain has&#xD;
      demonstrated that a single-session, 2-hour, pain management class (Empowered Relief; ER) was&#xD;
      effective to improve pain and pain-related distress. The ER class consists of pain&#xD;
      neuroscience education and self-regulatory skills. While the ER is a promising and scalable&#xD;
      option, it is not yet tested in patients with MOUD and chronic pain. The current proposed,&#xD;
      single-arm, uncontrolled pilot project will determine a) a feasibility in this patient&#xD;
      population, b) patients' perceptions and satisfaction of the ER class and c) preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy to inform the design of a future, larger, controlled trial.&#xD;
