  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery indeed leads to significant weight loss, reduces mortality risk,&#xD;
      obesity-associated comorbidities (Wolfe et al., 2016) and improves functional physical&#xD;
      abilities (Herring et al., 2016). Because these benefits are related to decreased energy&#xD;
      intake, the investigators aim to optimize them by combining them with supervised adapted&#xD;
      physical activity practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the aim of this clinical trial is to measure the effects of a physical training program&#xD;
      on physical fitness, body composition and quality of life of obese women who have undergone&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon hospitalization for their bariatric surgery (bypass or sleeve), subjects will sign their&#xD;
      informed consent and be included in the study. Six weeks' post-surgery, the subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in one of the 2 groups (Control group CG or Adapted Physical Activity group APAG).&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will have 3 postoperative visits one at 6 weeks (V1), one at 18 weeks&#xD;
      (V2) and one at 30 weeks (V3). During these visits, they will undergo the same assessments&#xD;
      (body composition, physical condition, quality of life). Patients in the CG will receive&#xD;
      standard hospital management. Patients in APAG will follow the same management and will also&#xD;
      follow a 3-month physical activity program 3 times a week between V1 and V2. Then, between V2&#xD;
      and V3, no APA program will be offered to both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will evaluate during each visit V1, V2 and V3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical condition,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  daily physical activity&#xD;

    <measure>Impact of obesity on the physical, psycho-social, dietary well-being and dieting experience assessed using the Quality of Life, Obesity and Diet Scale (QOLDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>QoL will be assessed using a simplified version of the French obesity-specific QoL questionnaire developed by Ziegler et al. Each participant will be asked to evaluate 14 statements about their life on a 4-point Likert scale (with 1 representing total disagreement and 4 representing total agreement). The 14 statements (eg, &quot;Because of my weight, I have trouble to dress or undress&quot;) will equally be divided between physical aspects of life and psychosocial aspects of life. A French obesity-specific QoL questionnaire will be used to calculate the participants' physical dimension of QoL scores and psychoso-cial dimension of QoL scores by summing the points for each relevant item (range: 7-28 points). The total score will also be calculated (range: 14-56 points). The higher the scores, the better the QoL.</description>
