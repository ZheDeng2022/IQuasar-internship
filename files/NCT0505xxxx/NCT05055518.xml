  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open, multicenter dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerance&#xD;
      of APL-102 and obtain the relevant data of APL-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors. In&#xD;
      the dose escalation stage, based on the incidence of dose limited toxicity (DLT) and adverse&#xD;
      event (AE), explore and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and phase II recommended&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). After RP2D and administration protocol are determined, an extended study will be&#xD;
      conducted on 6-10 subjects to further evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of APL-102.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be assigned to a dose level of APL-102 in the order of study entry. A total of seven therapeutic dose levels (1mg, 2mg, 3mg, 5mg, 7mg, 9mg and 11mg) are planned. To reduce the number of subjects exposed to potentially ineffective doses and protect the rights and interests of subjects, rapid titration was used in the low-dose group (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg); When approaching the expected effective dose of 5 mg, the &quot;3 + 3&quot; study design was used.</intervention_model_description>
