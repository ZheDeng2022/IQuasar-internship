  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This descriptive study aims to evaluate the experience of adults with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma receiving standard of care isatuximab-irfc through collection of&#xD;
      quantitative, qualitative and wearable data. Fifty adults with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma receiving standard of care isatuximab-irfc will be enrolled across 2 sites,&#xD;
      The University of California San Francisco and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center. Consented participants will be enrolled in a 3-month digital health coaching program&#xD;
      through which electronic patient reported outcomes and wearable activity data will be&#xD;
      collected. Outcomes include treatment experience, quality of life, financial toxicity,&#xD;
      treatment adherence, symptom burden and health self-efficacy. These will be captured by&#xD;
      patient reported outcome measures including the Patient's Qualitative Assessment of&#xD;
      Treatment- Real World (PQAT-RW), Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGIC/S),&#xD;
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (EORTC-QLQ-C30), Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma (QLQ-MY20), and the European&#xD;
      QoL-5 Dimensions (EQ5D), Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Form (CBI-B), Center for Adherence&#xD;
      Support Evaluation (CASE) Medication Adherence Index, Comprehensive Score for Financial&#xD;
      Toxicity (COST) Instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data, including treatment history, healthcare utilization, and co-morbidities, as&#xD;
      well as demographic data will be collected via the electronic health record from each&#xD;
      clinical site. This data will be complemented by qualitative data from a selected cohort of&#xD;
      study participants with a focus on treatment experience ranging from infusion burden,&#xD;
      toxicity management, to overall quality of life. Evaluation of this data in combination will&#xD;
      be used to better understand the treatment experience of individuals on standard of care&#xD;
      isatuximab-irfc specifically, and with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma generally,&#xD;
      contributing to an existing gap in the literature regarding patient reported outcomes from&#xD;
      diverse data sources. Outcomes will be analyzed with attention to the relationship between&#xD;
      social determinants of health, including race, ethnicity, and geographic location, and&#xD;
      treatment experience as reflected in both the qualitative and quantitative data.&#xD;
