  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy young adults will complete three trials in a randomized crossover counter-balanced&#xD;
      order, including two different loads of resistance exercise and sedentary control. During&#xD;
      each trial, blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that high-load and low-load resistance exercise exert similar&#xD;
      metabolic responses.&#xD;
