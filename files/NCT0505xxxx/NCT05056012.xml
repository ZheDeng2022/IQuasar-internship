      This study will involve the collection of follow-up data for patients who previously&#xD;
      participated in the Sjogren's International Clinical Collaborative Alliance (SICCA) study at&#xD;
      the University of Pennsylvania. Clinical data and specimens will be collected from subjects&#xD;
      with objective evidence of dry eye who were or were not diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome at&#xD;
      the time of their initial participation in the SICCA study. Specimens will be collected from&#xD;
      participants which will include tears, saliva, whole blood, serum, DNA and possible labial&#xD;
      minor salivary gland biopsies when indicated. All individuals will participate in a standard&#xD;
      evaluation protocol including an oral, ocular and physical examination, objective tests for&#xD;
      dry eyes and dry mouth and, whenever necessary, a labial minor salivary gland biopsy. The&#xD;
      biopsy requirement is waived for those who have already had positive lip biopsies in the&#xD;
      past.&#xD;

      General study design: This is a single center study that involves follow-up of patients who&#xD;
      previously participated in the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance&#xD;
      (SICCA) at the University of Pennsylvania. Objective evaluation of salivary function will be&#xD;
      done by collecting unstimulated whole and stimulated parotid saliva. Objective evaluation of&#xD;
      lacrimal function will be performed using the Schirmer test I, Lissamine Green staining, and&#xD;
      determining tear break-up time. In a subset of patients, when indicated an objective&#xD;
      evaluation of lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands will be performed by&#xD;
      histologic analysis of labial salivary gland biopsies. Serum autoantibody profiles will be&#xD;
      determined. In addition, specimens such as biopsies, saliva, sera, conjunctival cells, and&#xD;
      tears will be collected. Standardized questionnaires will be used to gain health information.&#xD;

      Subjects will provide approximately 7 tablespoons of blood, which may be used for serology,&#xD;
      isolation of DNA and isolation of lymphocytes. Subject will have whole saliva sampling&#xD;
      performed. These procedures are standardized and validated procedures routinely used for the&#xD;
      evaluation of Sjogren's syndrome. Impression cytology may be performed by numbing the ocular&#xD;
      surface with drops and then applying a membrane to the conjunctival surface of each eye and&#xD;
      the membranes will be stored. A standard Schirmer test will also be performed and strips will&#xD;
      be stored after test completion.&#xD;
