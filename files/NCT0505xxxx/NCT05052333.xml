      This is an observational study examining the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in&#xD;
      several low-resource countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Somalia, Indonesia, Malaysia,&#xD;
      Turkey) and an English-speaking country (USA). The data will be obtained on the measures of&#xD;
      wellbeing (WHO-5), psychological distress (K10), post-traumatic stress (PCL-5),&#xD;
      post-traumatic growth (PTGI), and pandemic-related stress [using a newly developed Covid&#xD;
      Psychosocial Impacts Scale (CPIS)]. Depending on the context, the data will be collected&#xD;
      online employing either unilingual (in native language) or bilingual survey (with English as&#xD;
      a second language) from 500 participants (aged 18 and above) in each of the eight locations&#xD;
      using convenience sampling. Where applicable in some countries (Turkey, Somalia), a follow-up&#xD;
      survey will be repeated after 12 months in the same cohort, which will provide a comparable&#xD;
      data set longitudinally. The findings will enable us to examine the psychosocial impacts of&#xD;
      COVID-19; validate the translations of the CPIS and standardized measures; and determine the&#xD;
      trajectory of study variables with pandemic exposure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing recognition of the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These&#xD;
      impacts likely result from a complex mix of the fear and consequences of infection and the&#xD;
      social and economic effects of public health restrictions. To date, most of the literature in&#xD;
      this field has derived from studies conducted in China, Europe, and the USA. In comparison,&#xD;
      studies investigating the psychological impacts in other regions (especially in low-resource&#xD;
      countries) are scant, despite many of these areas being severely affected by the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. The difficulties in evaluating the psychological impacts of the pandemic in these&#xD;
      regions are compounded by the fact that those standardized measures are often not available&#xD;
      in the languages of these countries, which also limits the comparison of results between&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the unique circumstances of the pandemic, traditional psychosocial scales are not&#xD;
      well suited to investigate the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore,&#xD;
      novel self-report scales are required. Several scales have been derived for this purpose,&#xD;
      which varies in length and focus. While these scales attempt to capture the overall&#xD;
      psychosocial impact of COVID-19, they frequently reflect the context in which they were&#xD;
      developed, limiting their applicability in other countries (e.g., CRISIS V0.1 which has a&#xD;
      US-centric focus). To overcome the limitations noted above we adopted a different approach in&#xD;
      the development of the Covid Psychosocial Impacts Scale (CPIS). We developed a comprehensive&#xD;
      measure that was able to consider both exposures to the immediate impacts of the pandemic,&#xD;
      and the adverse personal, social, and economic consequences that followed. We also recognized&#xD;
      the importance of assessing the positive outcomes and not solely focussing on negative&#xD;
      psychosocial impacts. Importantly, the translatability and applicability to other populations&#xD;
      were given due consideration in scale construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A validation study of CPIS was conducted in New Zealand together with standardized measures&#xD;
      of wellbeing [WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5)] and psychological distress [Kessler Psychological&#xD;
      Distress Scale (K10)] (Ethics Committee reference number F20/005). Despite New Zealand was&#xD;
      spared well with Covid-19, the CPIS exhibited overall strong reliability with moderate to&#xD;
      high discriminant and convergent validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team has also translated CPIS and several standardized measures into eight languages&#xD;
      (Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Bangla, Somali, Turkish, Malay, and Indonesian). Those translations&#xD;
      were carried out using parallel and back-to-back translations by the team of proficient&#xD;
      bilingual research assistants and interpreters who were familiar with the content and&#xD;
      context. The translations were later compared for internal consistency and examined for face&#xD;
      validity. Psychologists and academics working in this field in their countries of origin to&#xD;
      examine the quality of translation and suitability of its use in each country later examined&#xD;
      the expert validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is a part of an ongoing work that aims to examine the psychosocial&#xD;
      impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic both negative and positive in adults (aged 18 and above)&#xD;
      across several low-resource countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Somalia, Indonesia,&#xD;
      Malaysia, Turkey) and an English-speaking country (USA). This will be done employing a&#xD;
      cross-sectional and/or longitudinal design using measures of wellbeing (WHO-5), psychological&#xD;
      distress (K10), post-traumatic stress [PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)], post-traumatic&#xD;
      growth [Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)] and the newly developed CPIS. This study will&#xD;
      provide us with a comparable dataset to determine the trajectory of study variables with&#xD;
      pandemic exposures. The findings will also enable us to further validate the newly developed&#xD;
      CPIS and standardize the translations of CPIS and other standardized measures (WHO-5, K10,&#xD;
      PCL-5, PTGI). We believe that the proposed observational study can make a significant&#xD;
      academic contribution, particularly in countries where there is limited access to newly&#xD;
      developed scales relating to COVID-19 and associated measures of distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is an observational study examining the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic by employing a cross-sectional and/or longitudinal design. The data will be&#xD;
      collected employing either unilingual surveys in the native language (USA, Indonesia,&#xD;
      Bangladesh, Turkey) or bilingual surveys with English as a second language (Pakistan,&#xD;
      Malaysia, Iraq, Somalia). Where applicable, a follow-up survey will be repeated&#xD;
      longitudinally after 12 months in the same cohort in some countries (Turkey, Somalia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval: Human ethics approval has been obtained from the Human Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      University of Otago, New Zealand (Ref No. 21/102). In addition, the named international&#xD;
      collaborators will obtain local authorization or ethical approval in their respective host&#xD;
      universities before the commencement of data collection in a particular location. The time to&#xD;
      obtain this may vary in each location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding: Currently, the team has no available funding to offer compensation to the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments: The study includes standardized self-report measures of wellbeing (WHO-5),&#xD;
      psychological distress (K10), post-traumatic stress (PCL-5), post-traumatic growth (PTGI),&#xD;
      and newly developed measures of pandemic-related stress (CPIS). These measures have been&#xD;
      uploaded on the Qualtrics online survey platform, which has the added advantage of allowing&#xD;
      researchers being able to view responses in English, irrespective of the language it was&#xD;
      completed in. The details of those measures are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO-5: This is a short 5-item measure assessing the mental wellbeing in the last two weeks on&#xD;
      a 6 point Likert scale (0 = At no time, 5 = All of the time). The raw score can range from&#xD;
      0-25; which can be multiplied by 4 to give the final score; with 100 representing the highest&#xD;
      subjective wellbeing rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K10: This is a 10-item measure assessing symptoms of distress and anxiety on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale (1 = None of the time, 5 = All of the time) in the previous 30 days. The raw score can&#xD;
      range from 10-50; with scores 30 and above indicating severe mental disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPIS: A 27-item modified version of the CPIS is used to examine the psychosocial impacts of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. The items ask participants if they have experienced the stressor in&#xD;
      response to COVID-19 (No = 0) and if experienced it further asks to specify stress on a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale (1 = No stress at all, 5 = A lot of stress). Other than the overall&#xD;
      pandemic-related stress score ranging from 0-135, the scores can be computed into 3 factors,&#xD;
      such as personal and family stress, financial stress, and subjective stress rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCL-5: It is a 20-item measure to examine PTSD symptoms in response to COVID-19 in the past&#xD;
      month on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all, 4 = Extremely) with a severity score range&#xD;
      of 0-80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTGI: The PTGI is a 21-item measure to examine the degree of change as a result of COVID-19&#xD;
      on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all, 5 = A lot). The scores can be computed into 5&#xD;
      factors, such as relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change,&#xD;
      and appreciation of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation: Generally, random sampling is used when the prevalence of parameters&#xD;
      in the target population is unknown. This fits well with the current study as there are no&#xD;
      reported pre-sets on the level of prevalence of the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in the general population. Some of the studies that examined the psychosocial&#xD;
      impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic reported 29.1% stress disorders among health care workers in&#xD;
      China. Based on such findings, one can assume that the expected proportion (P) of the&#xD;
      psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 can range between 10% to 90% in the general population. In&#xD;
      addition, researchers suggest that the P-value can be set close to 50% if there are doubts&#xD;
      about P-value. Henceforth, in the current study, to obtain a better estimate and the biggest&#xD;
      sample size, 0.5 will be taken as P with 95% CI and 10% width of CI resulting in the&#xD;
      estimated sample size of 385.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power: The study will have power (p &lt; 0.05, α = 0.8) to show a difference between groups on&#xD;
      any variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data cleaning: Incomplete data sets will be removed before data analyses. Descriptive&#xD;
      Analysis: The demographics (e.g., age, gender, level of education, occupation, exposure to&#xD;
      previous trauma, vaccination status/intention, etc.) and study variables (wellbeing,&#xD;
      psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, post-traumatic growth, and pandemic-related&#xD;
      stress) will be analyzed descriptively using percentages, measures of central tendency (mean,&#xD;
      SD), and standard error of measurement (SEM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z-score Calculation: Standard scores (z-scores) will be computed from the raw scores. This&#xD;
      will enable us to determine if the data set obtained from a non-representative sample is&#xD;
      atypical or not. This will also enable us to compare scores from different data sets (with&#xD;
      different mean and SD) more accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability Analysis: Reliability analyses will be carried out on all the scales to determine&#xD;
      the suitability of its use employing item-total correlations and Cronbach's as a measure of&#xD;
      internal homogeneity and consistency. In the bilingual study, further comparisons between&#xD;
      groups will be undertaken using independent sample t-tests (two-tailed) and Chi-square tests&#xD;
      using LANGUAGE as a grouping variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the longitudinal study, comparisons between groups will be undertaken using paired sample&#xD;
      t-tests (two-tailed) and Chi-square tests using TIME as a grouping variable. The paired&#xD;
      sample t-tests will provide the t-test statistic and p-value for each question pair. To&#xD;
      examine the overall scale test-retest reliability, an intra-class correlation coefficient&#xD;
      will be used to determine the degree of consistency of a measure over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity Analysis: The convergent and discriminant validity of CPIS and its subscale with&#xD;
      other measures of wellbeing and distress will be examined using a correlation matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional Analysis: With-in-subjects and between-subjects designs, as well as&#xD;
      exploratory regression analyses, will be employed to characterize this outcome using t-tests&#xD;
      (two-tailed), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and/or a linear mixed model. The between-subjects&#xD;
      analyses can be carried out using demographic (e.g., gender, language, etc.) and/or&#xD;
      pandemic-related variables (e.g., vaccination) as grouping variables. Lastly, exploratory&#xD;
      analyses will use correlation matrix and ordinary least squares regression analyses to&#xD;
      examine associations between study variables and key demographic factors that may be related&#xD;
      to stress, such as the severity of pandemic exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal Analysis: In the longitudinal dataset, the changes in levels of study variables&#xD;
      from the previous assessment will be carried out using tabular and graphical measures. In&#xD;
      addition, the linear mixed model analysis will be carried out to examine the change in&#xD;
      psychosocial impacts over time.&#xD;

The data will be collected employing a unilingual (Indonesia, Bangladesh, Turkey, USA) or bilingual (Pakistan, Malaysia, Iraq, Somalia) survey.

    <description>Although, the validation of the newly developed CPIS has already been examined in New Zealand. But, relatively speaking, New Zealand has fared well and it is desirable to validate the CPIS in a different English-speaking COVID-19 context, where there have been higher rates of COVID-19 infection. The data will be collected employing a one-off unilingual (English) survey in the USA. Several standardized questionnaires of wellbeing (WHO-5, PTGI) and distress (K10, PCL-5) will be employed together with the CPIS to examine validity.
