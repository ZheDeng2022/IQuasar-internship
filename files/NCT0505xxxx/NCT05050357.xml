      Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a poorly understood association between varicose or&#xD;
      dilated pelvic veins and chronic pelvic pain (CPP). It is also called Pelvic venous syndrome,&#xD;
      Pelvic venous insufficiency, Pelvic varices and Pelvic vascular dysfunction Chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain is defined as chronic or persistent pain perceived in structures related to the pelvis&#xD;
      of either men or women for more than 6 months according to The International Association for&#xD;
      the Study of Pain (IASP). In other words, chronic pelvic pain with associated ovarian vein&#xD;
      varicosities is termed pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) and is an important but&#xD;
      under-diagnosed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Millions of women worldwide\e may suffer with chronic pelvic pain at some time in their life,&#xD;
      and the occurrence may be as high as 39.1%. Chronic pelvic pain may account for 10 to 15% of&#xD;
      outpatient gynecologic visits in the United States.The typical age of patients with this&#xD;
      condition ranges from 20 to 45 years. It is unclear whether there is any genetic or ethnic&#xD;
      predilection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of pelvic congestion syndrome is reflux of blood in the ovarian veins due to the&#xD;
      absence of functioning valves, resulting in retrograde blood flow and eventual venous&#xD;
      dilatation. The cardinal presenting symptom of PCS is pelvic pain, usually described as a&#xD;
      dull ache, without evidence of inflammatory disease. Clinical signs may include vulvar&#xD;
      varicosities extending onto the medial thigh and long saphenous territory as well as&#xD;
      tenderness on deep palpation at the ovarian point; however, such signs are not always&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many women with PCS, the road toward a definitive diagnosis has been long and laborious.&#xD;
      Certainly the diagnosis of PCS continues to challenge all physicians involved. However, a&#xD;
      heightened awareness and clinical suspicion for the specific symptomatology and associated&#xD;
      findings may bring about a more rapid progression to the much anticipated treatment. Pelvic&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) and/or computed tomography (CT) scan are usually the first imaging modalities&#xD;
      in the evaluation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. Both provide excellent resolution of&#xD;
      the uterus. Although a CT scan has greater sensitivity for showing varicosities throughout&#xD;
      the lower pelvis, Two dimensional ultrasound with Doppler examination provides dynamic&#xD;
      information about visualized venous blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopy is often used in patients with chronic pelvic pain in search of a specific&#xD;
      diagnosis. This direct visualization is excellent for ruling out other etiologies distinct&#xD;
      from PCS such as endometriosis. However, because the examination is done supine and requires&#xD;
      insufflation of CO2 gas, there may be compression of varices if present, thereby masking the&#xD;
      diagnosis of PCS.Certainly, the diagnostic venogram continues to provide physicians with a&#xD;
      reliable minimally invasive gold standard tool in patients with PCS.The diagnostic venogram&#xD;
      gives immediate dynamic flow information and measurements of ovarian and pelvic veins with&#xD;
      the option of changing patient position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many treatment modalities have been proposed. Medical management with hormone analogues and&#xD;
      analgesics, surgical ligation of ovarian veins, hysterectomy with or without bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy and transcatheter embolization have been described in the literature as&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with PCS today. Medical treatment of PCS includes&#xD;
      psychotherapy, progestins, danazol, phlebotonics, gonadotropins receptor agonists (GnRH) with&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT), dihydroergotamine, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve clinical efficacy and reduce perioperative and postoperative morbidity,&#xD;
      percutaneous pelvic vein embolization therapy has been utilized. Since its introduction in&#xD;
      1993 by Edwards et al, this modality has revolutionized the treatment of PCS. The procedure&#xD;
      is usually performed at the time of diagnostic venography using a variety of embolic agents,&#xD;
      including sclerosant foam and coils. In several published series in the 1990s, success rates&#xD;
      for reduction of chronic pelvic pain ranged from 50 to 80%. With advancements in technique,&#xD;
      clinical success is achieved in 70 to 85% of treated patients. It was found taht there was&#xD;
      significant improvement in 83% of women in their overall pain perception levels with a mean&#xD;
      of 45 months of long-term follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolotherapy for PCS is an exciting therapy that has proven to be safer over the past two&#xD;
      decades.Chung et al examined the effect of patient stress level on treatment efficacy,&#xD;
      directly comparing hysterectomy with oophorectomy versus venous embolization for the&#xD;
      treatment of PCS. Analysis of pain scores showed that venous embolization was more effective&#xD;
      than hysterectomy, especially for patients who are &quot;typically or moderately highly stressed.&#xD;
      It was demonstrated that PCS patients who underwent ovarian and pelvic venous embolization&#xD;
      have a more durable result in reduction of their pelvic pain.It was reported that there were&#xD;
      no major complications and also did not find any significant changes in the basal&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or estradiol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported complications of embolotherapy are rare (&lt; 4%) and include ovarian vein&#xD;
      thrombophlebitis, recurrence of varices, migration of embolic material, and radiation&#xD;
      exposure to ovaries. Long-term data shows no demonstrable negative effects on menstrual cycle&#xD;
      or fertility from transcatheter embolotherapy, It has proven to be a safe and effective&#xD;
      nonsurgical approach in reducing chronic pelvic pain associated with pelvic venous&#xD;
      incompetence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding our study, we hypothesize that levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is&#xD;
      better than and more effective than oral progestin in treatment of PCS. Because&#xD;
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is local treatment and may cause little side&#xD;
      effects than the oral treatment. In addition, it has better compliance than oral treatment.&#xD;
      Lastly, it contains higher concentration than oral treatment.&#xD;
