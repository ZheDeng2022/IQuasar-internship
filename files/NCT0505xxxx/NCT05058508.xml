    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if there are physical and emotional benefits to&#xD;
      participating in a structured exercise regimen for those who are ages 2-25, are newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with a blood or solid tumor cancer, and are currently undergoing or will begin&#xD;
      cancer treatment.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, controlled trial to investigate if a structured exercise regimen will&#xD;
      have benefit relative to the control arm by increasing and /or maintaining physical&#xD;
      functioning in pediatric subjects undergoing chemotherapy and childhood cancer treatment as&#xD;
      measured by 6-Minute Walk test and BOT-2 Brief or PDMS-2.&#xD;
