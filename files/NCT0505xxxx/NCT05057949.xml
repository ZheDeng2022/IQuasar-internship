    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of rifampin (Part A) and&#xD;
      itraconazole(Part B) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of Larotinib in healthy adult&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Larotinib (Z650). The study assessed the&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction of Larotinib with either a strong cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A inducer,&#xD;
      rifampin (Part A) , or with a strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole (Part B) in healthy adult&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
