    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to find and compare the effect of mirror therapy and constrained&#xD;
      induced movement therapy in upper limb rehabilitation among chronic stroke patient .Study&#xD;
      conducted in THQ Hospital Depalpur. The sample size was 36. Patients were divided into two&#xD;
      groups. In group-A patients were treated with mirror therapy and in group-B patients were&#xD;
      treated with constrained induced movement therapy. Both therapy sessions lasting for 60&#xD;
      minutes for total 1 hour in a day, 5 times a week and for consecutive 3 weeks in a month.&#xD;
      Sessions consist of total 20 min of passive mobilization to both groups, 30 min session for&#xD;
      MMT to 1 group, 30 min session to CIMT (task specific) to another group, and 10 minutes&#xD;
      standard ADL activities. The outcome was calculated with FMA-UE and modified Ashworth scale.&#xD;
      Data was analyzed by SPSS 22.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide stroke affects mostly aged population and thus leads to morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to world health organization stroke causes second most common cases of death and a&#xD;
      leading cause of morbidity in adults. Most developed countries are more affected with stroke&#xD;
      as compared to developing region around the world. Based on WHO record, estimated annual&#xD;
      death rates with stroke was 5.5 million. For optimal functioning, Brain requires sufficient&#xD;
      supply of blood and for this carotid arteries are responsible for supplying oxygen rich blood&#xD;
      to different areas of the brain. As an individual breathes, the brain consumes 20% of oxygen,&#xD;
      which allows it to work efficiently. As in the case of a stroke, brain cells die quickly when&#xD;
      there is a blockage or obstruction of oxygen to the brain by impeded blood flow. Blood&#xD;
      plaques or clots disrupts oxygen rich supply to the brain in ischemic stroke leads to brain&#xD;
      cell death. Whereas, sudden rupturing of blood vessels leads to cell death in hemorrhagic&#xD;
      stoke. Most studies showed that task specific motor programs an repetition of movements on&#xD;
      both upper and lower limbs are more effective interventions14. Various other treatment&#xD;
      protocols are also used for improving limb functions, like visual feedback training,&#xD;
      assistive robotic training, Functional Electrical Stimulator (FES) and Constrained Induced&#xD;
      Movement Therapy (CIMT). These therapies help in improving motor performance from the&#xD;
      affected side of stroke patients. Uni-manual, high intensity training known as Constrained&#xD;
      Induced Movement Therapy or forced use is reported as an effective treatment for training the&#xD;
      motor cortex areas. Task specific or bi-manual programs with rhythmic auditory clues were&#xD;
      also included in this training to improve motor functions. Researcher conducted a latest&#xD;
      study in 2019 by random sampling method to find the effect of mirror therapy for upper limb&#xD;
      rehabilitation. They allocate the participants randomly into three groups based on movement&#xD;
      mirror therapy (MMT), task specific mirror therapy (TMT) and conventional therapy (CT). The&#xD;
      session consists of 30 minutes a day, 5 days in a week and for total 4 weeks. Performance was&#xD;
      measured by FMA-UE, Wolf motor assessment and modified Ash worth scale. The results were the&#xD;
      same for both MMT and TMT for upper limb rehabilitation. In 2018 Yumi Ju et al. Conducted&#xD;
      study in the Korea to examine the effectiveness of mirror therapy and constrained induced&#xD;
      movement therapy for the rehabilitation of the upper extremity for daily life activities. 28&#xD;
      subjects were randomly placed to a weekly session of 5 days and for consecutive 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Performance was measured by Manual Function Test (MFT) and Modified Barthel Index(BI) to find&#xD;
      the factor which is affecting the activities of daily livings. They concluded that patients&#xD;
      actively participate in activities of daily livings by actively moving their affected.&#xD;
      Previous researches based on the effectiveness of mirror therapy and constrained induced&#xD;
      movement therapy alone or combined with other rehabilitative therapies for improving upper&#xD;
      limb rehabilitation in different patients having neurological impairments. Their outcomes&#xD;
      were evaluated on different outcome measurement tools and their were significant improvement&#xD;
      in patients functional independence and had good quality of life.&#xD;
