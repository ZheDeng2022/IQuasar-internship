  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test whether the investigational drug marizomib is safe and&#xD;
      effective when used in combination with standard of care drugs for the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 single-arm study, incorporating two cohorts and using the combination of&#xD;
      marizomib plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)&#xD;
      patients and in RRMM patients with CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves a three drug chemotherapy regimen which includes taking the&#xD;
      study drug marizomib, as well as pomalidomide and dexamethasone. The U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) has not approved marizomib as a treatment for any disease. The U.S. Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pomalidomide and dexamethasone as a treatment&#xD;
      option for multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits. As the study is looking for the highest dose of the study&#xD;
      drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in&#xD;
      participants that have multiple myeloma, not everyone who participates in this research study&#xD;
      will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose received will depend on the number of&#xD;
      participants who have been previously enrolled in the study and how well participants have&#xD;
      tolerated their doses. Participants will receive study treatment for as long as participants&#xD;
      do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 48 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bristol-Myers Squibb is supporting this research study by providing funding and study drug.&#xD;
