  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a deadly disease that is becoming increasingly common in the United&#xD;
      States. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a pre-cancerous state that can develop into esophageal&#xD;
      cancer, but is highly treatable. Progression of BE to esophageal cancer is still common due&#xD;
      to missed diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus recurrence following treatment. Wide-Area&#xD;
      Trans-Epithelial Sampling (WATS-3D) is a new technology that uses brush sampling to examine&#xD;
      larger areas of the esophagus as compared to conventional biopsies. Preliminary studies show&#xD;
      improved detection of cancerous changes in Barrett's esophagus surveillance. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to see if the addition of WATS-3D increases the rate of detection of&#xD;
      recurrent BE following treatment, which is of the utmost importance since it would allow for&#xD;
      earlier re-treatment of disease and ultimately allow for prevention of progression to&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) affects 5-15% of all patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      and approximately 1-2% of the entire population. The stepwise progression of BE from&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia (IM) to dysplasia can ultimately lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (EAC). There are over 15,000 cases of EAC diagnosed in the United States each year.&#xD;
      Regardless of stage of disease at time of diagnosis, the 5-year survival for EAC is an&#xD;
      abysmal 19%. Endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) has been shown to be very effective in&#xD;
      preventing progression of dysplastic BE to EAC with rates of complete eradication of&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) &gt; 90%. This is of paramount importance given the poor outcomes&#xD;
      associated with the development of EAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite high success rates in achieving CE-IM, recent studies show that the recurrence of IM&#xD;
      following CE-IM occurs with annual incidence of 8-10% and a 2-3% dysplasia rate per patient&#xD;
      year of follow-up. The current paradigm of endoscopic surveillance following CE-IM focuses on&#xD;
      random biopsies, which has raised concerns about sampling error and missed recurrence of IM&#xD;
      and dysplasia leading to increased risk of interval development of EAC. New technologies,&#xD;
      such as Wide-Area Trans-Epithelial Sampling (WATS-3D; CDx Diagnostics, Suffern, NY) have been&#xD;
      studied to improve detection of dysplasia in BE. WATS-3D involves abrasive brush sampling of&#xD;
      the esophagus that is then processed by a validated computer imaging system and subsequently&#xD;
      reviewed by pathologist. Prior studies have shown increased dysplasia detection in routine BE&#xD;
      surveillance with WATS-3D over standard biopsies, however there are no published data as to&#xD;
      the additive value of WATS-3D for detection of recurrence of disease after endoscopic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite high success rates of successful eradication of BE with EET, recurrence rates are&#xD;
      still high. Current Seattle Protocol biopsies for Post-EET surveillance is time-consuming,&#xD;
      difficult to reproduce, and often misses IM recurrence putting patients at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing EAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of WATS-3D to standard four-quadrant biopsies&#xD;
      driven by HD-WLE and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) will increase the rate of detection of&#xD;
      recurrence of IM and dysplasia in patients who have undergone EET. To that end, increased&#xD;
      recurrent IM detection will allow for proper choice of repeat EET and decreased progression&#xD;
      to EAC. The specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the additive diagnostic yield of WATS-3D sampling beyond that of standard&#xD;
           biopsies for detection of IM or dysplasia (recurrence) in patients who have undergone&#xD;
           EET for BE-related neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the difference in additive diagnostic yield of WATS-3D sampling beyond that of&#xD;
           standard biopsies between CE-IM as defined by a single exam without IM vs. &gt;1 exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the impact of order of tissue acquisition techniques on detection of recurrent&#xD;
           IM or dysplasia (via randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a prospective multi-center design over 24 months. The&#xD;
      participating centers will include Northwestern University, Washington University in St.&#xD;
      Louis, University of Colorado and University of California, Los Angeles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 200 patients will be in enrolled in this prospective study. All patients who&#xD;
           have completed EET with at least one endoscopy with biopsies demonstrating no evidence&#xD;
           of IM will be eligible for enrollment in the study. Enrollment will occur in the setting&#xD;
           of outpatient clinic visit or in the endoscopy lab. The PI or study coordinator will&#xD;
           meet with the patient and discuss the study, its objectives, and expectations and&#xD;
           informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolled subjects will have completed EET as per clinical standard of care within the&#xD;
           framework of the following study design. Standard EET will be defined as resection of&#xD;
           visible lesions and ablative therapy (either radio frequency ablation or cryo-therapy).&#xD;
           Once complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) is achieved as defined as no&#xD;
           recurrence of BE endoscopically or on forceps biopsies for at least a single EGD,&#xD;
           patients will then undergo post-EET surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While adhering to standard post-EET surveillance endoscopy intervals, on a prospective&#xD;
           basis, the investigators will add WATS-3D to the surveillance protocol. Each patient&#xD;
           will be randomized to one of two groups. The first group will undergo biopsies with&#xD;
           standard forceps first, followed by tissue sampling with WATS-3D. The second group will&#xD;
           undergo tissue sampling with WATS-3D first, followed by biopsies with standard forceps.&#xD;
           The forceps biopsies will then be examined by expert pathologists at each respective&#xD;
           institution, while the WATS-3D samples will be evaluated at a central laboratory. Each&#xD;
           surveillance endoscopy will follow current standard inspection with HD-WLE and NBI.&#xD;
           Forceps biopsies will be obtained from: a) the gastric cardia, b) the new squamocolumnar&#xD;
           junction, and c) targeted/neosquamous sampling of the original BE segment. WATS-3D&#xD;
           brushing will be performed of the: a) squamocolumnar junction to include and visible&#xD;
           islands and b) the neosquamous zone representative of the original BE segment. WATS-3D&#xD;
           brushings will be taken in 5 cm esophageal segments of the neo-squamous mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All physicians will participate in a training session (virtual) which will discuss the&#xD;
           use of WATS-3D and ensure all sampling is standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a patient is randomized, all subsequent surveillance endoscopies will follow the&#xD;
           same tissue sampling order. For instance, if a patient is assigned to the group that&#xD;
           will undergo tissue sampling with WATS-3D first, followed by biopsies with standard&#xD;
           forceps second, all surveillance endoscopies will follow sampling in this order.&#xD;
           Patients will continue in the study for 2 consecutive endoscopies using this sampling&#xD;
           protocol. All patients will be followed longitudinally for the duration of their&#xD;
           endoscopy surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will then compare the detection of IM and dysplastic cells obtained&#xD;
           via Seattle Protocol biopsies to WATS-3D obtained samples.&#xD;
