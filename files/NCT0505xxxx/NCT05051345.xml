  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial seeks to increase access to smoking cessation services to low-income pregnant&#xD;
      women. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Smoking during&#xD;
      pregnancy smoking is associated with an increased risk of low birth weight, a condition that&#xD;
      is associated with neonatal, perinatal, and infant morbidity and mortality. The overall goal&#xD;
      of this trial is to help patients make healthy choices and provide support during pregnancy&#xD;
      and in the first few months after the birth of the baby.&#xD;

      receive 3 separate Smoke-Free Homes mailings over 6 weeks, and a coaching call from a Baby&#xD;
