  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An equivalent parallel randomized clinical trial was approved by the local University&#xD;
      Committee of Ethics. 260 children with necrotic primary molars were allocated into 2 equal&#xD;
      groups (82 children per group). The participants were allocated into two groups; group &quot;1&quot;&#xD;
      teeth were instrumented with OneShape rotary system (Micro Mega, Besancon, France), and group&#xD;
      &quot;2&quot; teeth were instrumented with WaveOne Gold reciprocating system (Dentsply Maillefer,&#xD;
      Ballaigues, Switzerland). Postoperative pain was assessed using a four-point pain intensity&#xD;
      rating scale adopted from Wong-Baker FACES (WBF) pain scale . The face scale consists of four&#xD;
      faces with a brief title describing each face representing a scale from the first face (score&#xD;
      1), second face (score 2), third face (score 3), and forth face (score 4) 3. Postoperative&#xD;
      pain was assessed at 6 six time intervals (at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and one-week).&#xD;

    <description>File size 25 with a taper of 0.06 was mounted to a 6:1 speed-reduction headpiece powered by X Smart Plus endomotor (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). The speed and torque were set to 400 rpm and 1 N.cm torque, respectively. In a picking motion without pressure, mechanical preparation began with the first RC two-thirds followed by the next 3 mm followed by the full WL.</description>

    <description>A Primary file size 25 a taper of 0.07 was installed to pre-programmed reciprocation angles and speed for the WaveOne system handpiece of an endomotor (X Smart Plus endomotor (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). After ensuring a passive fit of the hand file along the predetermined WL, the RC coronal two-thirds was initially instrumented then followed by the full WL.</description>
