  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the composite score of gastrointestinal symptoms, (bloating score + abdominal cramping score + stomach noises score + flatulence score), in the treatment groups as compared to control, reported daily in the eDiary</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate each symptom on a 0-5 scale (0 = no symptoms; 5 = severe symptoms). A sum of each of the symptom scores is calculated minimum possible score is 0 and maximum is 30. Higher scores indicate worsening Gastrointestinal symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Type 6 (Fluffy pieces with ragged edges - a mushy stool) or Type 7 (Watery, no solid pieces - entirely liquid) Bristol Stool Scale score, in the treatment groups as compared to control, recorded daily in the eDiary.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will identify each bowel movement 'type' using the Bristol Stool Scale (Type 1 = hard stool difficult to pass [classified as severe constipation]; Type 7 = watery, entirely liquid stool [classified as severe diarrhea]). 'Normal' stool is considered to be Types 3 and 4; Type 5 would suggest the participant lacks dietary fiber, and Types 6 and 7 would be considered to suggest mild and severe diarrhea, respectively. This endpoint will show the incidence of participants experiencing 'diarrhea' Type stool. A lower incidence of diarrhea-type stools would indicate higher fiber content in the groups diet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Difference in mean and highest Bristol Stool Scale score, in the treatment groups as compared to control, reported daily in the eDiary</measure>

    <measure>Absolute change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) total score, in the treatment groups as compared to control, from baseline to Day 7 of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire contains 15 items, each uses a seven-graded Likert scale, where 1 represents the most positive option (no symptoms) and 7 the most negative one (severe symptoms). The participant will answer each question with respect to their experience over the last 7 days. To calculate the Total Score, each of the 15 item scores will be used to calculate a mean Total Score: minimum possible score = 0; maximum possible score = 7; higher scores indicate worse symptoms.&#xD;
As the recall period is 7 days, the Baseline value will give a score from Day -6 to Day 0, and the Day 7 value will give a score from Day 1 to Day 7 - a 14 day period overall.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of out of range blood safety parameters (Chemistry and FBC), in the treatment groups as compared to control, from baseline to Day 14 of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will report the incidence of 'out of range' blood safety parameters assessed from a standard safety chemistry panel (ALT, AST, BUN, Chloride, Creatinine, Potassium, Protein, Sodium) and a standard safety hematology panel (WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelets, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW). 'Out of range' is determined based on clinically defined 'normal' ranges for each analyte. A higher incidence of 'out of range' blood safety parameters would be a worse safety outcome in this case.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of out of range Urinalysis safety parameters in the treatment groups as compared to control, from baseline to Day 14 of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will report the incidence of 'out of range' Urinalysis safety parameters (Glucose, Bilirubin, Ketone, Specific Gravity, Blood, pH, Protein, Urobilinogen, Nitrite and Leukocyte Esterase). 'Out of range' is determined based on clinically defined 'normal' ranges for each analyte. A higher incidence of 'out of range' urinalysis safety parameters would be a worse safety outcome in this case.</description>
