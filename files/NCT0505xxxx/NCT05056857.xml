    <textblock>
      This study examines the long-term effects of tamoxifen (TAM) treatment on excessive&#xD;
      production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) and their impact on breast cancer and side&#xD;
      effects. NET are produced by the body to fight infections but have also been linked to side&#xD;
      effects caused by the body's immune system. Treatment with tamoxifen increases the production&#xD;
      of NETs. This study may help researchers determine if the increased number of NETs in the&#xD;
      body has a damaging effect in breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effect of long-term tamoxifen (TAM) treatment on excessive NET formation in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To understand the molecular mechanisms of tamoxifen-induced NET formation in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients by examining the effect of long-term TAM treatment on the NET-induced factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate the extend of NET formation with clinical data on tamoxifen resistance, drug&#xD;
      side-effects, cancer metastasis and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the association between the extent of NET formation and clinical data for&#xD;
      breast cancer patients treated with TAM in combination with other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples and their medical charts are reviewed.&#xD;

        Pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+)&#xD;
        breast cancer being treated with tamoxifen for at least 6 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age criteria for pre-menopausal group: Equal to or greater than 18 years of age and&#xD;
             less than or equal to 45 years of age. Patients of age 46-50 will be included if they&#xD;
             have not had menstrual cessation for 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age criteria for menopausal group: At least 51 years of age (median age of menopause).&#xD;
             Menopause is defined as cessation of menstrual cycle for 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being treated with tamoxifen (TAM) for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CONTROL SUBJECTS: Newly diagnosed ER+ breast cancer patients of the same age group as&#xD;
             above on TAM for 0-6 months. This criterion is based on our preliminary results&#xD;
             showing that patients taking TAM for 6-7 months exhibit near baseline level of NETs&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is terminal (expected survival &lt; 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent unobtainable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant -The immune modulations geared toward maintenance of pregnancy are known to&#xD;
             cause wide-spread alterations in innate and adaptive immune cell functions. In this&#xD;
             scenario, divorcing the pregnancy-related changes in myeloid cell function from those&#xD;
             relevant to sepsis and cancer will be complicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe congenital neutropenia due to genetic disorders, such as Kostmann&#xD;
             Disorder (HAX1 gene mutation), ELA2 gene mutation, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS),&#xD;
             growth factor independent 1 protein (GFI1) gene mutation, colony stimulating factor 3&#xD;
             receptor (CSF3R) gene mutation, Schwachman-Diamond syndrome, Barth syndrome, warts,&#xD;
             hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome, and&#xD;
             Chadiak-Higashi syndrome (this list notably does not include myelodysplastic syndrome,&#xD;
             or acute/chronic myeloid leukemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disorders, which can affect the body's inflammatory response,&#xD;
             such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and&#xD;
             psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis),&#xD;
             which can lead to reduced or variable immune cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent positive coronavirus disease (COVID) test&#xD;
