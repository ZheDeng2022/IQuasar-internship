  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Leading to Dose Interruption/Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with onset after the start of investigational product, or any worsening of a preexisting medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of investigational product and throughout the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Nonadherence With the Safe-Use Conditions for Administration of ZULRESSO®</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nonadherence is defined by failure of any of the following:&#xD;
Home infusion provider to train all pharmacy and healthcare providers (HPs) involved in dispensing/administration of ZULRESSO® on risk of excessive sedation/loss of consciousness&#xD;
Home HPs to counsel participants on risk of excessive sedation and loss of consciousness&#xD;
Deliver ZULRESSO® per protocol&#xD;
Provide preprogrammed peristaltic pump&#xD;
Home HP: assess for excessive sedation every 2 hrs in planned nonsleep periods, change infusion bag per protocol, available in participants home during infusion&#xD;
Fall protocol in place&#xD;
Monitor participants with pulse oximeter&#xD;
Stop infusion when i) participant is primary caregiver of dependents, ii) identification of excessive sedation/loss of consciousness/hypoxic episode&#xD;
Caution participants postinfusion against engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness&#xD;
Complete AE special interest/Serious AE form&#xD;
Infusion resumed after episode of hypoxia</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Use-Related Issues Related to the Home Administration of ZULRESSO®</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the duration of the infusion, home healthcare provider staff will complete checklists and/or journals at the end of each day and/or shift to document any use-related issues, including how the issues were addressed and followed-up. Any use-related issues determined to be critical in nature will be followed up immediately by a remote human factors team member so that the information is recent and can be reported adequately and analyzed for root causes.</description>
