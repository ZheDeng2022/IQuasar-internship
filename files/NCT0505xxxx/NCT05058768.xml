  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exosomes in the experimental group and the control group were sequenced to find the&#xD;
      difference of the two groups, providing a basis for subsequent basic research.&#xD;

      This study is an observational study, mainly collected by infection, trauma, burns and other&#xD;
      non cardiac causes without any related comprehensive character drug treatment of acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress (ARDS) in patients with blood, urine or alveolar lavage fluid specimens,&#xD;
      used to extract exosomes for omics sequencing, relevant histomorphic variations in exosomes&#xD;
      of this disease were obtained, In addition, functional verification of genes or proteins with&#xD;
      different changes will be carried out to provide clinical basis for subsequent basic&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

        The experimental group was patients with acute lung injury, which was caused by various&#xD;
        direct and indirect injury factors of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial&#xD;
        cells, resulting in diffuse pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema, resulting in acute&#xD;
