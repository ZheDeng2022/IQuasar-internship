  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Promus Premier below-the-knee (BTK) drug-eluting stent (DES) is specifically designed to&#xD;
      improve BTK vessel patency rates using a platinum-chromium alloy based stent that elutes the&#xD;
      anti-restenotic drug everolimus to inhibit neo-intimal hyperplasia. Although DES stents are&#xD;
      considered standard of care for certain BTK lesions, there is a paucity of data on the use of&#xD;
      DES in the contemporary BTK chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) population, especially&#xD;
      in Singapore. The aim of the Promus PREMIER BTK registry is to collect one year data of the&#xD;
      Boston Scientific Promus PREMIER BTK DES in BTK lesions in CLTI patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic condition in which chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of the arteries may result in CLTI and ultimately limb loss without treatment.&#xD;
      This problem is likely to worsen with the increasing global prevalence of diabetes. The&#xD;
      arterial blockage for diabetic CLTI patients occur predominantly in the BTK arteries which&#xD;
      are challenging to treat effectively due to the high incidence of elastic recoil and high&#xD;
      stenosis rates after plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) of these often calcified lesions.&#xD;
      The additional use of BTK drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have also not demonstrated any&#xD;
      significant improvements compared to POBA. The Boston Scientific Promus Premier BTK DES is a&#xD;
      next generation DES specifically designed to improve BTK vessel patency using a&#xD;
      platinum-chromium alloy-based stent that elutes everolimus. It is made with the most&#xD;
      radiopaque biocompatible alloy available with superior axial strength, exceptional&#xD;
      conformability, maximum fracture resistance, higher radial strength and less recoil compared&#xD;
      to cobalt alloy stent. It also has the highest labelled post-dilatation limits compared to&#xD;
      other stents, providing clinicians with more flexibility during procedures. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up at 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month post-intervention to assess primary and&#xD;
      secondary efficacy and safety.&#xD;
