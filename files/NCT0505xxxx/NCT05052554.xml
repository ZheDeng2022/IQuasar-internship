    <textblock>
      PQ-504a-001 (Fuchs Focus) is an open-label, single-dose, exploratory study to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and corneal endothelium molecular biomarker(s) in subjects with Fuchs&#xD;
      Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy with Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion in the TCF4 gene (FECD3).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PQ-504a-001 (Fuchs Focus) is an open-label, intra-subject-controlled study in subjects with&#xD;
      FECD3 scheduled for Descemet's Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty with preemptive lens&#xD;
      replacement surgery (LRS/DMEK) in both eyes as part of routine clinical practice. Each&#xD;
      subject will go through the following two parts in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Part A without study drug administration: Part A of the study starts once LRS/DMEK of the&#xD;
      first eye (hereafter called Eye 1) has been scheduled and subject eligibility has been&#xD;
      confirmed. During the LRS/DMEK of Eye 1 corneal endothelium will be collected to assess&#xD;
      selected molecular biomarkers. According to routine clinical practice, subjects will then be&#xD;
      monitored for at least 4 weeks and up to approximately 6 months to evaluate recovery of Eye 1&#xD;
      prior to scheduling LRS/DMEK of the second eye (hereafter called Eye 2). The duration of the&#xD;
      follow-up period also depends on the availability of cornea transplant material for Eye 2.&#xD;
      Data generated during this part will serve as intra-subject control for data generated in&#xD;
      Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Part B with study drug administration: Part B of the study starts once LRS/DMEK in Eye 2&#xD;
      can be scheduled and subject eligibility for Part B has been confirmed. At least 4 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the scheduled LRS/DMEK in Eye 2, the subject will receive a single dose of QR-504a&#xD;
      administered intravitreally in Eye 2. During the LRS/DMEK in Eye 2 corneal endothelium will&#xD;
      be collected for molecular biomarker assessments and subjects will continue to be followed&#xD;
      for safety and tolerability for at least 12 months post-surgery (ie, at least 13 months post&#xD;
      dosing).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of FECD3 with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  confirmed presence of trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion in the TCF4 gene (50&#xD;
                  TNRs or more as determined by PCR),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  symmetrical disease progression in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
