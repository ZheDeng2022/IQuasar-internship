      The purpose of this study is to examine the pre, post, and follow up effects of a single&#xD;
      ZILRETTA knee injection vs a single CELESTONE SOLUSPAN knee injection on physiological&#xD;
      measure of self-reported quality of life, pain, physical function, and physical performance&#xD;
      in individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain. The Primary Investigator (PI) will recruit&#xD;
      20 symptomatic knee OA patients for this study. Patients will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms, Arm 1 (ZILRETTA injection) or Arm 2 (CELESTONE SOLUSPAN injection). Patients&#xD;
      in Arm 1 will receive a single 5 mL IV injection of 32 mg ZILRETTA into the affected knee&#xD;
      joint. Patients in Arm 2 will receive a 5ml IV injection of 6mg/ml CELESTONE SOLUSPAN into&#xD;
      the affected knee joint. Each study arm will include 10 patients. All data will be collected&#xD;
      prior to injection (baseline), as well as at 6-week (post 1) and 12-week follow-ups (post 2).&#xD;
      Patients will blinded to treatment arm until after they complete their 12-week follow up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) often experience pain and difficulty completing&#xD;
      many everyday activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. It is a major cause of lost&#xD;
      work time and a serious disability for many people. Although there is no cure for arthritis,&#xD;
      there are many treatment options available to help manage pain and keep people active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ZILRETTA knee injection and CELESTONE knee injection are both FDA approved,&#xD;
      extended-release corticosteroid, and are both common nonsurgical treatment options for&#xD;
      patients with OA. Currently, there are no studies that have compared ZILRETTA and CELESTONE&#xD;
      SOLUSPAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Aims Specific Aim 1: To determine the difference between intra-articular (IA) injection of&#xD;
      Zilretta and intra-articular injection of Celestone in patients with knee OA improves&#xD;
      physical performance (OARSI recommended physical performance measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis 1: Patients who receive knee IA injection of Zilretta or Celestone&#xD;
      experience improved physical performance detectable at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the difference between IA injection of Zilretta and IA injection&#xD;
      of Celestone in patients with knee OA improves physical function (KOOS-PF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Patients who receive knee IA injection of Zilretta or Celestone report improved&#xD;
      patient-reported physical function (KOOS-PS) at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the difference between knee IA injection of Zilretta or&#xD;
      Celestone in patients with knee OA improves quality of life (KOOS-QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Patients who receive knee IA injection of Zilretta or Celestone report improved&#xD;
      quality of life (KOOS-QoL) detectable at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To determine the difference between knee IA injection of Zilretta or&#xD;
      Celestone in patients with knee OA improves pain based on numeric pain rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Patients who receive knee IA injection of Zilretta or Celestone report improved&#xD;
      pain level detectable at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Research Plan and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Objective The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Zilretta compared&#xD;
           to Celestone for improving quality of life, pain, neuromuscular function, and physical&#xD;
           performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design The proposed study will compare Zilretta and Celestone effectiveness on&#xD;
           patient-reported outcomes (quality of life, neuromuscular functioning, and pain) and&#xD;
           physical performance (30-second chair standing test, 40m fast-paced walking test, stair&#xD;
           ascent) related to knee arthritis. Patients will be chosen based on the level of&#xD;
           arthritis of the knee and interest in non-surgical treatment options. After informed&#xD;
           consent but before injection, Patients will be randomized into Zilretta or Celestone&#xD;
           treatment arms. Patients will be consented and seen at baseline, in clinic at 6-weeks,&#xD;
           and phone call follow-up at 12-weeks. Demographic information as well as any comorbidity&#xD;
           or adverse events related to poor healing will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing informed consent but prior to injection, patients will complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OARSI recommended physical performance tests (30-second chair standing test, 40m&#xD;
           fast-paced walking test, stair ascent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KOOS-PS (Physical Function Shortform) - 7 questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KOOS-Quality of life subscale (QoL) - 4 questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 6-week (Post 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6-week follow up visit with the PI, patients will complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OARSI recommended physical performance tests (30-second chair standing test, 40m&#xD;
           fast-paced walking test, stair ascent) 12 weeks after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KOOS-PS (Physical Function Shortform) - 7 questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KOOS-Quality of life subscale (QoL) - 4 questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 12-week (Post 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12-weeks post-injection, the Clinical Research Coordinator (CCRC) or Research Assistant&#xD;
      (RA) will call each patient and patients will complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KOOS-PS (Physical Function Shortform) - 7 questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KOOS-Quality of life subscale (QoL) - 4 questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients indicate any adverse events, high levels of pain, or have medical questions, the&#xD;
      CCRC or RA will schedule the patient to be seen by the PI.&#xD;
