      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and safety of the clinical&#xD;
      application of ultrasound capsule endoscopy in esophageal examination compared with&#xD;
      conventional endoscopic ultrasound examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wireless capsule endoscopy has opened a new era by enabling remote diagnostic assessment of&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract in a painless procedure. However, most commercially available&#xD;
      devices only utilise optical imaging to examine the GI wall surface. Using this sensing&#xD;
      modality, pathology within the GI wall cannot be detected. Micro-ultrasound (mUS) using&#xD;
      high-frequency (&gt;20 MHz) ultrasound can provide a means of transmural or cross-sectional&#xD;
      image of the GI tract. Depth of imaging is approximately 10 mm with a resolution of between&#xD;
      40-120 μm that is sufficient to differentiate between subsurface histologic layers of the&#xD;
      various regions of the GI tract. Ultrasound capsule endoscopy (USCE) uses a capsule equipped&#xD;
      with mUS transducers that are capable of imaging below the GI wall surface, offering thereby&#xD;
      a complementary sensing technique to optical imaging capsule endoscopy. In this work, a USCE&#xD;
      device integrated with a 40 MHz ultrasonic transducer was developed to capture a full 360˚&#xD;
      image of the lumen. Previous animal studies of two anaesthetised Landrace pigs have&#xD;
      demonstrated the effectiveness of the device. The reconstructed images demonstrate clear&#xD;
      layer differentiation of the lumen wall. The tissue thicknesses measured from the B-scan&#xD;
      images show good agreement with ex vivo images from the literature. The aim of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to assess the feasibility and safety of the clinical application of ultrasound&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy in esophageal examination compared with conventional endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
