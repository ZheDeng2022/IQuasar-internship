      This phase II/III trial compares the effect of immunotherapy with atezolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with standard chemotherapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide&#xD;
      versus standard therapy alone for the treatment of poorly differentiated extrapulmonary&#xD;
      (originated outside the lung) small cell neuroendocrine cancer. The other aim of this trial&#xD;
      is to compare using atezolizumab just at the beginning of treatment versus continuing it&#xD;
      beyond the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of medications known&#xD;
      as platinum-containing compounds that work by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It&#xD;
      blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill cancer&#xD;
      cells. Giving atezolizumab in combination with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and&#xD;
      etoposide may work better in treating patients with poorly differentiated extrapulmonary&#xD;
      small cell neuroendocrine cancer compared to standard therapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin&#xD;
      or carboplatin) and etoposide alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the combination of induction platinum/etoposide and atezolizumab followed by&#xD;
      maintenance atezolizumab (Arm 1) versus induction platinum/etoposide alone (Arm 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the combination of induction platinum/etoposide and atezolizumab followed by&#xD;
      observation (Arm 2) versus induction platinum/etoposide alone (Arm 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the combination of induction platinum/etoposide and atezolizumab followed by&#xD;
      maintenance atezolizumab (Arm 1) versus the combination of induction platinum/etoposide and&#xD;
      atezolizumab followed by observation (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall survival (OS), measured from start of observation/maintenance, across&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare progression free survival (PFS) (measured from randomization and measured from&#xD;
      start of observation/maintenance) across arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare objective response rate (ORR = confirmed and unconfirmed partial response&#xD;
      [PR] + confirmed and unconfirmed complete response [CR]) across arms among patients with&#xD;
      measurable disease at randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare clinical benefit rate (CBR = confirmed and unconfirmed PR + confirmed and&#xD;
      unconfirmed CR + stable disease [SD]) across arms among patients with measurable disease at&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare duration of response (DOR) across arms. VI. To evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank tumor and blood samples for future biomarker correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: During induction phase, patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 of each cycle, carboplatin IV over 60 minutes or cisplatin IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 of each cycle, and etoposide IV on days 1-3 of each cycle. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      During maintenance phase, patients receive atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of each&#xD;
      cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: During induction phase, patients receive atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of&#xD;
      each cycle, carboplatin IV over 60 minutes or cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of each&#xD;
      cycle, and etoposide IV on days 1-3 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      observation for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: During induction phase, patients receive carboplatin IV over 60 minutes or cisplatin&#xD;
      IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and etoposide IV on days 1-3 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo observation for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.&#xD;
