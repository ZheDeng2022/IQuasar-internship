  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease characterised by&#xD;
      the appearance of lesions, characterised by heterogeneity in their anatomopathological,&#xD;
      clinical and radiological presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its aetiology is complex and multifactorial, with genetic and environmental interactions with&#xD;
      a predominance in women (3:1) and is the second leading cause of disability in young adults&#xD;
      (25-30 years). It has a socio-economic impact, affecting interpersonal relationships and&#xD;
      causing a significant reduction in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OBJECTIVE To assess the effect on spasticity of the Percutaneous Ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      Neuromodulation (PMN) technique in patients diagnosed with MS with upper limb spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in the strength parameter of the wrist flexor musculature wrist before&#xD;
           and after the application of a PMN programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in the functionality scales (modified Asworth, established for&#xD;
           spasticity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in the range of motion (ROM) of the joints under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess changes in the quality of life scale (MSQOL54).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the adverse effects of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a Percutaneous Echoguided Neuromodulation (PNM) in the median nerve&#xD;
      at the elbow, medial to the brachial artery, running between the humeral and ulnar heads of&#xD;
      the pronator teres muscle. Once the nerve is located, a needle shall be inserted in the&#xD;
      vicinity of the nerve and is stimulated using an electrical current with a frequency of 10&#xD;
      Hz, with a pulse width of 250 µs and a tolerable intensity causing a visible muscle cont&#xD;
      raction for 1.5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessing the correct application of ethics in the study, it was decided to use the&#xD;
      individual's own baseline data as a control group, as simulating the technique is complex.&#xD;

    <description>9HP: Test to assess limb function upper / hand. The patient is asked to incorporate 9 pins into a board with 9 holes, one in each hole, as fast as they can using their dominant hand. Once the test is done, it is repeated one more time for each hand.</description>

    <description>Dynamometer: Dynamometry is an objective way of measuring muscle strength performed by an individual, managing to express it as a quantitative variable, which facilitates its assessment.</description>

    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Goniometer: Is used to assess changes in the range of motion (ROM) of the joints. The measurements made can be influenced by different factors: the ability to locate appropriate anatomical landmarks, evaluator experience, sex, weight, and age of the subject, as well as the type of joint. the level of reliability in the scan is somewhat greater in the joints of the upper limb than in the lower limb and this rises when more measurements are taken by the same examiner and on the same day.</description>
