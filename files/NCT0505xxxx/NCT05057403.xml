  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational cohort study to cross-sectionally assess the health of multiple&#xD;
      organs, using multiparametric abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and understand&#xD;
      if resulting MRI metrics can predict future clinical events over a period of 10 years, in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and concurrent diabetic retinopathy (as per their&#xD;
      standard of care).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-site study adopting a prospective, observational cohort study design.&#xD;
      There will be no intervention to the standard of care. Study participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study for a total of 10 years, with only 1 month of active participation. Participants&#xD;
      will be required to attend a screening visit and 2 study visits. The screening visit will&#xD;
      involve a medical review and receiving informed consent based on the participant information&#xD;
      leaflet already communicated to the patient, pre-screening. The first study visit- baseline&#xD;
      (visit 1) - will involve anthropometric measurements and taking a blood and urine sample in&#xD;
      order to perform standard of care measurements for type 2 diabetes at baseline and relevant&#xD;
      circulating biomarkers. The second study visit will involve having a multiparametric MRI&#xD;
      scan. Both visits will be within 21 days of the screening visit and carried out at local&#xD;
      study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcome measurements, blood samples and urine samples will be collected to assess&#xD;
      the natural history of diabetes disease progression. Optional blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      for future genetic testing. Participants will be asked to give consent for access to their&#xD;
      medical records held at their local hospital and NHS Digital to obtain information on&#xD;
      Hospital admissions (Hospital Episode Statistics), and mortality data collected by the Office&#xD;
      for National Statistics (ONS), also provided by NHS Digital. This data will be collected at&#xD;
      1, 3 and 10 years after baseline assessment.&#xD;
