      Genomes analysis reveal that SARS-CoV-2 presents unique features: optimal affinity for&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2&#xD;
      spike junction that determines infectivity and host range [3-4) Patients with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection may present symptoms ranging from mild to severe with a large portion of the&#xD;
      population being asymptomatic carriers. The most common reported symptoms include fever&#xD;
      (83%), cough (82%) and shortness of breath (31%) [5-6]. Patients suffering from chronic&#xD;
      respiratory diseases (CRD) such as chronic respiratory failure, asthma, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung diseases (ILD), pulmonary hypertension (PH),&#xD;
      sarcoidosis or cystic fibrosis (CF), were immediately considered to be at risk of severe&#xD;
      forms of COVID-19 [7]. Indeed, COVID-19 is responsible for various respiratory symptoms, from&#xD;
      cough with dyspnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in its most severe&#xD;
      presentation [8-9]. In parallel, it has been shown that COVID-19 patients have an increased&#xD;
      risk of venous thromboembolic disease [10]. There is concern that the respiratory&#xD;
      complications of COVID-19 could be deleterious in patients with prior CRD. [11-12-13] During&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic, studies mostly demonstrated that COPD was related with worse outcomes.&#xD;
      There may be a few reasons why the course of COVID-19 in COPD patients has been worse.&#xD;
      Firstly, COPD patients tend to be older and have more comorbidities which may increase&#xD;
      COVID-19 severity [14]. Respiratory failure and hypoxemia, which are the most important&#xD;
      causes of death in COVID-19 patients, are more common in COPD patients [15]. Although the&#xD;
      exact mechanism of acute exacerbation of ILD is not fully understood, the current belief is&#xD;
      that it can be caused by numerous triggers, including infection, or it can be idiopathic.(16)&#xD;
      It is likely that respiratory infection with COVID-19 could trigger an exacerbation of&#xD;
      underlying ILD and result in poor outcomes. There is similar concern regarding the&#xD;
      possibility of exacerbation in patients with sarcoidosis, especially those with fibrotic&#xD;
      manifestations.(17)&#xD;
