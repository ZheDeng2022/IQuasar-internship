  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      De-identified whole blood and serum samples are collected for the purpose of evaluating the&#xD;
      performance (sensitivity/specificity) of the HelioLiver Test for the detection of&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the performance characteristics (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of the Helio Liver Test within a study population of subjects that have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with liver cancer at various stages (I to IV) and for control subjects who have&#xD;
      been confirmed to not have liver cancer by at least one imaging technique, such as&#xD;
      ultrasound, MRI or CT. Control subjects will include patients who are at high-risk for liver&#xD;
      cancer and have been recommended to undergo liver cancer surveillance, as well as patients&#xD;
      who have non-HCC cancers to determine analytical specificity.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will be recently diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma as defined by at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
Subject has a â‰¥1 cm lesion exhibiting arterial phase hyperenhancement in combination with washout appearance by MRI and/or CT.&#xD;
Subject has a lesion of any size indicated to be HCC due to capsule appearance by 4 phase CT scan and/or multiphase contrast enhanced MRI.&#xD;
Subjects with a suspicious lesion of less than 2 cm must have HCC confirmed by both MRI and CT.&#xD;
Subject has a biopsy that is positive for HCC.&#xD;
Diagnostic imaging by multiphasic MRI or CT indicates a suspicious lesion on the liver, which is subsequently confirmed to be HCC by another method (biopsy, or surgical pathology).</description>
