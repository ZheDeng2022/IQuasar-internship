      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eustachian Tube (ET) is a mucosa-lined connection between the nasopharynx and the middle&#xD;
      ear cavity. It is believed to have three functions: 1) ventilation of and pressure&#xD;
      equalization in the middle ear cavity, 2) mucus drainage from the middle ear, and 3)&#xD;
      protection against sound and infection from the nasopharynx1. In adults, Eustachian Tube&#xD;
      Dysfunction (ETD) can cause complaints from one or both ears. For many years, various&#xD;
      definitions of ETD have been used, impairing the opportunity to compare studies. However, in&#xD;
      2015, an international consensus on definition, types, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&#xD;
      of ETD was published by Schilder et al2, which has been adopted by all the Scandinavian&#xD;
      countries. The symptoms include pressure (fullness), and/or pain in the ear, muffled hearing,&#xD;
      and overall discomfort. Furthermore, chronic ETD can result in tympanic membrane retraction,&#xD;
      atelectasis of the middle ear cavity, and ultimately formation of cholesteatoma3.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the symptoms of ETD are multiple and inaccurate giving rise to varying&#xD;
      estimates of the prevalence. As an example, a study in UK found a 0.9 % prevalence of ETD4.&#xD;
      In addition, clear guidelines on diagnostics and treatment are not currently available due to&#xD;
      the fact, that no objective test for detection of ETD exists. In the need of a symptom&#xD;
      scoring system, the patient reported Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) has&#xD;
      been developed and validated in English5. Yet, translation into other languages as well as&#xD;
      validation in other settings are necessary in order to substantiate the applicability of&#xD;
      ETDQ-7. ETD is associated with a lack of opening of ET. It is believed that the length,&#xD;
      diameter and angle of ET influences its ability to open regularly, thus affecting its&#xD;
      function. A short, narrow and angled ET may predispose to ETD. However, the imaging available&#xD;
      to visualize ET are not accurate enough to diagnose ETD. A direct test of the function of ET&#xD;
      is not available. Tubomanometry is a relatively new method developed to directly test the&#xD;
      opening of ET, but is yet to be validated6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both non-surgical and surgical treatment options to improve the function of the Eustachian&#xD;
      Tube are available. Non-surgical management includes pressure equalization methods (e.g. the&#xD;
      Valsalva maneuver), antihistamines, treatment with decongestants, and nasal douching with a&#xD;
      saline solution. Surgically, ventilation tubes are often used to treat ETD. In case of&#xD;
      adenoid hypertrophy obstructing the pharyngeal opening of ET, adenoidectomy is recommended.&#xD;
      Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET) was introduced in 2010 by Ockermann et al7. BET is a&#xD;
      non-invasive procedure performed under general anesthesia. During the procedure, a catheter&#xD;
      is inserted either endonasally or transtympanic into ET, and a balloon is inflated with water&#xD;
      for approximately two minutes. Various heterogeneous studies have shown a short-term effect&#xD;
      of BET, but long-term effects are unclear8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, despite the assumption of being a common condition, the field of ETD suffers from&#xD;
      lack of precise definition, diagnostic criteria, identification of underlying causes as well&#xD;
      as purposeful treatment, and prognostic factors. Especially, long-term effects of BET need&#xD;
      further investigation. Therefore, in an effort to fill out the gap of knowledge about ETD,&#xD;
      the following specific aims are proposed:&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation, modification, and validation of the ETDQ-7 in Danish settings Investigation of&#xD;
      combined Cone-Beam CT and MRI of the Eustachian tube in order to determine a potential&#xD;
      anatomical cause/disposition of ETD Clarification of the effects of BET using strict criteria&#xD;
      for ETD To validate the process of tubomanometry as an objective tool in patients with ETD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETDQ-7 is a useful patient-reported symptom scoring tool in Danish patients with assumed ETD&#xD;
      ETD is related to the dimensions and angles of the Eustachian tube detected by combining&#xD;
      Cone-Beat CT and MRI-scans BET is effective in patients with chronic ETD Tubomanometry can be&#xD;
      used as an objective tool in diagnosing and monitoring the effect of treatment in patients&#xD;
      with ETD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Danish translation, modification, and validation of the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction&#xD;
      Questionnaire Holm NH1 &amp; Ovesen T1.&#xD;

      Otolaryngology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) was introduced in 2012 by McCloud et&#xD;
      al. It scores symptoms of ETD, and it is the only validated patient-reported scoring tool. So&#xD;
      far, ETDQ-7 has been translated and validated into German, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to translate, modify and validate the questionnaire in Danish&#xD;
      settings to achieve a solid tool for optimal diagnostic and evaluation of treatment among&#xD;
      patients with ETD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Back and forth translation from English to Danish will be performed by a professional&#xD;
      translator. Then, a modification/cultural adaption of the questionnaire will be conducted.&#xD;
      Seventy-five patients older than 18 years referred to practicing ear nose and throat&#xD;
      specialists will be included. Inclusion criteria are symptoms of ETD for more than three&#xD;
      months including tympanometry compatible with negative middle ear pressure (C2 or B-curve).&#xD;
      The seven questions in the ETDQ-7 are: 1) pressure in the ears, 2) pain in the ears, 3) a&#xD;
      feeling that the ears are clogged or &quot;under water&quot;, 4) ear symptoms when having a cold or&#xD;
      sinusitis, 5) crackling or popping sound in the ears, 6) ringing in the ears or 7) feeling&#xD;
      that the hearing is muffled. Patients will fill out the questionnaire before and after&#xD;
      tympanostomy (insertion of ventilation tubes). Patients will then be referred to the ENT&#xD;
      Department, Regional Hospital West Jutland for further follow up, including controlling the&#xD;
      tympanostomy tubes. Here, a complete oto-rhino-laryngological examination, fiber optic&#xD;
      naso-pharyngo-laryngo-scopy, pure tone audiometry, and tympanometry will be performed.&#xD;
      SNOT-22 questionnaire is completed for differential diagnostics. Results will be compared to&#xD;
      75 age- and gender matched controls with no history of ETD or ear-surgery. In addition,&#xD;
      patients undergoing BET will complete the questionnaire before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For test-retest data, 15 patients and 15 controls repeat filling out the questionnaire 14&#xD;
      days after the first reply. Patients are excluded from the retest in case of upper airway&#xD;
      infection or travelling by airplane between the two tests. By comparing these results and&#xD;
      calculating the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the test-retest reliability of&#xD;
      ETDQ-7 is assessed. The internal consistency of the questionnaire will be investigated by&#xD;
      using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and Spearman rho. Hence, it will be possible to conclude&#xD;
      if ETDQ-7 can be used as a diagnostic tool to differentiate patients with ETD from&#xD;
      individuals without ETD as well as to evaluate the effect of BET.&#xD;

      The Eustachian tube (ET) is both skeletal and cartilaginous in nature. CT and/or MRI are&#xD;
      often used preoperatively to identify potential pathology in the temporal bone. However,&#xD;
      these techniques are not routinely used in order to diagnose ETD. It is unclear whether ETD&#xD;
      is associated pathology in the skeletal or cartilaginous regions of ET. Length, diameter&#xD;
      and/or angle of the ET may be a potential anatomical explanation for ETD, alternatively a&#xD;
      disposition of ETD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a relatively new imaging technique, where divergent&#xD;
      X-rays form a cone. CBCT can accurately visualize the facial bones, and is often used by&#xD;
      dentists and orthodontics. A study has shown no difference in the temporal bone between&#xD;
      patients with patulous Eustachian tube and a control group. No other study has investigated&#xD;
      ETD patients with CBCT. The cartilaginous part of ET is ideally visualized with MRI, whereas&#xD;
      CBCT is the best choice for the skeletal part. Both MRI and CBCT are therefore needed in&#xD;
      order to obtain a complete overview of ET. By implementing a brand-new software technique,&#xD;
      MRI and CBCT sequences will be fused. This will enable a better visualization of the ET,&#xD;
      where the length, diameter and angle of ET can be measured more accurately than with the&#xD;
      current available methods. Thus, dimensions of the ET in ETD patients can be classified&#xD;
      accordingly to normal dimensions of ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, twelve patients with ETD and 12 healthy controls are examined with both MRI&#xD;
      and CBCT. The sequences will be fused and two radiologists will describe the scans blinded&#xD;
      and independently. The dimensions and angulations of the ET in the two groups are compared to&#xD;
      identify significant differences.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients with long-lasting symptoms of ETD, who benefits from tympanostomy tube insertion,&#xD;
      will be offered Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET) of the cartilaginous part of ET. The&#xD;
      procedure is performed endonasally under general anesthesia. It is believed that BET leads to&#xD;
      micro-bleeding in the mucosa with subsequent scarring and expansion of ET. Apparently, the&#xD;
      procedure has a high success rate and low complication rate. Currently, little evidence&#xD;
      exists regarding the long-term effects of BET, and it remains unclear which patients will&#xD;
      benefit from the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to create a national cohort where all patients undergoing first time&#xD;
      BET in Denmark, are registered. A REDCap-database is established. All patients are followed&#xD;
      for 12 months by ETDQ-7, oto-microscopy and tympanometry. The patients, who benefit from the&#xD;
      procedure, will be compared to those without effect. Hence, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that it will be possible to assess which factors increase the probability of effect from BET&#xD;
      in order to select patients for BET more accurately in the future.&#xD;

      Tubomanometry: an objective tool in diagnosing patients with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Holm&#xD;

      Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tubomanometry (TMM) was introduced in 2009 as an objective tool to measure the dynamic&#xD;
      function of ET. While swallowing a small amount of water, a standardized air-pressure is&#xD;
      applied through a nasal catheter. If the ET opens, pressure will be transferred to the middle&#xD;
      ear cavity and the increased pressure will be measured with a probe in the ear channel. The&#xD;
      test is harmless, relatively fast, and can be used even in case of perforation of the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tube. In a control group, Schröder et al found an opening&#xD;
      of ET in 97 %, opposed to 57 % in a group of ETD-patients. Another study showed that TMM has&#xD;
      a high sensitivity, but low specificity for detecting ET opening. A reduced opening/lack of&#xD;
      opening of ET is associated with ETD. Schilder et al concluded, that the existing evidence is&#xD;
      weak, which is partly because of the disparate definitions of ETD. Finally, there is now&#xD;
      consensus both internationally and in Denmark on definitions of ETD. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to develop new knowledge in an effort to develop a globally acceptable&#xD;
      definition of ETD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim at examining 50 patients with ETD and compare them to 50 age- and&#xD;
      gender matched controls to investigate TMM's ability to distinguish the two groups. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that TMM has a great potential and most likely relates to the&#xD;
      pathological process of the disease. It may be a useful tool in direct testing of the ET and&#xD;
      monitoring the effect of treatment of ETD.&#xD;
