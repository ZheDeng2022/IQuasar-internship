    <measure>Distance LogMAR Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>High-contrast, monocular visual acuity in logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) will be evaluated at distance (4 meters) under high luminance lighting condition using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts. The room illuminance will be &gt;7.3 EV ( &gt;400 lux). The acceptable range for the chart luminance will be ~9.9-10.6 EV (120-200 cd/m2). Letter-by-letter results will be used to calculate the visual acuity for each chart read. A more negative logMAR score indicates a better visual acuity. A logMAR visual performance score of 0.0 is equivalent to visual acuity of 20/20 in Snellen notation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CLUE Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective quality of vision will be assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience with soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 18 and 65 years of age. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score indicates a 10% shift in the distribution of scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked their overall preference between the test and control lenses. Overall preference will only be asked once at the 1-week follow-up in the second period of the study.</description>

&#xD;
               6. In both eyes, have magnitude of the cylinder component of their vertex-corrected&#xD;

&#xD;
               7. In both eyes, have the mean sphere of their vertex-corrected distance refraction&#xD;
                  minus half of the indicated contact lens label cylinder power be between -0.875&#xD;
