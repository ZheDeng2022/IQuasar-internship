    <textblock>
      The population is aging. Aged people are more prown to develop frailty. The causes of frailty&#xD;
      are multifactorial and are being investigated in research settings. Cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      inflammaging and changes in microbiota have been associated with frailty and geriatric&#xD;
      syndrome. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and SIADH-related hyponatremia is also&#xD;
      important in aging and associated with inflammaging. The aim of this study is to examine, if&#xD;
      asymptomatic bacteriuria and SIADH-related hyponatremia could be markers for frailty and&#xD;
      geriatric syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The demographic evolution represents a challenge for the general public health. The global&#xD;
      population, especially in the developed countries, is aging. Aging is associated with a&#xD;
      decrease of physio-logical functions leading to frailty. Frailty is an important concept in&#xD;
      geriatric medicine: it is a biological syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to&#xD;
      stressors resulting from cumulative decline across multiple physiological systems (like&#xD;
      osteopenia, sarcopenia, dysregulation of hypothalamic axis …). Factors that lead to frailty&#xD;
      influence each other and can be self-perpetuating. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome but there&#xD;
      are a lot of other geriatric syndrome such as falls, undernutrition,… When young people are&#xD;
      sick, they present mostly more than one symptom who can be referred to one disease or one&#xD;
      cause. In contrast, geriatric patients will present one symptom, such as confusion, fall,&#xD;
      undernutrition,… which can be referred to multifactorial causes or diseases. This is the&#xD;
      concept of geriatric syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty or geriatric syndrome has been related to inflammaging. Inflammaging, characterized&#xD;
      by an increase of circulating cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and acute phase proteins,&#xD;
      is a feature of immunosenescence. This process of immunosenescence is suggested to&#xD;
      participate in the pathogene-ses of frailty and geriatric syndromes. The possible origins of&#xD;
      inflammaging are multifactorial and controversies still exist: cardiovascular (CV) diseases,&#xD;
      depression and chronic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are associated with this&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory state. These comorbidities are highly prevalent in geriatric patients and&#xD;
      could therefore contribute to the association between low-grade inflammation, frailty and&#xD;
      geriatric syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal barrier and microbiota are associated with frailty and inflammaging. Multiple&#xD;
      potential pathways exist through which the gut microbiota can provoke inflammaging (through&#xD;
      TLR, stimulation of immune cells, translocation, endotoxines et cetera). In the same way of&#xD;
      thinking, asymptomatic bacteriuria could also be responsible of inflammaging and frailty. The&#xD;
      prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is increased with aging and in patient with diabetes.&#xD;
      It has also been shown to be associated with chronic inflammation (sTNFR and TNFα), increased&#xD;
      WBCC and neutrophils. To our knowledge, it is unknown if asymptomatic bacteriuria is&#xD;
      associated with frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyponatremia is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients. SIADH-related hyponatremia&#xD;
      represents 1/3 of the causes of hyponatremia. The incidence of SIADH related hyponatremia is&#xD;
      believed to be higher in older people. It is associated with an increased risk of falls,&#xD;
      confusion and mortality. The physiological balance between water and salt changes with aging.&#xD;
      SIADH is classified as an euvo-lemic status; however, it is caused by an excess of water. The&#xD;
      inappropriate secretion of vasopressin( ADH=anti-diuretic hormone) increases the expression&#xD;
      of the aquaporins in the renal tubules. These aquaporines increase the reabsorption of water&#xD;
      resulting in an altered ratio of reabsorption of water and Salt, leading to hyponatremia.&#xD;
      SIADH-related hyponatremia is also associated with inflammation. IL-6 and IL-1β are able to&#xD;
      stimulate the pituitary-hypothalamic axis to secrete vasopressin. SIADH related hyponatremia&#xD;
      could be also a sign of inflammaging and related with frailty.&#xD;
