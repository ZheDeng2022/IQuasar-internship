  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicose veins (VV) are the early sign of Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) which are&#xD;
      characterised by abnormal tortuosity and dilatation of superficial veins of lower limb&#xD;
      extremities. Factors for the development of VV exist in literature. However, the exact&#xD;
      mechanism remains unclear. The prevalence of VV are greater in women compared to men and also&#xD;
      higher in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women which make pregnant women at higher&#xD;
      risk of developing VV. Furthermore, complications of VV have negative impacts on patients'&#xD;
      quality of life and health care budget. Therefore, better understanding of the cause of VV&#xD;
      can contribute in better quality of life to the patient and provide valuable insights to help&#xD;
      in reducing health care cost. The present study will investigate the contribution of both&#xD;
      mechanical and chemical factors in pregnant women by taking blood samples for genomic&#xD;
      testing, using Duplex ultrasound, vector flow imaging, limb volume assessment using Truncated&#xD;
      cone tool, assessment of iliac vein compression using Photoplethysmography (PPG) technique,&#xD;
      hormonal blood test and assessing patient's quality of life using Aberdeen Varicose Veins&#xD;
      Questionnaire (AVVQ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initially, patients will be approached by a member of the direct care team in the Maternity&#xD;
      outpatients' departments in the following hospitals: West Middlesex hospital, Queen&#xD;
      Charlotte's and Chelsea hospital and St Mary's hospital. This will be managed by experienced&#xD;
      research professionals in the area of vascular surgery. If a patient is prepared to discuss&#xD;
      their potential role in this research, then the researchers will discuss the study and&#xD;
      recruitment details at the patient's convenience. Recruitment is completely voluntary and&#xD;
      will not affect their routine care, this will be made clear during the discussion regarding&#xD;
      the research, and again during the consenting process. Time will be made available for any&#xD;
      questions and for the patient to consider recruitment in their own time. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to consent before any study-related procedures are carried out. Then her personal&#xD;
      identifiable data will be coded and pseudonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruited patient will be interviewed to obtain clinical information that is essential&#xD;
      for robust analysis. This clinical information will include standard demographic form which&#xD;
      will be used for all patients in each follow up in order to record and gather important&#xD;
      information which represents the composition of the target population. Gathered data will&#xD;
      include patients' details; patients name, day of visit, hospital name, ID number, date of&#xD;
      birth. Furthermore, this demographic form will record potential risk factors which may&#xD;
      associate with VV development such as race, number of pregnancies, family history of venous&#xD;
      disease, BMI which include weight and height, occupational factors, smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and diet. Any complications arising from pregnancy will be also recorded.&#xD;
      Finally, this proposed study will only record fetal weight in second and third trimester to&#xD;
      correlate increased fetal weight with potential venous pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patients will be asked to fill the demographic form then will be asked to stand on a&#xD;
      scale to measure the weight. Height will be recorded by bringing the horizontal measure down&#xD;
      to rest on the top of the participants head. Following this, patient will be asked to sit&#xD;
      while measurements are recorded in a relevant source data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the patient will be asked to stand on a step facing the sonographer to assess the&#xD;
      incidence of varicose veins using Duplex ultrasound (DUS) and vector flow imaging (VFI).&#xD;
      While patient is standing, Truncated cone tool will be performed immediately by measuring leg&#xD;
      circumferences in each segments of each limb to produce accurate measurements of lower limbs&#xD;
      volume. Following this, patient will be asked to sit on a chair for perform Iliac vein&#xD;
      compression test (venous outflow function) using photoplethysmography (PPG) technique.&#xD;
      Finally, patient's quality of life assessment will be evaluated by using Aberdeen Varicose&#xD;
      Veins Questionnaire (AVVQ) check list. Thereafter, the patient will be thanked for their&#xD;
      participation and excused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory tests will be managed and performed by experienced research professionals&#xD;
      in the area of vascular surgery. Four appointments will be arranged for each patient to&#xD;
      investigate DNA genomic testing and Estriol (E3) and progesterone hormonal testing. First&#xD;
      appointment during first trimester will include both genomic DNA and hormonal blood tests.&#xD;
      The three remaining appointments in the second trimester, third trimester and three months&#xD;
      after giving birth will include hormonal blood samples only. Patients will be entitled to&#xD;
      exit the study at any time without providing a reason, this is clearly stated on our&#xD;
      information sheet and consent form. Verbal consent will be requested before all follow-up&#xD;
      ultrasound scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will ensure that demographic data, ultrasound data, lower limb volume and iliac&#xD;
      vein compression measurements, histopathological results and quality of life assessment&#xD;
      results will be collected and stored in such a way that confidentiality is preserved. All&#xD;
      data will be pseudonyms by replacing names with research codes and by keeping any identifying&#xD;
      information separate from the main dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed with the help of the Imperial College statistics department. The&#xD;
      results of this study may be presented at local, national or international meetings or&#xD;
      submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. From a patient's perspective, all data&#xD;
      will be pseudonyms before the statistical analysis phase of the study and plans to publish&#xD;
      the results of the study are made clear in our patient information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and all appropriate documentation will be stored for a minimum of 10 years after the&#xD;
      completion of the study, including the follow-up period.&#xD;
