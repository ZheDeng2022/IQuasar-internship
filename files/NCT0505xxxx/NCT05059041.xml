  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) live with visual deficits due, in part, to elevated&#xD;
      levels of higher-order optical aberrations (HOA). HOAs are distortions/abnormalities in the&#xD;
      structure of the refractive components of the eye (i.e. the cornea and the lens) that, if&#xD;
      present, can result in poor quality focus on the retina, thus negatively impacting vision.&#xD;
      HOAs in the general population are overall low, and thus not ordinarily considered during the&#xD;
      eye examination and determination of refractive correction. However, for some populations,&#xD;
      such as individuals with DS, HOAs are elevated, and thus the commonly used clinical&#xD;
      techniques to determine refractive corrections may fall short. The most common clinical&#xD;
      technique for refractive correction determination is subjective refraction whereby a&#xD;
      clinician asks the patient to compare different lens options and select the lens that&#xD;
      provides the best visual outcome. Given the cognitive demands of the standard subjective&#xD;
      refraction technique, clinicians rely on objective clinical techniques to prescribe optical&#xD;
      corrections for individuals with DS. This is problematic, because it may result in errors for&#xD;
      eyes with elevated HOA given that these techniques do not include measurement of the HOAs.&#xD;
      The proposed research evaluates the use of objective wavefront measurements that quantify the&#xD;
      HOAs of the eye as a basis for refractive correction determination for patients with DS. The&#xD;
      specific aim is to determine whether dilation of the eyes is needed prior to objective&#xD;
      wavefront measurements. Dilation of the eyes increases the ability to measure the optical&#xD;
      quality of the eye and paralyzes accommodation (the natural focusing mechanism of the eye),&#xD;
      which could be beneficial in determining refractions. However, the use of dilation lengthens&#xD;
      the process for determining prescriptions and may be less desirable for patients.&#xD;
