      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, and expansion human clinical study to&#xD;
      observe the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of XZP-3621 in&#xD;
      single and multiple oral administrations in advanced NSCLC subjects with ALK rearrangement or&#xD;
      ROS1 rearrangement, and to initially explore the efficacy of XZP-3621.The study was divided&#xD;
      into two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this section was to determine MTD and RP2D doses in advanced NSCLC subjects&#xD;
      with ALK rearrangement or ROS1 rearrangement detected in tumor tissue samples or blood&#xD;
      samples (test method is not limited).The safety and PK of single dose in human subjects in&#xD;
      each group were first studied. After PK blood sample was collected 72 hours after single dose&#xD;
      on day 1, continuous dose was administered once a day for 4 weeks to confirm the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of single dose and continuous dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, Modified Fibonacci method was used for dose escalation. One subject was&#xD;
      enrolled at the initial dose of 50mg. After that, according to the &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation&#xD;
      principle, the dose of 100mg (100%), 200mg (100%), 300mg (50%), 400mg (33%), 500mg (25%),&#xD;
      600mg (20%)and so on was incremented successively. Starting from the 100mg Qd dose group, 3&#xD;
      NSCLC subjects with ALK rearrangement or ROS1 rearrangement should be included per dose.If&#xD;
      less than 3 NSCLC subjects were ALK rearrangement in any dose group due to inclusion of ROS1,&#xD;
      and no ≥1 PR was observed in this group, additional ALK rearrangement NSCLC subjects should&#xD;
      be added until the requirements are met. However, as long as the number of subjects in the&#xD;
      corresponding dose group who have completed DLT observations meets the &quot;3+3&quot; principle of&#xD;
      escalation, the addition of subjects to the ALK rearrangement should not affect the normal&#xD;
      escalation of the next dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation study, if 2 out of 3 ALK rearrangement NSCLC subjects have a partial&#xD;
      response (PR) or complete response (CR) after all subjects in the dose escalation study have&#xD;
      completed DLT evaluation and confirmed that the dose is safe, that is, a dose extension study&#xD;
      is performed from this dose to the MTD dose group. Each dose was reenrolled in about 15 NSCLC&#xD;
      subjects with ALK rearrangement or ROS1 rearrangement demonstrated by Ventana&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry or FISH or RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were treated with XZP-3621 for a 28-day treatment cycle, with continuous&#xD;
      administration of or XZP-3621 until disease progression occurs, or an intolerable toxic&#xD;
      reaction impeding further treatment occurs, or the investigator determines that the subject's&#xD;
      current condition is unsuitable for further treatment, the informed consent is withdrawn, or&#xD;
      the subject dies. RECIST efficacy was evaluated once every two treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, dose adjustments (both up and down) can be made according to protocol based&#xD;
      on subjects' tolerance and the occurrence of adverse events related to the study drug. Only&#xD;
      one dose reduction of the study drug is permitted.&#xD;
