      This study will be performed to evaluate patients'satisfaction and aesthetic outcomes of&#xD;
      single implant restorations in aesthetic zone by using superimposition of intra-oral scan and&#xD;
      CBCT.&#xD;

      The accurate transfer of an ideal implant position from virtual planning to the actual&#xD;
      implant site is essential for protecting vital structures as well as optimizing esthetic and&#xD;
      functional outcomes.With the introduction of 3D imaging and implant planning software,&#xD;
      preoperative design for a &quot;prosthesis-driven&quot; implant position becomes a reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial stage is digital image acquisition, which can be from extra-oral means such as&#xD;
      cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and laboratory scanners, or intraoral means such as&#xD;
      intraoral scanners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image fusion or superimposition of the STL data obtained from the optical scanning, with the&#xD;
      DICOM data obtained from the CBCT, is performed by matching the common reference points prior&#xD;
      to implant planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superimposed images enable virtual implant planning, while taking the surrounding&#xD;
      anatomic structures and future prosthetic needs into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct the present study, the following will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DICOM file of CBCT for examination of single implant in aesthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STL file of optical scanning for examination of single implant in aesthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An implant planning software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. One type of dental implant.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive a pre-operative CBCT examination and optical scan of the oral tissues by intra-oral scanner. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file from the CBCT examination and the Standard Tessellation Language (STL) file from the optical scan will be imported and merged in implant planning software. The virtual implant planning will be performed. The surgical guide and prosthesis are designed according to the virtual plan.</description>
