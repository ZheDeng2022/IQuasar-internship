  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of a fully automated&#xD;
      digital diabetes prevention program to standard of care human coach-based diabetes prevention&#xD;
      programs for promoting clinically meaningful lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes in adults with prediabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      After being informed about the study and potential risk, all participants giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry. At baseline&#xD;
      visit (month 0). Participants who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      in 1:1 ratio to human coach-based diabetes prevention program or digital diabetes prevention&#xD;
      program. An equal number of participants will be randomly assigned to both groups (like&#xD;
      flipping a coin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are randomly assigned to receive the human coach-based diabetes prevention&#xD;
      program, the participants will be referred to a local Diabetes Prevention Program close to&#xD;
      the participants' area. The Diabetes Prevention Program consists of 16 weekly sessions during&#xD;
      months 1 to 6 and 6 sessions during months 7 to 12. These group sessions may be delivered&#xD;
      in-person at the local program or remotely using video conferencing. During these sessions,&#xD;
      participants will receive information about lifestyle change behaviors focusing on weight&#xD;
      loss, physical activity, and nutrition from a trained lifestyle coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are randomly assigned to receive the digital Diabetes Prevention Program, the&#xD;
      participants will receive the Sweetch Digital Health Kit (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) in the mail&#xD;
      within approximately 8-12 days of the participants' first study visit. The Sweetch digital&#xD;
      health kit consists of a smartphone app and a digital body weight scale that is connected via&#xD;
      Bluetooth to the app. The phone app also consists of brief Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) lessons on type 2 diabetes prevention, which participants will be encouraged&#xD;
      to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 3 study visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months), each visit&#xD;
      includes fingerstick hemoglobin A1C measurement, weight measurement, and completion of&#xD;
      several questionnaires. Height will be measured at the first visit. Throughout the 12-month&#xD;
      study, participants will be asked to wear a device on the participants' wrist to measure&#xD;
      physical activity for 7 consecutive days following the first visit and once every month&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

Percentage engagement will be defined out of a total of 8 sessions in month 1-6. An engagement score (out of 100%) for the dDPPs will based on percentage of full weeks during which the app is installed and a) both push notifications and motion sensors are enabled or b) the participant accesses any component within the app for months 1-6.</description>

    <description>The Sweetch app is a hyper-personalized mobile digital coach that provides users with tailored recommendations to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors (150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight reduction, and healthy eating habits) to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
The Sweetch app uses self-tracking and multiple evidence-based persuasive eCoaching strategies. The Sweetch artificial intelligence algorithm delivers just-in-time support and/or adapt recommendations based on the user's response. For example, push notifications will be sent when the algorithm detects that the user is potentially available and able to act upon the recommendation, based on various parameters including location, p revious response, calendar availability, and weather, etc.</description>

The repository will contain documentation designed to facilitate use of the database. The documentation prepared for the repository will include a list and timetable for secondary and exploratory papers planned by the study investigators.
