  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AliveCor (www.alivecor.com) has developed an ECG device (KardiaMobile) that interfaces with&#xD;
      iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. This ECG consists of a lightweight hardware case&#xD;
      with two metal electrodes that can snap onto the back of the phone and a software&#xD;
      application. By holding the right finger(s) on the right electrode and the left finger(s) on&#xD;
      the left electrode, an electrical circuit is completed and a lead-I, 30 second rhythm strip&#xD;
      is created. KardiaMobile and a newer device, KardiaMobile 6L, were approved by FDA for ECG&#xD;
      rhythm recording. Recently, AliveCor developed two new devices: Kardia 12L and Kardia 6L to&#xD;
      record 12- lead and 6-lead ECGs, respectively. However, the data generated from the two new&#xD;
      devices have not yet been validated for accuracy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the accuracy of the ECGs recorded by AliveCor Kardia 12L and 6L devices. This will be&#xD;
      compared to simultaneous standard of-care 12-lead ECG recordings. The ECGs will be analyzed&#xD;
      for accuracy and statistical difference using root-mean-square error and cross correlation&#xD;
      between the median beats.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this study is to collect clinical validation data to support an FDA submission for a 510(k) for the Kardia 12L hardware which enables the simultaneous diagnostic quality recording of all 6 limb leads and any chest lead. We will be recording both Leads V2 and V4 in a sequential fashion along with the Limb leads and a simultaneous 12-lead ECG to validate the hardware and a Deep Neural Network model which expands the 7 leads into a complete 12-lead ECG. The 12-lead ECG used for validation of the recordings and the 12-lead synthesis model is the GE Cardiosoft System which is FDA cleared.</description>
