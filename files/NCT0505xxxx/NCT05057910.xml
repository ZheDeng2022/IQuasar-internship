      To evaluate the immune response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine by measuring the titers of&#xD;
      antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) among healthcare&#xD;
      workers of My Duc Hospital and investigate potential associations of vaccine protection&#xD;
      against infection in this population. The study's data can suggest the groundwork for the&#xD;
      development of predictive models for post-vaccination protection in the Vietnamese population&#xD;
      as well as for establishing vaccination strategies to control disease outbreaks in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December&#xD;
      2019 from Wuhan, China. This pandemic quickly spread to many countries and became a global&#xD;
      health challenge with profound impacts on human health as well as on economic and social&#xD;
      life. As of September 12, 2021, according to the statistic registry of the Ministry of Health&#xD;
      of Vietnam, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is 624,547 cases, of which the number&#xD;
      of deaths is up to 15,660 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides social distancing, masking, and handwashing, vaccine is one of the most efficient&#xD;
      ways to prevent COVID-19. Most of the vaccines currently available only provide one precursor&#xD;
      or vector of protein S, the anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies are not fully developed and&#xD;
      only anti-S antibodies could be detected (which target spike protein sub-domains, S1 and&#xD;
      RBD). On the other hand, due to the biological role of nucleocapsid and the fact that it is&#xD;
      protected from antibodies by viral or cellular membranes, nucleocapsid protein (NP)&#xD;
      antibodies are unlikely to directly neutralize SARS-CoV-2. For the above-mentioned reasons,&#xD;
      screening for anti-S or anti-RBD antibodies is commonly used to investigate the presence of&#xD;
      humoral immune markers following a Covid infection or after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of vaccination, the duration of antibody persistence is yet unknown. Large&#xD;
      cohort studies showed that 90-99% of individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus developed&#xD;
      detectable neutralizing antibodies within 2-4 weeks following infection and immune responses&#xD;
      remain robust and protective against reinfection for at least 6-8 months later. In Vietnam,&#xD;
      studies on antibody levels after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or after vaccination are receiving&#xD;
      more and more attention. Mai et al. conducted a study to assess the kinetics of antibody&#xD;
      titers of eleven COVID-19 infected individuals and found out that the titers of RBD-targeting&#xD;
      NAbs decayed by 18-30 weeks after the infection. Chau et al (2021) investigated the&#xD;
      vaccine-induced production of neutralizing antibodies after injecting ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222&#xD;
      vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca) on 554 Vietnamese healthcare workers. This study demonstrated&#xD;
      that the concentration of neutralizing antibodies increased after each dose. However, three&#xD;
      months after the first dose, neutralizing antibody levels reduced significantly, while the&#xD;
      seroconversion rate slightly declined from 98.1% to 94.7% at day 14 after the second dose,&#xD;
      but this study did not report neutralizing antibody levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies indicated that the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine might decrease over time, as&#xD;
      demonstrated by the decline of blood antibodies level, thus suggest providing additional&#xD;
      booster dose in the hope of increasing protection. However, more information about antibody&#xD;
      titers after vaccination is still needed, especially for the Vietnamese population.&#xD;
      Therefore, This study is conducted to evaluate the immune response created by the ChAdOx1&#xD;
      nCoV-19 vaccination by measuring the titers of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike&#xD;
      protein receptor binding domain (RBD) among healthcare workers of My Duc Hospital and to&#xD;
      investigate potential associations of vaccine protection and infection in this population.&#xD;

    <description>3ml of blood samples are collected, contained in heparin-free tubes, and centrifuged. Blood serum samples are collected and stored at the -80 Celcius degree. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in human serum and plasma are detected using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology on the ARCHITECT I 1000r System. Quality Control procedures will take place once daily, with three levels: one negative control and two positive controls. Sample, SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay diluent are combined and incubated. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies present in the sample bind to the antigen-coated microparticles. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a direct relationship between the titres of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the sample and the RLU detected by the system optics. Interpretation of Results: &lt; 50.0 AU/mL, Negative, ≥ 50.0 AU/mL, Positive</description>
