  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized study to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and&#xD;
      effects of a novel tele-rehabilitation intervention for stage I-IIIA lung cancer survivors&#xD;
      following curative intent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Conduct a pilot, phase IIb, parallel randomized (1:1) study to investigate&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of inspiratory muscle training and behavioral&#xD;
      support to promote walking in tele-rehabilitation with stage I-IIIA lung cancer survivors&#xD;
      following curative intent therapy (N=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: ≥ 20% eligible patients will enroll; ≥75% of participants will achieve ≥75%&#xD;
      adherence to the tele-rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: ≥75% of participants will perceive tele-rehabilitation as acceptable&#xD;
      (Telemedicine Satisfaction and Usefulness Questionnaire ≥4). There will be 0 intervention&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Explore the effects of the tele-rehabilitation program (N=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: At 12 weeks, participants in the tele-rehabilitation (experimental) arm,&#xD;
      compared to education only (control) arm, will have a trend of greater improvements in&#xD;
      outcomes, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. accelerometry-measured physical activity (primary outcome); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. functional capacity, self-reported physical activity, control of dyspnea and anxiety&#xD;
           symptoms, sleep quality, and quality of life (secondary outcomes).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot, parallel randomized study of an exercise + behavioral support intervention to reduce dyspnea and improve walking behavior among lung cancer survivors following curative intent therapy. Forty participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control arm, with assessments of feasibility, acceptability, safety, and patient-centered outcomes. The intervention period is 12 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
