  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TRE-515 is a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) that is&#xD;
      being developed for oral administration in patients with solid tumors. In cancer cells, rapid&#xD;
      and upregulated DNA replication creates high replication stress, as such, cancer cells are&#xD;
      more susceptible than normal cells to perturbations in nucleotide metabolism by DNA-targeting&#xD;
      treatments such as TRE-515.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary objective is too determine the safety and maximum tolerability of TRE-515 when&#xD;
      administered orally once daily as a single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to establish a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), to characterize&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TRE-515 preliminary evaluation of&#xD;
      antitumor activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the relationship between TRE-515 exposure and&#xD;
      plasma deoxynucleoside concentrations of deoxycytidine (dC), evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between TRE-515 exposure and intracellular dCK on-target knockdown as measured by a&#xD;
      [18F]-clofarabine (CFA) positron emission tomography (PET) probe and to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between TRE-515 treatment and dCK gene expression in archived tumor tissue when&#xD;
      available&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multi-center, nonrandomized, first in human, dose escalation&#xD;
      trial of TRE-515 designed to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the MTD and RP2D&#xD;
      of orally administered TRE-515 as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include adverse events (AEs), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs),&#xD;
      clinical laboratory values, vital signs, body weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicities will be assessed over the first 21 days on study. The PK and&#xD;
      preliminary tumor response analyses will be conducted throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary tumor responses will be assessed by the Principal Investigator (PI) based on&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) using an appropriate modality&#xD;
      (computer tomography [CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation phase, subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts to receive&#xD;
      TRE-515 as a daily oral dose using continuous 21-day cycles at escalating dose levels, as&#xD;
      outlined in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive TRE-515 in the absence of progressive disease as defined by&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. Following determination of an RP2D, an additional 6&#xD;
      subjects will receive TRE-515 at the RP2D to gain additional experience with the safety&#xD;
      profile and additional evidence of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation phase, a minimum of 3 subjects will be treated in each dose cohort&#xD;
      using a conventional 3+3 dose escalation study design, starting at Cohort 1 . Cohort (-1)&#xD;
      represents a contingency de-escalation dose level in the event that tolerance issues are&#xD;
      encountered in Cohort 1. In each cohort, 3 subjects will be initially treated, and each&#xD;
      subject will TRE515-T-02, be followed for the full DLT assessment period . In the absence of&#xD;
      a DLT in the 3 subjects within a cohort, dose advancement will proceed through the successive&#xD;
      cohorts. All subjects in each cohort must have completed the DLT observation period before&#xD;
      the next dose cohort may open. Depending upon the tolerance at a particular dose level,&#xD;
      intermediate dose levels may be studied to more closely characterize DLTs and more accurately&#xD;
      identify the MTD as recommended by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Individual subjects may&#xD;
      continue receiving additional TRE-515 treatment until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD of TRE-515 is defined as the highest dose at which less than 2 of 6 subjects&#xD;
      experience DLT. Subjects considered to be evaluable for the MTD determination must have&#xD;
      received at least 14 of 21 doses (67% of scheduled doses) or who have discontinued the study&#xD;
      drug earlier than 21 days because of a DLT. A Cohort dose will be declared to be above the&#xD;
      MTD if two or more subjects demonstrate DLT. With the determination that a Cohort dose&#xD;
      exceeds the MTD, the next lower Cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects (if not already&#xD;
      expanded to 6 subjects). In the event that an MTD is not reached, the safety committee shall&#xD;
      elect to define a RP2D that is consistent with the maximally administered tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RP2D will be determined by an appointed SRC prior to initiation of the dose expansion&#xD;
      phase of the study and will be no higher than the MTD determined in the dose escalation phase&#xD;
      of the study. The SRC may elect to define an RP2D lower than the MTD based on an overall&#xD;
      assessment of the PK and safety data available. The SRC may elect to modify the RP2D during&#xD;
      the dose expansion phase if new data become available that suggest a modification is&#xD;
      indicated.In the event that the RP2D is increased during the dose expansion phase of the&#xD;
      study, subjects currently receiving TRE-515 may have their dose increased to the higher RP2D&#xD;
      provided the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has received TRE-515 for at least 3 weeks (21 days) at the current dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject is not experiencing any TRE-515 related toxicity ≥ Grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dose escalation to the higher RP2D is considered to be in the subject's best interest&#xD;
           by both the subject's investigator and the medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Sponsor agrees with the dose escalation In the event that the RP2D is decreased&#xD;
           during the dose expansion phase of the study, subjects currently receiving TRE-515 may&#xD;
           have their dose decreased to the lower&#xD;
&#xD;
      RP2D provided the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dose reduction to the lower RP2D is considered to be in the subject's best interest by&#xD;
           both the subject's investigator and the medical monitor (subjects who appear to be&#xD;
           benefitting from their current dose are not required to dose reduce)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Sponsor agrees with the dose reduction Individual subjects may continue receiving&#xD;
           additional TRE-515 treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other&#xD;
           reason for treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
