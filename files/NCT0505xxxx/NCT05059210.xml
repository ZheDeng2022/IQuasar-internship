  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Here we will evaluate the implementation of Coach McLungsSM, a virtual evidence-based asthma&#xD;
      shared decision making (SDM) intervention with built-in asthma education and clinical&#xD;
      decision support, into primary care practices across a large healthcare system. All asthma&#xD;
      patients aged 5-17 who attend these practices will be assessed for uncontrolled asthma. The&#xD;
      goal of this study will be to evaluate the implementation of the Coach McLungsSM SDM&#xD;
      intervention into primary care. We will measure changes in emergency department visits,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and oral steroid use, which serve as surrogate measures for&#xD;
      patient-centered asthma outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changing behavior of health providers can be challenging, and significant gaps exist in our&#xD;
      knowledge of how to best implement new medical evidence into everyday practice. Numerous&#xD;
      individual- and system-level factors contribute to poor asthma outcomes which persist due to&#xD;
      the lack of a comprehensive approach for asthma care that is scalable, sustainable, and&#xD;
      widely disseminated. Improved asthma outcomes are associated with effective communication&#xD;
      strategies between the patient and provider. Shared decision making (SDM) is a&#xD;
      patient-centered process in which patients and providers work together to make decisions and&#xD;
      select tests, treatments, and care plans based on evidence that balances risks with patient&#xD;
      preferences and values. Previous studies, including our PCORI-funded dissemination study,&#xD;
      have shown that SDM is associated with improved outcomes for asthma patients in primary care.&#xD;
      Here we will evaluate the implementation of Coach McLungsSM, a virtual evidence-based asthma&#xD;
      SDM intervention with built-in asthma education and clinical decision support, into primary&#xD;
      care practices across a large healthcare system. Atrium Health, the 2nd largest virtually&#xD;
      integrated healthcare system in the nation, with over 14 million patient visits per year and&#xD;
      the region's largest primary care network, provides an ideal venue to evaluate implementation&#xD;
      into primary care. Coach McLungsSM will be fully integrated into the electronic medical&#xD;
      record at all primary care practices. All asthma patients aged 5-17 who attend these&#xD;
      practices will be assessed for uncontrolled asthma. The goal of this study will be to&#xD;
      evaluate the implementation of the Coach McLungsSM SDM intervention into primary care.&#xD;
      Implementation will be guided using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change&#xD;
      (ERIC), a compilation of implementation strategies, and evaluated using the RE-AIM (Reach&#xD;
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. Research questions are: How&#xD;
      best can we implement the Coach McLungsSM SDM asthma intervention into primary care? Will use&#xD;
      of Coach McLungsSM in primary care improve outcomes for patients with uncontrolled asthma?&#xD;
      After convening a Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of providers, researchers,&#xD;
      patients, stakeholders with expertise in implementation science, asthma research and&#xD;
      advocacy, we will implement the Coach McLungsSM SDM intervention into primary care practices&#xD;
      using a stepped wedge randomized control study design. Providers and staff will be trained in&#xD;
      SDM communication and use of the Coach McLungsSM tool. We will measure changes in emergency&#xD;
      department visits, hospitalizations, and oral steroid use, which serve as surrogate measures&#xD;
      for patient-centered asthma outcomes. The SAC will use an iterative process improvement&#xD;
      method and give best practice recommendations back to the practices for implementation&#xD;
      improvement. We will disseminate findings through local stakeholders, practice-based research&#xD;
      networks, asthma advocacy national organizations, and academic research meetings for&#xD;
      healthcare, primary care, and asthma.&#xD;
