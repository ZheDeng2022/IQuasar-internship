  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated immune response to infection associated with&#xD;
      multi-organ failure and a high mortality rate.While researchers have focused mainly on acute&#xD;
      sepsis, post-sepsis care of survivors has long been neglected despite the observation that&#xD;
      many sepsis survivors suffer from debilitating post-sepsis syndrome. This syndrome is&#xD;
      characterized by frequent hospital readmissions and increased mortality due to persistent&#xD;
      immune dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, causing poor quality of&#xD;
      life and a substantial burden on the healthcare system. Disconcertingly, the number of sepsis&#xD;
      survivors at risk for hospital readmission continues to rise.7 Of the post-sepsis symptoms,&#xD;
      post-sepsis immunosuppression is perhaps the most clinically important. While sepsis presents&#xD;
      as an initial phase of hyperinflammation (a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;), it is followed by an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive phase that is now understood to last weeks to months and predisposes&#xD;
      survivors to lethal secondary infections and sepsis recurrence. A third of deaths eight years&#xD;
      post-sepsis are caused by recurrent sepsis.We hypothesize that changes in the transcriptome&#xD;
      and DNA methylome in immune cells of survivors might be the underlying driver for prolonged&#xD;
      immunosuppression, and may also be correlated with long-term morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      post-sepsis, as well as other symptoms of post-sepsis syndrome including PTSD and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
