  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show that rapid, simple targeted radiotherapy to brain metastases&#xD;
      with 8 Gy / 1 is non-inferior to 20 Gy / 5 in terms of overall survival for patients with&#xD;
      poor prognosis.&#xD;

      Hypothesis For selected patients with limited life expectancy, a single targeted fraction of&#xD;
      8 Gy / 1 to brain metastases will provide equivalent survival as targeted radiotherapy with&#xD;
      20 Gy / 5 to brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification The QUARTZ study randomized patients with brain metastases and poor prognosis&#xD;
      between 20 Gy / 5 whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and best supportive care. The median&#xD;
      survival in both arms of the study was 9 weeks. The quality of life in both arm was also the&#xD;
      same. It is known that WBRT significantly diminishes quality of life. The investigators&#xD;
      interpretation of the QUARTZ trial is that the unchecked growth of brain metastases in the&#xD;
      best supportive care arm diminishes quality of life as much as WBRT. To control brain&#xD;
      metastases without giving WBRT, targeted treatment with 20 Gy / 5 to the metastases alone is&#xD;
      standard care at BC Cancer. Numerous randomized trials have compared the efficacy of 20-30 Gy&#xD;
      / 5-10 fractions and 8 Gy / 1 for palliative treatment of pain from bone metastases. In&#xD;
      addition, there is a randomized trial showing that 20 Gy / 5 and 8 Gy /1 are equally&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of symptoms from spinal cord compression. This study will test&#xD;
      the use of this shorter, one-visit treatment schedule against the standard 5-visit treatment&#xD;
      schedule for patients with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design Randomized Phase II Non-Inferiority Study. The estimated median survival for&#xD;
      this cohort, based upon a prior cohort study from 2012-2016 at BC Cancer is 3 months (13&#xD;
      weeks). The investigators would regard a study median survival of less than the 9-week median&#xD;
      survival observed in the QUARTZ trial as unacceptable. Hence, the hazard ratio for the&#xD;
      experimental arm and the control arm is: 13 weeks / 9 weeks = 1.44. With one-sided Type I&#xD;
      error set at alpha = 0.2 and power = 0.8, the investigators calculated a theoretical sample&#xD;
      size of 86 patients. Based on prior experience with clinical trials for patients with brain&#xD;
      metastases, a 15% risk of drop-out and loss to follow up is expected. Hence the final sample&#xD;
      size will be 100 patients. Stratification by the diagnosis-specific graded prognostic&#xD;
      assessment (DS-GPA) ranges of 0.0 - 1.0 and 1.5 - 2.0 and lung cancer versus other&#xD;
      histologies will help to ensure baseline characteristics that predict for equal survival are&#xD;
      equally distributed in both arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The primary endpoint is overall survival. The study will be considered&#xD;
      to be a positive phase II non-inferiority study if the median survival in the experimental&#xD;
      arm is within 4 weeks of the median survival in the standard arm.&#xD;
