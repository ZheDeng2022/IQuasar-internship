  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the reference treatment for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea syndrome (OSAS) and is effective in improving symptoms of OSAS, reducing risk of&#xD;
      accidents and improving quality of life. However, CPAP use is less than optimal. Recommended&#xD;
      use is between 6-8 hour per night and a common clinical and empiric benchmark has been&#xD;
      defined for CPAP use as an average of 4h per night for 70% of the night. Approximatively 30%&#xD;
      of patients discontinue CPAP treatment during the first weeks. Thus, it is very important to&#xD;
      identify the factors that influence CPAP adherence during the first weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomedical factors, in particular nose respiratory abnormalities, somnolence complaints and&#xD;
      insomnia complaints, have been widely studied but explain only 4 to 25 % of the variance in&#xD;
      CPAP use. Interestingly, &quot;self-efficacy&quot; (the confidence to engage in a treatment), was found&#xD;
      to explain more than 30 % of the variance in CPAP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEMSA (Self Efficacy in Sleep apnea) questionnaire is the instrument to investigate&#xD;
      self-efficacy related to OSAS and CPAP that has received the most attention. Retrospective&#xD;
      studies showed that the factor &quot;self-efficacy&quot; of the SEMSA was related to poor CPAP&#xD;
      adherence. Prospective studies showed that the factor &quot;self-efficacy&quot; of the SEMSA at&#xD;
      baseline was associated with future CPAP use when it was completed after education&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A French version of the SEMSA has been validated by investigators in a retrospective study.&#xD;
      They have confirmed in France that the factor &quot;self-efficacy&quot; of the SEMSA was related to&#xD;
      poor CPAP adherence. No prospective study using the SEMSA has been conducted in French&#xD;
      patients with OSAS treated with CPAP. Given the specificity of the French health care system&#xD;
      and home care system, it is thus important to evaluate the predictive value of self-efficacy&#xD;
      on CPAP adherence in France. The generation of predictive model would enable pretreatment&#xD;
      prediction of those likely to have difficulty with CPAP adherence, and would serve as the&#xD;
      basis for the development of maximally effective interventions in order to enhance CPAP&#xD;
      adherence by patients with OSAS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a prospective design, investigators aim to examine the following factors: pre-treatment&#xD;
      demographic factors, sleep clinical factors (Somnolence complaints with ESS questionnaire and&#xD;
      Insomnia complaints with ISI questionnaire), patients' perceptions of self-efficacy (SEMSA&#xD;
      questionnaire), and nose respiratory complaints (NOSE questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate if self-efficacy would be the best predictor of CPAP use&#xD;
      during the first month of treatment and at 3 and 6 months after treatment beginning. Impact&#xD;
      of demographic factors, sleep and nose complaints will be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intend to recruit at the sleep clinic 150 patients with newly diagnosed Obstructive&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome for whom CPAP treatment is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the consultation of CPAP treatment initiation, the investigator will present the study&#xD;
      and give the informed notice. If the patient agrees to participate, the investigator will&#xD;
      notify the non-opposition of the patient in the medical file and confirm eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. The patient will then complete 4 questionnaires (ISI, ESS, SEMSA, NOSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initiation of CPAP treatment, the same questionnaires will be sent to the patient 1&#xD;
      month, 3 and 6 months after treatment beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Clinical Research Associate will call the patient to ensure the completion of&#xD;
      questionnaires or in case of missing or incomplete data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of this study will give the opportunity to have a predictive model that enable&#xD;
      pretreatment prediction of those likely to have difficulty with CPAP use, and would serve as&#xD;
      the basis for the development of maximally effective interventions in order to enhance CPAP&#xD;
      adherence by patients with OSAS.&#xD;
