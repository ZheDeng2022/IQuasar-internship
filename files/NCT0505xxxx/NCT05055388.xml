      Sepsis is still the main cause of maternal death, accounting for 11% of maternal deaths.&#xD;
      Early identification of high risk factors of sepsis and early intervention can improve the&#xD;
      prognosis of pregnant women with sepsis. At present, there is no epidemiological&#xD;
      investigation report on sepsis in ICU in China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although great progress has been made in maternal care in China in recent years, the maternal&#xD;
      mortality rate in China has remained high in the past three years, fluctuating from&#xD;
      19.6-20.1/100000, and there is still a large gap between China and developed countries&#xD;
      (12.1/100000). Sepsis is still the main cause of maternal death, accounting for 11% of&#xD;
      maternal deaths; Early identification of high risk factors of sepsis and early intervention&#xD;
      can improve the prognosis of pregnant women with sepsis. At present, there is no&#xD;
      epidemiological investigation report on sepsis in ICU in China. A total of 160 cases of&#xD;
      maternal sepsis with ICU admission in any trimester of pregnancy or within 42 days of&#xD;
      delivery were reviewed between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2019. The demographic data&#xD;
      including age and gestational age, mode of delivery, the maximal SOFA score, invasive&#xD;
      operation before sepsis, sepsis focuses, intervention, microbial culture results, body&#xD;
      temperature and blood routine were reviewed to investigate the incidence and mortality of&#xD;
      maternal sepsis in intensive care unit, as well as the incidence of multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      bacteria and the risk factors of multidrug resistance.&#xD;
