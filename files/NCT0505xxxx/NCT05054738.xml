    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well three types of treatments work to improve&#xD;
      the outcomes for people with substance use problems. Veterans admitted to the Charleston VA&#xD;
      Psychiatric inpatient unit may be invited to participate. The three types of treatments that&#xD;
      will be evaluated are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combined Recovery Program (CRP), a six-session treatment group delivered on the&#xD;
           inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Home Telehealth program, called Stable and Able (S&amp;A), provided just prior to&#xD;
           discharge and provides additional support for up to 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment-as-usual (TAU), which is the treatment currently provided on the unit,&#xD;
           consisting of various mental health topics and sessions designed to help with recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation begins on the inpatient unit, beginning with CRP and/or TAU, and may continue&#xD;
      with S&amp;A post discharge. Participants will be followed up at 1 and 3- months post treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High inpatient readmissions among Veterans with substance use disorders (SUD) constitutes a&#xD;
      costly and persistent healthcare problem. Studies demonstrate that patients with SUDs return&#xD;
      to inpatient treatment multiple times and that high inpatient service utilization in this&#xD;
      population is associated with high rates of co-occurring mental illness (SUD/MI),&#xD;
      homelessness, suicidality, and continued impairment in health and social functioning. A&#xD;
      significant proportion (21%) of Veterans with SUD/MI are homeless, at high-risk for suicide,&#xD;
      and represent one of the largest, most chronic groups of psychiatric patients treated in the&#xD;
      VA Healthcare System. In effort to ameliorate inpatient readmission rates, VHA Handbook&#xD;
      1160.06, drafted in 2013, espouses the development and implementation of uniform&#xD;
      recovery-oriented mental health (MH) services, which include treatment of SUDs addressing&#xD;
      goals of recovery, improved quality of life, and community integration. The three types of&#xD;
      treatments that will be evaluated are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combined Recovery Program (CRP), a six-session treatment group designed to explore&#xD;
           goals, values, and personal strengths about making a change for overall quality of life,&#xD;
           health and well-being combined with skill building designed for helping to live a more&#xD;
           stable life in their own home that will include money management for financial success&#xD;
           and home maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Home Telehealth program, called Stable and Able (S&amp;A), designed to help maintain&#xD;
           skills to stay sober and allows continued communication with one of the mental health&#xD;
           staff on a daily basis to provide additional support for the next 3 months after&#xD;
           discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment-as-usual (TAU), which is the treatment currently provided on the unit,&#xD;
           consisting of various mental health topics and sessions designed to help with recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant will receive TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim I: Assess the relative effects of Treatment Engagement and Substance Use [and&#xD;
      SUD-related problems] between CRP+S&amp;A+TAU vs. CRP+TAU and CRP+S&amp;A+TAU vs. TAU only by 3-mos&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis 1a: Treatment Engagement: Participants in CRP + S&amp;A+TAU will attend more&#xD;
      outpatient SUD treatment sessions and general MH treatment sessions compared to participants&#xD;
      in CRP and to TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis 1b: Substance Use: Participants in CRP + S&amp;A+TAU will lower quantity and&#xD;
      frequency of substance use and SUD-related problems compared to participants in CRP+TAU and&#xD;
      to TAU only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 1c: Preventable Services: Participants in CRP + S&amp;A+TAU will reduce&#xD;
      Preventable Healthcare Services (hospital readmissions and emergency department visits)&#xD;
      compared to participants in CRP+TAU and to TAU only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 1d: Participants in CRP + S&amp;A+TAU will report Greater QoL; # of Days&#xD;
      Living in Stable Housing; and # of Days Engaging in Community Events and/or Activities&#xD;
      compared to CRP+TAU and to TAU only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim II: Conduct Veteran participant and Staff thematic interviews and to assess&#xD;
      qualitative facilitators and barriers to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      195 Veterans with SUDs admitted into the Charleston VAMC inpatient unit will be recruited.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to: (1) CRP + S&amp;A + TAU; (2) CRP+TAU; and (3) TAU. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed-up at 1 and 3-months and data analyzed using mixed methods.&#xD;
