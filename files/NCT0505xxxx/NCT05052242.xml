      Purpose: To investigate agreement between 2 swept source OCT biometers, IOL M.aster700 and&#xD;
      Anterion, in various ocular biometry and intraocular lens (IOL) calculations of primary&#xD;
      angle-closure disease (PACD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This was a prospective study conducted in a tertiary eye care centre involving&#xD;
      biometric measurements obtained with 2 devices in phakic eye with diagnosis of PACD. Mean&#xD;
      difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with confidence limits were assessed,&#xD;
      and calculations of estimated residual refraction of the IOL were analysed using Barrett's&#xD;
      formula.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary angle-closure disease (PACD) is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. PACD is an&#xD;
      anatomic disorder, typically of relatively small eye with shallow anterior chamber depth&#xD;
      (ACD), thick lens, shorter axial length (AL), small corneal curvature, and relatively&#xD;
      anterior lens position. Pupillary block, plateau iris and phacomorphic mechanisms play major&#xD;
      roles in the pathophysiology of the disease, and pupillary block is thought to be the most&#xD;
      common causal mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation (PEI) has been proposed&#xD;
      for initial management of PACD.4 PEI relieves pupillary block, deepening ACD and widening&#xD;
      irido-corneal angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biometry is essential in evaluating ocular dimensions and calculating IOL power in PACD, and&#xD;
      ocular biometers have been evolving in recent years. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
      includes partial coherence interferometry (PCI), and swept source OCT (SS-OCT) is in general&#xD;
      use in clinical practice. The agreement of the calculations of these devices has been studied&#xD;
      by many investigators; however, research into their agreement in PACD patients has been&#xD;
      sparse so far. A newer SS-OCT, Anterion, is now available and its performance needs to be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
