  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Peripheral arterial disease is a severe clinical problem with an increasing&#xD;
      prevalence, due to an ageing population. Endovascular treatment, usually using stents, is&#xD;
      recommended for most lesions in the femoropopliteal tract. The patency of these stents is&#xD;
      influenced by several factors, including stent sizing and stent positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current procedural planning of femoropopliteal disease is primarily based on single-plane&#xD;
      digital subtraction angiographies (DSA). This modality provides a 2-dimensional image of the&#xD;
      vessel lumen, which may be suboptimal for stent sizing. It can therefore be difficult to&#xD;
      choose the optimal stent position as minor lesions may be missed. Suboptimal treatment could&#xD;
      result in unfavourable levels of wall shear stress causing the vessel wall to be more&#xD;
      susceptible to neo-intimal hyperplasia ultimately causing restenosis and stent failure.&#xD;
      Intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) is able to visualize the arterial wall with&#xD;
      a micrometer resolution, which could result in better stent sizing. Furthermore, OCT is able&#xD;
      to visualize different layers in the vessel wall and identify unhealthy areas, which may lead&#xD;
      to a more optimal stent placement as unhealthy areas can be covered completely. Moreover, OCT&#xD;
      provides detailed patient-specific geometries necessary to develop reliable computational&#xD;
      fluid dynamics (CFD) models that simulate blood flow in stented arteries and calculate wall&#xD;
      shear stresses, which could predict stent patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate in a clinical study how often the use of intravascular optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography for femoropopliteal stenotic lesions leads to alterations in treatment&#xD;
      planning before and after stent placement, in comparison to traditional digital subtraction&#xD;
      angiography-based treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Exploratory observational study. Study population: 25 patients with&#xD;
      femoropopliteal stenotic lesions who are treated with a Supera nitinol stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The percentage of procedures in which OCT changed the&#xD;
      DSA-based treatment planning before and after stent placement to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      OCT imaging on treatment planning.&#xD;
