  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the pretreatment with exogenous interferon blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, but&#xD;
      intervention is much more effective if administered prior to infection. In this study the&#xD;
      primary aim is to investigate 28-day regime of nasal interferon gama use in healthy&#xD;
      participants for COVID-19 and other respiratory infections prevention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tissues of the upper respiratory tract: the mucous membrane of the oropharynx, nose, - as&#xD;
      well as the lung parenchyma are identified as the main targets of SARS-CoV-2. Previously&#xD;
      published data from studies describe that in vitro and in vivo observations SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      replicates exponentially during the first few days after infection to the peak of the host's&#xD;
      antiviral response. It is assumed that it is the violation of the antiviral immunity of the&#xD;
      nasal epithelium that may underlie the development of a severe form of the disease. The&#xD;
      significance of interferon protection proven in early studies supposes that it can reduce&#xD;
      peak viral load and viral reproduction index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the efficacy and safety of nasal interferon gama use in healthy participants for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and other respiratory infections prevention there is a need of interventional study.&#xD;
      Interferon gamma has many years of clinical experience in the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      various viral infections, including coronavirus nature, flu and pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participant enrollment, comprehensive baseline documentation of anamnestic, clinical&#xD;
      and allergy data is collected on the same day if possible. For participants who develops&#xD;
      acute respiratory symptoms or recieve positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, all parameters are&#xD;
      collected that may be necessary to assess the type and severity of acute respiratory disease.&#xD;
      Furthermore, data is collected that may be suitable for an assessment of the safety profile.&#xD;
      In particular, questions are asked about known infection risks, lifestyle, alternative&#xD;
      prevention methods, immune competence, rate of acute respiratory infections, the history of&#xD;
      symptoms and tests relating to COVID-19, preexisting medication, as well as ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of inclusion (day -3-1) routine clinical values, safety-relevant data, WHO scale&#xD;
      score, concomitant medication and anamnesis, as well as study criteria analysis are&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day 0 (randomization visit) and at termination visit (up to 90 days) repeated routine&#xD;
      clinical values, safety-relevant data, WHO scale score, and concomitant medication are&#xD;
      collected. If the patient falls ill, the necessary disease information is documented. If the&#xD;
      patient dies, the date and cause of death are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 24-30 after randomization, a follow-up call takes place with particular attention to&#xD;
      the health-related events such as respiratory diseases or other changes in health and vital&#xD;
      status and drug compliance. If the participant cannot be reached for the follow-up call, the&#xD;
      including study center will attempt to reach the participant, otherwise exclude the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasopharynx swab is obtained on days 0 to exclude asymptomatic patients before the&#xD;
      randomisation. If possible, sputum is obtained for termination visit and during the acute&#xD;
      respiratory symproms manifestation to confirm COVID-19.&#xD;
