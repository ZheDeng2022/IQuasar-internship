    <textblock>
      The aim of the ENHANCE study was to determine if an intervention focused on empowering&#xD;
      medical inpatients to discuss their values and interests with their Cleveland Clinic&#xD;
      Caregivers leads to greater caregiver empathy, improved patient experience, and improved&#xD;
      Caregiver experience. The intervention patient participants received a poster where they were&#xD;
      able to share things about themselves that they wanted their Caregivers to know. These&#xD;
      posters were hung on the wall behind their bed. A few days later, they were given a survey to&#xD;
      assess their experiences in the hospital. On the control floors, medicine patients were&#xD;
      recruited a few days into their admission and administered a survey. CCF Caregivers completed&#xD;
      surveys before the intervention period and afterward. Data collection is complete, data&#xD;
      analysis is largely finished and a manuscript is in progress. 320 patients and 219 CCF&#xD;
      Caregivers participated in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ENHANCE was a prospective cluster randomized controlled trial with patients admitted to four&#xD;
      general medicine units at one hospital and their hospital Caregivers (nurses and&#xD;
      hospitalists). We chose to focus on internal medicine units specifically, due to the&#xD;
      documented need for hospitalists to establish rapport and maintain relationships with their&#xD;
      patients. Two units were randomized to the control group and two units to the intervention&#xD;
      group. The cluster randomized design was chosen to reduce spillover effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION The intervention was an 18&quot;x18&quot; poster board with a large blank surface for&#xD;
      patients to share information about who they are as people and what is important to them. The&#xD;
      Care to Share poster was co-designed with ten medicine inpatients during pilot testing. The&#xD;
      goal of the poster was to equip Caregivers with humanizing information about their patients,&#xD;
      thereby provoking more genuine empathetic interactions. Based on input from pilot testing,&#xD;
      the researcher wrote on the poster for the patient to ensure ease of completion and&#xD;
      legibility. The posters were displayed on the wall behind patients' beds, so Caregivers&#xD;
      entering the room could easily see the information when facing the patient. Nurses&#xD;
      (registered nurses, patient care nursing assistants, nurse managers and health unit&#xD;
      coordinators) were designated as control or intervention Caregivers based on their unit,&#xD;
      while all hospitalists (physicians and advanced practice providers) were treated as&#xD;
      intervention Caregivers since their practice was not limited to specific medicine units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Data collection occurred between December 2018 and May 2019 and in three&#xD;
      stages: Caregiver baseline survey, Intervention vs Control patient survey, and Caregiver&#xD;
      post-intervention survey. Caregivers were recruited to the study using emails and in person&#xD;
      surveys and were blinded to details of the intervention. Caregiver surveys contained&#xD;
      questions about communication and experience, validated inventories on Caregiver-reported&#xD;
      burnout and empathy, and demographic information. Caregiver surveys for all hospitalists and&#xD;
      nurses in the intervention group, also contained questions to gather feedback on the Care to&#xD;
      Share poster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible for study recruitment when they were admitted to one of the study&#xD;
      units (either from the ICU or as a new admission) within the past 48 hours for the&#xD;
      intervention group, or within 3-5 days of admission for the control group, age 18 years or&#xD;
      older, on the Internal Medicine service, and capable of making their own medical decisions.&#xD;
      This timing was chosen so that all patient participants - both control and intervention -&#xD;
      would complete surveys at about the same length of time into their admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention patients were informed that the Care to Share poster was for them to share&#xD;
      whatever they want their care team to know about them as a person. A member of the research&#xD;
      team (CF) recorded content on the poster and immediately hung it on the wall behind the&#xD;
      patient's bed. The intervention participants were then approached for survey administration&#xD;
      48 hours after the poster was hung (or after 24 hours if the patient was to be discharged the&#xD;
      day after poster creation). Patients discharged before 24 hours after poster creation were&#xD;
      not eligible for survey administration. The researcher administered the survey to patients&#xD;
      unless the patient indicated they preferred to complete it on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES Patient: The primary patient outcome variable was patients' perceived empathy of&#xD;
      their hospitalist, measured by the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician&#xD;
      Empathy(JSPPPE). This 5 item 7-point scale, completed by patients, measures patient-physician&#xD;
      empathetic engagement. Patient surveys also included covariates such as trust in their&#xD;
      physician, measured by the Interpersonal Physician Trust Scale (IPTS), a 10 item 5-point&#xD;
      scale, as well as a 3 item patient-reported measure of shared decision making, CollaboRATE,&#xD;
      and demographic characteristics. The survey fielded to patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      also contained items to gather feedback on the Care to Share poster, including two open-text&#xD;
      questions for patients to comment in their own words. Additionally, specific medical details&#xD;
      were gathered from the EMR, such as length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregiver: The caregiver survey consisted of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)36, Jefferson&#xD;
      Scale of Empathy (JCE), and demographic items. The MBI measures the frequency of job-related&#xD;
      feelings of burnout using a scale of 0 (never) to 6 (every day). Burnout is measured on 3&#xD;
      dimensions- emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment&#xD;
      (PA). We used the burnout criteria of EE&gt;26 and DP&gt;9 which was used in previously reported&#xD;
      literature on internal medicine physicians. The JCE is a 20 item 7-point Likert scale&#xD;
      completed by the Caregiver that measures a health professional's empathy. As with the patient&#xD;
      survey, the surveys fielded to Caregivers on intervention units (i.e., some nurses and all&#xD;
      hospitalists) contained items to gather feedback on the Care to Share poster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS Based on a priori power calculations, we required 306 patient participants and&#xD;
      approximately 40 caregivers to detect a difference in the JSPPPE. We computed descriptive&#xD;
      statistics to describe patient and caregiver samples, and multivariate nested regression&#xD;
      models to test if the intervention predicted patients' perceptions of clinician empathy,&#xD;
      shared decision-making, and trust. Data analysis was conducted using JMP, SAS and R. Verbatim&#xD;
      comments to the two open-text questions were analyzed using content analysis.&#xD;
