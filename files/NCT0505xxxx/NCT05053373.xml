    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PFMT added to EA vs PFMT added&#xD;
      sham EA for SUI in women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      clinical trial in four hospitals in China to compare the effectiveness of EA added to PFMT vs&#xD;
      sham EA added to PFMT for women with SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participated women with SUI will be recruited from four participating hospitals or&#xD;
      through community clinics by advertising. Participated hospitals include: Yueyang Hospital of&#xD;
      Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Affiliated to Shanghai University of&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (Shanghai, China); Shaanxi Hospital of Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine (Xi'an, China); First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine (Tianjin, China); and Nanjing Hospital of Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Nanjing&#xD;
      University of Chinese Medicine (Nanjing, China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility. Chief complaint, medical history, and general&#xD;
      characteristics (such as age, race, education level, body mass index, manner of child&#xD;
      delivery, menopause) will be obtained. Those who met inclusion criteria and are interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study will sign an informed consent form and then make another&#xD;
      appointment to complete the baseline data collection, including the 72-hr bladder diary, 1-h&#xD;
      pad test, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF)&#xD;
      score, the weekly mean number of urine pads used). Participants will then be assigned&#xD;
      randomly to either a PFMT (3 sets/day for 8 weeks) + EA (3 times per week for 8 weeks) group&#xD;
      or a PFMT + sham EA group. The primary and secondary outcome will be measured from week 2 to&#xD;
      32. The participant-reported severity of UI and subjective self-evaluation of therapeutic&#xD;
      effects will be recorded. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants&#xD;
      before they are included in the study. All clinical investigations will be conducted&#xD;
      according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A central randomized system of clinical research (provided by the Clinical Evaluation Center of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine) will be used for randomization. When eligible subjects are enrolled, randomized personnel from each center will log on to the central random online system to apply for a randomized number. Then the participants will be randomly assigned to PFMT+EA group or PFMT+sham EA group at a ratio of 1:1 to one of four hospitals. The following individuals in the trial will be blinded: 1) participants, this will be achieved by using sham EA procedure; (2) Evaluators, evaluation and record of measurements will be conducted by the evaluators who do not know the grouping situation; (3) Statisticians, group allocation will not be revealed until the statistical analyses are completed.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>The evaluation will be performed when the participants are first distributed into the groups as a baseline, and then at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The change of urine loss is measured by the 1-hour urine pad test. The 1-hour pad test will be performed as follows: 1) Empty the bladder and wear a preweighted pad. 2) Drink 500 ml of sodium-free liquid in 15 minutes; 3) walk for half hours, including going up and down stairs; 4) perform the following activity in the remaining 30 minutes: squat and stand up 10 times; cough hard 10 times; run in place for 1 minute; bend down to pick up a small object on the ground 5 times; wash hands for 1 minute with running water. 5) Weigh the pad again to calculate the urine leakage (1 gram equivalent to 1 ml of urine).</description>

    <description>Patients will be in a prone position. Bilateral Zhongliao (BL33) and Huiyangacupoint (BL35) will be identified and punctured by an acupuncturist. The electrodes will be placed on the needle handles, and stimulate for 30 minutes at 50 Hz with a current intensity between 1 to 5 mA. PFMT will be performed 3 sets a day (morning, around noon, and night).</description>

    <description>The preparation for the patients will be the same as that for the patients who will receive EA. Whereas, instead of using real acupuncture needles, special designed placebo needles (size 0.30 × 25 mm) with the blunt-head will be used in the PFMT+sham EA group to penetrate the fixed pad to the skin surface but without skin penetration. The same procedure for deqi will be performed as in the PFMT+EA group. A special-designed cable (the intermediate wire of the cable is cut off but the appearance is normal) will be used to connect the electrodes to the electroacupuncture machine. Therefore, the electroacupuncture machine appears to work, but does not actually stimulated acupoints. The sham EA treatment will also be maintained for 30 minutes. PFMT will be performed 3 sets a day (morning, around noon, and night),</description>
