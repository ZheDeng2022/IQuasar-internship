    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial compares the effect of the combination of high-dose cisplatin every&#xD;
      three weeks and radiation therapy versus low-dose cisplatin weekly and radiation therapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This study&#xD;
      is being done to find out if low-dose cisplatin given weekly together with radiation therapy&#xD;
      is the same or better than high-dose cisplatin given every 3 weeks together with radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether radiation with low-dose cisplatin weekly is superior in terms of&#xD;
      acute toxicity, as measured by the T-scores (TAME method), to radiation with high-dose&#xD;
      cisplatin every 3 weeks for patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      the head and neck (SCCHN). (Phase II) II. To determine whether radiation with low-dose&#xD;
      cisplatin weekly is non-inferior to radiation with high-dose cisplatin every 3 weeks in terms&#xD;
      of overall survival (OS) for patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN. (Phase III) III. To&#xD;
      determine whether radiation with low-dose cisplatin weekly is superior in terms of acute&#xD;
      toxicity, as measured by the T-scores (TAME method), to radiation with high-dose cisplatin&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN. (Phase III)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess and compare progression-free survival (PFS) between arms. II. To assess and&#xD;
      compare locoregional failure and distant metastasis between arms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess acute and late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      [CTCAE] version 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess patient-reported outcomes quality of life (PRO/QOL), as measured by the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck (FACT-H&amp;N) (primary PRO), between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess hearing loss, as measured by audiograms and the modified TUNE grading scale&#xD;
      between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess hearing loss, as measured by speech audiometry Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant word&#xD;
      scores and tympanometry (subject to the modified TUNE grading scale testing results;&#xD;
      otherwise, it will be an exploratory objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess hearing-related QOL as measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory-Screening&#xD;
      (HHIA-S) (secondary PRO), between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect blood and tissue specimens for future translational science studies. For&#xD;
      instance, to examine how germline and somatic genetic variants, such as TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA,&#xD;
      PTEN, NFE2L2, and KEAP1, may influence cisplatin-related efficacy and toxicity, and to assess&#xD;
      the effect of regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use and genomic&#xD;
      activation of PIK3CA (mutation or amplification) or loss of PTEN, the negative regulator of&#xD;
      PI3K, on disease-free survival or overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (NON-OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER [OPC]/p16-NEGATIVE OPC): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy over 5 fractions a week for a total of 33-35&#xD;
      fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive high-dose cisplatin intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (Q3W) (on days 1, 22, and&#xD;
      43) during radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy over 5 fractions a week for a total of 33-35&#xD;
      fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive low-dose cisplatin IV once a week (QW) during radiation therapy in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (p16-POSITIVE OPC/CANCER OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY [CUP]): Patients are randomized to 1 of&#xD;
      2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients undergo radiation therapy over 5 fractions a week for a total of 33-35&#xD;
      fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive high-dose cisplatin IV Q3W (on days 1, 22, and 43) during radiation therapy in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Patients undergo radiation therapy over 5 fractions a week for a total of 33-35&#xD;
      fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive low-dose cisplatin IV QW during radiation therapy in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months&#xD;
      during year 1-2, every 6 months during year 3-5, then annually thereafter.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of SCCHN of the&#xD;
             oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, or p16-positive unknown primary prior to&#xD;
             registration; specimen from cervical lymph nodes with a well-defined primary site&#xD;
             documented clinically or radiologically is acceptable; in patients with carcinoma of&#xD;
             unknown primary this will be sufficient for pathologic confirmation without a&#xD;
             clinically or radiographically defined primary site&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC)/cancer of unknown primary (CUP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        P16 status based on local site immunohistochemical tissue staining is required. A cell&#xD;
        block obtained from a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy specimen may be used as the sole&#xD;
        diagnostic tissue. Centers are encouraged to contact the pathology chair for clarification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Institutions must screen patients for p16 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
             in order to be eligible for the trial using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement&#xD;
             Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. A rigorous laboratory accreditation process&#xD;
             similar to the United States (U.S.) CLIA certification, such as the provincial&#xD;
             accreditation status offered by the Ontario Laboratory Accreditation (OLA) Program in&#xD;
             Canada, the College of American Pathologists (CAP), or an equivalent accreditation in&#xD;
             other countries, is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The p16 results must be reported on the pathology report being submitted. The p16&#xD;
                  positivity is defined as &gt; 70% of tumor cells showing strong nuclear and/or&#xD;
                  cytoplasmic immunostaining with p16 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries: Analysis of p16 status&#xD;
                  is NOT required&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measurable disease&#xD;
                       at the primary site or at nodal stations. Simple tonsillectomy or local&#xD;
                       excision of the primary without removal of nodal disease is permitted, as is&#xD;
                       excision removing gross nodal disease but with intact primary site. Limited&#xD;
                       neck dissections retrieving =&lt; 4 nodes are permitted and considered as&#xD;
                       non-therapeutic nodal excisions&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinical stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC], 8th ed.),&#xD;
                       including no distant metastases based on the following diagnostic workup:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History/physical examination within 60 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One of the following imaging studies is required within 60 days prior to&#xD;
                  registration:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Computed tomography (CT) scan of neck (diagnostic quality with contrast, unless&#xD;
             contraindicated) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck (diagnostic quality with contrast, unless&#xD;
             contraindicated) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT of the neck; the CT&#xD;
             component should be of diagnostic quality with contrast, unless contraindicated.&#xD;
