      A First-in-Human, Multicenter, Phase 1/2, Open-Label Study of XTX202 in Patients with&#xD;
      Advanced Solid Tumors&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of XTX202, an engineered IL-2 prodrug with its activity&#xD;
      masked, as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will examine XTX202 monotherapy in an accelerated and standard 3+3 dose-escalation&#xD;
      design. Based on the results of Phase 1, patients with select advanced solid tumors will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;
