  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4,&#xD;
      programmed death-1, and programmed death-ligand 1 have achieved milestones in the treatment&#xD;
      of NSCLC, from back-line to first-line, and beyond. Is changing the standard of care for&#xD;
      NSCLC. Currently, several phases Ⅲ clinical studies of neoadjuvant immunity combined with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy are underway, suggested that neoadjuvant ICI therapy is a promising way&#xD;
      for locally advanced lung cancer. As an intermediate state in the process of tumor&#xD;
      metastasis, Oligometastatic NSCLC patients have a better prognosis and more likely to benefit&#xD;
      from local treatment than patients with extensive distant metastasis. However, there have&#xD;
      been few reports of salvage surgery after ICI treatment in Oligometastatic NSCLC, and only&#xD;
      one case has been reported to date. There is therefore a need to further gather evidence on&#xD;
      salvage surgery after ICI.&#xD;
