  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) to motivate self-management&#xD;
      behaviors of weight monitoring and physical activity in adults with heart failure (HF). Half&#xD;
      of the participants will receive the SCDG app and weight monitoring and physical activity&#xD;
      sensors and the other half will receive only the weight monitoring and physical activity&#xD;
      sensors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to obtain efficacy data through a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of a SCDG intervention that synchronizes with a Bluetooth-enabled weight scale and&#xD;
      activity tracker to activate game rewards and feedback based on real-time weight monitoring&#xD;
      and exercise behaviors of adult heart failure (HF) participants who are older than 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCDG involves a narrative, the goal of which is to help the avatar maintain good health&#xD;
      and quality of life by using game points, earned via the participant's real-time behaviors,&#xD;
      in game tasks that help maintain the avatar's optimal HF health status. Real-time behaviors&#xD;
      of weight-monitoring and physical activity will be tracked by an off-the-shelf sensors and&#xD;
      app (Withings). The data from the Withings sensors will then be routed to our SCDG app. The&#xD;
      digital game paired with sensors will enable objective tracking of real-time behaviors such&#xD;
      as physical activity, and weight monitoring, and provide personalized, contextually relevant&#xD;
      feedback (e.g., reduce fluid intake or call doctor for weight gain) to motivate engagement in&#xD;
      and generate habit formation of heart failure related self-management behaviors. The goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to determine efficacy of the SCDG concept for heart failure self-management&#xD;
      in a real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the initial efficacy of the SCDG intervention for primary outcome of rate of&#xD;
      engagement in HF self-management behavior of weight-monitoring and secondary outcomes of&#xD;
      physical activity engagement, HF self-management-knowledge, and self-efficacy, HF-functional&#xD;
      status, hospitalization, cognitive ability, depression and quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;
      For this study, 200 adults who are 45 years or older and who experienced HF hospitalization&#xD;
      in the past 6 months will be recruited through online recruiting methods from 7 southern U.S&#xD;
      states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas. Recruited,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either the SCDG intervention group that will receive&#xD;
      sensors tracking weight monitoring and activity and play the SCDG on a mobile smartphone for&#xD;
      24 weeks or a control group that will receive sensors and an app tracking activity and weight&#xD;
      monitoring, and standardized written HF educational modules.&#xD;
