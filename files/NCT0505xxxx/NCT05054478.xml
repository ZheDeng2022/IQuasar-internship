             (that is patients allowed to remain in the treatment phase of the study) is made for&#xD;
             radiation therapy to a pathological fracture site to enhance bone healing or to treat&#xD;
             post-fracture pain that is refractory to narcotic analgesics because pathologic bone&#xD;
             fractures do not by themselves fulfil a criterion for disease progression.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unable to take corticosteroid therapy, daratumumab, bortezomib and or lenalidomide at&#xD;

             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the&#xD;
             various formulations of any agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Known GI disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or&#xD;
