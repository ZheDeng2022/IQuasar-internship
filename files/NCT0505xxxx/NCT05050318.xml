      Study duration per participant is approximately 28 days for participants 6 months to &lt; 9&#xD;
      years of age if they receive 1 dose of vaccine. If they receive 2 doses, their study duration&#xD;
      is 56-70 total days. 21 days for participants ≥ 65 years of age, including 1 to 3 visits (1&#xD;
      or 2 vaccination visits) and 1 or 2 telephone calls, depending on study Group.&#xD;
