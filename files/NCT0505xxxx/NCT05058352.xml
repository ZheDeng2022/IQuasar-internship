  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, first in human study of HS269 tablet, a small molecule&#xD;
      highly-selective RET Inhibitor. The dose-escalation study will assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of HS269 and determine the dose and schedule to be used in&#xD;
      Phase II. Seventeen to thirty-six patients with advanced solid tumor may be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
