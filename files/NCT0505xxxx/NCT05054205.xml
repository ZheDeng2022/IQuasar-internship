  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an important chronic disease that causes&#xD;
      increasing mortality and morbidity globally, as well as a social and economic burden. All&#xD;
      symptoms (cough, sputum production, etc.), especially dyspnea in COPD, the chronicity of the&#xD;
      disease and the need for long-term care limit the lives of the patients. Dyspnea occurring in&#xD;
      COPD negatively affects the self-confidence of patients by restricting their activities of&#xD;
      daily living, thus causing a decrease in their self-efficacy levels. Low self-efficacy levels&#xD;
      cause patients to limit their activities more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses play an important role in ensuring the management of COPD, supporting patients to&#xD;
      continue their activities of daily living, and increasing their self-efficacy levels. Nursing&#xD;
      care that includes patient education and counseling is important in providing disease&#xD;
      management and symptom control, and increasing the self-efficacy levels of patients. During&#xD;
      self-management training, it is necessary to ensure that the patient is an active&#xD;
      participant, to use a motivating communication style in the behavior change process and to&#xD;
      encourage patients. In this process, it is stated that it is important to use motivational&#xD;
      interview techniques in self-management training given by nurses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the effect on self-efficacy of self-management&#xD;
      education and motivational interview among COPD patients. This randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental study was conducted between March and May 2018 with 39 intervention and 39&#xD;
      control groups, a total of 78 patients in the Chest Diseases Clinic of Chest Diseases&#xD;
      Hospital who were treated with COPD. In data collection; ''Patient Data Form'', ''Medical&#xD;
      Research Council (MRC) Dyspnea Scale'', ''COPD Self Efficacy Scale (CSES)'' were used. To the&#xD;
      experimental group; motivational interview based self-management education was given for&#xD;
      30-45 minutes with groups of 5-8 people, COPD education guide was given, questions were&#xD;
      shared with the question-answer method and group interaction was provided. After the&#xD;
      self-management education, 3 motivational interviews were conducted 3 days apart with 30-45&#xD;
      minutes. Normal care was continued in the control group. The data were collected in three&#xD;
      stages as pre-test, post-test and follow-up. According to the research ethics,&#xD;
      self-management education and COPD education guidelines were given to the control group and&#xD;
      motivational interviews were conducted. In this study, written consent was obtained from the&#xD;
      ethics committee, institutions and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-efficacy levels and dyspnea perception levels of COPD patients are the dependent&#xD;
           variables of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-management training and motivational interviewing given to COPD patients are the&#xD;
           independent variables of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control variables of the study; age, gender, marital status, education status,&#xD;
           occupation, employment status, smoking status, duration of being a COPD patient, number&#xD;
           of hospitalizations, drug use status, people living with at home, type of warming,&#xD;
           participation in COPD education and Pulmonary Rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0: Self-management training and motivational interviewing given to COPD patients have&#xD;
           no effect on self-efficacy and dyspnea perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1: Self-management training and motivational interviewing given to COPD patients have&#xD;
           an effect on self-efficacy and dyspnea perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All statistical analyzes were made SPSS 25 package program. The obtained data were&#xD;
           analyzed by means of percentage distributions, mean, variance analysis in repeated&#xD;
           measures, bonferroni analysis as a further analysis and t test in dependent groups.&#xD;

It is a five-point Likert scale; one corresponds to 'I am not confident' (not efficacious), two 'I am a little confident' (efficacious), three 'I am confident to some extent' (efficacious), four 'I am quite confident' (efficacious) and 5 'I am very confident' (efficacious). The highest and lowest scores for the scale are 170 and 34, respectively. An increase in the self-efficacy scale mean score indicates that the patient's self-efficacy level has improved.

    <description>The most current version of Motivational İnterviewing (MI) is described in detail in Miller and Rollnick (2013) Motivational Interviewing: Helping people to change (3rd edition). Key qualities include:&#xD;
MI is a guiding style of communication, that sits between following (good listening) and directing (giving information and advice).&#xD;
MI is designed to empower people to change by drawing out their own meaning, importance and capacity for change.&#xD;
MI is based on a respectful and curious way of being with people that facilitates the natural process of change and honors client autonomy.</description>
