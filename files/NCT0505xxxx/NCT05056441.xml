  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to compare long-term remission in participants receiving&#xD;
      vedolizumab (VDZ) and those receiving ustekinumab (UST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the study doctors will review each participant's past medical records. This&#xD;
      study is about collecting existing information only; participants will not receive treatment&#xD;
      or need to visit a study doctor during this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, retrospective study of participants with CD. The study will&#xD;
      review the medical charts of participants who have initiated the treatment with vedolizumab&#xD;
      and ustekinumab or another biologic agent (post- index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to enroll approximately 700 participants, with 350 participants in each of&#xD;
      the following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Vedolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Ustekinumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for participants will be collected in two main periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Index Event Period: From the date of diagnosis of CD until the date of index when&#xD;
           vedolizumab or ustekinumab was initiated during the eligibility period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-Index Event Period: From one day post-index when vedolizumab or ustekinumab was&#xD;
           initiated during the eligibility period until chart abstraction initiation, unless the&#xD;
           date of death or loss to follow-up is before the date of chart abstraction initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study will be conducted in Belgium, Australia, and Switzerland. The overall&#xD;
      time for data collection in the study will be approximately 12 months and the long-term&#xD;
      duration of the study is approximately 36 months.&#xD;
