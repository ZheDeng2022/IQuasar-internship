  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares patients' acceptability and safety of two established endoscopic methods&#xD;
      for treating dysplastic Barrett's esophagus: radiofrequency ablation versus hybrid argon&#xD;
      plasma coagulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and argon plasma coagulation (APC) are&#xD;
      established treatment modalities for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus. Recently, a modification&#xD;
      of the APC method has emerged, which involves a submucosal injection of saline preceding the&#xD;
      thermal ablation (hybrid-APC; h-APC). This allows to increase the procedure's safety and&#xD;
      presumably reduces the patients' post-procedural discomfort. Although both RFA and h-APC are&#xD;
      characterized by high effectiveness in eradicating Barrett's segments, limited data compares&#xD;
      the patient-related aspects of the procedures. To fill this knowledge gap, we set out a&#xD;
      single-center randomized-controlled trial to compare procedural acceptability, safety, and&#xD;
      impact on the quality of life, of the two methods.&#xD;

The QLQ-OES18 includes 18 questions: 6 single item subscales relating to saliva swallowing, choking, dry mouth, taste, coughing, and talking. It also includes 12 items grouped into 4 subscales: dysphagia (3 items), eating (4 items), reflux (2 items), and pain (3 items).</description>

    <description>Circumferential ablation with radiofrequency ablation will be performed for each segment of the BE starting from the proximal end with one ablation at 12J/cm2, followed by cleaning of mucosal slough with esophageal cap, patient extubation, cleaning of ablation device with wet gauze, and finally a second ablation at 12 J/cm2 (1 × 12J/cm2-clean-1 × 12 J/cm2). Focal ablations will be performed with three consecutive ablations at 12 J/cm2 without cleaning (simplified protocol).</description>
