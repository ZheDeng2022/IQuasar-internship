  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates parents' attitudes and beliefs on the risks of opioid use in children&#xD;
      with cancer. Pain is the common symptom reported by pediatric cancer patients. Opioids are&#xD;
      the mainstay in the treatment of cancer-related pain. Despite an almost universal desire to&#xD;
      prevent or mitigate pain in their children, parents exhibit complex behaviors from&#xD;
      withholding prescribed opioids entirely to giving less than the prescribed analgesic dose of&#xD;
      opioid to discontinuing despite ongoing pain. Information gathered from this study may help&#xD;
      address a crucial knowledge gap in researchers' understanding of parental attitudes and&#xD;
      beliefs regarding the risks associated with opioid use in children and adolescents.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine parents' level of concern regarding the use of opioids for pain in their&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore differences in parents' level of concern regarding the use of opioids for pain&#xD;
      in their children as well as level of concern for side effect of opioids between the opioid&#xD;
      subgroup and non-opioid subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore differences in other parental attitudes and beliefs between the opioid&#xD;
      subgroup and the non-opioid subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. For each concern, associations between:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Level of concern regarding the use of opioids and the age and disease of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIb. Level of concern regarding the use of opioids and parental history of addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIc. Level of concern regarding the use of opioids and a family history of addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
