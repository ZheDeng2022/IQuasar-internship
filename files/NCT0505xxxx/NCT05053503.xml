      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center, clinical trial in which&#xD;
      participants with a history of dependence on prescriptive or non-prescriptive opioids will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 into one of four treatment groups during Phase I (acute detoxification, 7&#xD;
      days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: Active tAN + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: Active tAN + lofexidine&#xD;

        3. Group 3: Sham tAN + placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group 4: Sham tAN + lofexidine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will occur during the participant's treatment in a residential detox center.&#xD;
      Participants will have the option to continue into Phase II of the trial at the conclusion of&#xD;
      their stay in the residential detox treatment program. In Phase II, participants will be&#xD;
      re-randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment groups and will return weekly for 90 days:&#xD;

    <measure>SOWS-Gossop</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS-Gossop is an appropriate, precise, and sensitive measure to evaluate the symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal in research or clinical settings. The scale was derived from the original 32-item Opiate Withdrawal Scale to reduce redundancy while providing an equally sensitive measure of opioid withdrawal symptom severity appropriate for research and clinical practice. The assessment is a self-administered test used for the assessment of opiate withdrawal symptoms. The scale contains ten items: yawning, muscular tension, runny eyes, muscle twitching, pains, and aches, feeling of coldness, stomach cramps, insomnia, heart pounding, and feeling sick, making it easy and rapid to administer. The tool has a 4-point rating scale: 0 for 'none,' 1 for 'mild,' 2 for 'moderate,' and 3 for 'severe', with scores ranging from 0 to 30.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is an 11-item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. This tool can be used in both inpatient and outpatient settings to reproducibly rate common signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal and monitor these symptoms over time. The summed score for the complete scale can be used to help clinicians determine the stage or severity of opiate withdrawal and assess the level of physical dependence on opioids. Scores range between 0 and 48 where total score is the sum of all the items. A higher score indicates more severe withdrawal symptoms. Scores between 5 and 12 indicate mild withdrawal, scores between 13 and 24 indicate moderate withdrawal, scores between 25 and 36 indicate moderately severe withdrawal and scores greater than 36 indicate severe withdrawal. A COWS score reduction of 15% or greater for a given individual is considered clinically significant.</description>

    <description>The 3-item Opioid Craving Scale (OCS) was adapted from the 3-item Cocaine Craving Scale for use with opioids.

Participants are asked to answer the following three questions with responses ranging from 0-10, where 0 = Not at all and 10 = Extremely. Total possible score ranges from 0 to 30 with greater scores indicating higher opioid craving.&#xD;
How much do you currently crave opiates?&#xD;
In the past week, please rate how strong your desire to use opiates has been when something in the environment has reminded you of opiates (example: seeing a medication bottle, using the Internet, visiting a doctor's office, going to a place where you used to buy drugs)?&#xD;
Please imagine yourself in the environment in which you previously used opiates (examples: a party, a hangout, a particular room where you live). If you were in this environment today and if it were the time of day that you</description>

    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a validated tool in mental health and considered a powerful tool to assist clinicians with diagnosing depression and monitoring treatment response. The relationship between opioid use and depression is bidirectional. The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression scale and is based directly on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV. Each of the nine items is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) scale. A total score is calculated by summing the nine items. Scores range from 0 to 27 and higher scores indicate a higher degree of depression.</description>

    <description>Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and opiate dependency may overlap, to which, opioid withdrawal symptoms may emulate PTSD hyperactive startle response. This is indicative a common physiological mechanism. The PCL-5 scale is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. It consisted of a 20-item self-report measurement that is capable of measuring symptom change during and after treatment. Additionally, the scale can provide a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Each of the 20 items is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) scale. A total symptom severity score is calculated by summing the 20 items. Scores range from 0 and 80 and higher scores indicating a higher degree of PTSD symptomology. Evidence suggests that a10 to 20-point reduction in score represents a clinically significant change in PTSD symptoms.</description>

    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is a shorter version of the original assessment tool and is commonly used in clinical trials with participants undergoing substance use disorder intervention. The WHOQOL-BREF is comprised of 26-items and assesses the participant's quality of life across specific domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. In addition, there are 2 items that measure overall quality of life and general health. Participants rate how much they have experienced each item in the preceding 2 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely). Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction with higher scores denoting higher quality of life. The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Raw domain scores will be converted to a 0 to 100 scale.</description>
