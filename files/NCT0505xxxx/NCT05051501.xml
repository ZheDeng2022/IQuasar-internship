  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop probiotic dietary supplements intended for the&#xD;
      elderly, which can modify the composition of the intestinal microbiota typically occurring in&#xD;
      the aging population. According to currently held scientific knowledge, it is postulated that&#xD;
      the probiotics-induced normalization of the physiological axis in the brain-intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota affects the activity of the nervous system. Thus, normalization of this axis&#xD;
      should lead to observable improvements in cognitive functions and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With an increasing age of the population, the incidence of age-related problems, such as&#xD;
      memory deficits or negative changes in mood, is on the rise. On this account, an increased&#xD;
      emphasis has been placed on identifying natural ways to reduce the occurrence of such&#xD;
      problems. One of the proposed methods to achieve this is to modify the composition of gut&#xD;
      bacteria and their by-products, which has shown a surprising, yet highly promising potential&#xD;
      to benefit the brain function and blood composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent years, gut bacteria have been of great interest to many medical professionals&#xD;
      from various disciplines. It is postulated that they might exert some influence on memory and&#xD;
      emotions, but there is a lack of evidence to confirm these hypotheses. Our study would like&#xD;
      to address this issue and examine the beneficial effects of probiotics into more depth.&#xD;
      Probiotics are dietary supplements in the form of bacteria, which are often artificially&#xD;
      added e.g. into some dairy products. This is done to promote gut health and to improve the&#xD;
      quality of gut microflora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject selection and assessment are summarised as follows: Participants will be&#xD;
      pre-selected electronically and given an electronic memory test. Further selection of&#xD;
      eligible subjects based on their preliminary results will be followed by the first personal&#xD;
      appointment, where each participant will undergo memory and mood-focused psychological&#xD;
      testing and testing for gut bacteria composition. One week after the initial appointment,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to bring in a stool and urine sample, their blood will be&#xD;
      collected and their fitness and dietary habits assessed. Each participant will also be given&#xD;
      an electronic watch, which will monitor their physical activity, and supplements in the pill&#xD;
      form, which either contain specially cultivated human gut bacteria (i.e. probiotics) or&#xD;
      placebo. Identical tests and blood, urine and stool collection will be repeated three months&#xD;
      after administering the first pill. The participants will receive another set of pills, which&#xD;
      will contain the probiotics if the participant has initially received placebo and vice versa.&#xD;
      After three more months, participants will be subjected to the same tests as in the previous&#xD;
      two instants and the project will reach its termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the above-mentioned methods, the aim of this project is to provide sufficient evidence&#xD;
      of the beneficial effects of the new probiotics on memory, mood and the biochemical&#xD;
      components contained in the blood, stool and urine in elderly population.&#xD;
