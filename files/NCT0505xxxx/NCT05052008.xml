      The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of erenumab on frequency of monthly&#xD;
      migraine days in adults at baseline, 3 months and 6 months, disability in patients with&#xD;
      chronic migraine and on post covid migraine severity&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a debilitating disorder that affects 37 million people in the United States.&#xD;
      Recently, three new injectables calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor&#xD;
      antagonists-erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab-were FDA approved for prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment of migraine in adults, that plays a key role in migraine pathophysiology. By&#xD;
      blocking the receptor function of CGRP, these agents can reduce the total number of headache&#xD;
      days per month and limit the need for using multiple medications. In clinical trials, these&#xD;
      agents, which have no drug interactions and minimal adverse reactions, reduced headache days&#xD;
      per month by as much as 50% in patients experiencing multiple migraine days each month. These&#xD;
      new biologics, however, are more expensive for the patient compared with other prophylactic&#xD;
      treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational of this study was to assess the efficacy of erenumab on frequency of monthly&#xD;
      migraine days in adults at baseline, 3 months and 6 months, disability in patients with&#xD;
      chronic migraine and on post covid migraine severity&#xD;

        Migraine prevention is an area of a large unmet medical need, with existing prophylactic&#xD;
        therapies often having modest efficacy and poor tolerability. Calcitonin gene-related&#xD;
        peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonism is a novel approach to migraine preventive therapy.&#xD;
        Erenumab is a human monoclonal antibody against CGRP receptor. The present study is a phase&#xD;
        3 trial intended to assess the efficacy and safety of erenumab for prevention of migraine&#xD;
        in Egyptian adults with chronic migraine (CM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study consists of a screening period (up to 24 weeks, including at baseline period), a&#xD;
        12-week period and a 24-week period ,.&#xD;
