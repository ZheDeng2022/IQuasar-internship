  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite declining mortality in high-income countries, cervical cancer continues to be a&#xD;
      public health problem in low and middle -income countries. HPV tests have shown a better&#xD;
      sensibility and a higher capacity of reducing mortality than cytology based-screening.&#xD;
      Greater participation has been demonstrated with the use of HPV self-testing when it is&#xD;
      offered to women with a poor screening history; however, it is not clear whether getting&#xD;
      tested necessarily translates into a greater adherence to the entire clinical protocol,&#xD;
      including diagnosis and treatment of precancerous lesions. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the self-testing techniques on the participation and adherence of&#xD;
      women to cervical cancer screening.&#xD;

      The investigators will perform a randomized clinical trial with three arms including: regular&#xD;
      HPV with cytology triage, colpo/biopsy, and treatment if indicated; HPV self-collection&#xD;
      without cytology triage but with colpo/biopsy and treatment if indicated, HPV self-collection&#xD;
      with immediate treatment for women with positive test results. This study will be carried out&#xD;
      in two different settings with differential access to diagnosis and treatment. Two methods&#xD;
      will be used for inviting women and collecting samples: mail and door-to-door. Participation&#xD;
      (screening uptake) and adherence to the clinical protocol (compliance with diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment) will be evaluated.&#xD;
