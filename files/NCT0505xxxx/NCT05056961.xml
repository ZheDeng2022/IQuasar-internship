  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some ICU ventilated patients might present with large tidal volume despite very low or&#xD;
      inexistant presser support. Patient-Self Inflicted Lung Injury (P-SILI) might appear related&#xD;
      with large alveolar stretch an distension. Two clinical presentations are observed: patients&#xD;
      with or without respiratory distress signs such as supra-clavicular depression and&#xD;
      thoracic-abdominal asynchronies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the pulmonary physio(-patho)logical parameters of these&#xD;
      two types of patients (eupneic or with respiratory distress signs), and presenting important&#xD;
      TV in spite of a minimal adjustment of the ventilatory support, except for Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of invasive mechanical ventilation is one of the most frequent therapies in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. There are several types of indication, depending on the failure: mainly&#xD;
      neurological, hemodynamic or respiratory. In recent years, the concept of Ventilator Induced&#xD;
      Lung Injury (VILI) has led to changes in ventilator settings in both intensive care units and&#xD;
      operative rooms. Thus, tidal volume (TV) reduction to 6-8 mL.kg-1 of predicted body weight,&#xD;
      the use of an individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the possible use of&#xD;
      therapies to optimize pulmonary aeration (alveolar recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning&#xD;
      sessions...) have become mandatory. More recently, some authors have described the existence&#xD;
      of Patient-Self Inflicted Lung Injury (P-SILI). In certain situations (delirium,&#xD;
      encephalopathies, pulmonary receptor stimulation, metabolic acidosis...), some patients may&#xD;
      present, in spite of an &quot;optimized&quot; ventilator setting, very important VT, which may exceed&#xD;
      10 mL.kg-1 of theoretical ideal weight. Two circumstances of observation of these large VT&#xD;
      needs despite low pressure supports can be observed. The first corresponds to a patient with&#xD;
      signs of respiratory distress (signs of respiratory distress: supra-clavicular,&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal asynchronies...) who presents with significant inspiratory efforts. The&#xD;
      second is a patient with no sign of respiratory distress (eupnea). In both cases, the&#xD;
      &quot;trigger&quot; comes from a (hyper)-stimulation (drive) of respiratory brainstem centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is currently uncertain whether these two types of patients are comparable in terms of&#xD;
      P-SILI. It is possible that in the second case, lesions are non-existent (or minimal) due to&#xD;
      low trans-pulmonary pressure (stress) and low levels of pulmonary alveolar distension&#xD;
      (strain). Indeed, the most likely determinant of alveolar injury is trans-pulmonary pressure,&#xD;
      defined as the difference between upper airway pressure and pleural pressure (Ptp = Paw -&#xD;
      Ppl). Thus, in case of a negative pathophysiological parameter, it would be preferable to&#xD;
      sedate the patient more deeply and to temporarily consider controlled mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      to limit the alveolar stretch and lesions. However, we know that excessive sedation of&#xD;
      resuscitation patients increases their morbidity and mortality, by exposing them to increased&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation, and thus to the risk of pneumonia acquired under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. In this context, daily sedation release tests are recommended.&#xD;
      Physicians must therefore find the right balance between an optimal level of sedation&#xD;
      compatible with the least deleterious ventilatory support possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the pulmonary physio(-patho)logical parameters of these&#xD;
      two types of patients (eupneic or with respiratory distress signs), and presenting important&#xD;
      TV in spite of a minimal adjustment of the ventilatory support, except for Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
