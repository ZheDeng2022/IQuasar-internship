  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aberration of glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer cells, and plays an important role in&#xD;
      oncogenesis and cancer progression, including metastasis. One of the markers of aberrant&#xD;
      glycosylation (O-linked) is the binding of the lectin Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), which&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in a wide range of human cancers, especially in tumours with a more&#xD;
      aggressive phenotype. Data on the role of HPA within follicular neoplasms of the thyroid&#xD;
      gland are currently lacking, therefore we sought to investigate possible changes in cell&#xD;
      surface glycosylation associated with this type of neoplasms.&#xD;

      Lectin-histochemistry was performed on 37 archival paraffin wax-embedded specimens of various&#xD;
      follicular thyroid tumours (10 follicular adenomas (FA), 10 minimally invasive follicular&#xD;
      carcinomas (miFTC), 13 widely invasive follicular cancers (wiFTC) and 4 metastatic follicular&#xD;
      thyroid cancers (metFTC)). Sections were scored as positive when ≥5% of cancer cells labelled&#xD;
      positive, and scored as negative when &lt;5% labelled positive for HPA binding. Assessments of&#xD;
      HPA-binding were performed by two observers, who were blinded to the identity of the sample,&#xD;
      and their results were compared.&#xD;

    <description>A Statistical association of HPA-binding positivity with other known adverse prognostic tumour markers (e.g. capsular or lymphovascular invasion) will be assessed using crosstabs and the non-parametric product limit method. Binary logistic regression models will be further developed using relevant clinicopathologic variables to determine their association with HPA-labelling to produce relative risks (odds ratios (ORs)).</description>
