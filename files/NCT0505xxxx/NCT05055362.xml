      The purpose of this research is to determine the effect a spiced-infused baked good has on&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers in adults who are overweight and/or who has chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      Participants will be involved for 10 days in this research study.&#xD;

      The dietary intervention will for 10-days, in which participants will eat a baked good each&#xD;
      day for a total of 10 days. This baked good contains honey and spices (cinnamon and&#xD;
      turmeric). At the first day of the study, participants will provide a urine sample, saliva&#xD;
      sample, be weighed, take a pregnancy test, complete a total of 3 surveys - dietary and spice&#xD;
      intake and demographics. Each survey will take no more than 10 minutes for a total of 30&#xD;
      minutes. At the end of the 10 days, participants will provide a saliva sample and complete 2&#xD;
      surveys - dietary and spice intake. Each survey will take no more than 10 minutes for a total&#xD;
      of 20 minutes. Each day of the baked good intervention, participants will tick off the amount&#xD;
      of baked good consumed (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0%).&#xD;

    <description>The dietary intervention will be a 10-day feasibility trial, using a honey, spice infused baked good. The participants will receive the baked good on day 1 and will be asked to consume a 50-gram baked good daily for 10 days with or without their meals. The honey, spice infused baked good will contain 15g honey and 3g of spice blend (turmeric and cinnamon). A saliva sample will be taken at the start of the intervention (day 1) before consumption of the baked good and after the intervention ends (day 10), 2 hours after consuming the final baked good. Additionally, participants will provide a urine sample to determine microalbuminuria level, complete a spice-consumption survey and a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (day 1). At day 10, participants will indicate if their spice consumption and dietary intake has changed over the past 10 days. Each day, they will tick off the amount of baked good consumed (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0%).</description>
