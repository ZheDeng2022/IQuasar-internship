      Introduction Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most common form of entrapment neuropathy.&#xD;
      CTS is defined as a symptomatic compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of&#xD;
      the wrist, characterized physiologically by evidence of increased pressure within the carpal&#xD;
      tunnel and decreased function of the nerve at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of CTS is mainly a clinical one based on the history and physical examination by&#xD;
      Tinnel's test Phanel's test and Reverse Phalen's test.The Reverse Phalen's test is more&#xD;
      appropriate clinical test for truly compressing the carpal tunnel and provoking symptoms of&#xD;
      CTS The gold standard of diagnosis is nerve conduction velocity study (SNCV) and&#xD;
      ultrasonography. SNCV is highly specific and it rules out neuropathies and demyelinating&#xD;
      disease but it has a considerable false negative rate of 10-20% . Ultrasonography has high&#xD;
      sensitivity (89%) and specificity (83%) for the diagnosis of CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) is used for the assessment and the grading of median&#xD;
      nerve pathology. While patients hold their wrists in a neutral position with the palm up and&#xD;
      fingers semi-extended, the CSA of the median nerve will be measured in ellipse adjusted to&#xD;
      maximum transverse and anteroposterior diameter at the proximal inlet of the carpal tunnel at&#xD;
      the level of the pisiform bone. The normal CSA is 9 mm2. The cross-section area cutoff points&#xD;
      that discriminate between different grades of CTS severity are 10-15 mm2 for mild to moderate&#xD;
      symptoms, and &gt;15 mm2 for severe symptoms PRF treatment is well established intervention&#xD;
      technique for treatment of CT.Although the mechanism of action of PRF is not yet known but it&#xD;
      has been postulated that PRF has a neuromodulatory effect as it modifies the neuronal&#xD;
      membranes and selectively targets the small diameter C and A -ᶑ fibers PRP is autologous&#xD;
      fraction of human blood that encompasses a bigger concentration of platelets than baseline&#xD;
      levels of blood. PRP contains platelet degradation production the form of multiple growth&#xD;
      factors such as are transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta),vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and epithelial growth factor (EGF). PRP&#xD;
      therapies aim to enhance the self-healing ability of human body, by exposing the injured&#xD;
      tissue to a high concentration of autologous growth factors. Increased Schwann cell&#xD;
      proliferation, myelinization, axonal regeneration, and better nerve healing after injury have&#xD;
      been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system has increasingly been implicated in numerous neurological disorders.&#xD;
      Patients with CTS have adaptive changes in the homeostasis of memory T cells and an increase&#xD;
      in systemic inflammatory response modulating cytokines/chemokines. Which is a prominent&#xD;
      feature of neuroinflammation and elevated levels of certain cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6&#xD;
      (interlukin 6), and IL-1β, have been demonstrated in patients with painful peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of pulsed radiofrequency versus&#xD;
      platelet rich plasma injection in treatment of idiopathic mild to moderate carpal tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the study Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients aged (30-50) years of both gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with mild to moderate idiopathic CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient who are failed to respond to conservative treatment (such as splint,&#xD;
           medications, physical therapy) for at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Severe CTS and secondary CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified into three equal groups using randomized closed envelop method&#xD;
      into three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group ( n=25):Patients will receive median nerve perineural injection of bupivacaine&#xD;
      with mehylprednisolone under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;

      ultrasound guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be then assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed medical and surgical history taking. Clinical examination for median nerve by&#xD;
      Reverse Phalen's test, Tinel's tests and Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ)&#xD;
      Cross-sectional area (CSA): The median nerve will be identified using a 38 mm,L25x ,13-6 MHz,&#xD;
      linear array transducer with a portable, bedside Ultrasound unit (Sonosite S-Nerve ,Sonosite&#xD;
      Inc.,USA). The probe will be inserted in transversve direction at proximal crease of hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve conduction velocity study (SNCV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations via venous blood sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Random blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulation profile (PT,PTT, INR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune test :Serum Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α). All the procedures and the tests&#xD;
           including VAS and BCTQ questionnaire will be explained to all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be admitted to day case unit then they will be transferred to block room ,&#xD;
      On arrival to the block room, patients will be connected to the standard monitoring (Drager&#xD;
      Infiniti Gamma Patient Monitor) to display the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three lead Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive arterial blood pressure All patient will receive intravenouse sedation via&#xD;
           peripheral line as midazolam with dosage range: 0.5 to 2 mg over ≥2 minutes; will repeat&#xD;
           every 2 to 5 minutes as needed; titrate to clinical effect; maximum total dose: 5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patient randomized to PRP group, 10 ml of whole blood will be freshly collected from each&#xD;
      patient on citrated tube.The tubes will be initially centrifuged using (Electric centrifuge,&#xD;
      model 800,China ) at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant plasma will be collected in&#xD;
      another sterile plain tube and will be centrifuged again at 4000rpm for 15 minutes. The&#xD;
      supernatant platelet poor plasma (PPP) will be removed leaving 2 ml of PRP on sediment&#xD;
      (platelet pellet) which will be suspended by gently shaking the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: With the palm facing upwards and the wrist joint in slight extension, the&#xD;
      median nerve will be identified at the inlet of the carpal tunnel at the level of the&#xD;
      pisiform bone using linear array transducer of bedside ultrasound unit. The skin will be&#xD;
      prepared with povidone and draped in a sterile fashion, then local anesthetic infiltration&#xD;
      using 1ml xylocaine 2% (Debocaine vial, sigma tec pharmaceutical) will be given using a&#xD;
      25-gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group : A 22-gauge needle of venous cannula will be gently advanced in transverse&#xD;
      direction under ultrasound guidance using the in-plane technique via ulnar side of wrist&#xD;
      towards the median nerve and 1ml bupivacaine 0.25% (Sunny bupivacaine vial, sunny medical&#xD;
      group) plus 1ml (40 mg) mehylprednisolone (Solu Medrol 500mg vial, Pfizer) in total volume&#xD;
      2ml will be injected in perineural plane in the carpal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRF Group : After US identification of the median nerve , a 5-cm radiofrequency curved&#xD;
      cannula with a 10-mm active tip will be inserted under ultrasound guidance using the in-plane&#xD;
      technique in transverse direction. Using (Neurotherm NT1000, Neurotherm Inc., USA) sensory&#xD;
      and motor stimulation will be tested after the needle tip placement near the median nerve.&#xD;
      Responses to sensory and motor stimulation will be checked at 50 Hz, 0.5 V and at 2 Hz, 1 V&#xD;
      respectively. PRF lesion will be carried out for 120 seconds at a 2 Hz frequency and pulse&#xD;
      width of 20 ms at 42°C. Then 2ml of bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected perineurally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP Group : A 22-gauge needle of venous cannula will be gently advanced in transverse&#xD;
      direction under ultrasound guidance using the in-plane technique under ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      using the in-plane technique towards the median nerve and 2 ml of PRP will be injected&#xD;
      perineural in the carpal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Procedure Care For Three Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be advised to apply ice on the injection site at day of intervention and&#xD;
           modify activity as tolerated to alleviate any post injection discomfort or pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain medication in the form of paracetamol (500mg) only will be allowed for the next 3&#xD;
           months if needed. The patients will be instructed to stop analgesics 48hr before visit&#xD;
           of follow up to allow proper symptoms assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
