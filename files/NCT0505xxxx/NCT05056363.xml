  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional structural deformity of the&#xD;
      spine in which lateral flexion and axial rotation are seen in vertebrae with a Cobb (method&#xD;
      for measuring spinal curvature) angle of 10° and above. AIS is the most common type of&#xD;
      scoliosis and it occurs in the period from the onset of puberty (up to 10 years) until the&#xD;
      closure of growth plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with AIS have cosmetic effects, decrease in functional capacity, muscle weakness in&#xD;
      certain parts of the body, decrease in quality of life and posture disorders. Lack of core&#xD;
      stability might be causing these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core stability training may have a positive effect for these problems experienced by children&#xD;
      with AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologies that cause the disease may originate from the nervous system and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system. In this study, the investigators will evaluate these systems objectively with EMG&#xD;
      biofeedback and Isokinetic Testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show the effect of core stability training on various problems&#xD;
      (as we mentioned before) caused by the disease. In addition, the investigators of this study&#xD;
      hope to contribute to the literature(with objective evaluations) about the pathological&#xD;
      background and treatment of this challenging disease which the cause is unknown.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life will be measured with using the Scoliosis Research Society 22 item questionnaire (SRS-22r).&#xD;
SRS-22 has a minimum score of 22 and a maximum score of 110. Each question is scored on 1-5 scale. Questions are sorted into different domains and total and mean scores for each domain are calculated. A total score for the entire questionnaire is also calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patients cosmetic deformity will be evaluated with Walter Reed Visuel Assesment Scale.&#xD;
This scale includes seven items with figures representing different aspects of the spinal deformity: spinal deformity, rib prominence, lumbar prominence, thoracic deformity, trunk imbalance, shoulder asymmetry and scapular asymmetry. The figures are scored from minimum (1, no deformity) to maximum (5, severe deformity) and summed up to yield a total score (minimum: 5 points, maximum: 35 points).</description>
