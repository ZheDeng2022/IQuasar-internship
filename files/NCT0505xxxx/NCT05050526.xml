  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formal caregiving of elderly dependent people is a both physically and psychologically&#xD;
      demanding job, and both musculoskeletal and mental disorders with a negative impact in&#xD;
      general health and quality of life are habitual among eldercare workers. Previous research&#xD;
      has shown that physical exercise programs can reduce and/or prevent those disorders,&#xD;
      consequently improving well-being at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online exercise interventions might be a cost-effective tool, as they can reach a large&#xD;
      number of people at a relatively low cost. Moreover, they are compatible with situations in&#xD;
      which interpersonal physical distancing is required, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      However, real-time videoconference-based exercise interventions have not yet been studied in&#xD;
      working populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the effects of a real-time videoconference-based&#xD;
      exercise intervention in eldercare workers. The primary outcome will be low back pain. Pain&#xD;
      in neck, shoulders and wrists/hands will also be recorded, as well as additional measures of&#xD;
      physical fitness, psychoaffective state, health and work-related variables. All outcomes will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline and at 12-week and 1-year follow-ups.&#xD;

    <description>12-week exercise program consisting of two weekly 45 minute group-based sessions, remotely supervised by a professional via real-time videoconference. Each session will consist of a warm-up (5-10 min), general strengthening (30 min) and cool-down (5-10 min). Warm-up will include general joint mobility and exercises focused on increasing heart rate. General strengthening will include 4 series of 6 exercises (2 for lower limb, 2 for upper limb and 2 for the trunk) performed with minimal equipment, combining body-weight and elastic-band exercises. Three difficulty levels will be set for each of the exercises, and progression will be made at weeks 5 and 9. Participants will be asked to work in a given rate of perceived exertion (between 3 and 6 in Borg's CR10 scale) and not to reach failure in any of the exercises. Cool-down will include stretching and breathing/relaxing exercises.</description>
