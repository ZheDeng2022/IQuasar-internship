  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      De-identified whole blood and serum samples are collected for the purpose of evaluating the&#xD;
      performance (sensitivity/specificity) of the HelioLiver Test for the detection of&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to define the performance characteristics (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of the Helio Liver Test within a study population of subjects that have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with liver cancer at various stages (I to IV) and for control subjects who have&#xD;
      been confirmed to not have liver cancer by at least one imaging technique, such as&#xD;
      ultrasound, MRI or CT. Control subjects will include patients who are at high-risk for liver&#xD;
      cancer and have been recommended to undergo liver cancer surveillance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has provided informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is 18 to 75 years old (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
        For subjects diagnosed with HCC, the subject must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have active HCC at the time of the blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has not undergone treatment for HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        For subjects diagnosed with primary liver cancer, the subject has been recently diagnosed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has a â‰¥1 cm lesion that is indicated to be HCC by MRI or CT due to exhibiting&#xD;
             arterial phase hyperenhancement in combination with washout appearance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a lesion of any size that is indicated to be HCC due to capsule appearance&#xD;
             by 4 phase CT scan or multiphase contrast enhanced MRI&#xD;
&#xD;

                  radiotherapy, liver transplant or other treatment indicated for HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject has undergone prior or current treatment for HCC with sorafenib,&#xD;
                  regorafenib, or other treatment indicated for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject has received a cancer diagnosis within the past 5 years for any cancer&#xD;
                  (with the exceptions of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject has received treatment for any cancer, including chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
                  radiation therapy, within 5 years prior to enrollment/sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject have received IV contrast dye (for multiphasic CT or MRI) within 1 day&#xD;
                  [or 24 hours] of blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject has undergone fine needle aspiration (FNA) of target pathology withing 3&#xD;
                  days prior to blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject has undergone a biopsy (other than FNA) of target pathology withing 7&#xD;
                  days prior to blood collection.&#xD;
