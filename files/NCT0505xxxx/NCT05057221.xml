    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the drug uproleselan can help patients with&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Investigators will study both the side effects of the drug and&#xD;
      assess if the drug will help patients recover more quickly and slow down the progression of&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure.&#xD;

      Soluble E-selectin is a significant biomarker for ARDS. Soluble E-selectin also has&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory properties further releasing cytokines and promoting its synthesis and the&#xD;
      continued influx of neutrophils. Small molecule glycomimetic antagonists of E-selectin&#xD;
      (rivipansel and uproleselan) are 500- to 1000-fold more potent inhibitors of E-selectin and&#xD;
      have shown activity and no measurable toxicity in human clinical trials for other&#xD;
      indications. Treatment with these E-selectin inhibitors reduced the levels of soluble&#xD;
      E-selectin in the bloodstream which occurs during recovery of ARDS. Thus antagonists of&#xD;
      E-selectin which include glycomimetic antagonists and more specifically, rivipansel&#xD;
      (GMI-1070) and uproleselan (GMI-1271), may be used to treat COVID-19 patients with&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms that may lead to ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of uproleselan in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if treatment with uproleselan administered intravenously in addition to the best&#xD;
      available therapy according to institutional guidelines is able to reduce the progression of&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure, in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure through Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate overall survival and all-cause mortality at day 15 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in the COVID ordinal outcomes scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess adverse events to evaluate the safety of uproleselan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, oxygen, vasopressor free days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in D-dimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the correlation of plasma soluble E-selectin concentrations with clinical&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the correlations of other biomarkers of interest with clinical outcome.&#xD;
