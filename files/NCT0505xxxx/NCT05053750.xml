    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot trial of weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab with or without&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess macrophage counts by image cytometry in women with platinum resistant ovarian&#xD;
      cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab and ZA relative to weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel/bevacizumab. The primary endpoint is the percentage changes in macrophage count&#xD;
      from baseline to after 2 cycles of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of combination weekly&#xD;
           paclitaxel/bevacizumab and ZA relative to weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab in women with&#xD;
           platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate toxicity of the two arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess objective response and duration of response by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess differential effects from baseline, within and between patient treatment cohorts,&#xD;
      on macrophage and hypoxia markers, CSF1/R and MHCII, plasma biomarker (VEGF, VEGFR, IL6, IL8,&#xD;
      FGF, PDGFAA), tumor and macrophage-derived exosomes, and single-cell level changes.&#xD;
