      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) represents an opportunity to evaluate the upper airway in&#xD;
      sleep-like conditions. In its current clinical form, however, DISE does not routinely&#xD;
      determine the functional impact of anatomic and neuromuscular factors on airflow obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will apply nasal pressure (CPAP) during DISE to generate pressure-flow and pressure-area&#xD;
      relationships, deriving functional determinants of upper airway obstruction during sleep. In&#xD;
      addition, we will use objective anatomic measurements from computerized tomography (CT) and&#xD;
      submental ultrasound. Our findings will allow us to streamline the upper airway exam during&#xD;
      DISE, and will further the goal of developing personalized solutions that address specific&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms of pharyngeal collapse and airflow obstruction during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the physiologic and anatomic features derived from DISE and imaging to determine&#xD;
      which are predictive of success to standard-of-care surgical interventions (e.g. skeletal,&#xD;
      soft tissue, neurostimulation) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction due to&#xD;
      inadequate muscle tone during sleep leading to nocturnal hypercapnia, repeated oxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      desaturations and arousals. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the therapeutic&#xD;
      mainstay for OSA, but adherence remains poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there exist 3 classes of surgical therapy for OSA, each addressing a specific&#xD;
      pathologic structure: skeletal surgery (target: jaw bones), neurostimulation (target:&#xD;
      tongue), and soft tissue (target: soft palate). Unfortunately, there is a critical knowledge&#xD;
      gap in terms of accurately identifying a patient's underlying mechanism of obstruction; as a&#xD;
      result, the efficacy of surgical treatment is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) represents an opportunity to evaluate the upper airway in&#xD;
      sleep-like conditions. In its current clinical form, however, DISE does not routinely&#xD;
      determine the functional impact of anatomic and neuromuscular factors on airflow obstruction.&#xD;
      In June 2020, our group implemented a pilot protocol (IRB # 833511) to utilize measures of&#xD;
      airflow, pressure catheters, and ultrasound to enhance our DISE exam. Over the course of 100&#xD;
      patients, we refined our research protocol to generate a safe, efficient, and comprehensive&#xD;
      physiologic exam of the upper airway in the clinical setting (Dedhia et al, ORL, 2021, in&#xD;
      press).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper airway pressure-flow and pressure-area relationships will be characterized during a&#xD;
      standard-of-care DISE by stepping through a range of nasal pressure (CPAP) levels to derive&#xD;
      functional determinants of upper airway obstruction during sleep. Our preliminary work in&#xD;
      this area has shown patients requiring lower pressures to restore airflow experience improved&#xD;
      outcomes with neurostimulation surgery.1 Our overall hypothesis is that upper airway&#xD;
      pressure-flow/area relationships can be used to predict response to all 3 major classes of&#xD;
      sleep surgery: skeletal, neurostimulation, and soft tissue. We will address this hypothesis&#xD;
      by characterizing upper airway pressure-flow and pressure-area relationships while utilizing&#xD;
      objective anatomic measurements from CT and ultrasound. Our findings will allow us to&#xD;
      streamline the upper airway exam during DISE, and will further the goal of developing&#xD;
      personalized solutions that address specific pathogenic mechanisms of pharyngeal collapse and&#xD;
      airflow obstruction during sleep.&#xD;
