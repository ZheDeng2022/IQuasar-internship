  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is an antibody-mediated autoimmune glomerular disease,&#xD;
      that represents one of the most frequent causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. The&#xD;
      first-generation chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is effective in inducing MN&#xD;
      remission in the majority of patients, but a significant fraction of them can experience&#xD;
      disease relapses that require multiple re-treatments over time. Repeated infusions may result&#xD;
      in hypersensitivity reactions, which contraindicate further treatment with rituximab.&#xD;
      Independent of previous treatment response, Rituximab-Intolerant patients require a safe and&#xD;
      effective therapeutic alternative that could reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.&#xD;
      On the other end a substantial proportion of patients do not benefit of rituximab therapy and&#xD;
      might benefit of other anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies. A few patients transiently benefit of&#xD;
      rituximab but their relapses after rituximab administration are so frequent that they spend&#xD;
      most of their live with nephrotic range proteinuria (rituximab-dependent patients).&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with enhanced B cell-depleting potential. Due&#xD;
      to humanization and glycoengineering, this drug may be safe and effective in inducing disease&#xD;
      remission even in patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab. Moreover, it&#xD;
      has been found to be effective in patients with membranous nephropathy who failed to respond&#xD;
      to rituximab.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults (≥18 years old) on the day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Primary membranous nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Availability of a recent (over the last month) diagnostic kidney biopsy to confirm the&#xD;
             diagnosis of membranous nephropathy and quantify the severity of chronic changes and&#xD;
             the number of glomerular podocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. High-risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease due to persistent nephrotic-range&#xD;
             proteinuria (urinary protein excretion &gt; 3.5 g/24-hours as a median of three&#xD;
             consecutive measurements) despite background treatment with RAS-inhibitors (ACEi&#xD;
             and/or ARBs) at the maximum tolerated doses for at least six months before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Failure to definitively and effectively respond to rituximab therapy because of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. RITUXIMAB-INTOLERANCE, i.e. any previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to&#xD;
                  rituximab (acute grade III or IV adverse reactions requiring advanced care, or&#xD;
                  late reactions including delayed serum sickness syndrome) that, independent of&#xD;
                  response to treatment, preclude further exposure to the drug; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. RITUXIMAB-RESISTANCE: no evidence of nephrotic syndrome complete remission&#xD;
                  (24-hour proteinuria &lt; 0.3 g/day, normal serum albumin and stable renal function)&#xD;
                  or partial remission (24-hour proteinuria &lt; 3.5 g/day with &gt; 50% decrease from&#xD;
                  baseline, normal serum albumin and stable renal function) for at least 12 months&#xD;
                  after rituximab administration; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. RITUXIMAB-DEPENDENCE:frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome (≥ 2 relapses) with&#xD;
                  nephrotic-range proteinuria for ≥ 50% of time in the 24 months preceding&#xD;
                  enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Estimated GFR/eGFR) ≥40 mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated using the CKD-EPI equation) or&#xD;
             qualified endogenous creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min based on 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
             during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and provide a valid written consent to the study according to&#xD;
             the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Compliance with an effective contraception without interruption, from 28 days before&#xD;
             treatment start up to 18 months after treatment discontinuation, agreeing not to&#xD;
             donate semen during treatment and for 18 months after discontinuation (if the patient&#xD;
             is male), or to undergo pregnancy test during the course of the study (if the patient&#xD;
             is female).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Secondary forms of membranous nephropathy (associated with systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus, active hepatitis B, malignancy, drugs such as gold salts and&#xD;
             penicillamine, and others).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Rituximab treatment or any other prolonged (i.e. for more than two weeks)&#xD;
             immunosuppressive treatment in the 12 months preceding anti-CD20 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥160 and/or diastolic BP &gt;90 mmHg despite&#xD;
             therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active bacterial, viral and/or fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Seropositivity for HIV, regardless of viral load.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the medicaments under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any other serious medical condition, uncontrolled intercurrent illness or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that, according to the investigator's judgement, would constitute an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk of premature discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known history of drug induced liver injury, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic&#xD;
             steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, ongoing extra-hepatic obstruction caused&#xD;
