      Background: The demand for beauty is increasing in society as everyone is looking for&#xD;
      cosmetic improvement, including gummy smile correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Object: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of a clinical tooth crowns&#xD;
      lengthening surgery following by a BTX-A injection in gummy smile treatment upon based on&#xD;
      clinical assessment and photography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: An uncontrolled longitudinal study was implemented at the Faculty of&#xD;
      Odonto-Stomatology (FOS) of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City&#xD;
      (UMPH), Viet Nam, from August 2020 to May 2021. Twenty patients (19 females and one male) at&#xD;
      a mean age of 24 years old who came for gummy smile chief complaint were included in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects were operated to lengthen the clinical crown following an additional&#xD;
      botulinum toxin A injection two months post-surgery. All the participants answered the smile&#xD;
      esthetic satisfactory questions and were photographed at the time before treatment (T0), two&#xD;
      months after clinical crown lengthening surgery (T1), two weeks (T2), and two months (T3)&#xD;
      follow-up visits after BTX-A injection. The gingival exposure (GE) and clinical crown length&#xD;
      (CCL) were measured at each time point for analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical dental crown lengthening surgery protocol: a clinical crown lengthening surgery was performed.&#xD;
Post-operation protocol Patients were all prescribed antibiotics , anti-inflammation, analgesic, and an antiseptic mouthwash. Patients were instructed for oral hygiene and recalls.&#xD;
Botulinum Toxin A injection One hundred units (U) of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) were diluted with 2.5ml of sterile saline solution without shaking. 1 mm syringe with a 30-gauge needle was used to get 0.25ml BTX-A for four-point injection, or 0.6ml in case injection of 6 points. Cold compress was applied extraoral 5 mins at injection site before injection.&#xD;
After local anesthesia, the doctor administered slowly 2,5 U of diluted BTX-A at each point until white cellulite appeared.&#xD;
Patients were recalled two weeks (T2), and two months (T3) after injection.</description>
