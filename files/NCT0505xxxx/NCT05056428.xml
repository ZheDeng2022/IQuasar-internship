  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teachers in Hong Kong are susceptible to professional stress and its associated psychosomatic&#xD;
      illnesses. To enhance teachers' well-being, mindfulness training is conducted in local&#xD;
      schools. The present study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate 1) the effects of&#xD;
      mindfulness training on teachers' well-being (i.e. general health, positive affect, stress,&#xD;
      negative affect); 2) whether decentering strategy (vs. cognitive reappraisal strategy) is&#xD;
      nurtured by mindfulness practice; and 3) whether decentering instead of cognitive reappraisal&#xD;
      is the mediator that explains the impact of mindfulness on well-being. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either intervention (8-week .b Foundations course) or waiting-list control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the participants will complete an online survey before (baseline), after&#xD;
      (post-intervention), and two-months (follow-up) after the intervention. A subset of&#xD;
      participants (N = 30) will complete an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the experiment, participants will complete an online questionnaire writing down&#xD;
      eight recent autobiographical situations: four reflecting a neutral experience, two&#xD;
      reflecting events that triggered anxiety, and two reflecting events that triggered sadness.&#xD;
      After writing about each situation, participants will be asked to identify five keywords that&#xD;
      are both unique and tightly linked to each situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the experiment, participants will be reminded of the autobiographical situations in&#xD;
      the computerized task. Participants will be asked to view the keywords (i.e. control&#xD;
      condition); step back and view the keywords like an impartial observer, allowing whatever&#xD;
      thoughts or emotions arise to come and go (i.e. decentering condition); and think about the&#xD;
      keywords from different perspective to minimize negative emotions (i.e. reappraisal&#xD;
      condition). EEG will be recorded while participants complete the task. Participants will&#xD;
      receive $200 Hong Kong dollars each time as a remuneration for the time to participate in the&#xD;
      experiment.&#xD;
