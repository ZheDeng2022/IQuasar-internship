  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate bowel cleansing is a critical component in the care of hospitalized patients&#xD;
      undergoing colonoscopy. However, inpatient status is a well-established risk factor for&#xD;
      inadequate bowel preparation. However, few strategies have been rigorously shown to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of inadequate bowel preparation. Moreover, inadequate bowel preparation is&#xD;
      frequently related to the poor tolerability of high volumes of bowel preparation in the&#xD;
      medically complex and comorbid hospitalized population. Low volume bowel preparations have&#xD;
      been developed that have been shown to be noninferior compared to high volume bowel&#xD;
      preparation with regards to adequacy of bowel preparation but with improved tolerability.&#xD;
      However, the use of low volume bowel preparations for colonoscopies have largely been&#xD;
      evaluated in the outpatient setting. In this study, we plan to compare rates of adequate&#xD;
      bowel preparation and tolerability of a low volume bowel preparation, MoviPrep, compared to&#xD;
      standard high volume bowel preparation, GoLYTELY, in hospitalized patients undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy. This study promises to highlight low volume bowel preparation as a viable and&#xD;
      better tolerated alternative to high volume bowel preparation in hospitalized patients which&#xD;
      may ultimately decrease delays in inpatient endoscopy as well as hospital length of stay.&#xD;

    <measure>Boston Bowel Preparation Score (BBPS) During Colonoscopy Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of procedure, approximately 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The BBPS is a validated scoring tool that assesses the three segments of the colon (left, transverse, right) and rates them from 1-3 based on the ability to visualize the mucosa. An adequate bowel preparation is defined as a BBPS of 6 or higher with no individual segment scoring less than a 2.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately prior to procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayo Clinic Bowel Preparation Questionnaire is a survey consisting of 9 questions that relate to symptoms and tolerability of bowel preparation before colonoscopy. The answers to each question will be aggregated for each arm and compared.</description>

    <measure>BBPS Score During Colonoscopy Withdrawal For Each Segment</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of procedure, approximately 45 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>BBPS assesses three segments of the colon (left, transverse, right) and rates each segment either a 1, 2, or 3 based on the ability to visualize the mucosa. Higher scores correspond to improved mucosal visibility.</description>
