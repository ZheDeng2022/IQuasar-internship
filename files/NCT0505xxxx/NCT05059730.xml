  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BHSAI is developing a computational system that provides early alerts of a rise and fall in&#xD;
      core body temperature to help reduce the risk of thermal injury in the field and during&#xD;
      training. The goal of the body temperature alerting system is to use it during rest, exercise&#xD;
      in the heat and cold. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate a&#xD;
      body temperature alerting system using physiological responses that occur during rest,&#xD;
      exercise in the heat and cold. Multiple cold ambient temperatures will be validated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will perform 5 study visits: 1) baseline testing and four trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant numbers will be randomly assigned. Four trials for men (extreme cold, EC;&#xD;
      Moderate Cold, MoC; mild cold, MiC; extreme heat, EH) and four trials for women&#xD;
      (EC-follicular phase, EC-F; EC- luteal phase, EC-L; EH-F; EH-F) will be ordered with a random&#xD;
      number generator and assigned to a participant number. These orders will be counterbalanced&#xD;
      between participants to ensure that there is not an order effect. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned after medical clearance is granted. Visit specific information is described below,&#xD;
      however, specific data collection protocols for dependent variables and procedures are&#xD;
      included below the description of the study design. Participants will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      photo/video release form (Appendix H) to be used in research projects, scientific&#xD;
      publications/conferences and for educational purposes. Participants may be videoed or&#xD;
      photographed while exercising or resting in the environmental chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Testing (visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max&#xD;
&#xD;
      testing day. Upon arrival to the lab, subjects will provide a urine sample in a clean urine&#xD;
      cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will also be&#xD;
      recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by&#xD;
      taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door,&#xD;
      and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted&#xD;
      to continue to&#xD;
&#xD;
      the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) ≤1.025 is met.&#xD;
      If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      drink 500mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. Participants will fill out a&#xD;
      Karolinska Sleep Diary (Appendix I) prior to collecting anthropometrics. Females will fill&#xD;
      out a menstrual history questionnaire (Appendix K). Height will be measured with a tape&#xD;
      measure. Percent body fat will be measured using Air displacement plethysmography (BodPod®;&#xD;
      Cosmed, Software Version 4.2+, Concord, CA, USA). This will take less than ~5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. This information will be used to describe the subject demographics. For&#xD;
      familiarization purposes, researchers will insert and immediately remove the esophageal&#xD;
      probe. Participants will also be asked to complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a&#xD;
      treadmill in a thermoneutral environment. This test will provide aerobic fitness levels of&#xD;
      the participants. After VO2max testing, researchers will assess the 6 locations where blood&#xD;
      flow analyses will occur during trial days (described in the dependent variable section).&#xD;
      This will familiarize the participant to the blood flow process and allow researchers to&#xD;
      optimally location each artery of interest prior to the testing days. Researchers may also&#xD;
      use a sharpie or tracing paper to mark anatomical landmarks to assist with artery&#xD;
      identification during trial days. This visit will take approximately 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy #1 Males and Females in Extreme Cold and Heat&#xD;
&#xD;
      This substudy will have two visits for males and four visits for females (figure below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform 30 mins of rest outside the climate chamber, one hour of rest&#xD;
      inside the climate chamber, and 2 hours of work to rest cycles in the climate chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do&#xD;
      not meet hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a current illness or&#xD;
      taking medications to determine whether they can complete the trial. The participant's visit&#xD;
      will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or taking medications that&#xD;
      influence body temperature. Both trials will be on separate days at least 3 days apart. Women&#xD;
      will determine their phase of their menstrual cycle based on self-reporting and a menstrual&#xD;
      history questionnaire filled out during the baseline visit (Appendix K). The EC and EH trials&#xD;
      in the follicular phase will be collected 14 days following the start of menses and the&#xD;
      luteal phase will occur between 14 and ~30 days of cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the lab, subjects will provide a urine sample in a clean urine cup. Urine&#xD;
      specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will be recorded. Privacy&#xD;
      will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by taking&#xD;
      measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door, and&#xD;
      the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted to&#xD;
      continue to the trial if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) ≤1.025 is&#xD;
      met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked&#xD;
      to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status.Participants will be given&#xD;
      instructions at the prior visit about how to obtain desired hydration status for the upcoming&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the lab, participants will also be asked to indicate if they have consumed&#xD;
      alcohol or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked&#xD;
      to specify exactly what they have consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their&#xD;
      trial will be rescheduled for another day. Key study personnel will insert an esophageal&#xD;
      probe to measure esophageal temperature (procedure described below). No undergraduate student&#xD;
      who is listed as key personnel will insert an esophageal probe Participants will privately&#xD;
      insert a rectal thermometer 15 cm beyond the anal sphincter and wear a heart rate monitor&#xD;
      strap. Additionally, participants will wear 14-site skin temperature sensors (Biopac).&#xD;
      Researchers will apply the skin temperature sensors with medical tape to the participants'&#xD;
      finger tip and base of finger, hand dorsum, forearm, thigh, calf, feet dorsum, big toe, nose,&#xD;
      cheek, ear tip, chin, and forehead. Participants will also have 4 iButton skin temperature&#xD;
      sensors placed on four locations (shoulder, chest, calf, thigh) to assess mean skin&#xD;
      temperature. The participants will also be asked to complete a subjective sleep questionnaire&#xD;
      upon arriving to the lab. the participants will wear a Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch on their&#xD;
      non-dominant arm and a Polar chest strap. These devices would be paired with a Samsung Galaxy&#xD;
      Note 4 smartphone that runs the 2B-Cool algorithm for core temperature estimation using data&#xD;
      from the smartwatch. These devices would be provided by the BHSAI to the University of&#xD;
      Connecticut.n addition to the BHSAI-provided devices, participants will wear an apple watch&#xD;
      and garmin watch on the opposite hand. Both of these devices will be validated against the&#xD;
      gold standard assessments (Table 2). Each dependent variable coming from the Apple and Garmin&#xD;
      devices from the manufacturer's own applications. All measurements will be taken starting&#xD;
      from the thermoneutral exposure (pre-exposure) period to include baseline recordings. Blood&#xD;
      flow of the brachial artery, radial and ulnar artery, superficial femoral artery, anterior&#xD;
      tibial artery, and posterior tibial artery will be collected with a Triplex ultrasound during&#xD;
      rest (before exercise and during rest breaks). The same sequence for the measuring sites&#xD;
      across subjects, e.g., 1) radial, 2) ulnar, 3) brachial, 4) femoral, 5) anterior tibial, and&#xD;
      6) posterior tibial, will be used. A pulse oximeter will also be clipped to the participant's&#xD;
      finger and measured every 10 mins throughout each rest period. Blood lactate will be assessed&#xD;
      from a finger stick blood sample (0.7μ1) during exercise trials and post-exercise. VO2 data&#xD;
      will also be assessed to collect metabolic heat production. After thermoneutral exposure of&#xD;
      30 minutes, participants will rest in a lounge chair for an hour and then perform 2 hours of&#xD;
      moderate exercise with rest breaks. All dependent variables listed above will be collected&#xD;
      through the exercise period at various time points. Participants will drink ad libitum&#xD;
      throughout the exercise trial. Participants will be asked to keep a dietary record (using My&#xD;
      Fitness Pal) to track their food and fluid intake during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme Cold Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the EC trial, participants will wear a t-shirt, shorts, a microfleece cap and&#xD;
      lightweight balaclava. Participants will also wear ankle length socks (no shoes during rest).&#xD;
      Participants will rest upright on a chair with feet above the ground and hands on the arms of&#xD;
      the chair (exposed to air). The participant will remain seated for up to 1 hour. For&#xD;
      additional safety of the participants, the experiment will be terminated if the core body&#xD;
      temperature falls below 35°C. Participants will wear t-shirt, shorts, microfleece cap, and&#xD;
      shoes for the exercise component of the protocol. The trial will be conducted outside the&#xD;
      chamber (~20C) and in a climatic chamber with ambient temperature below &lt;8°C and relative&#xD;
      humidity at approximately 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme Heat Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the EH trial, participants will wear a t-shirt and shorts, a microfleece cap and&#xD;
      lightweight balaclava during rest. Participants will also wear ankle length socks (no shoes&#xD;
      during rest). Participants will remove the cap and balaclava prior to exercise. During rest,&#xD;
      participants will rest upright on a chair with feet above the ground and hands on the arms of&#xD;
      the chair (exposed to air). The participant will remain seated for up to 1 hour. For&#xD;
      additional safety of the participants, the experiment will be terminated if the core body&#xD;
      temperature exceeds 40C. Participants will wear t-shirt, shorts, microfleece cap, and shoes&#xD;
      for the exercise component of the protocol. The trial will be conducted outside the chamber&#xD;
      (~20C) and in a climatic chamber with ambient temperature between 30-42C and relative&#xD;
      humidity at approximately 30-60%. Participants will also complete an environmental symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaire (ESQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy #2 Males Moderate and Mild Cold Stress at Rest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform 30 mins of rest outside the climate chamber and two hours of rest&#xD;
      inside the climate chamber in moderate vs. mild cold (Figure 3). The data collection&#xD;
      procedures are summarized below and in Figure 3. The subjects will be male only and will the&#xD;
      same male subjects participating in substudy #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Day Procedures (moderate and mild cold).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to make-up trial visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do&#xD;
      not meet hydration requirements. Participants will be asked if they have a current illness or&#xD;
      taking medications to determine whether they can complete the trial. The participant's visit&#xD;
      will be rescheduled if they have a fever, current illness or taking medications that&#xD;
      influence body temperature. Both trials will be on separate days at least 3 days apart. Upon&#xD;
      arrival to the lab, subjects will provide a urine sample in a clean urine cup. Urine specific&#xD;
      gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will be recorded. Privacy will be&#xD;
      afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by taking measurements with&#xD;
      the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door, and the research reading&#xD;
      the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted to continue to the trial&#xD;
      if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) ≤1.025 is met. If the&#xD;
      participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink&#xD;
      500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the lab, participants will also be asked to indicate if they have consumed&#xD;
      alcohol or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked&#xD;
