    <description>LATCH is a breastfeeding charting system that provides a systematic method for gathering information about individual breastfeeding sessions. The system assigns a numerical score, 0, 1, or 2, to five key components of breastfeeding. Each letter of the acronym LATCH denotes an area of assessment. &quot;L&quot; is for how well the infant latches onto the breast. &quot;A&quot; is for the amount of audible swallowing noted. &quot;T&quot; is for the mother's nipple type. &quot;C&quot; is for the mother's level of comfort. &quot;H&quot; is for the amount of help the mother needs to hold her infant to the breast. The minimum point is 0 and maximum point is 10. The highest 10 points to be obtained from the scale are taken, and a high score indicates good breastfeeding success.</description>

    <measure>Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale short form</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is a 14-item self-administered instrument derived from the original 33-items, that measures breastfeeding confidence. All items are preceded on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5. Total scores range from 14 to 70, with higher scores reflecting more significant levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant Nutrition Attitude Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is composed of 17 items with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. The total IIFAS score can range from 17 to 85 with higher scores reflecting positive attitude towards breastfeeding. Total IIFAS scores can be further categorized into groups: 1) positive to breastfeeding (IIFAS score 70-85), 2) neutral (IIFAS score 49-69), and 3) positive to formula feeding (IIFAS score 17-48).</description>

    <description>Oxytocin massage: It is a massage that will accelerate the work of the parasympathetic nerves in order to transmit the oxytocin production stimulus to the posterior lobe of the brain. Massage the scapula from the cervical 7th to the 5th-6th spine, spinal (vertebral), 1-2 cm around the spine, both thumbs up and then 2-3 times down, in a small circular clockwise, downward and upward movements. It is a form of massage by pressing hard.&#xD;
Music intervention: In order to decide on the type of music to be played to the mothers during breastfeeding, three samples (Pentatonic, Büzürk makam and classical music) selected by the researcher will be asked to the postpartum mother, and the music preferred by the mothers will be determined. It will be ensured that mothers listen to the music determined 5 minutes before the breastfeeding session for 7 days and continue breastfeeding while the same music is playing.</description>
