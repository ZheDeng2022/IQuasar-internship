    <textblock>
      The purpose of ORACLE is to demonstrate the ability of a novel ctDNA assay developed by&#xD;
      Guardant Health to detect recurrence in individuals treated for early-stage solid tumors. It&#xD;
      is necessary that ctDNA test results are linked to clinical outcomes in order to demonstrate&#xD;
      clinical validity for recurrence detection and explore its value in a healthcare environment&#xD;
      subject to cost containment.&#xD;
