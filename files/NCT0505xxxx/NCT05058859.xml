  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystinuria is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of the kidney that is the result of&#xD;
      an inability to reabsorb dibasic amino acids, including cystine, from the urine.&#xD;
      Supersaturation of cystine in the urine produces crystals that precipitate and form stones in&#xD;
      the kidney, which can be a cause of obstruction, infection, and chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      Cystine stones constitute a major health challenge for affected individuals with cystinuria&#xD;
      because of the frequent recurrence of painful symptoms and the current absence of effective,&#xD;
      patient-accepting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mainstay of therapy is breaking or preventing the cystine bond on the molecular level such&#xD;
      that cystine (which is formed from the joining of two cysteine amino acids and their&#xD;
      corresponding sulfur atoms) cannot precipitate in the urine. It is hypothesized that a&#xD;
      glucose molecule may be able to do this if introduced into the urine. SGLT-2 inhibitors are a&#xD;
      class of drug that are FDA approved to treat diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure by&#xD;
      inhibiting an enzyme in the kidney that allows for reabsorption of glucose from the urine.&#xD;
      This effectively increases the concentration of glucose in the urine. The hypothesis suggests&#xD;
      that administration of this drug to patients with cystinuria will introduce sufficient&#xD;
      glucose into the urine to prevent or reverse the formation of cystine stones. To date, there&#xD;
      has been no published data on the effectiveness of this therapy for this indication, although&#xD;
      the dosage and administration would be identical to that already approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of DM and heart failure.&#xD;

      This is a single center, prospective cohort trial designed to assess the effect of daily oral&#xD;
      administration of dapagliflozin 10 mg on cystine stone formation across routine imaging&#xD;
      obtained during management of this disease. 25 subjects are planned, each with previously&#xD;
      diagnosed cystinuria and without current treatment except with potassium citrate medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient identified in the clinic as a potential participant will be screened to&#xD;
      determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Consent will be obtained. The therapy&#xD;
      under investigation, dapagliflozin 10 mg, will then be administered orally to each&#xD;
      participant daily for one year. Each subject will be contacted 1 week by the study team after&#xD;
      treatment begins to check compliance, tolerability, and side effects with SGLT-2 inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy. Each subject will then be contacted every 8 weeks by the study team for follow-up&#xD;
      and to continue checks on compliance, tolerability, and side effects with SGLT-2 inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy. Each subject will subsequently undergo routine care with no further alterations or&#xD;
      interruptions to their typical care with routine follow up appointments with a study doctor&#xD;
      every 3-4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine standard-of-care surveillance imaging for their cystinuria and formation of cystine&#xD;
      stones will also occur as part of the treatment and management of each participant's kidney&#xD;
      stone disease. This routine care will continue to be performed during the study period, the&#xD;
      only difference being the collection of data with regard to ongoing stone burden for the&#xD;
      cystinuria patients receiving treatment with daily oral dapagliflozin 10 mg on each routine&#xD;
      imaging scan. Tolerability of the study therapy will be assessed at each routine visit during&#xD;
      the participant's usual care. Participants who require operative intervention for their&#xD;
      kidney stones during the treatment period will be removed from the study. No placebo will be&#xD;
      used during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of subject participation with be up to 1 year and 3 months. Total duration of&#xD;
      the study is expected to be up to 1 year and 3 months.&#xD;
