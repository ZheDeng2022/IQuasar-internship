  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in patients with erosive esophagitis due to gastro-esophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease (GERD) Los Angeles (LA) grades C or D, and in patients with at least partial&#xD;
      symptom response but still endoscopically unhealed (LA grades A or B) after 8 weeks history&#xD;
      of standard treatment healing course with PPI, designed to support dose selection for Phase 3&#xD;
      and to investigate safety, tolerability, and healing rates after 4 weeks treatment of X842 or&#xD;
      Lansoprazole, and symptom pattern during subsequent 4 weeks treatment with Lansoprazole.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study with a parallel-group&#xD;
      design including four arms with X842 and one arm with Lansoprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to one of the treatments with X842 twice daily (BID) 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100&#xD;
      mg, or Lansoprazole 30 mg once daily (QD) will be based on a 1:1:1:1:1 scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each patient's participation in the study, including screening, blind&#xD;
      treatment period, and open-label treatment period will be approximately 60 days. The patients&#xD;
      will be randomized for 4 weeks of double-blind treatment and will be provided with&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product for 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have an endoscopic evaluation after 4 weeks of treatment. Following the&#xD;
      endoscopic evaluation, all patients will receive subsequent 4 weeks of open-label treatment&#xD;
      with Lansoprazole. Repeated symptom evaluation to detect symptom patterns will be assessed&#xD;
      during this period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the healing rate of erosive esophagitis due to GERD based on endoscopic assessment. Dose selection for X842 (to identify the dose providing the target effect of 85% healing rate) will be supported through assessment of healing of erosive esophagitis after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of patients with adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Day -7 to Day 0) until Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>To assess safety and tolerability of the four dose levels of X842 and Lansoprazole, where Lansoprazole will serve as the active comparator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of heartburn-free 24-hour days</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the percentage to heartburn-free 24-hour days based on eDiary (Reflux Symptom Questionnaire electronic Diary: RESQ-eDiary). The reflux related symptom pattern will be evaluated during the initial 4 weeks treatment with four dose levels of X842 and with Lansoprazole, and the symptom pattern during the subsequent additional 4 weeks (Weeks 5-8) open-label treatment with Lansoprazole. Modified RESQ-eDiary is a validated self-reported questionnaire electronic symptom diary. mRESQ-eD has 3 domains [i.e. Heartburn (min-max: 0-10), Other GERD signs/symptoms (min-max: 0-15) and Regurgitations/Reflux (min-max: 0-8)]. It is used to assess the severity and frequency of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms. For severity a 6-point and for frequency a 5-point Likert response format is used. RESQ-eD contains 8 items where 5 assess severity (0=Did not have - 5=Severe) and 3 assess frequency (0=Never - 4=Very often) of symptoms (min-max: 0-33). Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator assessment of symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1-8</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator will assess the severity of patients' heartburn, regurgitation and dysphagia in the 7 days prior to the visit. The assessment will include both the severity grade (for severity, items are coded: none, mild, moderate, severe where none represents no complaints, severe represents incapacitating symptoms) and the frequency (for frequency, a 7-graded Likert scale is used, ranges from none of the time to all of the time) of symptoms. Symptoms are scored as follows: none (no complaints), mild (aware of symptom, but easily tolerated), moderate (discomforting symptom, sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activities and/or sleep), severe (incapacitating symptom, with inability to perform normal daily activities and/or sleep).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia (QOLRAD) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The reflux related symptom pattern will be evaluated during the initial 4 weeks treatment with four dose levels of X842 and with Lansoprazole, and the symptom pattern during the subsequent additional 4 weeks (Weeks 5-8) open-label treatment with Lansoprazole 30 mg QD. The heartburn version of the QOLRAD is a disease specific instrument and contains 25 questions addressing concerns associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The questions are rated on a seven-grade (1-7) Likert scale, score of 1 represents low quality of life and as higher the score the better is the patient. If 50% or more of the questions in one dimension are completed, the mean value of the completed items should replace the missing responses. The questions are categorized into 5 domains: emotional distress, sleep disturbance, vitality, food/drink problems and physical/social functioning. The score ranges from 1 to 175, higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
