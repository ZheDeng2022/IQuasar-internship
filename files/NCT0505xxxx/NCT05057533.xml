  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The association between primary headaches and functional gastrointestinal disorders has been&#xD;
      confirmed by many clinical observations. In most patients during the attacks of headache,&#xD;
      apart from various neurological and vascular symptoms, gastrointestinal disturbances occur .&#xD;
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are reported&#xD;
      in primary headache patients in periods between the attacks as well. On the other hand 23-53%&#xD;
      of IBS patients have frequent headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine typically presents relapsing episodes of symptoms including headache, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, sensory hypersensitivity and mood changes that last for hours to days . Similar to&#xD;
      migraine, IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort with altered&#xD;
      gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity that returns to normal between&#xD;
      attacks . Both pain disorders lack detectable organic causes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An emerging model of the brain-gut axis was proposed to explain migraine and IBS as a result&#xD;
      of a genetically sensitive nervous system that develops hyperexcitability over time as a&#xD;
      response to multiple environmental and immunological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster headache (CH) characterized by its distinctive circadian and circannual periodicity,&#xD;
      implicating the role of the hypothalamus in its underlying pathophysiology. CH and IBS are&#xD;
      featuring recurrent attacks of pain that possess relationships with circadian rhythms and&#xD;
      potentially hypothalamic derangements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tension headache that's associated with pain in head described as feeling like a tight band&#xD;
      around head, also show many similarities with IBS such causes for both are unknown, and some&#xD;
      studies suggest a possible link that could shed light on shared genetics of both condition .&#xD;

    <description>The Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of IBS require that patients have had recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per week during the previous 3 months that is associated with two or more of the following&#xD;
Related to defecation (may be increased or unchanged by defecation)&#xD;
Associated with a change in stool frequency&#xD;
Associated with a change in stool form or appearance The Rome IV criteria (May 2016) only require abdominal pain in defining this condition; &quot;discomfort&quot; is no longer a requirement owing to its nonspecificity, and the recurrent abdominal pain. [2] Supporting symptoms include the following:Altered stool frequency Altered stool form Altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency) Mucorrhea Abdominal bloating or subjective distention.</description>
