    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-report scale developed to determine the risk levels of patients in terms of anxiety and depression. HADS consists of two subscales, one measuring anxiety, with seven items, and another measuring depression, with seven items, which score separately. Those with a score of 10 and above for the anxiety subscale and those with a score of 7 and above for the depression subscale are defined as high-risk patients.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life assessment was performed using the 36-Item Short Form. The 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) is an often used, well-researched, self-reported measure of health. It comprises 36 questions that cover eight domains of health. These; physical function (10 items), social function (2 items), role difficulty due to physical problems (4 items) and emotional problems (3 items), mental health (5 items), vitality (4 items), bodily pain (2 item), general health (5 items) [26]. The scores of the items for each dimension were coded and converted into a scale that is scored from 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best health status) by proportional calculation.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 Seconds Sit to Stand Test is a method used to measure the lower extremity DB and muscle strength. The test was administered using a folding chair without arms, with a seat height of 43 cm. The participant was seated in the middle of the chair, back straight; feet approximately a shoulder-width apart and placed on the floor, arms are crossed in front. Then the participant was encouraged to complete as many full stands as possible within 30 seconds. Less than 10 sit-ups in 30 seconds indicate lower extremity weakness and poor DB.</description>
