    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that NMDA hypotheses have been implicated in schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able to benefit the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Whether an NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) can benefit the treatment of prodromal&#xD;
      schizophrenia deserves study. Therefore, this study aims to compare NMDAE and placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of prodromal schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects with prodromal schizophrenia at first receive 6 weeks of health-promotion&#xD;
      intervention (including exercise and education). A total of 48 subjects who do not respond&#xD;
      sufficiently to the health-promotion program are then recruited to this 12-week, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which aims to compare treatment response of NMDAE vs.&#xD;
      placebo in 1:1 ratio. Clinical performances and side effects are measured at weeks -6 (before&#xD;
      the screening phase), 0 (baseline of the drug trial), 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Cognitive functions&#xD;
      are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacies of NMDAE and placebo will be compared. Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test)&#xD;
      will be used to compare differences of categorical variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      if the distribution is not normal) for continuous variables between treatment groups. Mean&#xD;
      changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized&#xD;
      estimating equation (GEE). All p values for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed&#xD;
      tests with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

As shown in &quot;Detailed Description&quot;, &quot;mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE).

    <description>The measure is the composite from multiple measures. All tests have no unit. For the domain (a. and c.) with more than one test, a composite T score will be calculated by standardizing the average of each T score. Furthermore, a global composite score (for all seven domains) and a neurocognitive composite score (for the first 6 domains, a-f) will be also calculated by standardizing the average of the T score of each domain (Lane HY et al, JAMA Psychiatry. 2013).&#xD;
Ten tests for assessment of 7 cognitive domains:&#xD;
speed of processing (assessed by Category Fluency, Trail Marking A, WAIS-III Digit Symbol-Coding);&#xD;
sustained attention (Continuous Performance Test);&#xD;
working memory: verbal (digit span) and nonverbal (spatial span);&#xD;
verbal learning and memory (WMS-III, word listing);&#xD;
visual learning and memory (WMS-III, visual reproduction);&#xD;
reasoning and problem solving (WISC-III, Maze);&#xD;
social cognition (MSCEIT Version 2)</description>
