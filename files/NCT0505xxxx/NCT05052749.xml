  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is defined as a permanent cessation of menstrual cycle for 12 months due to&#xD;
      intrinsic diminution of ovarian oocytes among women in older age. Globally reported mean age&#xD;
      for menopause is 48.78 years (ranges from 46-52 years). Menopausal age reported among Asian&#xD;
      and African population was lower as compared to European women . Among postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      age related various central nervous system, musculoskeletal, urogenital, metabolic and skin&#xD;
      changes ensue along with osteoporosis (T-score = ≤ -2.5) and decreased bone mineral density&#xD;
      due to estrogen deficiency that is directly associated with fragility fractures and&#xD;
      disability among this age group. Therefore, recruitment of older adults in resistance&#xD;
      training program is crucial in inducing increases in muscle strength and ameliorating glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity along with improvements in BMD and BMR.&#xD;

      Physical activity is extremely crucial in maintaining quality of life and estrogen metabolism&#xD;
      among postmenopausal women, owing to the increased risk of falls, age related decline in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal endurance and cognitive capacity. In Pakistan, fitness of&#xD;
      women specifically of postmenopausal age group is ignored due to some cultural norms.&#xD;
      Performance of physical activity in the form of resistance training (RT) is one of the best&#xD;
      known methods to improve physical fitness in the elderly. So the current study is planned&#xD;
      with objectives to determine effects of High Intensity Resistance Training in Postmenopausal&#xD;
      Women. Supervised exercise training will be provided for 3 months and functional performance&#xD;
      will be measured accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial screening of postmenopausal women including history and anthropometric details,&#xD;
      females meeting inclusion criteria and willing to participate in high intensity resistance&#xD;
      exercise trial will be recruited in the study. After that; physical fitness, performance base&#xD;
      testing for functional performance outcome measures and MENQOL assessment will be done at&#xD;
      baseline and after 3 months. Patients will perform resistance training twice a week, 40-50&#xD;
      min/session for 12 weeks respectively. It is hypothesized that supervised high intensity&#xD;
      resistance training will improve functional performance, physical fitness and Quality of life&#xD;
      among postmenopausal women.&#xD;
