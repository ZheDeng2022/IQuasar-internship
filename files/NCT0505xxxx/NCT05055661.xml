    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pragmatic randomized clinical study, consisting of two groups,&#xD;
      the control group with conventional service and the intervention group with teleconsultation.&#xD;
      The research team comprises pharmacists, students, and professors who work in a&#xD;
      pharmaceutical service of secondary health care linked to the public university. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct the study exclusively remotely, following the patients for six&#xD;
      months. The research team will implement and structure an ambiance to adapt the face-to-face&#xD;
      pharmaceutical consultation into the pharmaceutical teleconsultation. The evaluated outcomes,&#xD;
      in both groups, will be the scores of the Asthma Control Test, the Asthma Quality of Life,&#xD;
      and the hospitalization rate and admission to urgency/emergency services.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a pragmatic, randomized, single-blind clinical trial based on a population of users&#xD;
      diagnosed with asthma, registered in the Pharmaceutical Assistance Network in Porto Alegre&#xD;
      (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). The study will be conducting exclusively by remote means, in the&#xD;
      premises of the Collaborating Center for Pharmaceutical Services (CECOL-FAR), belonging to&#xD;
      the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). Characterized&#xD;
      as a pharmaceutical service of secondary care, the CECOL-FAR/UFRGS, in the pre-pandemic&#xD;
      COVID-19, used to provide assistance in face-to-face pharmaceutical consultations to patients&#xD;
      who did not adhere to the asthma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team of the study, composed of pharmacists from CECOL-FAR/UFRGS, students and&#xD;
      professors of the Postgraduate degree in Pharmaceutical Services (PPGASFAR) at UFRGS, will&#xD;
      restructure and adapt the face-to-face pharmaceutical consultation for teleconsultation, with&#xD;
      the creation of work processes, elaboration of research flows and standard operating&#xD;
      procedures (SOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study, carried out through simulated situations, will evaluate these new practices&#xD;
      regarding the processes' suitability, feasibility, and scope. After the pilot project&#xD;
      adaptation, the documents will be applied to the study in the implementation of&#xD;
      pharmaceutical teleconsultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of participants for randomization foresees two steps: Recruitment 1 (R1) with&#xD;
      the identification of the target population (screening), and Recruitment 2 (R2), with the&#xD;
      identification of the population that meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In R1, the Pharmaceutical Assistance Network of the city will provide the list of patients,&#xD;
      identified by the drug dispensing system of the Municipal Health Department, without&#xD;
      withdrawal movements of the drug Beclomethasone 250mcg and Beclomethasone 50mcg inhaled&#xD;
      solution in the Basic Health Units from the city, for a period longer than 60 days,&#xD;
      characterizing treatment dropout. From this list, the research team will carry out screening,&#xD;
      by simple random sampling, for patients over 18 years of age and a diagnosis of asthma&#xD;
      confirmed in medical record data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will contact the participants via telephone. Once located, the research&#xD;
      team will approach the patient for analysis of primary non-adherence and guide the patient to&#xD;
      resolve the situation of primary non-adherence. The patient advances to R2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In R2, patients oriented to resolve primary non-adherence will receive new telephone contact&#xD;
      from the research team 10 days after the first approach. In case of an unresolved situation,&#xD;
      there will be another contact after 10 days. The patient who remains in primary non-adherence&#xD;
      after the new telephone contact will result in deletion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the primary situation of non-adherence resolved can participate in the study.&#xD;
      The submission of the free and informed consent form, answered by audio message or signature,&#xD;
      will confirm the participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After R1 and R2, patients will be randomized, using specific software, to one of two groups:&#xD;
      the control group or the intervention group. The research team will accompany the&#xD;
      participants of both groups for six months by remote, telephone contact, and video call. The&#xD;
      pharmaceutical teleconsultation will be carried out monthly with the patient allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention group. Patients randomized to the control group will receive conventional&#xD;
      service at the reference US and be contacted throughout the six months to collect the study&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected from both groups in the same period, by telephone, video call, or&#xD;
      online form by a blind member of the research team, and at a different time from the&#xD;
      teleconsultation, in the case of patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population considers all patients diagnosed with asthma followed at the municipal primary&#xD;
      health care network. Thus, the patient sample size needed to obtain 1-α = 0.95 confidence and&#xD;
      e = 7% maximum error was estimated at a minimum of 196 patients (98 patients in each group),&#xD;
      estimating 80% power to detect a difference of 0.1 between the proportion of the null&#xD;
      hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. With expected losses of 25%, the sample was&#xD;
      increased to 123 individuals in each group, totaling 246 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chi-square test for categorical variables and the t-student test for continuous&#xD;
      characteristics will be applied to compare the baseline characteristics between the control&#xD;
      and intervention groups. The variables compared will be related to the clinical and&#xD;
      humanistic outcomes observed, based on the ACT (Asthma Control Test) score, indicating the&#xD;
      effective control of asthma. The hypothesis tests will identify significant differences&#xD;
      between individuals for the analysis of results, adopting a significance level of 0.05. Data&#xD;
      analysis will follow an intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
