  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: ICU hospitalization is associated with loss of strength, functionality and&#xD;
      delirium. The &quot;Start to Move protocol&quot; demonstrated efficacy in improving and minimizing such&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of the &quot;Start to move protocol&quot; compared with conventional&#xD;
      treatment in ICU subjects on functionality, weakness acquired in the Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (ICU-AW), incidence of delirium, days of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), ICU stay and&#xD;
      28-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Including adults ≥15 years with IMV &gt;48 hours,&#xD;
      randomized into Start to move and conventional treatment groups.Functionality, ICU-AW&#xD;
      incidence, delirium incidence, IMV days, ICU stay and mortality-28 days were analyzed.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals hospitalized in Intensive Care Units are subjected to a prolonged state of rest&#xD;
      and to various factors that directly or indirectly affect the muscular and organic structure,&#xD;
      which can result in ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) and a limitation in functional&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors can be divided into metabolic, pharmacological and organic, where sustained&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, corticosteroid use, sedation-analgesia, neuromuscular blockade and multiorgan&#xD;
      failure associated with sepsis or septic shock stand out. This state translates into a direct&#xD;
      loss of muscle mass, specifically of type II fibers, physiologically explained by an increase&#xD;
      in the myosin protein degradation process, a decrease in protein synthesis and an increase in&#xD;
      proinflammatory cells that favor the weakness of the critically ill patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brower et al. studied that the effects of prolonged rest produce a deconditioning and atrophy&#xD;
      of the musculature. After 14 days of immobilization, young people and adults are exposed to a&#xD;
      9% loss of quadriceps muscle mass, which translates into a loss of muscle strength of up to&#xD;
      27%.In subjects subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation, it has been shown that the&#xD;
      cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle can decrease up to 12.5% in the first week of&#xD;
      their stay in the ICU, which can increase up to 15.7% if they present multiorgan failure&#xD;
      versus a 3% loss in subjects with single organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU-AW and loss of function are also directly related to the prolonged use of sedoanalgesia,&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade and a higher incidence of delirium in the ICU. The presence of&#xD;
      delirium is related to low participation in physical therapies, either by decreased&#xD;
      cooperation and/or psychomotor agitation, thus directly influencing muscle status and&#xD;
      subsequent functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brummel et al. report that delirium is common in the ICU, affecting between 60-80% of&#xD;
      subjects undergoing IMV and between 20-50% of subjects on noninvasive mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of removal of invasive elements, accidental extubations and the need for&#xD;
      physical restraints that may delay the onset of functional recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the consequences of prolonged rest and quantify ICU-AW, the Medical Research&#xD;
      Council (MRC) assessment scale is used, a validated tool which analytically measures the&#xD;
      strength of six muscle groups bilaterally with a score of 30 points per hemibody, obtaining a&#xD;
      total of 60 points. A score of 48 points or less determines the presence of ICU-AW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the validated Functional Status Scale - Intensive Care Unit (FSS-ICU),&#xD;
      which measures functional milestones with a score between 0 and 35 points, is commonly used&#xD;
      to assess the functionality of the critically ill patient 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Start to move protocol compared&#xD;
      to conventional ICU treatment on functionality, ICU-Aw, incidence of delirium, days of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and 28-day mortality, Clínica Ensenada 2018 - 2019.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Methods: Randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial. Computational random assignment of the intervention using sealed envelopes (1:1), non-probabilistic, consecutive sampling of subjects admitted to Clínica Ensenada ICU between January 2018 - July 2019 and who met selection criteria.&#xD;
Participants: All subjects admitted to Clínica Ensenada ICU, adults ≥15 years with invasive mechanical ventilation requirement &gt;48 hours were recruited. Subjects with neuromuscular disease; psychiatric history (attempted autolysis, schizophrenia, senile dementia or others, who due to their condition are not able to follow a logical sequential order, which could bias the evaluation and functional treatment); limb amputation; pregnancy; cardiorespiratory arrest with severe hypoxic-ischemic brain damage; total dependence prior to hospitalization, according to Barthel index (&lt;20 points); and not consenting to participate in the study were excluded.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study was conducted in a single 12-bed ICU clinical center, during 2018-2019. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were asked for informed consent from the responsible guardian and were subsequently randomized (1:1) into Start to move group and conventional treatment group. Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes were used for allocation, which were accessed only by research personnel not participating in the clinical trial.</masking_description>
