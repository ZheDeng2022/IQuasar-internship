  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute soft tissues injuries are a common complaint for emergency department (ED) visit. RICE&#xD;
      and Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used to reduce pain&#xD;
      and inflammation. Herbal therapy is commonly used to treat pain but few studies assessed its&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability.&#xD;

      Materials and methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design It is a randomized, prospective, double blind, controlled, multicentric trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and selection of participants :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is conducted in three community teaching hospitals :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency department, fattouma bourgiba university hospital, monastir, tunisia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency department, sahloul university hospital, sousse, tunisia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency department, farhat hached university hospital, sousse, tunisia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes patients aged 18 to 60 years who presented to the ED with acute&#xD;
      soft-tissues limb trauma pain occurring within 24 hours before presentation, with a visual&#xD;
      numeric scale (VNS) of 5 or more on a standard 11 point (0-10) and who required a&#xD;
      prescription for home use analgesic treatment upon discharge. An informed consent is&#xD;
      necessary. Pain was considered traumatic if it is reported as appearing immediately after the&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol :&#xD;
&#xD;
      After medical evaluation, every patient who meet the inclusion criteria, will receive&#xD;
      randomly either Piroxicam gel or Soulagel tubes as detailed above according to the&#xD;
      predetermined randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the treating physician or nurses are aware about the medication received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesive and/or immobilizing casts, bandages, splints, and treatment by rest, ice,&#xD;
      compression, or elevation were prohibited after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients could not take additional medications such as oral NSAIDs, opioids, muscle&#xD;
      relaxants, or supplemental topical therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were phonelly contacted in order to ensure treatment adherence and evaluate VAS once&#xD;
      a day until the end of the treatment. After the end of the treatment, patients' satisfaction&#xD;
      with the treatment was noted and quoted as &quot;not satisfied&quot;, &quot;satisfied&quot;, and &quot;very&#xD;
      satisfied&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for rescue analgesic treatment was noted as well as the dose and duration. All patients&#xD;
      were encouraged to report all adverse events during the treatment period. S&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data recorded on data collection sheets, including sex, demographics, medical history,&#xD;
      and vital signs, were entered into SPSS (version 20.0 ; IBM corps) by the research manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients's informed consent is obtained. The ethic commitee of our institution approved the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

Study treatments were applied on the injured site3 times per day for 7 days. The gel must be gently rubbed on the skin over the injured site for 2 minutes.</intervention_model_description>
