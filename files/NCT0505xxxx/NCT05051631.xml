  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central goal of this study is to test strategies to implement evidence-based breast&#xD;
      cancer risk assessment in healthcare clinics in Tennessee. The BRAVE Strategy (Breast cancer&#xD;
      Risk Assessment - achieVing Equity) study aims to assess the feasibility, reach,&#xD;
      acceptability, and appropriateness of select customized strategies to increase uptake of&#xD;
      breast cancer risk assessment. The investigators will achieve these aims through a conducting&#xD;
      a stepped-wedge trial conducted in 10 healthcare clinics in the state of Tennessee. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is the proportion of women age 25-49 having risk assessment. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the numbers of 1) women identified as high-risk; 2) pursuing risk-adherent&#xD;
      screening; and 3) diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Women with a 20% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer using the Tyrer Cuzick risk assessment tool will be considered high risk. The Tyrer Cuzick risk assessment tool is an 11 question electronic risk assessment tool about a woman's family history of cancer and personal history to immediately calculate a lifetime risk percentage.</description>

    <description>Screening is defined as screening mammography or breast MRI. The number of women who received screening will be calculated from electronic health records.</description>
