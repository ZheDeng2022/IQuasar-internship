  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALAMO is a prospective, multi-center, perspective, registry of patients receiving LungCare™&#xD;
      (AlloSure®-Lung, AlloMap Lung, AlloID™, iBox, HistoMap, and AlloHeme) for surveillance&#xD;
      post-transplant. This study aims to investigate the clinical utility of AlloSure®-Lung for&#xD;
      surveillance of the spectrum of rejection and infection events in concert with standard of&#xD;
      practice (SOP) post-transplant medical care in a robust lung transplant population. The&#xD;
      AlloID™ metagenomics NGS plasma test will be collected and performed for research to validate&#xD;
      this molecular diagnostic tool versus SOP microbiologic techniques for detection of allograft&#xD;
      infection events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational registry of lung transplant recipients&#xD;
      receiving LungCare (AlloSure-Lung, AlloMap Lung, AlloID, iBox, and Histomap, and AlloHeme)&#xD;
      surveillance testing. Patients will be recruited based on utilization of surveillance testing&#xD;
      with LungCare, as deemed appropriate for their care post-transplant. Consecutive patients&#xD;
      deemed eligible for the study by their physician will be invited to participate during their&#xD;
      usual care visit. Enrolled patients will receive evaluations and treatment for their lung&#xD;
      transplant according to their health care provider and clinical practice at each study site.&#xD;
      Treatment and follow-up visits will be determined by the treating physician. Information&#xD;
      related to surveillance testing, selected clinical outcomes, and treatments received for&#xD;
      managing the lung transplant recipients will be collected from medical records. The product&#xD;
      Laboratory Services Guide(s) will be provided as a reference. Patient data (including&#xD;
      diagnosis and biopsy outcomes) will be drawn from the patients' medical records. This data&#xD;
      will be recorded by the site study personnel via a web-based electronic data collection (EDC)&#xD;
      system every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to observe the clinical use of LungCare and patient outcomes in a&#xD;
      cohort of lung transplant recipients managed with LungCare. This cohort design is selected&#xD;
      because it is efficient and effective to evaluate the real-world robust performance of&#xD;
      LungCare on patient management and outcomes that can be generalized to the intended use&#xD;
      population. A well-designed observational cohort study that includes a large number of&#xD;
      patients with long-term follow-up may provide robust results with several advantages, such as&#xD;
      gathering data regarding sequence of events to assess causality; examining multiple outcomes&#xD;
      for a given LungCare use; calculating rates of biopsy and rejection; and operational&#xD;
      efficiency.&#xD;
