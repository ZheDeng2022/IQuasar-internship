    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers aimed to investigate the effects of bed exercises on anxiety,&#xD;
      pain, early ambulation and mobilization in major surgery patients. This study was conducted&#xD;
      in the experimental type and in the surgical clinics of a university hospital. 120 patients&#xD;
      (60 experimental and 60 control groups) scheduled for major surgery took part in the study.&#xD;
      The data were collected using the patient information and surgical care information form, the&#xD;
      Surgical Anxiety Questionnaire, and the Numerical Pain Scale with a face-to-face interview&#xD;
      technique. Patients in the experimental group were given a 15-minute bed exercise, and the&#xD;
      control group was routinely performed in the clinic. The data analysis was done with IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics 25.0. The data were evaluated by descriptive statistics, t-test and correlation&#xD;
      tests. For the validity and reliability analysis of the scales, Cronbach's alpha coefficient&#xD;
      was examined. The results were evaluated at 95% confidence interval and p &lt;0.05 significance&#xD;
      level.&#xD;

      Major surgery is a serious physiological condition that can cause significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Adverse conditions encountered during major surgery may be fatal, cause one or&#xD;
      more postoperative complications, negatively affect short-term and long-term survival and&#xD;
      increase healthcare costs. It is estimated that more than 230 million major surgical&#xD;
      interventions are performed every year in the world. Major surgery is an extremely stressful&#xD;
      experience. Anxiety, which begins by telling the patient that surgery is needed, increases&#xD;
      with hospitalization and may adversely affect patient compliance, care, quality of life,&#xD;
      duration of treatment and expenses, recovery and well-being, disease progression, and the&#xD;
      patient's exposure to additional diseases. Anxiety is a disturbing feeling of fear and worry&#xD;
      that is life-threatening or perceived as a threat. Anxiety, which is the feeling of&#xD;
      restlessness and tension caused by waiting for danger, can lead to an increase in&#xD;
      sympathetic, parasympathetic and endocrine stimuli and confront the individual with many&#xD;
      physiological and psychological problems. Surgical pain is at the top of these problems. Pain&#xD;
      felt during the postoperative period is an inevitable experience for many patients. More than&#xD;
      75% of patients who underwent surgery in Western societies reported moderate, severe and&#xD;
      unbearable pain in the postoperative period. The prevalence of pain in Turkey after major&#xD;
      surgery is more than 90%. In literature studies, the pain seen after major surgery was found&#xD;
      to be higher than other surgeries. Ineffective pain management causes delays in wound&#xD;
      healing, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary dysfunction, cognitive impairment, anxiety and&#xD;
      stress, increased morbidity and mortality, delayed discharge, and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      Nurses play important roles in the assessment and management of pain. In addition to drug&#xD;
      applications related to pain management; non-drug applications such as massage, hot and cold&#xD;
      application, pain-reducing positioning, meditation, patient distraction,&#xD;
      vibration,transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, listening to music, edema-reducing&#xD;
      interventions, turning in bed, leg and arm exercises, deep breathing exercises. Arm and leg&#xD;
      exercises performed in bed are aimed at maintaining the muscle strength and balance of&#xD;
      individuals and are less tiring than standing exercises. Turning in bed, arm and leg&#xD;
      exercises, moving from right to left, raising and lowering the heel and feet, bending the&#xD;
      arms, bending the legs, bumping the feet together, moving the legs like cycling, stretching&#xD;
      the arms, inverted arm and leg movements. Surgical patients are recommended methods of&#xD;
      mobilization starting with early ambulation at the 6th and 8th hour postoperatively. In this&#xD;
      way, prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), early recovery, rapid discharge and early&#xD;
      return to social roles are targeted. In major surgical patients, anxiety and pain are thought&#xD;
      to restrict early ambulation and mobilization and have negative effects on wound healing,&#xD;
      daily life activities and well-being. The severity of anxiety and perceived pain is likely to&#xD;
      increase in immobile surgical patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of&#xD;
      turning in bed, arm and leg exercises on preoperative anxiety, surgical pain and early&#xD;
      ambulation.&#xD;

    <description>Routine preoperative care of the clinic was performed in both groups. &quot;Turning in bed, arm and leg exercises&quot; were applied to only the experimental group for 15 minutes and 12-24 hours prior to surgery. Later, both groups were provided to fill in the Anxiety Specific to Surgery Questionnaire (ASSQ). After interventions for postoperative pain by clinical nurses in both groups during the postoperative period, nurses waited until oral feeding and patients' general condition to stabilize. Afterwards, &quot;turning in bed, arm and leg exercises&quot; were applied to the experimental group patients for the second time for 15 minutes. Later, both groups took a few steps in front of their bed as part of the early ambulation procedure.</description>

Later, both groups took a few steps in front of their bed as part of the early ambulation procedure. The patients who tolerate early ambulation were mobilized by allowing them to walk in the clinical corridor, walk around in a social space specially designed for patients and spend time. In the two days following surgery, 15-minute exercise was applied once to the experimental group.</description>
