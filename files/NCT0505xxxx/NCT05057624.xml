  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a double-blind trial that seeks to examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and efficacy of a recently developed eye-tracking-based, gaze-contingent music&#xD;
      reward therapy (GC-MRT) in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to: (1) examine the efficacy of GC-MRT in PTSD; and (2)&#xD;
      elucidate its underpinnings (i.e. attention control, reward processes, and exposure via&#xD;
      counter-conditioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. GC-MRT will produce greater reductions in symptoms compared to PC at post-treatment and&#xD;
           follow-up (diverting attention away from threat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GC-MRT-exp will produce greater reductions in symptoms compared to PC at post-treatment&#xD;
           follow-up (exposure via counter-conditioning by rewarding threat stimuli).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory analysis will compare the reductions in symptoms of GC-MRT compared to&#xD;
           GC-MRT-exp at post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GC-MRT is designed to shift participants' attention away from threat and toward neutral&#xD;
      stimuli by introducing a contingency between viewing patterns and music pre-chosen by&#xD;
      participants. Participants view matrices of *faces with neutral and angry expressions.&#xD;
      Viewing the neutral faces triggers music the participant previously requested, and viewing&#xD;
      the angry faces turns the music off. The researchers will compare this condition (GC- MRT) to&#xD;
      two additional conditions. In the &quot;exposure&quot; condition (GC-MRT-exp) the investigators will&#xD;
      reverse the music contingency such that viewing the angry faces triggers the music while&#xD;
      viewing the neutral faces turns the music off. In the placebo control (PC) condition, music&#xD;
      plays continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to: (1) examine the efficacy of GC-MRT in PTSD; and (2) elucidate&#xD;
      its underpinnings (i.e. attention control, reward processes, and exposure via&#xD;
      counter-conditioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention control is the ability to shift attention deliberately based on goal-directed&#xD;
      behavior. Accordingly, deficits in attention control can result in volatile shifts in&#xD;
      attention leading to increase attention allocation to threat in the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reward functioning is the ability to seek out and enjoy stimuli of positive motivational&#xD;
      valence, and is considered a crucial driving force of behavior, guiding the organism towards&#xD;
      positive and rewarding experiences, ranging from food and gender to money, music, and&#xD;
      positive social interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocating visual attention to rewarding stimuli is considered a reward-related attentional&#xD;
      feature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counter-conditioning is an alternative to exposure therapy involving pairing of the feared&#xD;
      stimulus with an appetitive/positive outcome (i.e., increasing the rewarding/positive value&#xD;
      of the feared stimulus), in which repeated trials are supposed to reduce the fear response,&#xD;
      and replace it by an appetitive response. Indeed, studies have shown counter-conditioning to&#xD;
      be more effective at reducing fear than traditional exposure therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. GC-MRT will produce greater reductions in symptoms compared to PC at post-treatment and&#xD;
           follow-up (diverting attention away from threat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GC-MRT-exp will produce greater reductions in symptoms compared to PC at post-treatment&#xD;
           follow-up (exposure via counter-conditioning by rewarding threat stimuli).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory analysis will compare the reductions in symptoms of GC-MRT compared to&#xD;
           GC-MRT-exp at post-treatment follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population: Seventy-five subjects with PTSD will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The sample (N = 75) will be randomized equally into three groups. Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive a 4-week (8 sessions) course of GC-MRT where music will play only when viewing&#xD;
      neutral faces, Group 2 will receive a 4-week (8 sessions) course of GC-MRT-exp where music&#xD;
      will play only when viewing angry faces, and Group 3 will receive a 4-week (8-sessions)&#xD;
      course of non-GC-MRT (i.e. placebo control; PC) where music will play throughout the trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *The pictures of the faces used in the intervention will include 50% male and 50% female.&#xD;
      Race-wise they are homogenous. Varying the different faces by race is not feasible as these&#xD;
      faces were chosen from an established picture data-base (i.e., the Karolinska Directed&#xD;
      Emotional Faces database; KDEF) based on the affective ratings of each face. Importantly,&#xD;
      this composition of faces is similar to one used in an attention assessment task for which&#xD;
      our pilot data shows significant group differences in dwell time, which is the attentional&#xD;
      target of the intervention. Hence, we do not expect this to affect the results.&#xD;
