      To validate the ability of the FatHealth algorithm to identify individuals with pre-diabetes&#xD;
      and with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre prospective study will evaluate the ability of the FatHealth technology to&#xD;
      correctly identify individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes, validating the technology&#xD;
      against the current gold-standard diagnostic method, oral glucose tolerance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be individuals who have undergone a CT scan of the chest (coronary CT&#xD;
      angiogram [CCTA] or CT chest) as part of observational cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is the current&#xD;
      gold-standard method for detecting pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus. All patients must have&#xD;
      an evaluable OGTT. The study population will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Approximately 90 individuals who had a CCTA as part of their clinical care (45&#xD;
           identified as having an abnormal FatHealth algorithm calculation and 45 with a normal&#xD;
           FatHealth algorithm calculation) will undergo OGTT which is evaluable; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Approximately 90 individuals who had a chest CT as part of their clinical care (45&#xD;
           identified as having an abnormal FatHealth algorithm calculation and 45 with a normal&#xD;
           FatHealth algorithm calculation) will undergo OGTT which is evaluable.&#xD;

    <description>Obtain blood sample for glucose assessment (time &quot;0&quot; sample). This may be obtained via venepuncture or after cannula insertion.&#xD;
Test a small sample using a near patient glucose testing meter. If the result on the glucose meter is greater than or equal to 11mmol/L, send the blood sample urgently to lab. If it is confirmed by biochemistry to be above 11mmol/L, there is no need to continue test.&#xD;
If the result is less than 11mmol/L on meter, give the patient the glucose solution to drink.&#xD;
Collect a further blood sample at 120 minutes.&#xD;
Send samples all together to laboratory for glucose measurement.</description>
