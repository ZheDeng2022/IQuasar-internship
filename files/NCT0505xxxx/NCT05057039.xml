  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent animal and human studies have found the relationship between the composition of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota and hypertension, but some studies did not have a detailed evaluation of the&#xD;
      diet content, which could be an important effect on gut microbiota. Moreover, most of these&#xD;
      studies were finished in Western countries, in which the dietary patterns were significantly&#xD;
      different from those in Chinese regions. This study intends to establish Taiwanese local data&#xD;
      to explore the differences in the composition of gut microbiota among hypertensive patients&#xD;
      and normotensive subjects.&#xD;

      The investigators plan to enroll total 70 hypertensive and normotensive cases from the&#xD;
      elderly health examination in Cathay General Hospital, who are aged from 65 to 80 years. Body&#xD;
      mass index and blood samples for biochemical analysis such as blood sugar and cholesterol&#xD;
      levels are taken, and fecal samples are collected for analysis of gut microbiota, which is&#xD;
      characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Besides, the diet and nutrients intake&#xD;
      are recorded and calculated by licensed dietitian. Through the exploration of gut microbiota&#xD;
      in hypertensive patients, the results can be the reference for clinical treatment.&#xD;
