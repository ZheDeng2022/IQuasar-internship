  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans at high-risk for hospitalization, including those with complex care needs, represent&#xD;
      a large population of VHA patients who often do not receive evidence-based primary care&#xD;
      practices that would help them avoid the hospital and improve their health. The high-RIsk&#xD;
      VETerans (RIVET) Program will implement evidence-based practices that can support VHA Primary&#xD;
      Care teams to deliver more comprehensive and patient-centered care, better strategies to&#xD;
      manage medications, and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. The RIVET Program is designed to&#xD;
      find the most effective approaches to increasing use of evidence-based practices for&#xD;
      high-risk Veterans in primary care, provide rapid data feedback to VHA on high-risk patient&#xD;
      care, build capacity for the implementation of evidence-based practices, and train future&#xD;
      leaders in high-risk Veteran care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The top 5% of Veterans at the highest risk for hospitalizations account for almost 50% of VHA&#xD;
      healthcare costs, have significant multimorbidity, and are also at high risk for poor health&#xD;
      outcomes. In the VHA, most (88%) high-risk patients are managed by general primary care teams&#xD;
      (i.e., Patient-Aligned Care Teams; PACTs). Few PACTs, however, have implemented&#xD;
      evidence-based practices (EBPs) known to address the most common issues among high-risk&#xD;
      Veterans. Some evidence indicates that usual implementation strategies, such as dissemination&#xD;
      of toolkits and training are not effective for improving uptake of EBPs. The most effective&#xD;
      implementation strategies to achieve evidence-based care for high-risk patients, however, are&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall impact goal of the high-RIsk VETerans (RIVET) QUERI Program is to improve VHA&#xD;
      primary care capacity to provide comprehensive, evidence-based care for complex, high-risk&#xD;
      Veterans. The investigators will test 2 implementation strategies to evaluate their impact on&#xD;
      the uptake of two separate EBPs. These EPBs are 1) Comprehensive Assessment and Care Planning&#xD;
      (CACP), and 2) Phone-Based Health Coaching for Medication Adherence (HCMA). CACP is based on&#xD;
      the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and guides teams in systematically addressing&#xD;
      patients' cognitive, functional, and social needs through a comprehensive care plan. HCMA&#xD;
      addresses common challenges to medication adherence using a patient-centered approach through&#xD;
      virtual encounters. Both comprehensive assessments and health coaching have demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy in randomized, controlled trials and have been implemented by two of the national&#xD;
      partners in geriatrics and Whole Health teams. However, both EBPs have had low uptake in&#xD;
      primary care. Implementing these practices in primary care has the potential to improve&#xD;
      quality of care for the large majority of high-risk Veterans. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a mixed methods type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of EBQI-IC and EBQI-LC versus usual care (national tool dissemination and training efforts)&#xD;
      in at least 14 sites in 2 VISNs using a Concurrent Stepped Wedge design (Aim 2). The primary&#xD;
      outcome is proportion of eligible high-risk patients that receive each EBP. The investigators&#xD;
      will use the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework to&#xD;
      compare and evaluate Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and costs. The&#xD;
      investigators will then assess the Maintenance/sustainment and spread of both EBPs in primary&#xD;
      care across 3 VISNs after the active 18-month implementation period (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness evaluation using a Concurrent Stepped Wedge45 design to compare two implementation strategies to increase adoption of the EBPs in primary care in 14 sites across 2 VISNs: Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI)-Individual Consultation (EBQI-IC) and EBQI-Learning Collaborative (EBQI-LC). Each VISN will implement a single EBP [Comprehensive Assessment and Care Planning (CACP) for High-Risk Veterans or Phone-Based Health Coaching for Medication Adherence (HCMA)]. Implementation strategies will be randomized by site. Time periods without active implementation will serve as the usual care periods for both EBQI conditions.</intervention_model_description>
