  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump therapy (CSII) have increased&#xD;
      in utilization in the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both types of&#xD;
      devices are worn externally, with either a catheter or filament introduced into the&#xD;
      subcutaneous space. Removal of these devices interrupts glucose monitoring or insulin&#xD;
      delivery or both, which may have an adverse impact on patients' glucose control. Few studies&#xD;
      have investigated the logistical and technical challenges that patients face when their&#xD;
      insulin pump device or continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: We will conduct a patient survey which seeks to identify and quantify the&#xD;
      number of times insulin pump therapy or continuous glucose monitor has been disrupted, for&#xD;
      what reason, how it was resolved and whether diabetes care had been adversely affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the frequency and intensity of adverse health outcomes resulting from&#xD;
      mandatory removal of CGM on insulin pump devices in healthcare or other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients treated at Washington University outpatient clinics or Barnes&#xD;
      Jewish Hospital between August 1, 2021- December 1, 2021. The study will include outpatients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus who routinely utilize either CGM or insulin pump therapy or both. The&#xD;
      target number of patients for the study will be 600, equally distributed between inpatients&#xD;
      and outpatients, and with at least 100 having type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology: After providing consent, patients will complete an electronic&#xD;
      questionnaire. Demographic information and diabetes history will be extracted from the&#xD;
      patients' medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: We will determine the incidence of disruptions to insulin pump therapy or&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes mellitus as a result of&#xD;
      hospitalization or medical test over a 1 year time period. We will also determine adverse&#xD;
      health outcomes that resulted from device disruptions.&#xD;
