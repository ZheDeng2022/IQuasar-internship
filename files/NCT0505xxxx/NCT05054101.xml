  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic and more specifically the confinement is an unpleasant experience for&#xD;
      those who undergo it. Separation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over&#xD;
      disease status, and boredom can, on occasion, create dramatic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the pandemic and its consequences are inducing a considerable degree of fear, worry&#xD;
      and concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as older&#xD;
      adults, care providers and people with underlying health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we refer back to former pandemics (SARS-CoV-1, MERS, Ebola), suicide, post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorders have been reported, anger generated, and&#xD;
      lawsuits brought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current COVID-19 pandemic is an epidemiological and psychological crisis. The enormity of&#xD;
      living in isolation, changes in our daily lives, job loss, financial hardship and grief over&#xD;
      the death of loved ones has the potential to affect the mental health and well-being of many.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the developing situation with Covid-19, policy makers urgently need evidence synthesis&#xD;
      to produce guidance for the public and patients suffering from mental disorders such as PTSD&#xD;
      and adjustment disorders. Therefore, it seems crucial to assess and manage the signs of&#xD;
      anxiety, panic attacks, depression and suicide easily and at the national scale using fast,&#xD;
      efficient and cutting-edge techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the superiority of the VieCovid2020 smartphone app, in add-on to usual care in&#xD;
      patients suffering from PTSD or adjustment disorders within the context of COVID-19, on the&#xD;
      rate of responders at 6 months using the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VieCovid2020 smartphone application provides lifestyle and educational advices, as well&#xD;
      as, a real-time data collection targeted the emotional state of the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be used during 3 months in add-on to usual psychiatric intervention and psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;

      Design of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicentric randomized controlled superiority trial with 2 parallel arms. The randomization&#xD;
      will be a various-sized block randomization, stratified by centre and by co-treatment (=usual&#xD;
      psychiatric intervention) prescribed at baseline before randomisation: selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) alone or SSRI in combination to eye movement desensitization and&#xD;
      reprocessing (EMDR), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or reconsolidation blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the superiority of the VieCovid2020 smartphone app, in add-on to usual care in&#xD;
      patients suffering from PTSD or adjustment disorders within the context of COVID-19, on the&#xD;
      rate of responders at 6 months using the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be randomized between:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  usual psychiatric intervention alone and psychiatric evaluations at 5 following time&#xD;
           points (day 1, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months) (control arm) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a real-time assessment using the VieCovid2020 smartphone application during the first 3&#xD;
           months in add-on to usual psychiatric intervention and psychiatric evaluations at 5&#xD;
           following time points (day 1; 1 month; 3 months, 6 months and 12 months) (intervention&#xD;
           arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the VieCovid2020 smartphone application and psychiatric evaluations at 5 following&#xD;
      time points are added by the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers suffering from PTSD or adjustment disorders will be included within the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VieCovid2020 smartphone application provides lifestyle and educational advices, as well&#xD;
      as, a real-time data collection targeted the emotional state of the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be used during 3 months in add-on to usual psychiatric intervention and psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential reduction of acute and chronic stress is expected among users of the application&#xD;
      in particular with the set of lifestyle and educational advices proposed every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the COVID-19 pandemic context, the expected benefits for society is to contribute to&#xD;
      reduce the number of patients suffering from PTSD or adjustment disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      850 patients are expected and 18 sites in France.&#xD;
