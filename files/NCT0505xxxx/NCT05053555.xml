  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past three decades, the treatment of both primary and secondary liver malignancies&#xD;
      has been improved by the development and optimization of multiple minimally invasive thermal&#xD;
      ablative therapies. These advances have resulted in a myriad of benefits for patients&#xD;
      including decreased morbidity, mortality, as well as increased longevity and quality of life.&#xD;
      However, these therapies can only be performed within certain parameters. Thermal ablative&#xD;
      techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MVA) are recommended&#xD;
      for small lesions under 3 cm due to decreased efficacy when attempting to treat larger&#xD;
      lesions. Additionally, large vessels in close proximity to a target lesion may result in heat&#xD;
      dissipation, termed the &quot;heat sink&quot; effect, and result in incomplete ablation of the lesion.&#xD;
      Furthermore, thermal ablative techniques cause off-target damage when utilized near sensitive&#xD;
      structures such as the diaphragm, stomach, or bowel, and if performed near thermosensitive&#xD;
      bile ducts, can result in cholestasis . Noting these limitations, percutaneous high-dose-rate&#xD;
      brachytherapy was brought into clinical practice by Ricke et al. in Europe in 2002 . This&#xD;
      therapy utilizes an iridium-192 (192Ir) isotope to administer a cytotoxic dose of radiation&#xD;
      to a target lesion. It is not susceptible to heat sink effects and can also deliver radiation&#xD;
      with the precision necessary to cause tumor death without destroying the integrity of&#xD;
      neighboring structures. Additionally, it can be used to treat larger tumors (&gt;3cm) as it is&#xD;
      not associated the same size limitations as ablative techniques and can also be utilized to&#xD;
      treat lesions that are not amenable to intra-arterial therapies (such as trans-arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization and yttrium-90 radioembolization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its inception, HDRBT has been evaluated through multiple studies investigating its use&#xD;
      to treat lesions throughout the body including both primary and secondary liver malignancies&#xD;
      such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, metastasis to the liver from&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer , melanoma , and breast cancer . Its use in treating&#xD;
      lymph node metastases has also been investigated . These studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      feasibility, safety, and clinical effectiveness of this method, establishing it as a&#xD;
      therapeutic option when use of thermal ablation therapies is restricted. Most studies&#xD;
      however, have been retrospective and have been performed outside the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying this therapy will add a crucial treatment option to our current armamentarium,&#xD;
      filling a gap in currently available therapies and additionally allowing for further&#xD;
      investigation of the use of HDRBT in a larger and more diverse population.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To prospectively evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the use of high dose rate&#xD;
      brachytherapy (HDRBT) for the treatment of both primary and secondary unresectable liver&#xD;
      malignancies assessed by comparing local tumor control (LTC) rates at 6 months with a&#xD;
      historical cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare local tumor control rates at 3-month intervals between cohorts for the&#xD;
           duration of the study (3 months, 9 months, 12 months, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between cohorts.&#xD;
