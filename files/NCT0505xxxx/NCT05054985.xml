      Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a multi-branched thoracoabdominal stent graft system&#xD;
      for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is mainly for patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, and all subjects who&#xD;
      signed the informed consent and passed the screening will be enrolled. Patients who meet all&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and don't meet the exclusion criteria will be implanted with&#xD;
      multi-branched thoracoabdominal stent graft system. Patients will be followed up at&#xD;
      discharge, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months after the implantation.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. The diameter has increased by more than 5mm in recent 6 months or the by more&#xD;
                  than 10mm in recent 1 year;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. anatomical criteria&#xD;

               1. The proximal anchoring region (aorta or implanted graft) was 17~36 mm in diameter&#xD;
                  and ≥25 mm in length;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Distal anchoring region (aorta or implanted graft): If the distal anchoring&#xD;
                  region is in the iliac artery, the anchoring region has a diameter range of 7~25&#xD;
                  mm and a length of ≥15 mm; If the distal anchoring area is in the abdominal&#xD;
                  aorta, the diameter of the anchoring area ranges from 12~36mm and the length≥&#xD;
