    <description>The Shockwave Medical Mini S Peripheral IVL Catheter is intended for lithotripsy-enhanced catheter dilatation of lesions, including calcified lesions found in the peripheral vasculature, such as the iliac, femoral, ilio-femoral, popliteal, infra-popliteal, and renal arteries. The Mini S IVL Catheter is not for use in the coronary or cerebral vasculature.</description>

               -  Angiographic Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. One or two target lesion(s) located in a native de novo superficial femoral, popliteal&#xD;
             or infrapopliteal artery (above the ankle joint), in one or both limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Target lesion reference vessel diameter (RVD) between 2.0 mm and 7.0 mm by&#xD;
             investigator visual estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Target lesion stenosis ≥70% (for vessels below the knee defined as P3 to the ankle&#xD;
             joint) or ≥90% (for vessels above the knee) by investigator visual estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Target lesion length is ≤150 mm by investigator visual estimate. Target lesion can be&#xD;
             all or part of the 150 mm treated zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Calcification is at least moderate defined as presence of fluoroscopic evidence of&#xD;
             calcification: 1) on parallel sides of the vessel and 2) extending &gt; 50% the length of&#xD;
             the lesion if lesion is ≥50mm in length; or extending for minimum of 20mm if lesion is&#xD;
             &lt;50mm in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;

          2. History of endovascular or surgical procedure on the target limb within the last 30&#xD;
             days, or planned within 30 days of the index procedure. Note: inflow treatment of&#xD;
             non-target lesions is allowed providing successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subject has known allergy to contrast agents or medications used to perform&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that, in the opinion of&#xD;

             evaluations pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Covid-19 diagnosis within 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Planned use of cutting/scoring balloons, re-entry or atherectomy devices in target&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Angiographic Exclusion Criteria&#xD;

             femoral, or popliteal arteries with ≤30% residual stenosis, and no serious&#xD;
             angiographic complications (e.g. embolism).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Failure to successfully treat significant non-target infra-popliteal lesions prior to&#xD;
             treatment of target lesion(s). Successful treatment is defined as obtaining ≤50%&#xD;
             residual stenosis with no serious angiographic complications (e.g., embolism).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Target lesion includes in-stent restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Evidence of aneurysm or thrombus in target vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. No calcium or mild calcium in the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Target lesion within native or synthetic vessel grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Failure to successfully cross the guidewire across the target lesion; successful&#xD;
             crossing defined as tip of the guidewire distal to the target lesion in the absence of&#xD;
