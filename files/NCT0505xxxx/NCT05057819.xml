  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is an effective anti-obesity treatment providing durable weight loss and&#xD;
      profound beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. However, bariatric surgery also comes with&#xD;
      an increased risk for a late metabolic complication known as postbariatric hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      (PBH). The condition presents with hypoglycaemic episodes 1-3 hours after meals and develops&#xD;
      one to several years after bariatric surgery, mainly gastric bypass. PBH affects&#xD;
      approximately 30% of patients without preexisting diabetes. For a subset of patients,&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia-associated impairment of daily living and social functioning are commonly&#xD;
      observed. The underlying mechanisms of PBH are multifactorial. It is considered that&#xD;
      inadequately high insulin secretion caused by both accelerated glucose absorption from the&#xD;
      gut and increased insulinotropic hormones such as GLP-1 are important pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor reduces glucose&#xD;
      exposure by increasing urinary glucose excretion. In a pilot study, a single dose of 10mg of&#xD;
      empagliflozin taken before a mixed meal reduced the risk of PBH by 74%. Both, postprandial&#xD;
      glucose and insulin exposure were significantly lower with empagliflozin vs. placebo, which&#xD;
      makes Empagliflozin a potential treatment for PBH. In this study, treatment naïve patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either oral empagliflozin 25 mg daily in the morning for 20&#xD;
      days, followed by 2-6 weeks wash out and 20 days placebo once daily in the morning, or the&#xD;
      reverse sequence. Urine and blood analysis will be performed as detailed in the protocol.&#xD;
