  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Receiving a life-limiting diagnosis is often a shock for those affected as well as for their&#xD;
      relatives, which changes the entire life situation of the family. New perspectives often&#xD;
      arise, as well as feelings of worry, sadness and powerlessness. Caregiving is often an&#xD;
      extreme physical challenge, but above all a psychological one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether family caregivers of palliative patients with severe trait&#xD;
           anxiety in the care situation also suffer from severe state anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether family caregivers of palliative patients with increased stress&#xD;
           levels and burnout-promoting work-related behaviour suffer more from burnout symptoms,&#xD;
           health-related anxiety and psychosomatic complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the impact of nursing support by a mobile palliative team on family&#xD;
           caregivers of palliative patients.&#xD;
