      This study is being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined&#xD;
      with SHR1020 in the treatment of advanced melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical research. Based on current&#xD;
      experience, single agent immunotherapy has limited efficacy in advanced melanoma. SHR1020 is&#xD;
      a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This study is aiming to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of camrelizumab combined with SHR1020 in patients with advanced melanoma. The safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of this study will be assessed through ORR, DCR, PFS, OS and adverse effects as&#xD;
      graded by CTCAE 5.0.&#xD;
