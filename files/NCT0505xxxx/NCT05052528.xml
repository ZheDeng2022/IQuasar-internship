      This phase I trial evaluates the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without rituximab before CD19 chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor T cells in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). T-cells are a normal part&#xD;
      of the immune system. To make the T-cell medication, T-cells are taken from the blood and&#xD;
      altered in a laboratory. They are then returned to the body. The altered T-cells will latch&#xD;
      on to a specific part of the cancer cells and hopefully kill them. Once the T-cells have been&#xD;
      altered in the laboratory, they are called &quot;CAR T-cells.&quot; CAR is short for &quot;chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptors.&quot; These are structures on the surface of cells that allow the altered T-Cells to&#xD;
      find and destroy the cancer cells. Another part of the T-Cell medication is called &quot;CD19.&quot;&#xD;
      This part is called a &quot;biomarker.&quot; Biomarkers help doctors determine whether a cancer is&#xD;
      getting worse and whether medications are working to stop it. The chemotherapy drugs that are&#xD;
      given before the T-Cell therapy are cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and rituximab. Rituximab is&#xD;
      an immunotherapy drug. These chemotherapy drugs will reduce the number of normal (unaltered)&#xD;
      T-Cells in the body to make room for the altered T-cells to kill the cancer cells. Giving&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without rituximab before CD19 CAR T cell therapy may&#xD;
      help improve response to CD19 CAR T cell therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:I. To examine the feasibility to manufacture autologous CD19 CAR T cells&#xD;
      at a minimum target dose of 1.0 x 10^6 cells/kilogram using the CliniMACS automated&#xD;
      system.II. To determine the safety of administering high-dose conditioning chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine with rituximab prior to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed (R)/refractory (R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to find the&#xD;
      recommended regimen after phase II dose for this therapy.III. To determine the safety of&#xD;
      infusion of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD19 in adults with R/R DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To describe the toxicities related to CD19 targeted CAR T cells.II.&#xD;
      To describe the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate of relapsed DLBCL&#xD;
      treated with CD19 CAR T cells.III. To assess other response variables including overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and event free survival (EFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL 1: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes daily&#xD;

      CAR T cells IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL 2: Patients receive rituximab IV on day -5, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes daily on days -5 to -3, and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -5 to -3.&#xD;
      Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL 3: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes daily on days -3 to&#xD;
      -5 and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes daily on day -5. Patients also receive CD19 CAR T&#xD;
      cells IV on day 0.DOSE LEVEL 4: Patients receive rituximab IV on day -5, fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate IV over 30 minutes daily on days -5 to -3, and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes&#xD;
      on day -5. Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL 5: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes daily on days -5 to&#xD;
      -1 and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes daily on days -5 and -4. Patients also receive&#xD;
      CD19 CAR T cells IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE LEVEL 6: Patients receive rituximab IV on day -5, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes daily on days -5 to -1, and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -5 and -4.&#xD;
      Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells IV on day 0.After completion of study treatment,&#xD;
      patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, 6 and 12 months, and then annually for up to&#xD;
      15 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune diseases (ex: Crohn's, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus&#xD;

             immunosuppressive or systemic disease modifying agents within the last two years prior&#xD;
             to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autologous transplant within 6 weeks and allogeneic transplant within 3 months of&#xD;
             planned CAR T cell infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipient of CD19 CAR T cell therapy outside of this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system or meningeal involvement by tumor. Subjects with&#xD;
             untreated brain metastases/central nervous system (CNS) disease will be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Patients with a history of CNS or meningeal involvement must&#xD;
             be in a documented remission by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation and&#xD;
             contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for at least 30 days prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ&#xD;
             (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection documented by positive viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because CAR T cell&#xD;
             therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Subjects of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to practice&#xD;
             birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four (4) weeks after&#xD;
             receiving the CAR-T cell infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of myelodysplasia on any bone marrow biopsy prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded)&#xD;
