  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for a culturally adapted screening tool to aid health care professionals or&#xD;
      clinicians screen for the presence of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injuries&#xD;
      in Pashtoon population. . Since Paraplegic center Hayatabad Peshawar is a reputable institute&#xD;
      for spinal cord injury patients' rehabilitation in Khyber pakhtun khwa where most of Pashto&#xD;
      speaking SCI patients are rehabilitated. While working there as a physical therapist I, my&#xD;
      other colleagues and patients felt a need for a screening tool for pain in Pashto language&#xD;
      .So I decided to a conduct a tool validation study. This study will help the clinicians to&#xD;
      assess their patient's pain type easily through the Pashto version of LANSS pain scale in&#xD;
      Pashtoon population and hence will help in timely management of the pain.&#xD;

      The Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) pain scale, a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire for identifying patients with neuropathic pain, was developed to identify&#xD;
      patients with neuropathic mechanisms dominating their pain experience. The original English&#xD;
      version of the LANSS pain scale has been translated and validated in Turkish, Spanish,&#xD;
      Swedish, Brazilian, Portuguese, and Chinese Mandarin languages. However, no neuropathic pain&#xD;
      questionnaire including the LANSS has yet been established in Pasto language in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these screening tools are based on descriptors, their linguistic adaptation and&#xD;
      validation into different languages are feasible and this ensures their reliability and&#xD;
      validity in languages other than those in which they were initially developed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (DN4) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The DN4 questionnaire consists of a total of 10 items grouped in 4 sections . The first seven items are related to the quality of pain (burning, painful cold, electric shocks) and its association to abnormal sensations (tingling, pins and needles, numbness, itching). The other 3 items are related to neurological examination in the painful area (touch hypoesthesia, pinprick hypoesthesia, tactile allodynia). A score of 1 is given to each positive item and a score of 0 to each negative item. The total score is calculated as the sum of all 10 items, and the cut-off value for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain is a total score of 4/10.</description>
