    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effectiveness of reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA),&#xD;
      targeting both village and forest working populations, compared to control for reducing the&#xD;
      health promotion hospital-level (sub-district) incidence and prevalence of P. falciparum and&#xD;
      P. vivax within five provinces in Thailand.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thailand currently has a well-developed and robust surveillance system based on detailed&#xD;
      mapping of all cases to the village foci level and stratification of response. In fiscal year&#xD;
      2019, 5,833 cases of malaria were reported with 83.0% P. vivax and 12.9% P. falciparum; nine&#xD;
      deaths were reported. This represents a 20.8% decrease in total cases from fiscal year 2018.&#xD;
      Currently, there are 701 &quot;A1&quot; villages in 44 provinces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research proposed here will evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of enhanced&#xD;
      reactive focal mass drug administration, results of which will have direct implications for&#xD;
      continued roll out the community-led foci management, providing practical guidance that other&#xD;
      malaria programs can utilize. Responding to the malaria among high risk populations is a&#xD;
      requirement from the National Malaria Elimination Strategy in Thailand. Additionally,&#xD;
      Thailand has experienced outbreaks related to forest work over the past several years, and&#xD;
      consequently the Department of Vector Borne Disease (DVBD) is interested in introducing more&#xD;
      aggressive parasite elimination strategies, including rfMDA for P. falciparum and P. vivax&#xD;
      specifically targeting high-risk populations to interrupt transmission and rapidly accelerate&#xD;
      elimination.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals will be told of their test result and a positive test result on either RDT will prompt treatment as per the national treatment guidelines.&#xD;
Individuals with P. falciparum infection will be treated with an age-appropriate course of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHAP) or artesunate-pyronaridine (Pyramax) and PQ.&#xD;
At all study sites in Thailand, patients with a P. vivax infection identified by the standard combination RDT will be tested by the VMV and Health Promotion Hospital (HPH) staff member using the quantitative G6PD RDT. G6PD normal individuals will be treated with Chloroquine (CQ) and a 14-day course of primaquine (PQ). G6PD deficient individuals will receive CQ alone and referred to the nearest health facility for further primaquine management decisions.</description>

    <description>Reactive focal mass administration (rfMDA) will be implemented around the index case household and to forest co-workers/co-travelers in Thailand. The VMV will conduct the investigation visit within 7 days after the notification of the index case. All members of the index case's household as well as all members of the nearest five households around the index case's household, including temporary visitors will be invited to participate in the study and to be treated for malaria without a malaria test. After obtaining participants' or parents/guardians' consent, the VMV will proceed with the participant questionnaire, and all consenting household members will be tested for G6PD using the G6PD quantitative test prior to administration of antimalarials.&#xD;
For rfMDA, all eligible participants will be offered artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ). Per national policy, a 14-day course of primaquine will be administered to G6PD non-deficient study participants.</description>
