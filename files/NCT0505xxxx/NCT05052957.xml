  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of P140K MGMT hematopoietic stem cells,&#xD;
      O6-benzylguanine, temozolomide, and carmustine in treating participants with supratentorial&#xD;
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma who have recently had surgery to remove most or all of the brain&#xD;
      tumor (resected). Chemotherapy drugs, such as 6-benzylguanine, temozolomide, and carmustine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Placing P140K MGMT, a gene that has been created in the&#xD;
      laboratory into bone marrow making the bone more resistant to chemotherapy, allowing&#xD;
      intra-patient dose escalation which kills more tumor cells while allowing bone marrow to&#xD;
      survive.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients aged 18-70years. (Patients &gt;70 years will be excluded due to difficulties in&#xD;
             mobilizationand collection of adequate numbers of peripheral progenitors.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1or Karnofsky ≥ 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No myelosuppressive chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation prior to the&#xD;
             diagnosis of GBM and no prior chemotherapy (including Gliadel BCNU wafers) for GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No plan for hypofractionated radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic (absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥ 1000/mm3, platelets ≥&#xD;
             100,000/mm3, Hgb ≥ 9.5, hepatic (Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than or equal&#xD;
             to 3 times institutional upper limit of normal, prothrombin time &lt;1.2 times normal),&#xD;
             and renal (serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m2for&#xD;
             subjects with serum creatinine levels above institutional normal). These tests will be&#xD;
             repeated within 2 weeks of treatment with BG and TMZ, and must meet the same criteria.&#xD;
             -Post-operative steroids are i) tapered to ≤ 8mg dexamethasone/day(or equivalent)and&#xD;
             ii) patient has been on a stable or decreasing steroid dose for the 7 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must agree to using single barrier contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing and able to understand provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have all sutures removed prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be considered to be clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of 10unstained slides or FFPE sample of tumor for molecular or&#xD;
             histopathological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative HIV screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known medical or hereditary condition associated with&#xD;
             immunosuppression;orothermedical illness which may jeopardize patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of HIV seropositivity. This exclusion is included for two reasons.&#xD;
             First, there is evidence of decreased marrow reserve in HIV+ patients and antiviral&#xD;
             treatment is associated with myelosuppression. Thus, drug treatment designed to be&#xD;
             myelosuppressive may bemore toxic in this patient population. Second, extensive&#xD;
             laboratory culturing of the bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells is&#xD;
             required. No preclinical samples which are HIV+ have been evaluated with the gene&#xD;
             transfer modality proposed and thus the feasibility and safety of gene transfer and&#xD;
             selection in HIV+ samples cannot yet be advocated. Such studies are planned so as to&#xD;
             not preclude HIV+ patients in later studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. There is data to indicate that BCNU and TMZ is&#xD;
             teratogenic and carcinogenic. Thus, its use in pregnant women would confer unnecessary&#xD;
             risk to the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic pulmonary disease and other severe co-morbid respiratory&#xD;
             conditions, including patients with active pulmonary infection and/or pulse oximetry &lt;&#xD;
             90% and a corrected DLCO &lt; 50% of predicted. However, subjects with a corrected DLCO&#xD;
             in the range of 50-70% should have Pulmonologyclearance prior to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known diagnosis heart failure or cardiac insufficiency and an LVEF of &lt;&#xD;
             40%. History of acute coronary event including MI within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmiaor&#xD;
             bradycardia.Inability to undergo repeated MRI evaluation; or allergy or intolerance of&#xD;
             Gadolinium-containing contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active illicit drug use or diagnosis of alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior diagnosis of any malignant disease with the exception of non-melanomatous skin&#xD;
             cancer, or carcinoma in situof the cervix, bladder, prostate, or breast, unless&#xD;
             patient has been disease-free/in remission for ≥2 years prior to date of study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental incapacity or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Hepatitis B or C or Hepatitis grade ≥3 are excluded due to the potential&#xD;
             for additional hepatotixicity&#xD;
