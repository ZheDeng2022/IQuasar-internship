  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is intended to investigate the effectiveness of the Social-Emotional&#xD;
      Prevention Program enhanced version (SEP+) for increasing preschoolers' social-emotional&#xD;
      competencies and reducing their risk for behavior problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for the current study are put forward for child- and parent-related outcomes.&#xD;
      First, for the SEP+ effects for child-related outcomes, the investigators expect that: 1)&#xD;
      intervention group children will be rated significantly higher on measures of&#xD;
      social-emotional competencies (social skills and positive emotion regulation strategies (ER))&#xD;
      compared to children from the wait-list control group (primary outcomes); and 2) children&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention will be rated significantly lower on externalizing, as well as&#xD;
      internalizing problems (primary outcomes). In addition, for parent-related outcomes the&#xD;
      hypotheses are: 1) intervention group parents will report significantly more positive&#xD;
      parenting practices, and coparenting support, as well as significantly fewer negative&#xD;
      parenting practices, coparenting undermining, and parenting stress compared to control group&#xD;
      parents (secondary outcomes); and 2) intervention group parents will report significantly&#xD;
      more positive coping strategies with children's negative emotions and adaptive ER strategies,&#xD;
      as well as fewer negative coping strategies with children's negative emotions and less&#xD;
      maladaptive ER strategies in comparison with control group parents (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators aim to test potential intervention mechanisms. First, in the&#xD;
      case of child-related outcomes, it is expected that children's use of adaptive ER strategies&#xD;
      will mediate the intervention's effect on externalizing/internalizing problems; in a similar&#xD;
      vein, it is hypothesized that improved social skills will mediate the intervention's effect&#xD;
      on children's externalizing/internalizing problems. Furthermore, moderator effects of gender&#xD;
      on adaptive emotion regulation strategies and externalizing problems will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the parenting intervention, it is expected that program's effect on positive parenting&#xD;
      practices and stress will be mediated by the use of positive coping strategies, parental ER&#xD;
      and coparenting support. Also, coparenting undermining and parental reported adverse events&#xD;
      are hypothesized to moderate the intervention's effectiveness on parenting practices,&#xD;
      parental stress, and parent ER/coping.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first step in recruiting participants will require approaching preschool headmasters with&#xD;
      a detailed description of the study's aims and the benefits of participating in the SEP+&#xD;
      intervention for both teachers and parents. All recruited schools will further inform parents&#xD;
      of enrolled children regarding the study. Parents will be asked to provide informed consent&#xD;
      for their children's participation in the study. Also, they will be asked to make a choice&#xD;
      regarding their own participation to the parent training component. Afterwards, all&#xD;
      classrooms from a particular school will be randomly assigned to either the SEP+ intervention&#xD;
      or the wait-list control group. Data on the SEP+ effectiveness will be gathered at&#xD;
      pre-intervention (January 2022) and at 4-months post-intervention (June 2022) for both&#xD;
      conditions, intervention and control, respectively. Primary outcomes related to children's&#xD;
      social-emotional skills and risk of externalizing/internalizing problems will be assessed at&#xD;
      both baseline (T1) and immediately after the end of the intervention (T2) based on teacher&#xD;
      and parent ratings. A similar approach will be employed for secondary outcomes. More&#xD;
      specifically, data on self-reported parental discipline strategies, emotion regulation/coping&#xD;
      and stress will be gathered at T1 and T2. Also, parents will be asked to fill out measures of&#xD;
      children's social-emotional skills and externalizing/internalizing problems (primary&#xD;
      outcomes), as well as measures related to parenting practices, parenting stress and parental&#xD;
      ER (secondary outcomes). Both types of outcomes will be assessed at T1 and at T2, whereas&#xD;
      parents will report about the number of adverse events only at T2. Any adverse events&#xD;
      associated with the exposure to the classroom curriculum and/or parent training such as&#xD;
      deterioration of child and/or parent mental health will be monitored by the research team. If&#xD;
      such events occur, these will be reported to The Scientific Council of the Babes-Bolyai&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the SEP+ is comprised of multiple interventions, monitoring procedures will be employed&#xD;
      for all components. First, regarding the implementation of the classroom curriculum, teachers&#xD;
      will be required to fill out a self-monitoring implementation form, which will include&#xD;
      children's attendance rates, number of implemented classroom activities, and teachers' use of&#xD;
      intervention methods. In addition, teachers will be required to provide access to the&#xD;
      research team to 25% filmed classroom activities. The quality of implementation for each&#xD;
      activity by two independent raters. The teacher training will be conducted with approximately&#xD;
      12-15 participants in each group. Teachers will be required to participate in all 6 training&#xD;
      sessions. Fidelity of implementation in accordance with the facilitator's manual will be&#xD;
      conducted for half of the sessions (from sessions 2 to 5) by two independent raters based on&#xD;
      video recordings of these sessions. Checklists will contain items describing facilitators'&#xD;
      ability to implement specific methods of training, as well as their skills regarding group&#xD;
      management and ways to support teachers' use of learned strategies in delivering the&#xD;
      classroom curriculum. The parent training will also consist of 6 sessions, which will be&#xD;
      delivered to groups of 8-10 parents. For each parent training, group fidelity checks will be&#xD;
      conducted for 50% of the parent training sessions (sessions 2 to 5) by two independent raters&#xD;
      based on videotaped recordings. Similar to the teacher training, facilitators will be&#xD;
      assessed on their ability to deliver each training method according to the manual, as well as&#xD;
      their interaction and communication skills with parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 classrooms will be recruited for the purposes of the current study. Given an&#xD;
      expected rate of 15-30% dropout form pre- to post-intervention and that some parents might&#xD;
      not provide consent for children to participate, the investigators estimate that the final&#xD;
      sample will include a total of approximately 250-300 participants. A GPower a priori sample&#xD;
      size estimation for a medium effect size, a significance level of .05 and power of .80&#xD;
      suggests that 41 participants are required in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the current study will be collected online employing Google Forms and all items will&#xD;
      be marked mandatory to reduce the likelihood of missing data from each set of parent- and&#xD;
      teacher-rated questionnaires. In order to handle missing data an iterative Markov chain Monte&#xD;
      Carlo (MCMR) method will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the current study two types of analyses will be conducted: 1) for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the universal intervention (for all children in the sample), and 2) for the&#xD;
      indicated intervention levels (children who score above the cutoff (T score &gt; 67) on the&#xD;
      Externalizing Problems score on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Caregiver-Teacher Report&#xD;
      Form. For the universal intervention multi-level mixed models controlling for clustering&#xD;
      effects will be conducted to test the intervention's effectiveness and moderator effects.&#xD;
      Additionally, mediator effects will be tested employing multi-level meditation models in&#xD;
      MPlus. For the indicated intervention, mixed ANOVAs will be conducted for assessing SEP+&#xD;
      effectiveness. Moderator and mediator effects will be assessed employing Model 1 and Model 4&#xD;
      from the Process add-on for Statistical Package for Social Sciences.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in the current study will be assigned to either: 1) the intervention condition, which will receive the SEP+; or 2) the wait-list control group. A partially-randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be employed, in which schools will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group, so that all classrooms within a school will either receive the SEP+ or not. This was done in order to prevent contamination effects, which are more likely to occur when classrooms from the same school participate in the intervention and others do not.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales-2 (PKBS-2; Merrell, 2002)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline social skills at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Skills Scale from the PKBS-2 is a measure of children's social skills for parents and teachers. Both raters are required to assess the frequency of children's behaviors on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (often). The scale is comprised of subscales measuring Social Cooperation, Social Interactions, and Social Independence. Scores on each scan be obtained by summing ratings for each item. Also, a total Social Skills score can be obtained by adding scores from each subscale.</description>

    <measure>Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire (ERSQ; Mirabile, 2014)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline emotion regulation at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The ERSQ will be used as a measure of children's use of 13 regulatory strategies in response to negative emotions (sadness, anger, and fear) grouped into scales assessing adaptive (Self-soothing, Comfort-seeking, Support-seeking, Self-Directed Speech, Instrumental Coping, Information Gathering, Verbal Distraction, Self/Object Oriented Distraction) vs. maladaptive (Focus on Distressing Object, Venting, Aggression, Avoidance, Suppression) ER strategies. Parents and teachers rate children on their use of each ER strategy on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (very much). Scores are obtained as the average scores for each regulatory strategy across the 3 emotions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline externalizing/internalizing problems at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is filled out by parents who are requested to respond on a 3-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (absent) to 2 (occurs often). Responses on the Anxiety/Depression, Emotionally Reactive, Withdrawn, and Somatic Complaints will be employed for obtaining a measure of children's Internalizing Problems, whereas Aggressive Behavior and Attention Problems scores will provide a measure of Externalizing Problems. Scores for the broad-band syndrome scales are computed by adding ratings on each corresponding subscale.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline externalizing/internalizing problems at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The C-TRF evaluates teachers' perception regarding the frequency of children's Anxiety/Depression, Emotionally Reactive, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Aggressive Behaviors and Attention Problems. Responses are coded on a 3-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (absent) to 2 (occurs often). Scores are computed by adding ratings for each type of problems and obtaining a broad-band score for either Internalizing Problems or Externalizing Problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Scale (PS; Arnold et al., 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline over-reactivity and laxness at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The PS aims to assess parenting behaviors in response to children's behaviors by describing on a 7-point scale their reaction, with ratings closer to 1 suggesting more effective ways of responding, whereas ratings closer to 7 suggesting more ineffective ways of responding. Scores for the Over-reactivity and Laxness scales are computed as means.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Stress Scale (PSS; Berry &amp; Jones, 1995)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline parental stress at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PSS is an 18-item measure assessing parental stress. Responses are coded on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Parent Stress score is obtained by summing responses to all items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping with Children's Negative Emotions (CCNES; Fabes et al., 1990; Mirabile, 2015)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline coping strategies with children's negative emotions at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>CCNES contains 12 scenarios depicting emotion-eliciting situations for which parents are required to rate 7 possible reactions to their child's negative emotions, on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). Means are obtained for each of the following scales: Distress Reactions, Punitive Reactions, Expressive Encouragement, Emotion-Focused Reactions, Problem-Focused Reactions, Minimization, and Ignoring.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Parental Emotion Regulation Inventory (PERI-2; Lorber et al., 2017)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline parental emotion regulation strategies at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PERI-2 contains 23 items which describe ways in which parents respond emotionally when their children misbehave. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (I never do this) to 7 (I very often do this). Means are computed for the following scales: Discipline Reappraisal, Discipline Suppression, Discipline Capitulation, and Discipline Escape.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Coparenting Relationship Scale (CRS; Feinberg et al., 2012)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline coparenting support and undermining at 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The CRS measures parental perceptions about the extent to which they receive support from the partners on matters related to childrearing. Parents are requested to rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true of us) to 6 (very true of us). In the current study, the Coparenting Support and Coparenting Undermining will be employed.</description>
