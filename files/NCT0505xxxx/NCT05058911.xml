  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common medical condition characterized by chronic generalized&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and a series of additional somatic and psychiatric problems&#xD;
      that give rise to distress, functional impairment, and substantial societal costs. The most&#xD;
      extensively evaluated treatment for FM is traditional cognitive behavior therapy (T-CBT)&#xD;
      which typically appears to have small to moderate effects when compared to waitlist,&#xD;
      attention control, treatment as usual or other active nonpharmacological therapies.&#xD;
      Internet-delivered exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (Exp-CBT) where the patient&#xD;
      willingly and systematically engages with stimuli associated with pain and pain-related&#xD;
      distress has shown promising controlled effects versus a waiting-list but has never been&#xD;
      compared to T-CBT in a randomized controlled trial. In this randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      self-recruited adults with FM (N=260) are randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 weeks of&#xD;
      internet-delivered Exp-CBT or internet-delivered T-CBT and complete self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires to measure symptoms and therapeutic processes up to 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the relative effect of Exp-CBT and T-CBT on FM severity as modelled using&#xD;
      linear mixed models fitted on weekly Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire sum scores over the&#xD;
      treatment period, testing the hypothesis of Exp-CBT superiority based on the coefficient for&#xD;
      the time Ã— group interaction. Cost-effectiveness and mediational processes are investigated&#xD;
      in secondary analyses. The investigators expect this trial to be of notable clinical&#xD;
      significance as it will provide valuable information about the value of Exp-CBT in helping&#xD;
      patients with FM as compared to using other interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FM is a common problem with substantial negative consequences. The most widely evaluated&#xD;
      psychological treatment for FM is T-CBT which usually has small to moderate controlled&#xD;
      effects on pain, mood and functional impairment. Based on one pilot study and one&#xD;
      wailist-controlled RCT, Exp-CBT appears to have promising effects on FM but this treatment&#xD;
      has not yet been compared to an active control condition. The present study aims to compare&#xD;
      internet-delivered Exp-CBT to internet-delivered T-CBT in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Exp-CBT and T-CBT are encouraged to work with self-help texts and complete&#xD;
      regular homework exercises via a secure treatment platform. Both treatments are 10 weeks&#xD;
      long, equally exhaustive, and involve approximately the same level of therapist support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical efficacy, the investigators will also investigate cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      and mediational processes. The primary hypothesis is that Exp-CBT is significantly more&#xD;
      efficacious than T-CBT in reducing FM severity, i.e., the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FIQ) composite score indicative of symptoms and functional status, from the baseline&#xD;
      assessment to the 10-week assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The primary treatment component is exposure to stimuli (situations and activities) that give rise to pain, distress, and unwanted emotional responses. The treatment proceeds in accordance with functional analysis. Exercises are tailored for the patient so that, for example, individuals whose main coping strategy is to be overly active (i.e., persistence behavior) are encouraged to sit down and observe pain and other aversive bodily sensations as they arise. The protocol also includes regular exercises where the participant is encouraged to observe and name physical sensations without acting on them.</description>
