  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the level of distress felt by cancer patients due to the coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Researchers also want to learn if patients prefer to&#xD;
      receive supportive care (palliative care) in person or through telemedicine (visits by phone&#xD;
      or video call, such as Zoom). Information from this study may help doctors better understand&#xD;
      how COVID-19 has affected patients with advanced cancer, patients' perceptions of telehealth,&#xD;
      and may help clinicians tailor care to patients' needs during the pandemic.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess advanced cancer patients' level of distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess patients' overall preference towards palliative telemedicine vs in person visits&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess associations between patient characteristics and perceptions of overall distress&#xD;
      due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess associations between patient characteristics and their attitudes and beliefs&#xD;
      towards palliative telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the attitudes and beliefs towards palliative telemedicine between patients who&#xD;
      completed visits via video vs telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete survey over 20 minutes.&#xD;
