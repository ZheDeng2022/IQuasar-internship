  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the instant effects of direct vertabral manipulation&#xD;
      and indirect vertebral manipulation techniques on muscles mechanical properties,&#xD;
      pressure-pain threshold and joint range of motion in individuals with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      Another purpose of this study was to compare the effects of both treatment methods on the&#xD;
      parameters studied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Resolving chronic low back pain is a costly obstacle. There is a wide spectrum of treatment&#xD;
      for chronic low back pain, such as exercise training, pain training and spinal&#xD;
      manipulation.It is the recommended spinal manipulation in the short and long term in chronic&#xD;
      low back pain. Clinical Spinal manipulation is one of the most preferred methods of reducing&#xD;
      pain and disability.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A power analysis was conducted to determine the number of cases to be included in the study. In order for the study to be performed at 80% strength and with a 5% margin of error, at least 23 people from each group should be included in the study to find a difference of 30 N/m after application, in the case where the lumbal extensor November hardness is 320 N/m and the standard deviation is 74 N/m</masking_description>

    <measure>Mechanical properties measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>A MyotonPro was used to measure the mechanical properties of selected muscles. the measurements of the medial gastrocnemius and biceps femoris muscles were performed while individuals were in prone position the knees at full extension, and the ankle at neural position. The measurements of medial gastrocnemius were performed on plumped portion of the muscle at a point 70% of the lower leg length in line with the popliteal crease to the lateral malleolus. For biceps femoris muscle, measurements were performed at the middle points between tuberosity of the ischium and the head of the fibula.the mechanical properties of lumbar extensor muscle were performed while the individuals were prone position the hip and knee at full extension. For lumbar extensor muscle, the measurements were performed at the point 3 cm from the midpoint of the L3/L4 intervertebral space. The average of three consecutive measurements was recorded.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry low back pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>it measures a total of 10 different aspects, severity of pain, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, degree of pain change, social life, travel to assess the effect of low back pain on daily life activities in the patient.</description>

    <measure>Roland morris disability scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a 24-point questionnaire designed to assess the degree of functional limitation in patients with low back pain. In the survey, the answers vary from yes to no yes: 1 point, no: 0 points, and high scores indicate severe obstacle status</description>

    <measure>Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>VAS was used to measure the severity of the patient's pain. It is usually 10 cm long, horizontal or vertical; it is a line that begins with &quot;no pain&quot; and ends with &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. This line can only be a straight line, or divided into equal December, or in pain definition, the definition placed on the line can be found in words. The patient indicates the severity of his pain with a sign where he sees fit on this line. &quot;Cm&quot; was measured and recorded between the point marked with the onset of decontamination. &quot;0 'means no pain,' 5 'means moderate pain,' 10&quot; means the most severe pain encountered in life.</description>

    <measure>Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnare</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance beliefs questionnare has 16 questions and two sub-scales, physical activity and work. The physical activity section consists of 5 questions, and the work section consists of 11 questions. The survey was a Likert-type scale of 7. In the answers given to the survey, the expression I disagree with at all is given 0 points and the expression I fully agree with is given 6 points.</description>
