      The purpose of this study is to compare a smartphone-based virtual reality exposure with&#xD;
      standard relaxation training for anxiety and associated symptoms (including pain) on an&#xD;
      inpatient psychiatric unit, and whether patients find it usable and beneficial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is open only to inpatients on a specific Mayo Clinic Rochester psychiatric hospital&#xD;
      unit, the Mood Disorders Unit. Two different techniques for reducing anxiety will be tried.&#xD;
      The first time patients report anxiety, they will be asked to listen to a 15 minute audio CD&#xD;
      guiding them through relaxation strategies. The second time patients are anxious, they will&#xD;
      be given a cardboard VR goggle set and will view 15 minutes of unguided VR. Before and after&#xD;
      each session, they will fill out a short survey of anxiety and related symptoms (including&#xD;
      pain ratings) and their reaction to each technique. They will be asked to try each technique&#xD;
      at least once during your hospital stay.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of anxiety with Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS); this 0-100 scale has anchors and guidance for patients to rate their anxiety, 100 is &quot;highest anxiety/distress you have ever felt&quot;, 50 is &quot;moderate anxiety/distress; uncomfortable, but can continue to function&quot;, and 0 is &quot;no stress; totally relaxed&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in associated emotions rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, approximately 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to write up to 3 more associated emotions and rate them 0-10, 10=strongest intensity</description>
