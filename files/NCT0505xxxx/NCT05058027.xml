  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of MEDICURTAIN® (investigational&#xD;
      device) compared to commercially available GUARDIX-SG® (control device) in treatment of&#xD;
      subject who underwent total thyroidectomy for prevention of adhesion formation at 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a randomized, multi center, subject and evaluator blinded, parallel,&#xD;
      comparative and non-inferiority clinical trial study to assess the prevention of adhesion&#xD;
      formation in the subjects treated either MEDICURTAIN® or GUARDIX-SG at 6 weeks after total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was defined as abnormal findings of esophageal motility evaluated by the&#xD;
      independent third evaluator using marshmallow esophagography. The objective of this study was&#xD;
      to demonstrate the non-inferiority of investigational device versus control device for&#xD;
      adhesion formation at 6 weeks after the administration of investigational or control devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal motility score and clinical symptoms assessed by the independent third evaluator&#xD;
      using marshmallow esophagography at 6 weeks after administration of investigational device&#xD;
      were secondary outcome.&#xD;
