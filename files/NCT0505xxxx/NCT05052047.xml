  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 min walk test: Distance (meters)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, 6 min walk test was used to measure Functional capacity. It is a sub maximal exercise test which can aid in assessing functional capacity of patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, in this test we find out the maximum distance in meters which an individual covers in 6 min without any support.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak VO2max with formula</measure>
    <time_frame>4th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, Maximal oxygen uptake or capacity is the maximum rate of oxygen consumed and measured during the stress activity. Its measurement within the laboratory demonstrates a numerical value for endurance fitness full stop and this value can be used to compare individuals training with or without diseases. This tool reflects cardiopulmonary endurance in the performance of any exercise. maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is calculated by:&#xD;
Mean Peak VO2 (ml/kg/Mean) = 4.948 + 0.023 *Mean 6MWD (meters)&#xD;
6 minute walk distance (6MWD)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life scale (HRLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the baseline, It is usually administer the Health-Related Quality of Life scale verbally, reading the questions aloud and writing down respondents' answers.&#xD;
The scale consists of three modules. The Core Healthy Days module contains one item that asks respondents to rate their general health on a 5-point scale (1 = excellent; 3 = good; 5 = poor). The module also has three items that ask respondents how many days their physical health was not good, their mental health was not good, and their health interfered with their daily activities.&#xD;
It compute an unhealthy days score by adding the number of physically unhealthy and mentally unhealthy days. The maximum score is 30 unhealthy days, even if the number of unhealthy days totals more than 30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to access the quality of life; SGRQ is used for determining quality of life in COPD patients. This questionnaire is designed in 50 items to check the impact of COPD. 0 to 100 is the range of this score. Scores having higher values means more limitations</description>

    <description>Breathing exercises: 20 min/day&#xD;
Breathing Ex includes:&#xD;
• Pursed lip breathing: Sit with your back straight, inhale through your nose for 2 seconds. Purse your lips like you rae blowing on hot food and then breath out slowly, take twice as long to exhale as you took to breath in 4-5 times a day&#xD;
• Diaphragmatic breathing: Lie on your back on a flat surface, knees bent and head supported. Use pillow under knees to support your legs . breathe in slowly through your nose tighten your stomach, letting them fall inward as you exhale through your pursed lips. Practice these exercises 5-10 minutes about 3-4 times a day.&#xD;
