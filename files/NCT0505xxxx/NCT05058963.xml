      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a virtual Mantram repetition program for adults with&#xD;
      PTSD and substance use disorders. The program involves repetition of a personalized Mantram,&#xD;
      which is a word or short phrase with spiritual meaning that is frequently repeated throughout&#xD;
      the day. The program also involves slowing down thoughts and have one-pointed attention that&#xD;
      help with stress.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a virtual Mantram repetition program for adults with&#xD;
      PTSD and substance use disorders. The program involves repetition of a personalized Mantram,&#xD;
      which is a word or short phrase with spiritual meaning that is frequently repeated throughout&#xD;
      the day. The program also involves slowing down thoughts and have one-pointed attention that&#xD;
      help with stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study starts with an eligibility and baseline assessment, which involves completing a&#xD;
      series of questionnaires. Following these assessments, enrolled participants will be placed&#xD;
      into a Mantram repetition program group led by two facilitators. This group will consist of 5&#xD;
      to 8 participants who will meet virtually every week for ninety minutes over an 8-week&#xD;
      period. During this time, participants will also be asked to complete weekly self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires on their own. Additionally, at weeks 4 and 8, the participants will complete&#xD;
      assessments and questionnaires with a member of the study team. The program will end after&#xD;
      week 8. At week 12, participants will be invited to participate in a focus group to complete&#xD;
      additional assessments, as well as be asked open-ended questions assessing the impact of the&#xD;
      program on PTSD symptoms, substance use, and substance use cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the Mantram group program will take 8 weeks to complete and the assessments will&#xD;
      take approximately 12 weeks to complete. Participants will receive compensation of up to $200&#xD;
      for their participation.&#xD;
