      Nonpuerperal mastitis (NPM), mainly including Plasma cell mastitis (PCM) and Granulomatous&#xD;
      mastitis (GM), which clinical presentation is an accessible and painful breast mass&#xD;
      accompanied by skin redness and swelling, nipple retraction and fistula formation . Much&#xD;
      progress has been made in exploring the etiology and pathogenesis of NPM, while the exact&#xD;
      etiology remains unknown, NPM is thought to arise from interactions between genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility factors, epigenetic effects, and various environmental factors. While&#xD;
      microbiota as an environment factor to some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases accept&#xD;
      widespread attention, if gut microbiota also as a risk factor for NPM, it is worthy to be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      NPM is common in young women of reproductive age with a history of lactation and childbearing&#xD;
      . The main clinical presentation is an accessible and painful breast mass accompanied by skin&#xD;
      redness and swelling, nipple retraction and fistula formation&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The imaging of NPM is not specific, with NPM mimicking breast cancer in imaging . NPM&#xD;
      etiology is associated with several factors, such as autoimmunity, bacterial infections ,&#xD;
      estrogen and progesterone imbalance , and hyperprolactinemia . In recent years, NPM has&#xD;
      become a common benign breast disease, especially in the Mediterranean region and developing&#xD;
      countries in Asia, such as China . Currently, the associations between bacterial infections&#xD;
      and NPM are among the important issues attracting research interest. This study tried to&#xD;
      reveal the roles of gut microbiota in NPM. Further understanding of the roles of gut&#xD;
      microbiota in this disease may lead to the development of methods for personalized therapy.&#xD;
