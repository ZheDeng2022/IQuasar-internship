      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in combination with bortezomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In the study, 60&#xD;
      patients will be recruited into three dose groups. All patients will receive the treatment&#xD;
      for the planned 8 cycles(28 days per cycle）until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      drug-related adverse events&#xD;
