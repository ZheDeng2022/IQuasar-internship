  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to validate a novel clinical care strategy based on a electronic clinical&#xD;
      decision support algorithm (CDSA) combined with point of care rapid diagnostic tests by&#xD;
      evaluating its impact on antibiotic prescription and clinical outcome of children and&#xD;
      adolescent presenting at primary healthcare facilities with non-severe acute illness compared&#xD;
      to routine practice. The trial also aims to assess the usability of the CDSA strategy. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in primary healthcare facilities across different epidemiological&#xD;
      regions of Senegal.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Superiority of the CDSA strategy when compared to routine practice in terms of antibiotic prescription at Day 0</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured as point estimates of the percent change of antibiotic prescription at Day 0 in the intervention arm, as compared to the control arm and to site-specific historical data. This measure aims to assess rational use of antibiotics using the CDSA strategy compared to routine practice.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic performance of the dengue rapid diagnostic test (RDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The performance of the dengue RDT used in health facilities will be assessed against reference standards.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of risk factors associated with viral and bacterial infections</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure aims to better characterize viral and bacterial infections in children and adolescents presenting with acute illness in these settings and improve the next version of the algorithm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Usability of the CDSA strategy</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will determine the ease of use of the CDSA strategy. This will be assessed through questionnaires administered to end users at the beginning and end of participant inclusion; the assessment of data completeness comparing historical collected-on-paper to study data; and passive collection of the platform performance indicators autogenerated by the platform.</description>
