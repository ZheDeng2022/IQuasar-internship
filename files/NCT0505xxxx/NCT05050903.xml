  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bulk of the morbidity and mortality related to asthma is during periods of acutely&#xD;
      increased symptomatology called 'exacerbations'. Roughly half of asthma sufferers experience&#xD;
      such an exacerbation each year. Most of these events are triggered by viral infections,&#xD;
      usually the common cold virus (rhinovirus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key part of the body's defence against viral infections is to produce antiviral proteins&#xD;
      called 'interferons', which have a myriad of effects to stop viruses. Previous work on cells&#xD;
      taken from volunteers with asthma and healthy controls and infected with rhinovirus in the&#xD;
      lab suggests interferon production is impaired in asthma. However when human volunteers with&#xD;
      asthma are infected with rhinovirus, high levels of interferon are found a few days later -&#xD;
      along with high numbers of virus. Whether the high virus numbers are the result of an&#xD;
      initially weak interferon response, with subsequently unchecked viral replication leading to&#xD;
      exaggerated interferon levels, is unknown as no one has measured interferons early in&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By infecting volunteers with asthma and healthy controls with rhinovirus at a known time,&#xD;
      only done in a handful of centres worldwide, we will be able to measure interferons within&#xD;
      hours of infection and well before symptoms develop.&#xD;
