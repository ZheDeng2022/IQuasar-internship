  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were used as the research object to&#xD;
      explore the effectiveness and safety of idarubicin hepatic artery perfusion combined with&#xD;
      lipiodol embolization, and to preliminarily explore the possibility of idarubicin in the&#xD;
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Provide evidence-based medicine for the discovery of&#xD;
      better TACE combined chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      China is a country with a high incidence of liver cancer, the annual incidence of nearly 50%&#xD;
      of the world. At present, transcatheter Arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has become one of&#xD;
      the main treatment methods for primary liver cancer and liver metastasis, and has been&#xD;
      recognized as the first choice for inoperable primary liver cancer. In addition, it has also&#xD;
      been applied in the treatment of resectable liver cancer, liver cancer with tumor embolus and&#xD;
      liver metastasis, which is safe and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idarubicin is a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor that promotes DNA strand breakage, trapping&#xD;
      cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, DNA cleavage, and cell apoptosis. At the same time,&#xD;
      it can be inserted between the DNA base pairs and create freedom. Preclinical studies have&#xD;
      shown that Idarubicin has superior antitumor activity than epirubicin, especially against&#xD;
      SUN-449 human hepatoma cells. In recent years, foreign scholars have conducted a series of&#xD;
      explorations in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with Idarubicin TACE, and have&#xD;
      obtained positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of idarubicin lipiodol emulsion&#xD;
      hepatic artery chemoembolization in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, in order to&#xD;
      provide evidence-based medical evidence for the discovery of a better TACE treatment regimen&#xD;
      for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
