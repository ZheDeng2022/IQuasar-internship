  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use the caring chatbot developed by the Taipei University of Technology team&#xD;
      to provide care for participants and use robots to talk to them to collect daily changes in&#xD;
      mood, sleep, and activities, and analyze the factors that affect the physical and mental&#xD;
      health of the elderly.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of anxiety and depression in middle-aged and elderly people is quite high.&#xD;
      Among the risk factors for illness, &quot;loneliness&quot; is closely related to the physical and&#xD;
      mental health of the elderly: the higher the loneliness of the elderly, the more likely to&#xD;
      develop unhealthy lifestyle habits and emotional symptoms such as depression and anxiety.&#xD;
      Depression and anxiety are often comorbid, and the diagnoses of the two groups have many&#xD;
      symptoms that overlap each other. Emotional symptoms that have not been effectively treated&#xD;
      have a great impact on the quality of life, and the drug treatment of emotional disorders in&#xD;
      the elderly is more difficult. In addition to medication, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is&#xD;
      also conducive to the control of emotional disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information technology has been used in supplementary medical care and maintenance of&#xD;
      physical and mental health for decades. However, reviewing the literature, there is less&#xD;
      research on applications developed in cooperation between the information field and the field&#xD;
      of psychiatric medical care, and there are no applications developed for the mental health of&#xD;
      middle-aged and elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use the caring chatbot developed by the National Taipei University of&#xD;
      Technology team to provide care for the participants enrolled from the psychiatric outpatient&#xD;
      department, and use the chatbot to talk to them to collect daily changes in mood, sleep, and&#xD;
      activities, and analyze the factors that affect the mental health of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research anticipates the following goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. With the chatbot developed, it provides care for subjects every day and collects their&#xD;
           daily changes in mood, sleep, and activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze the relationship between robot interaction and emotional changes, and evaluate&#xD;
           the impact of chatbot intervention on the health behavior of the case.&#xD;

    <description>Satisfacation (How satisfied were you with Chatbot?), usability (How easy was talking to Chatbot?), continue (How much would you like to continue working with Chatbot?) and adherence (How likely is it that you will follow Chatbot's advice?) were measured by single items on seven-point Likert scales (with 1= &quot;not at all&quot; and 7=&quot;very much&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline &quot;loneliness&quot; measured by UCLA Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before and at the end of one-month-intervention of the caring chatbot</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA Loneliness Scale (version 3) is a 20-item measure that assesses how often a person feels disconnected from others. Using a 4-point rating scale (1= never; 4 = always), participants answer 20 questions, and researchers later reverse-code the positively worded items so that high values mean more loneliness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline &quot;depression&quot; measured by Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and at the end of one-month-intervention of the caring chatbot</time_frame>
    <description>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is designed for the older population. A Short Form GDS consisting of 15 questions. Of the 15 items, 10 indicated the presence of depression when answered positively, while the rest indicated depression when answered negatively. Scores of 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; 12-15 indicate severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline &quot;anxiety&quot; measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale- Anxiety subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>before and at the end of one-month-intervention of the caring chatbot</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is developed for people with physical illnesses. This scale includes a total of 14 questions. There are 7 questions about anxiety and depression, each with a 4-point scoring method (0-3 points). The higher the total score, the greater the anxiety or the greater the depression. Due to the high overlap between the topics of the depression subscale and the GDS, this study only uses the anxiety subscale.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline &quot;quality of life&quot; measured by Short Form Quality Life Sale (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and at the end of one-month-intervention of the caring chatbot</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form Quality Life Sale (SF-12) is the most commonly used questionnaire in the study of the quality of life of the elderly, with a total score ranging from 13~43. A higher score reflects a better life quality.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline &quot;physical activity&quot; measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire Self-Administered Short Version (IPAQ-SS)</measure>
    <time_frame>before and at the end of one-month-intervention of the caring chatbot</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Self-Administered Short Version (IPAQ-SS) measures the physical activity of the participant in the past seven days by self-filled method. The questionnaire is consisted of four domains: (1)during transportation, (2) at work, (3) during household and gardening tasks and (4) during leisure time, including exercise and sport participation. In each of the four domains the number of days per week and time per day spent in both moderate and vigorous activity are recorded.</description>
