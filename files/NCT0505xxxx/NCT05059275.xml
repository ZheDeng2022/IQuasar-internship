  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of sacral Tarlov cysts (TCs) is still unclear. In this study, histological&#xD;
      techniques were used to clarify the anatomical membranous layers of TCs and further explore&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of them.Although many approaches have been used to treat TCs, there is no&#xD;
      consensus on the optimal treatment. Microsurgery is now increasingly recommended as the&#xD;
      preferred treatment with the best long-term outcomes.However, some authors have proposed the&#xD;
      opposite view because current microsurgical techniques fail to completely close the ostium&#xD;
      between the cyst and subarachnoid space.Consequently, could lead to leakage of cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid, pseudomeningocele , or a high frequency of cysts recurrence, which are the main&#xD;
      reasons for surgical failure and also the biggest scruple when microsurgery is chosen.&#xD;
      Herein, we present a new method of cyst separation and ostium closure, and evaluate its&#xD;
      clinical reliability and effectiveness for surgical treatment of Tarlov cysts through the&#xD;
      prospective study.&#xD;

      1. Part of the intact cyst wall was removed under the microscope and fixed in 10% formalin&#xD;
           solution. After dehydration and paraffin embedding, tissue sections (thickness: 6μm)&#xD;
           were prepared and dewaxed to water. Sirius red stain drops were stained for 1 hour. The&#xD;
           staining liquid on the surface of the slices was removed after a little flushing with&#xD;
           water. The slices were dehydrated and transparent, sealed with neutral gum, and the&#xD;
           membranous layers of the capsule walls were observed under a microscope.It has been&#xD;
           observed in previous surgeries that all cysts were incompressible and remained filled&#xD;
           after opening the distal wall of the cyst to release cerebrospinal fluid（CSF). These&#xD;
           findings lent support for the proposed valve mechanism as the etiology of the entity&#xD;
           becoming symptomatic. In this study, the cyst was observed in the following way: the&#xD;
           dural sac was opened to expose the ostium to observe whether the cystic fluid would&#xD;
           reverse outflow and shrink the cyst; In this way, the existence of a &quot;one-way valve&quot; can&#xD;
           be further verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified microsurgical method is used to treat patients who met the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
           To evaluate the surgical effect, we record and statistically compare the&#xD;
           patients'outcomes before surgery and at the postoperative follow-up, which include the&#xD;
           following: 1) Demographic data: sex, age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), etc.;&#xD;
           2) clinical manifestations: symptoms and their features, complications, and long-term&#xD;
           recovery; 3) Imaging findings: maximum diameter, location, shape, number, intracapsular&#xD;
           nerve root condition, and postoperative outcome of TCs. 4) Surgical characteristics:&#xD;
           operative process and time, intraoperative blood loss, assistive technologies, etc.; 5)&#xD;
           Neurologic assessment using the following tools: The visual analogue scale (VAS),&#xD;
           Scoring System for the Clinical Evaluation of Patients with Spinal Processes&#xD;
           (hereinafter referred to as SCPS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Japanese Orthopedic&#xD;
           Association Scores 29 (JOA), and modified evaluation criteria for the efficacy of lumbar&#xD;
           function (MacNab).All patients are required to return for MRI review and neurofunctional&#xD;
           assessment at 3 and 12 months postoperatively, followed by annual examinations&#xD;
           thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>An ostium at the end of the site where the nerve root enters the dural sac, from which CSF could flow continuously along the subarachnoid space, was identified An appropriate amount of autologous soft adipose tissue was removed under the skin of the incision or deep in the upper part of the buttock (Iliac spine incision, for less subcutaneous fat patients). It was then trimmed to resemble a gourd or dumbbell, with a relatively small middle section and two relatively large end sections. Trimmed graft was inserted into the neck of the sac and subarachnoid space below the dural sac so that it plugs the ostium inside and outside After filling the graft, Prolene 6-0 was used to continuously suture and close the ostium and dural sac starting from the lower part of the nerve root sheath and the ostium.The residual cyst cavity filled with autologous fat and gelatin sponge</description>
