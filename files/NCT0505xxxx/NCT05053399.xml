    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label, clinical study of the&#xD;
      investigational TECNIS Symfony® Toric IOL. The study will enroll up to 100 subjects from a&#xD;
      single investigative site in China. The subjects will be followed for 12-months&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a cataract in one or both eyes, with planned phacoemulsification with intraocular&#xD;
             lens implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have estimated postoperative visual acuity of at least 20/25 Snellen (0.8 decimal) in&#xD;
             the eye to be implanted per surgeon estimate \&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Regular corneal astigmatism and predicted postoperative residual astigmatism of less&#xD;
             than 1.00 D after implantation with a toric intraocular in the study eye(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to understand the purpose&#xD;
             of the examination procedures and comply with postoperative visits that are required&#xD;
             by the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Voluntary participation indicated by the study informed consent form (ICF) signed by&#xD;
             the patient or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent participation or participation in any other clinical study within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to the preoperative visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ocular disease (other than cataract) that may significantly affect postoperative&#xD;
             vision, such as visually significant keratopathy, macular lesions, diabetic&#xD;
             retinopathy, chronic or severe uveitis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior corneal refractive (LASIK, LASEK, RK, PRK, etc.) or intraocular surgery,&#xD;
             including prophylactic peripheral iridotomies and peripheral laser retinal repairs&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Irregular corneal astigmatism&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to achieve keratometric stability for contact lens wearers (as defined in&#xD;
             Section 10.3 Preoperative Procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g., macular degeneration or&#xD;
             other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause visual acuity loss to a level&#xD;
             worse than 20/30 Snellen (0.67 decimal) during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including&#xD;
             capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration or tilt, such as&#xD;
             pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision, confound the outcome or&#xD;
             increase the risk to the subject (e.g., poor dilation or a lack of adequate iris&#xD;
             structure to perform standard cataract surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Acute, chronic, or uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease or illness that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would increase the operative risk or confound the&#xD;
             outcome(s) of the study (e.g., immunocompromised, connective tissue disease, suspected&#xD;
             glaucoma, glaucomatous changes in the fundus or visual field, ocular inflammation,&#xD;
             etc.). Note: controlled ocular hypertension without glaucomatous changes (optic nerve&#xD;
             cupping and visual field loss) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Planned monovision correction (one eye designated for near correction).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Severe or unstable systemic disease that may affect the heart, liver, kidney, lung,&#xD;
             endocrine (including thyroid insufficiency), blood, or psychoneurological dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any other systemic or ocular disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             affect the patient's eligibility for the study, affect visual acuity or may require&#xD;
             surgical intervention during the course of the study (e.g., macular degeneration,&#xD;
             cystoid macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, etc.).&#xD;
