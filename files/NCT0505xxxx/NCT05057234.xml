  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for molecular characterization of tumors is tissue based next&#xD;
      generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Liquid biopsies (ie blood) are of increasing interest and&#xD;
      have been implemented as a diagnostic tool in some countries. This study compares tissue&#xD;
      based and liquid based testing to evaluate the detection rate and cost consequence of using&#xD;
      this new tool in BC.&#xD;

      Part A - Simultaneous - Patients will be randomized 1:1 to FoundationOne liquid CDx or no&#xD;
      additional testing simultaneously at initiation of request for standard based tissue based&#xD;
      next generation sequencing (NGS) panel testing. The objective of Part A is to evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-consequence of the liquid ctDNA biopsy technology, FoundationOne liquid CDx, for first&#xD;
      line molecular characterization of advanced colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor&#xD;
      (GIST), melanoma, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer with simultaneous&#xD;
      molecular characterization by tissue based NGS panel, at BC Cancer's Vancouver Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Sequential - Patients will undergo standard tissue based NGS panel testing and if&#xD;
      there are no somatic tier 1 variant of strong clinical significance identified the patients&#xD;
      will then be eligible for FoundationOne liquid CDx. The objective of Part B is to determine&#xD;
      the benefit of a sequential approach with molecular characterization by tissue based NGS&#xD;
      panel testing followed by liquid based FoundationOne liquid CDx for patients who do not have&#xD;
      an actionable tissue based oncogenic driver, across British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development and access to next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on tumour tissue&#xD;
      and blood allows the ability to profile the genomic landscape of the tumour within reasonable&#xD;
      turn-around times and costs. The promise of precision oncology is the ability to 'match the&#xD;
      right drug to the right patient at the right time'. Despite considerable excitement at the&#xD;
      prospect of genome-informed therapy to improve oncologic outcomes, there has been little&#xD;
      empirical assessment of its benefit from an overall population perspective and its true&#xD;
      impact on cancer care delivery in 'real-world' scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the enthusiasm for liquid biopsies has increased, the understanding of the cost&#xD;
      implications lags behind. We propose to assess the true clinical impact on both individual&#xD;
      patients and on a population-based cancer system of precision oncology via ctDNA analyses in&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors in a real-world scenario.&#xD;
