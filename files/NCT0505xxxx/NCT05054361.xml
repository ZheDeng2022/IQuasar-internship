    <textblock>
      To investigate in a prospective way changes in Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells&#xD;
      frequency, phenotype and function in link with the gut microbiota, gut integrity and the&#xD;
      presence of Coxsackie virus B in two cohorts of pediatric patients: patients with a high&#xD;
      genetic risk of type 1 diabetes and pediatric patients with recently diagnosed T1D by&#xD;
      comparison with control subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure blood MAIT cells frequency, phenotype and function in the three cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze gut microbiota and the presence of Coxsackie B enterovirus (CVB) and their&#xD;
           impact on MAIT cell function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate gut integrity and analyze the gut mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To integrate all the data obtained with T1D development and evolution&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects: Multi study. Subjects will be included in the pediatric diabetes and endocrinology&#xD;
      unit in Necker Sick children hospital and in the pediatric unit of ANTONY hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent-onset (RO) n=40: New onset patients will be included shortly after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At risk (AR) cohort n=70: Routinely screened siblings of T1D patients previously tested&#xD;
           positive for HLA DR3 and DR4 will be asked to be a part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control (C) cohort (n=50): Control subjects will be patients consulting at Necker&#xD;
           Hospital for endocrine testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control for Endoscopy (CE) n= 20: patients consulting at Necker Hospital or at Antony&#xD;
           hospital for UGI endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIT cell analysis: For FACS analysis, MAIT cells will be identified as CD3+ CD4- CD161high&#xD;
      Vα7.2+ T cells. Surface markers will be analyzed to determine their activation status (CD25,&#xD;
      CD69, CD44), their exhaustion (PD1, KLRG1, TIM3), their migration capacity (CCR6), and their&#xD;
      proliferation and survival will be analyzed by Ki67 and BCL2 expression. Cytokine production&#xD;
      will be assessed after PMA-ionomycin activation, followed by intracytoplasmic staining with&#xD;
      antibodies against IL-2, IFN-γ TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17 and granzyme B. To&#xD;
      determine the capacity of MAIT cells to response to TCR stimulation (exhaustion), in vitro&#xD;
      stimulation will be performed in the presence of specific bacterial ligands. Activation&#xD;
      marker expression will be analyzed by FACS and cytokines released in the supernatant by&#xD;
      Cytometry based assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota analysis: Stool samples are collected and directly kept under anaerobic&#xD;
      condition. Within an hour the samples are processed: one fraction is aliquoted and frozen at&#xD;
      -80°C and another fraction is used to prepared fecal supernatant for the bioassay of MAIT&#xD;
      ligands, aliquoted and frozen. Bioassay to measure the presence of MAIT cell ligands by&#xD;
      bioassays using WT3 cell line as well as plate bound MR117. 16S sequencing of all samples and&#xD;
      according to the results obtained with the bioassay and 16S, 10 samples will be selected for&#xD;
      metagenomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coxsackie virus B (CVB) infection status: Specific antibodies against coxsackie virus B and&#xD;
      CVB specific-qPCR measurement in gut microbiota samples will be performed in all patients of&#xD;
      the three cohorts, and analysis of the gut mucosa by q-PCR and immunochemistry will be&#xD;
      performed on a subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut integrity: the investigators will assess the permeability of the intestine using the&#xD;
      Lactulose-Mannitol test in a sub sample of RO, RD and AR groups (&gt; 5 years of age, n=20). In&#xD;
      brief after an overnight fast, the patients will drink 50 ml solution of 5 g lactulose and 2&#xD;
      g mannitol. Urine will be collected during before and 5 hours after ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut mucosa analysis: In a subset of patients (without celiac disease as determined by the&#xD;
      dosage of antibodies against transglutaminase), duodenal biopsies will be obtained during an&#xD;
      IUG endoscopy . Duodenal biopsy will be performed in RD subjects older than 8 years of age&#xD;
      and in CE subjects older than 4 years of age. These biopsies will be analyzed by qPCR for the&#xD;
      expression of key epithelial molecules such as the fucosyl transferase 2 (fut2), tight&#xD;
      junction proteins (occludin, claudin4), antimicrobiol peptides (Reg3, LL37) and mucus&#xD;
      component (mucin 2). Immune cells function will also be assessed by q-PCR for key&#xD;
      cytokines/molecules such as IL-23, IL-17, IL-22, Foxp3, IL-10, TGFb and CVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous study, the sample size should allow statistical differences between AR, RO&#xD;
      and C groups. The investigators anticipate to observe blood MAIT cell abnormalities in RO&#xD;
      patients and some at risk children after seroconversion but before diabetes onset. This new&#xD;
      data will strengthen our predictive model (see preliminary data). Since MAIT cells recognize&#xD;
      bacterial ligand we hypothesize that MAIT cells alteration could occur in parallel with&#xD;
      microbiota changes and/or CVB infection. The investigators anticipate observing gut mucosa&#xD;
      abnormalities in RO children and the severity of these abnormalities may correlate with the&#xD;
      level of MAIT cells defect and the presence of CVB infection. The investigators expect to&#xD;
      demonstrate that MAIT cells represent a new biomarker of progression toward diabetes as well&#xD;
      as a functional immune marker of the aggressiveness of the autoimmune disease. As such this&#xD;
      study could determine the accurate therapeutic window for preventive strategies based on MAIT&#xD;
      cells manipulation.&#xD;
