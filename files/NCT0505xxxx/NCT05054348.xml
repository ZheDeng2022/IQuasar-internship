      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of IO-108 as monotherapy&#xD;
      and in combination with pembrolizumab, in adult subjects with advanced relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors to estimate the maxium tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD)&#xD;
