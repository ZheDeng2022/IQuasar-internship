      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced&#xD;
      huCART-meso cells when given in combination with VCN-01 in a 3+3 dose (de)escalation design&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (N = 3-6): will receive VCN-01 as a single IV infusion of 3.3x1012 vp on Day 0,&#xD;
           followed by a single dose of 5x107 huCART-meso cells on Day 14 via IV infusion. This&#xD;
           cohort will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs, Cohort 1 will be expanded to enroll an additional 3&#xD;
                evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects, the study will advance to Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (N = 3-6): will receive VCN-01 as a single IV infusion of 1x1013 vp on Day 0&#xD;
           followed by a single dose of 5x107 cells huCART-meso cells on Day 14 via IV infusion.&#xD;
           This cohort will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If 0 DLT/3 subjects or 1 DLT/3 subjects occurs, Cohort 2 will be expanded to enroll&#xD;
                an additional 3 evaluable subjects. If 0 DLT/6 subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects occurs,&#xD;
                this dose combination will be defined as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If 2 DLTs occur at any time, enrollment in this Cohort will be stopped. If less&#xD;
                than 6 subjects were infused in Cohort 1 prior to Cohort 2 escalation, an&#xD;
                additional 3 evaluable subjects will be infused at the Cohort 1 dose level to&#xD;
                further demonstrate safety and to confirm Cohort 1 as the RP2D (with 0 DLT/6&#xD;
                subjects or 1 DLT/6 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that 2 DLTs occur in Cohort 1, then enrollment in Cohort 1 will be stopped and&#xD;
      Cohort -1 will be opened for evaluation. Cohort -1 will evaluate a different sequence of&#xD;
      administration for these two investigational products at the same dose level used in Cohort&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Cohort -1 (N = up to 6): will receive a single dose of 5x107 huCART-meso cells via IV&#xD;
      infusions on Day 0 followed by VCN-01 as a single infusion of 3.3x1012 vp on Day 10. Up to 6&#xD;
      subjects will be infused in Cohort -1 unless &gt; 1 DLTs are observed at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Day 0 infusions of the first two subjects in each cohort will be staggered by at least 42&#xD;
      days from the prior subject's 1st infusion (huCART-meso or VCN-01; depending on the cohort&#xD;
      assignment), to allow for the assessment of DLTs and a formal decision regarding cohort&#xD;
      progression, expansion, or de-escalation. Subsequent subject infusions within that cohort&#xD;
      will be staggered by at least 14 days from the preceding subject's second infusion. Formal&#xD;
      DLT assessments will be performed by the Clinical PI and Sponsor Medical Director in&#xD;
      accordance with the definition provided in the protocol.&#xD;
