    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the respiratory therapy method based on&#xD;
      short-term intermittent exposures to hypoxia and hyperoxia (ReOxy therapy) on the pain&#xD;
      intensity, restoration of the lumbar range of motion, physical capacity, disability, mental&#xD;
      and vegetative status in Chronic Low Back Pain patients with Multiple Chronic Conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with chronic non-specific low&#xD;
      back pain with multiple chronic conditions. Comorbidity constitutes a serious challenge for&#xD;
      rehabilitative medicine - significantly reduces the patients' quality of life and restoration&#xD;
      of the working capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined&#xD;
      non-medicinal rehabilitation programe which include a course of ReOxy- therapy and&#xD;
      conventional therapy back pain treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 patients will be randomly allocated to three treatment groups: experimental (&quot;hypoxic&#xD;
      group&quot; - ReOxy therapy + conventional therapy back pain treatment), placebo (&quot;sham hypoxic&#xD;
      group&quot;- sham- ReOxy therapy + conventional therapy back pain treatment) and control (only&#xD;
      conventional therapy back pain treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (2 weeks) and at 1&#xD;
      month after randomization. The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principles and the between-group differences will be calculated by using mixed linear models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of interest are pain intensity, lumbar range of motion function, general&#xD;
      physical and mental status.&#xD;

    <description>Will be evaluated through Schober test (positive/negative). The examiner places one finger 5cm below the mark pproximately at the level of L5 and another finger at about 10cm above this mark. The patient is then instructed to touch his toes. If the increase in distance between the two fingers on the patients spine is less than 5cm then this is indicative of a limitation of lumbar flexion.</description>

    <intervention_name>ReOxy</intervention_name>
    <description>ReOxy therapy is a protocol which employs passive (the patient is at rest), short (up to 10 min) mild normobaric hypoxic exposures alternated with similar duration intervals of breathing hyperoxia (up to 5 min). The gas mixtures are supplied to a patient via facial mask on continued measuring of oxygenation status of the patients, lasting about 45 min in total per treatment session.&#xD;
The hypoxic load will be individually adjusted, based on the results of a preliminary hypoxic test. The patient inhales air with low oxygen content (10-14%) at atmospheric pressure in a continuous mode through a mask withing 10-min.&#xD;
During the ReOxy - treatment session, the software automatically adjusts the gas mixture switching, based on changes in physiological parameters (blood oxygen saturation and heart rate) in response to hypoxic and hyperoxic impact (biofeedback control).</description>
