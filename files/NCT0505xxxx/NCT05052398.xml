      Proof-of-concept study to assess the effects of gonyautoxins (PSP NEURO SERUM) on safety and&#xD;
      tactile sensitivity on patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). This&#xD;
      is a multicenter, prospective proof-of-concept study in patients with solid tumors affected&#xD;
      by CIPN. The study will be divided into two parts: Part 1 will assess the activity and&#xD;
      tolerability of PSP NEURO SERUM and part 2 consists of a randomized cohort that will compare&#xD;
      the activity of PSP NEURO SERUM vs placebo. Part 2 will depend on the results of part 1. If&#xD;
      there are less than 8 responses in part 1, the study will be interrupted, and it will not be&#xD;
      recommended to proceed with part 2. The detailed description of the study will be given only&#xD;
      for part 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, prospective proof-of-concept study in patients with solid tumors who developed&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in upper limbs, equal or greater than grade&#xD;
      2, according to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0. Patients must have been treated with cytotoxic agents&#xD;
      known to cause CIPN in neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative setting. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to assess the effects of gonyautoxins (PSP NEURO SERUM) on tactile sensitivity and safety on&#xD;
      patients with CIPN. The study will be divided into two parts, 1 and 2 and the investigational&#xD;
      treatment will have a maximum duration of 4 weeks (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a two-stage (stage 1 and stage 2), two-cohort (C1 and C2), open-label study where&#xD;
      38 pts with G&gt;2 CIPN secondary to taxanes (C1) and other anti-neoplastic drugs (C2) will&#xD;
      receive PSP NEURO SERUM thrice a day for 28 days. Twelve patients will be evaluated in stage&#xD;
      1, expecting a 20% response (2/12) in each cohort to proceed to stage 2. Additional 7&#xD;
      patients will be recruited to stage, expecting 4/19 response in each cohort. If the number of&#xD;
      responses is not met in a specific cohort, recruitment will be halted. The transition to the&#xD;
      randomized part 2 will be determined by the efficacy in part 1 (stratified analysis of C1 and&#xD;
      C2 or overall population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Part 1 is to evaluate response of the tactile sensation as assessed&#xD;
      by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and to evaluate safety and toxicity (type,&#xD;
      frequency, grade and causality of adverse effects) of PSP NEURO SERUM according to NCI-CTCAE&#xD;
      v5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of Part 1 are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the improvement of overall neurological examination as assessed by the clinical&#xD;
           version of Total Neuropathy Score (TNSc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the improvement of manipulative dexterity and agility as assessed by the&#xD;
           nine-hole pegboard test (NHPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the improvement in patient reported symptoms as assessed by the Patient&#xD;
           Neuropathy Questionnaire (PNQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the improvement of quality of life by using the Portuguese version of the&#xD;
           30-item European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life&#xD;
           Questionnaire (EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)) version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-treatment / Baseline Assessments (D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. D7 (± 1 day) - Assessments during Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. D14 (± 1 day) - Assessments during Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. D21 (± 1 day) - Assessments during Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. End of Treatment (D28 + 3 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Safety Follow-up Visit (30 ± 7 days from the last dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient will have responded to the CIPN in the study if there is a documented improvement&#xD;
      of 30% (two sizes of evaluator) and / or normalization of the baseline pretreatment&#xD;
      assessment as assessed by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. A patient will have&#xD;
      progressed CIPN in the study if there is a documented worsening in tactile sensation assessed&#xD;
      by the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Worse tactile sensation is defined as the change&#xD;
      in one (1) size of the monofilament evaluator.&#xD;
