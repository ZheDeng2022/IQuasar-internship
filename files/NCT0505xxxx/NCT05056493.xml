  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement a new mobile application ('app') called Caremap to improve care&#xD;
      coordination for patients with complex health needs. The goal is to pilot test the mobile app&#xD;
      with patients/families and clinic doctors to gather input on how well the app works and how&#xD;
      to make it better. Investigators plan to enroll up to 40 participants from Duke University&#xD;
      for this study. The study is sponsored by Duke's Institute for Health Innovation.&#xD;

This process is called a &quot;digital prescription&quot; of the app and will be tracked as a marker of app adoption by providers.</description>

    <description>The Caremap app is intended for organizing and tracking patient-reported health insights over time and sharing those trends and patient-centered goals with their providers, not for urgent/emergent clinical communication. Information shared with providers through the app will be used for clinical care at the discretion of their provider. Use of the app to share information and health insights will not replace usual, existing channels for patient-provider communication (e.g., MyChart, phone calls, email, pager, etc.).</description>
