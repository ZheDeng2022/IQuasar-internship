    <textblock>
      This uncontrolled feasibility pilot study explores the feasibility of a 10 week, 8-module,&#xD;
      therapist-assisted, internet-delivered treatment program, &quot;SpilleFri&quot;, for patients with&#xD;
      Pathological Gambling. The study includes 25-30 participants aged 18-60 fulfilling diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for Pathological Gambling (ICD-10). The focus of the feasibility trial is evaluation&#xD;
      of treatment response, treatment satisfaction, program utility, recruitment and retention&#xD;
      rates, data completion rates, and time requirement. The primary feasibility criterion is 60 %&#xD;
      of participants included in the study completing the treatment program.&#xD;

      &quot;SpilleFri&quot; - an Internet-delivered Treatment for Patients with Pathological Gambling. A&#xD;
      Feasibility Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lisbeth Frostholm &amp; Anna Stenbro&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this uncontrolled pilot study is to test the feasibility of a future RCT by&#xD;
      exploring the feasibility of an internet-delivered treatment program, &quot;SpilleFri&quot;, for&#xD;
      patients with Pathological Gambling. The focus of the feasibility trial is evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment response, treatment satisfaction, program utility, recruitment and retention rates,&#xD;
      data completion rates, and time requirement. The primary feasibility criterion is an a priori&#xD;
      defined change in patient-rated gambling problems from before to after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as an uncontrolled, single-arm, single-center feasibility pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 25-30 participants included from September 2021 to March 2022. The&#xD;
      participants are recruited from The Research Clinic on Gambling Disorder, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital, Denmark. Patients with Pathological Gambling are screened for eligibility by the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria below. They undergo thorough diagnostic assessment by an authorized&#xD;
      psychologist including diagnostic interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;SpilleFri&quot; is a newly developed internet-delivered therapist-assisted treatment program for&#xD;
      patients with Pathological Gambling. The 8 modules contain text, video files with&#xD;
      psychoeducation, guided exercises, and videos with former patients. During a period of 10&#xD;
      weeks, patients are guided through the program modules assisted by a trained psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible and willing to participate, patients are included in the pilot study and assigned&#xD;
      to a therapist (a trained psychologist from The Research Clinic on Gambling Disorder).&#xD;
      Patients are contacted by telephone by the therapist and guided to login to the program&#xD;
      platform and initiate treatment. The therapist follows the patient through the 8 treatment&#xD;
      modules and provides guidance when needed. Patients and therapists primarily communicate&#xD;
      through asynchronously written messages. If deemed necessary by the therapist, up to four&#xD;
      consultations (telephone-/video-based or with physical attendance at the clinic) may be&#xD;
      offered to enhance patient motivation and/or treatment adherence and effect. Treatment&#xD;
      duration is 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-rated outcome measures are collected through a web-based program at the time of&#xD;
      screening (before inclusion) (T1), before treatment (T2), and at end of treatment (T3).&#xD;
      Between 6 and 12 patients will be interviewed during and post treatment to assess patient&#xD;
      experience and satisfaction with the treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician ratings are collected at the time of diagnostic assessment and at end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements also include logged data from the &quot;SpilleFri&quot;-treatment internet program, e.g.&#xD;
      regarding patient activity in the program and number of messages to/from therapist pr.&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and retention rates, time requirements and data completeness as measured by&#xD;
           the rate of eligible patients willing to participate, the rate of included patients&#xD;
           completing the treatment program (defined as completion of at least 5 modules),&#xD;
           therapists' time spent per patient, and the rate of treatment completers providing full&#xD;
           data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients' impression of treatment effect as measured by the clinical global improvement&#xD;
           scale (CGI_p)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients' treatment satisfaction and assessment of program utility as measured by the&#xD;
           credibility/expectancy questionnaire and a purpose designed patient satisfaction&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Therapists' impression of treatment effect as measured by the clinical global&#xD;
           improvement scale (CGI_c).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Changes in patient-rated gambling problems from before to after the treatment measured&#xD;
           by the NODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators regard a future study testing the treatment program &quot;SpilleFri&quot; in an RCT&#xD;
      as feasible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 60 % of the patients included in the study complete the treatment program (defined as&#xD;
           completion of at least 5 of 8 modules)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 70 % of treatment completers provide data for primary gambling outcome variable (NODS)&#xD;
