  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases, globally and locally. Several health&#xD;
      benefits of increased physical activity (PA) have been reported for people with cancer. PA&#xD;
      plays a critical role across the cancer trajectory, from prevention through to post-diagnosis&#xD;
      and has been proposed as an alternative for improving physical and psychosocial health&#xD;
      outcomes, reducing cancer recurrence, and cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Although&#xD;
      there are a variety of exercise intervention programs for cancer patients, those programs&#xD;
      were quite intensive, requiring individuals to commit extra time and effort. Feeling of&#xD;
      overwhelmed appointments, lack of time, other barriers, including high cost and limited&#xD;
      access to facilities are the most frequently reported barriers that prevent people from&#xD;
      starting and maintaining exercise. Hence, the investigators propose to use a brief messaging&#xD;
      lifestyle modification intervention program to incorporating simple and easy-to-do&#xD;
      patient-centred home-based lifestyle-integrated exercise into daily activities of patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer. The aims are to explore the feasibility of using instant messaging to&#xD;
      enhance physical activity and improve their fatigue, emotion and quality of life, and obtain&#xD;
      feedback from patients for intervention and study design improvement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer, globally and locally. Patients with lung cancer&#xD;
      are in a uniquely challenging situation in their disease, comorbidities, and treatment that&#xD;
      may lead to worsened symptoms and many negative health consequences, including fatigue,&#xD;
      irritability, and impaired daytime functioning. Physical activity (PA) is defined as 'any&#xD;
      bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle that results in energy expenditure'. Several&#xD;
      health benefits of increased PA have been reported for people with cancer. PA plays a&#xD;
      critical role across the cancer trajectory, from prevention through to postdiagnosis and has&#xD;
      been proposed as an alternative for improving physical and psychosocial health outcomes,&#xD;
      reducing cancer recurrence, and cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Although there are a&#xD;
      variety of exercise intervention programs for cancer patients, those programs were quite&#xD;
      intensive, requiring individuals to commit extra time and effort. Most clinicians&#xD;
      underutilise exercise therapy, regardless of its low-cost way to improve symptoms and&#xD;
      potential health outcomes. Feeling of overwhelmed appointments, lack of time, other barriers,&#xD;
      including high cost and limited access to facilities are the most frequently reported&#xD;
      barriers that prevent people from starting and maintaining exercise. Low motivation, fear to&#xD;
      exercise, lack of knowledge about benefits are the most common barriers of engaging in&#xD;
      physical activity for cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the current proposal is to use a brief messaging lifestyle modification intervention&#xD;
      program to incorporating simple and easy-to-do patient-centred home-based&#xD;
      lifestyle-integrated exercise (light to moderate physical activity) into daily activities of&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to explore the feasibility of using instant messaging to enhance physical&#xD;
      activity and improve their fatigue, emotion and quality of life, and obtain feedback from&#xD;
      patients for intervention and study design improvement.&#xD;
