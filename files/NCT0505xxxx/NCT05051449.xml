  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methadone is a first-line, evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, retention and adherence in methadone treatment is a major challenge. OUD&#xD;
      patients frequently present with co-morbid depression (OUDCD), a risk factor for poor OUD&#xD;
      treatment outcomes, overdose, and suicide. The last two decades have seen an exciting and&#xD;
      transformational development in the treatment of depression - ketamine. As a safe,&#xD;
      rapid-acting anti-depressant deliverable within the context of methadone maintenance&#xD;
      treatment, ketamine could feasibly change the landscape of treatment for OUD patients with&#xD;
      comorbid depression. This proposal seeks to evaluate implementation outcomes (feasibility and&#xD;
      patient acceptance) as well as preliminary efficacy of ketamine on methadone treatment&#xD;
      outcomes for OUD patients (n=6) with comorbid depression and depressive symptoms presenting&#xD;
      for methadone treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Ketamine will be administered by a nurse in a 2-week treatment phase, during which participants will receive six IV infusions of 0.5 mg/kg (over 40-50 minutes) ketamine three times per week. Infusion days for patients will be on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, +/- 1 day. Ketamine infusions will take place at the UMB General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). The GCRC nurse will deliver ketamine within a private exam room. The infusions will last 40-50 min, and the participant will be observed by the GCRC clinical staff for 2 hours post-infusion. Vital signs will be monitored throughout the treatment; specifically, blood pressure, pulse ox and heart rate will be checked prior to treatment, q20 minutes during infusion, and q30-60 minutes after infusion for up to three hours.</description>
