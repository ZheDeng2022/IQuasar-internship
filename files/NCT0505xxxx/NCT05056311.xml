  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstructive surgery is advocated for most children with hypospadias, a condition in which&#xD;
      the pee hold is not in the correct place on the penis, to prevent potentially serious&#xD;
      cosmetic and functional problems. Parents faced with a decision about hypospadias repair&#xD;
      encounter an irreversible choice with potentially lifelong consequences. Recent studies have&#xD;
      identified decisional conflict (DC) and decisional regret (DR) as a significant problem for&#xD;
      parents. Several recent guidelines on complex urologic topics suggest that shared&#xD;
      decision-making (SDM) is the optimal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot test of a decision aid website by parents potentially facing this decision will be&#xD;
      conducted to measure pre- and post-outcomes, in order to develop a fuller understanding of&#xD;
      how urologists can effectively provide parents with optimal decision support. Parents will&#xD;
      answer questions via phone up to four time points, twice before (T1 and T2) and twice after&#xD;
      seeing a urologist for a hypospadias referral (T3 and T4). If the urologist diagnoses&#xD;
      hypospadias but recommends no surgery, the final data collection point will be three months&#xD;
      after the urology visit. If the urologist recommends repair surgery, the final data&#xD;
      collection point will be six months after surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T1), Week 1 (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) measures personal perceptions of uncertainty in choosing options, modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values and unsupported in decision making, and effective decision making (in full version) such as feeling the choice is informed, values-based, likely to be implemented and expressing satisfaction with the choice.&#xD;
This study utilizes the full version, a Likert-type scale consisting of 16 questions and answer options of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Total scores from items are summed and divided by 16, with a higher score meaning more decisional conflict.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decision-Specific Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T1), Week 1 (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Decision-Specific Knowledge is a six-question tool with multiple choice question and answer options created by the investigator to measure pre/post knowledge of hypospadias and repair surgery. Tool scores range from 0-100% with a higher score indicating more correct answers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Regret Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post urology visit if no surgery or 6 months post surgery (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>The Decision Regret Scale measures distress or remorse after a decision. Brehaut's 5-item scale has scores ranging from 0-100, where 100 indicates maximal regret, and 0 indicates no regret.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hypospadias Treatment Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T1), Week 1 (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a singe question created by the investigator with yes/no/unsure answer options to measure a change in response, or not, after viewing the decision aid website.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Awareness of Decision</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T1), Week 1 (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a singe question created by the investigator with yes/no/unsure answer options to measure a change in awareness of decision, or not, after viewing the decision aid website.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decision Aid Acceptability Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours of urology visit (T3), 3 months post urology visit if no surgery or 6 months post surgery (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of a decision aid refers to ratings regarding the comprehensibility of components of a decision aid, its length, pace (if audio-visual), amount of information, balance in presentation of information about options, and overall suitability for decision making. The tool has 4 questions with answers on a Likert scale. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher acceptability and responses can be reported descriptively in terms of proportions responding positively or negatively on each criterion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Preparation for Decision Making Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (T2), Within 48 hours of urology visit (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The Preparation for Decision Making scale (Prep-DM) scale assesses a patient's perception of how useful a decision aid or other decision support intervention is in preparing the respondent to communicate with their practitioner at a consultation focused on making a health decision. The scale contains 10 questions with answers on a Likert Scale Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a higher perceived level of preparation for decision making.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shared Decision Making Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours of urology visit (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The Shared Decision Making Questionnaire measures the decisional process in medical encounters from both the patient and the physician perspectives. The questionnaire contains 9 questions with answers on a 6-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating a higher perceived level of shared decision making.</description>
