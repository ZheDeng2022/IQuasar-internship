  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to adapt and evaluate a multicomponent intervention to reduce sedentary&#xD;
      behavior and improve psychosocial distress and quality of life in rural cancer survivors&#xD;
      currently receiving treatment. The multicomponent intervention combines Harmony &amp; Health&#xD;
      (HH),40,41 a face-to-face light-intensity physical activity intervention to reduce sedentary&#xD;
      behavior and psychosocial distress, with AIM,42 a smartphonebased personalized messaging&#xD;
      intervention, to motivate participants to move more and sit less.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adapt a multicomponent intervention (HH+AIM) that assesses the perspective of health care&#xD;
      provider and cancer survivors about: 1) needs related to psychosocial distress and health&#xD;
      behaviors in rural patients with cancer, 2) needs related to implementing interventions&#xD;
      within the treatment setting, 3) barriers to intervention delivery/participate, and 4)&#xD;
      preferred means/methods for referring participants and receiving information related to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess time spent sitting in prolonged bouts of 20 consecutive minutes or more&#xD;
           (minutes/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess daily number of steps (collected using the activPALTM over 7 days at week 8,&#xD;
           data will be averaging over 7 days to get minutes per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess psychosocial distress measured using the NCCN Distress Thermometer scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess health-related quality of life measured using the SF-36 short form&#xD;
