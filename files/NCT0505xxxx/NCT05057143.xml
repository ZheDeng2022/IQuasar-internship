  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A patient with a tumor lesion of the chest wall undergoes CT scan with a step width of less&#xD;
      than 1 mm, then engineers design an individual model to replace the defect. Using a 3D&#xD;
      printer, a model is made based on titanium alloy powder. Preoperative preparation takes an&#xD;
      average of 14-21 days. The next stage is surgical treatment in the amount of resection of the&#xD;
      chest wall with plastic defect with an individual titanium implant. In some cases, the&#xD;
      titanium framework is separated from the pleural cavity by a polytetrafluoroethylene plate in&#xD;
      order to seal and prevent the development of pulmonary hernias. The advantages of titanium&#xD;
      individual prostheses include accurate matching of the implant to the size and&#xD;
      characteristics of the defect, individual modeling allows you to repeat the anatomical&#xD;
      features of the patient. This method helps to recreate the original shape of the chest, and&#xD;
      most importantly, symmetrical, relatively healthy half. With the help of titanium,&#xD;
      individualized prostheses are made based on 3D modeling, which will reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      complications, accelerate rehabilitation and improve the quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      tumor lesions of the chest wall. The postoperative period takes 15-30 days.&#xD;

      A patient with a tumor lesion of the chest wall undergoes CT scan with a step width of less&#xD;
      than 1 mm, then engineers design an individual model to replace the defect. Using a 3D&#xD;
      printer, a model is made based on the patient's anthropometric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufacturing takes place by 3D printing on a titanium alloy powder certified for the&#xD;
      manufacture of medical implants. The technology used is a type of SLS (Selective Laser&#xD;
      Sintering) -technology, layer-by-layer laser melting of metal-powder compositions. The&#xD;
      printing process begins with dividing the digital 3D model of the product into layers with a&#xD;
      thickness of 20 to 100 microns in order to create a 2D image of each layer of the product&#xD;
      (section). The industry standard format is STL (Stereolithography) file. This file enters a&#xD;
      special machine software, where the information is analyzed and compared with the technical&#xD;
      capabilities of the machine. Based on the data obtained, a production cycle of construction&#xD;
      is launched, consisting of many cycles of building individual layers of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cycle for constructing a layer (section) consists of typical operations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  applying a layer of powder of a given thickness to the construction plate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  scanning by a laser beam of the section of the product layer. The laser beam is a source&#xD;
           of heat, under the influence of which the particles of the material are sintered along&#xD;
           the profile of the section of the model;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lowering the platform into the depth of the construction well by an amount corresponding&#xD;
           to the thickness of the construction layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of building products takes place in the SLM (Selective Laser Melting) chamber of&#xD;
      the machine, filled with an inert gas argon. After construction, the product is removed from&#xD;
      the printer chamber and sent for heat treatment, annealing, to relieve internal stresses and&#xD;
      improve mechanical properties. After annealing, the product is separated from the platform&#xD;
      and undergoes finishing, which combines various types of machining. The final stages of the&#xD;
      technological process are product cleaning and technical quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation takes an average of 14-21 days. The next stage is surgical treatment&#xD;
      in the amount of resection of the chest wall with plastic defect with an individual titanium&#xD;
      implant. In all cases, the titanium framework is separated from the pleural cavity by a&#xD;
      synthetic polyester (Dacron) plate in order to seal and prevent the development of pulmonary&#xD;
      hernias. The advantages of titanium individual implants include accurate matching of the&#xD;
      implant to the size and characteristics of the defect, individual modeling allows you to&#xD;
      repeat the anatomical features of the patient. This method helps to recreate the original&#xD;
      shape of the chest, and most importantly, symmetrical, relatively healthy half. With the help&#xD;
      of titanium, individualized prostheses are made based on 3D modeling, which will reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of complications, accelerate rehabilitation and improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients with tumor lesions of the chest wall. The postoperative period takes 15-30 days.&#xD;
