  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of positive ctDNA -freely&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA fragments found in the blood plasma- in patients with pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      and to better understand the relationship between possible ctDNA biomarkers and patient&#xD;
      survival. A successful study may provide preliminary evidence that helps improve future&#xD;
      patient care through targeted diagnostics, prognosis, and/or treatment.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to assess the role of serial ctDNA analysis as integrative&#xD;
      biomarker in patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer undergoing&#xD;
      treatment with curative intent. This is a single arm prospective tissue/blood collection from&#xD;
      patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and Surgery as well as surveillance, plan to accrue&#xD;
      up to 50 patients. Primary objective is to determine the proportion of ctDNA positive in&#xD;
      patients with resectable pancreatic cancer and to evaluate the progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) in subjects with ctDNA positive versus ctDNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to the study will participate in pre-study exams and tests to find out&#xD;
      if they can take part in the study. This includes, but is not limited to, a doctor's visit&#xD;
      with medical history and physical evaluation, blood work, pregnancy test for those capable of&#xD;
      becoming pregnant, and and imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study itself will include the patient's regular treatment for pancreatic cancer which may&#xD;
      include 4 to 6 months of chemotherapy, chemo-radiation, surgery to remove pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy and follow up for 5 years. Blood will be drawn at regular time points&#xD;
      during this study for ctDNA detection. The tumor tissue at diagnosis will be collected to&#xD;
      develop a personalized and tumor informed PCR test.&#xD;
