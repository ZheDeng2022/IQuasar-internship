  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Live Attenuated freeze-dried Influenza Vaccine has been licensed for use in 2020 (Approval&#xD;
      No.S20200002), the sponsor of this research submitted an new application for non freeze-dried&#xD;
      Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine in 2021. The main objective of phase Ⅰ trail is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of LAVI(non freeze-dried). The secondary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of LAVI(non freeze-dried).&#xD;

      Totally 160 health people aged 3-59 years old will be divided into two age group, containing&#xD;
      80 in 18-59 years old and 80 in 3-19 years old. All subjects will receive vaccination either&#xD;
      LAVI or placebo in a ratio of 3:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be collected any adverse events within 30 days and any serious adverse&#xD;
      events within 6 months for safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be collected blood sample and nasopharyngeal swab for immunogenicity&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
