  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is taking place in Los Angeles, CA at clinics within the UCLA Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a 2x2 nested factorial design. Patients will be randomized into 1)&#xD;
      receiving text based reminder messages, 2) portal-based reminder messages or 3) the control&#xD;
      group. Patients randomized to the intervention arms will receive reminders if they are due&#xD;
      for influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested within the reminder arms (text or portal), we will have 2 additional components for&#xD;
      which patients will be randomized separately:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A direct scheduling link within the reminder letter enabling the patient to schedule an&#xD;
           influenza vaccine only visit (direct scheduling link vs. no direct scheduling link).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pre-appointment reminder, encouraging patients to ask for their influenza vaccine at&#xD;
           their upcoming appointment (pre-appointment reminder encouraging influenza vaccination&#xD;
           vs. standard pre-appointment reminder not mentioning influenza vaccination)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation in 2010 that&#xD;
      all people above 6 months of age should receive an annual flu vaccine, vaccination rates&#xD;
      remain low: at 6m-4.9 yrs. (70%), 5-17.9 yrs. (56%), 18-64.9 yrs. (38%), and &gt;65 yrs. (63%).&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the effectiveness of MyChart R/R messages and text R/R messages&#xD;
      as compared to the standard of care control (no messages).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-optimal vaccination rates are a significant problem in the U.S., despite their&#xD;
      effectiveness in preventing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable illness. For&#xD;
      influenza specifically, annual epidemics of influenza cause substantial morbidity in the U.S.&#xD;
      with up to 40,00-80,000 deaths/year and many hospitalizations, emergency and outpatient&#xD;
      visits, and significant costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reminder/recall (R/R), sent by phone, mail or other modality, can improve child and adult&#xD;
      influenza vaccination rates. However, the majority of pediatric or adult primary care&#xD;
      practices do not conduct R/R. Barriers are lack of finances, personnel, and algorithms to&#xD;
      identify eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technological breakthrough that might overcome these barriers involves patient portals--&#xD;
      secure, web-based communication systems, embedded within electronic health records (EHRs),&#xD;
      for patients and providers to communicate with each other via email and the internet. Portals&#xD;
      are used by about half of Americans and half of UCLA patients. Another is text messaging at&#xD;
      the health system level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will assess the effectiveness of reminders messages sent to&#xD;
      portal users, encouraging influenza vaccination, on increasing influenza vaccination rates&#xD;
      within a health system. Patients will be randomized into three groups: 1) one-third of&#xD;
      patients will receive reminder letters via the portal, 2) one-third will receive reminders&#xD;
      via text messages sent by the health system and 3) one-third will not receive reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the reminder arms will be further randomized (separately) for two additional&#xD;
      components: 1) direct appointment scheduling and 2) pre-appointment reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct scheduling: The convenience of scheduling an appointment for influenza vaccination may&#xD;
      increase the likelihood that patients receive an influenza vaccination. Patients receiving&#xD;
      reminders will be randomized to receive one of two types of reminder letters: 1) one half&#xD;
      will receive flu vaccine reminder letters with a link to the MyChart direct appointment&#xD;
      scheduling page and 2) one half will receive flu vaccine reminder message without the direct&#xD;
      appointment scheduling link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-appointment flu reminders: Finally, a missed opportunities for vaccination occurs when&#xD;
      patients are eligible for vaccination but are not offered a vaccine at their medical&#xD;
      appointment. Pre-appointment reminders, sent in advance of an upcoming appointment,&#xD;
      encouraging the patient talk to their doctor about influenza vaccination, may increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of that patient receiving a vaccine. Patients will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups: 1) one half will receive modified pre-appointment reminders that mention influenza&#xD;
      vaccination and 2) one half will receive the standard pre-appointment reminders for an&#xD;
      upcoming appointment (no mention of influenza vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions that apply Behavioral Economics principles in vaccine promotion messaging can&#xD;
      increase vaccine receipt. We will include ownership language in the pre-appointment messages.&#xD;
      Additionally, the convenience of reminders sent via text and with a Direct Appointment&#xD;
      Schedule link included enables patients to self-schedule a flu vaccine only visit, reducing&#xD;
      friction for vaccine receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analysis, the primary outcome will be the patient's end of flu season&#xD;
      vaccination status. Intervention effects will be assessed using mixed effects log-binomial&#xD;
      models. Models will contain terms for messaging modality (text v. portal v. none),&#xD;
      pre-appointment reminders (sent v. not sent), and direct scheduling link (included v. not&#xD;
      included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The R/R text and portal messages (with and without direct scheduling links) and&#xD;
      pre-appointment reminders and will all begin in October of 2021.&#xD;
