  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this study are to check for side effects from TAK-881 in healthy adults and&#xD;
      to learn how much TAK-881 they can receive without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will receive one infusion of TAK-881 under the skin&#xD;
      (subcutaneous infusion) on Day 1 at a lower dose level followed by participants receiving one&#xD;
      infusion of higher dose levels with ongoing safety monitored by the doctor to ensure optimal&#xD;
      tolerability and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the clinic for 4 days and will come back after 4 weeks. A follow up&#xD;
      visit will take place 12 weeks after the TAK-881 infusion.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Tolerability Events Related to Infusion of TAK-881</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>An infusion is considered tolerable if the infusion rate was not reduced or the infusion was not interrupted or stopped, due to any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to TAK-881. A tolerability event is considered to have occurred if an infusion was tolerable. Number of participants with tolerability events related to the infusion of TAK-881 will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of the study drug administration up to EOS (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with an Investigational product (IP) or medicinal product or any existing event that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the IP or medicinal product. TEAE's will include clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, serious TEAEs, local TEAEs, systemic TEAEs, temporally associated TEAEs, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, TEAEs by maximum severity, and TEAEs of special interest. Occurrence of TEAEs will be reported.</description>
