    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinomas cause anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      Additionally, these patients suffer hormonal alterations, associated with psychological&#xD;
      symptoms (changes in mood, emotional instability, memory loss, etc.). This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of a psycho-oncological intervention based on Counselling to&#xD;
      reduce anxiety and depression related with the treatment in patients with differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid carcinomas.&#xD;

      A non-randomized controlled study, with two groups (experimental, n=37, and control, n=38)&#xD;
      and baseline and post-treatment measures was designed. Patients in experimental group&#xD;
      received a psycho-oncological intervention based on Counselling in addition to the standard&#xD;
      treatment. The independent variable was the assigned group and the dependent one was the&#xD;
      evolution of anxiety and depression, analyzed separately, both evaluated using HADS. Other&#xD;
      relevant covariables related with quality of life were also analyzed using SF-36 and PGWBI&#xD;
      scales.&#xD;

    <measure>Anxiety and depression of patients with DTC (Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma) after a PIBC (Psycho-oncological intervention based on Counselling).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Research on the effectiveness of psycho-oncological interventions in the last 20 years has been classified according to the phase of the oncological process and to the objectives to be achieved. According to the objectives, the interventions focuses on controlling the symptoms associated with the disease, on improving the emotional state, on improving and recover the functional status of patients and on improving quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
Anxiety and depression were evaluated through the HADS scale [Zigmond et al. 1983, Herrmann 1997]. A minimum goal of 3-point reduction in the HADS scale was considered as an improvement. Effect size measure was calculated with Cohen's d for the difference between EG and CG in the primary outcome variable at post-treatment, for both anxiety and depression.</description>

    <description>Patients in EG received a psycho-oncological intervention based on Counselling (PIBC) following the scheme proposed by Arranz and Cancio in addition to the standard treatment. The evolution of anxiety and depression was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a PIBC in reducing anxiety and depression of patients with DTC. Other QoL relevant items were also evaluated using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) scales.</description>
