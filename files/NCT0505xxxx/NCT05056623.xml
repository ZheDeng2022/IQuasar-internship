  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a dyadic pain management program (DPM) in&#xD;
      reducing pain and psychological health symptoms, improving pain self-efficacy, quality of&#xD;
      life, and physical function in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: DPM is more effective in reducing pain and psychological health symptoms,&#xD;
      improving pain self-efficacy, quality of life, and physical function among older adults than&#xD;
      the usual care, upon completion of the DPM (week 8) and over time (week 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: Clustered randomized controlled trial with neighborhood elderly centers&#xD;
      (NEC) as cluster; 150 dyads (one older adults and his/her caregiver as one dyad) will be&#xD;
      recruited from 22 NEC clusters. Each NEC will be randomly allocated to experimental group&#xD;
      (receive DPM), control group (receive usual care and pain management pamphlet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments: Brief Pain Inventory; Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire; Short Form Health&#xD;
      Survey-12; Depression, anxiety &amp; stress; Caregiver Burden Inventory; 6-minute walk test and&#xD;
      process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: DPM, each session includes exercise, interactive pain management education,&#xD;
      practices on non-drug techniques and using a WhatsApp (WhatsApp Messenger) group to encourage&#xD;
      home-based exercise and practice of non-drug methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, perceived health-related quality of&#xD;
      life and experience in participating DPM, to be collected at baseline (T0), week 8 (T1), and&#xD;
      week 16 (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Multilevel regression and/or Generalized Estimating Equation will be used for&#xD;
      within-group and between- group comparisons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DPM is an 8-week group-based program. The DPM included 4 weeks of center-based,&#xD;
      face-to-face activities and 4 weeks digital-based activities delivered via a WhatsApp group.&#xD;
      An 80% participation rate in the face-to-face activities will be regarded as completion of&#xD;
      the DPM. Timely make-up sessions will be arranged for those unable to attend the scheduled&#xD;
      session.&#xD;

    <description>The Chinese version of the Brief Pain Inventory will be used to assess the multidimensional nature of pain, including intensity and interference with life activities in the previous 24 hours. Minimum score = 0; Maximum score = 10. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Chinese version of the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L) will be used to measure quality of life of participants as well as the cost effectiveness of the proposed dyadic pain management program. It is a health-related quality of life measure developed by the EuroQol Group. Minimum score = 0; Maximum score = 100. Higher scores means a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Face-to-face part: The DPM will start with 20-30 minutes of physical exercise supervised by research assistant, followed by 20-minutes of pain management education. Communication skills regarding the practice of various pain management techniques by the participants and their caregivers will be taught. At the end of the session, the caregiver and research assistant will help the older adults to make portfolio entries on the activities of the day, to help them recall the various pain-relief methods learned in each class.&#xD;
Home-based part: An exercise book will be given to guide them in performing exercises at home. It is recommended to perform 30 minutes of exercise, 3 times a week, at home and the more frequent the exercise time, the better.&#xD;
All participants will join a WhatsApp group to receive teaching materials and videos of the physical exercises learned, for practice at home. The team will produce compact disc (CD) with the exercise video clips to the dyads for revision.</description>
