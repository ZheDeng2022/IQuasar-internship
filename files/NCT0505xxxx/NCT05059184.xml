      The term recovery from COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is unverified because the infection&#xD;
      leaves many symptoms due to permanent effects on multiple organs; The primary objective of&#xD;
      this research is to understand acute and chronic long COVID symptoms by asking questions&#xD;
      detecting patient's experience especially symptoms lasting for several months which is known&#xD;
      as chronic fatigue syndrome(Myalgic encephalitis). The study focuses on symptoms describing&#xD;
      Myalgic encephalitis which may still affect COVID patients for several months after the&#xD;
      infection along with making a big picture about rare symptoms that may the patient&#xD;
      experienced during or after the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this research is to focus on the long-term sequelae effects and&#xD;
      comorbidities following COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the appearance of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic has spread and had a&#xD;
      profound effect on the lives and health of people around the Whole world causing around 3.97&#xD;
      million deaths and more than 183 million confirmed cases of the covid-19. The pandemic of&#xD;
      COVID-19 may leave unexplainable symptoms after recovery. COVID-19 pandemic has a lot of&#xD;
      serious symptoms, but some last for some time even after the recovery. Even some of the&#xD;
      people who had mild symptoms during COVID-19 continue to have long terms effects after&#xD;
      initial recovery. These people are called &quot;long haulers&quot; and these symptoms are called Long&#xD;
      COVID-19. Long haulers still suffer from permanent symptoms due to multi-organ dysfunction&#xD;
      despite normal nucleic acid tests that detect the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Dr. Anthony Fauci &quot;patients with COVID-19 can develop a post-viral syndrome&#xD;
      that's very strikingly similar to Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome&quot; Long&#xD;
      COVID-19 involves multiple organs and affects many systems mainly respiratory,&#xD;
      cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of&#xD;
      long-covid include shortness of breath, cough, myalgias, disturbances in the sense of taste&#xD;
      and smell, fatigue, fever, chills, and, less commonly, rhinitis and gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. Those manifestations&#xD;
      persist in one of 10 patients of the infection and last for 3-4 weeks of acute symptoms and&#xD;
      chronic symptoms last for more than 12 weeks after the infection. According to The Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 150 patients out of 300 who were PCR-positive for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 had permanent symptoms after three weeks after the positive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the fatigue persists for six months, it is called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic&#xD;
      Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the period of 6 months is no longer required for ME diagnosis according to 2011's ME&#xD;
      international Consensus Criteria, it is still common in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic fatigue syndrome /post-viral myalgia can not only covid-19 but also follow viral&#xD;
      infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, Ross River virus, enteroviruses, human herpesvirus,&#xD;
      Ebola virus, West Nile virus, Dengue virus, and parvovirus; bacteria, such as Borrelia&#xD;
      burgdorferi, Coxiella burnetii, and Mycoplasma pneumonia; and sometimes parasites, such as&#xD;
      Giardia lamblia, so it is expected but the problem is that it is unknown how severe it is or&#xD;
      how it can affect the public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there has been global concern about the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines. According to WHO, the most common side effects that were reported about COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines were fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhea, and pain at the&#xD;
      injection site which is more or less like some of the post covid infection symptoms so it was&#xD;
      found that it is logical to add a section to gather information about the vaccine status,&#xD;
      type, and timing with the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, some cases were reported from Canada reported weird and rare symptoms like Beau lines.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Persons had a COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 infection (still suffering or suffered&#xD;
             symptoms) for longer than 1 week Even if your COVID-19 test result was negative, or&#xD;
             you were not tested at all&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persons who are 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        General considerations according to Myalgic encephalomyelitis: International Consensus&#xD;
        Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should meet the full criteria for epidemiological studies. If specific&#xD;
             subgroups or atypical ME are included in a research study, that should be clearly&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specificity: Because critical symptoms are compulsory, it ensures the proper selection&#xD;
             of patients. Key operational guidelines enhance clarity and specificity. Ranking the&#xD;
             hierarchy of the most troublesome symptoms may be helpful in some studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reliability: Symptoms must not be viewed as a nominal checklist. The International&#xD;
             Consensus Criteria focus on symptom patterns, which increase reliability. The&#xD;
             International Symptom Scale ensures consistency in the way questions are asked and&#xD;
             further increases the reliability of data collected in different locations. Patients&#xD;
             should complete the International Symptom Scale prior to entering a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  persons other than selected in the inclusion criteria&#xD;
