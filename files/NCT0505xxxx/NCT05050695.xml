      Objective: This study will be conducted to investigate the relationship between the amplitude&#xD;
      of posterior oblique sling muscles; ipsilateral gluteus maximus (GM) and contralateral&#xD;
      latissmus Dorsi (LD), and the amount of anterior translation of humeral head (ATHH) of the&#xD;
      contralateral glenohumeral joint (GHJ) in subjects with unilateral chronic low back pain&#xD;
      (CLBP) during ipsilateral prone knee extension (PHE) test. Methods: The study will be&#xD;
      conducted on thirty subjects (15 patients with CLBP and 15 healthy subjects). Ipsilateral GM&#xD;
      and contralateral LD amplitude will be recorded by surface EMG during PHE of the limb at the&#xD;
      painful side and correlated to ATHH of contralateral GHJ as measured by ultrasonography.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There won't be a significant relationship between the amplitude of posterior&#xD;
      oblique sling muscles (GM and contralateral LD) during PHE for the ipsilateral leg and the&#xD;
      amount of ATHH of the contralateral GHJ in patients with unilateral CLBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demographic data will be collected from all subjects regarding age, weight, height, and body&#xD;
      mass index. After patient selection according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      measuring the amplitude of gluteus maximus (GM) and contralateral latissmus dorsi (LD)&#xD;
      muscles during prone hip extension (PHE) for the ipsilateral leg to the symptoms in&#xD;
      unilateral CLBP patients and for the selected leg in matched controls will be carried out&#xD;
      using surface electromyography (EMG) unit. Then ultrasonography unit will be used to assess&#xD;
      the amount of anterior translation of humeral head (ATHH) of contralateral glenohumeral joint&#xD;
      for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before placement of the EMG electrodes, the skin at the anatomic landmarks will be shaved (if&#xD;
      required), rubbed, and cleaned with isopropyl alcohol 70% to remove excess oils and debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrodes will be sterilized and placed on the muscle belly oriented parallel to the&#xD;
      muscle fiber away from the tendon and muscle edges with the inter-electrodes distance of two&#xD;
      centimeters. The electrodes will be secured by adhesive tape. Before recording, skin&#xD;
      impedance will be checked to be less than 5 Kâ„¦.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrodes for LD will be placed 4 cm below the inferior tip of the scapula and half the&#xD;
      distance between the spine and the lateral edge of the torso. For GM, electrodes will be&#xD;
      placed at half the distance between the greater trochanter and second sacral vertebra and at&#xD;
      an oblique angle at, or slightly above, the level of the trochanter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two normalization procedures will be the typical maximal voluntary isometric contraction&#xD;
      (MVIC) performed as per SENIAM Guidelines (www.seniam.org), and submaximal voluntary&#xD;
      contraction (sub-MVC) task will be performed using the prone double leg raise. It is&#xD;
      recommended to avoid maximal contractions of the GM muscle, because reproduction of pain on&#xD;
      testing would have possibly invalidated the use of the root mean square (RMS) values for&#xD;
      normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the sub-MVC of GM, the subjects will be asked to lift both knees 5 cm off the examination&#xD;
      table while the knees should be flexed at 90 and held them for 5 seconds in a prone position.&#xD;
      Three trials will be performed with 30 seconds rest in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For MVIC of LD muscle, the subjects will be in prone position and the side being tested is&#xD;
      aligned with the edge of the plinth, with the shoulder and upper extremity off the plinth.&#xD;
      The subjects will be asked to flex the elbow and manual isometric resistance will be applied&#xD;
      at distal humerus during shoulder extension and adduction and the contraction held for 5&#xD;
      seconds, the middle 3 seconds will be used for the analysis. Stabilization will be applied to&#xD;
      the ipsilateral scapula and trunk. Three trials were performed with 30 seconds rest in&#xD;
      between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For recording during PHE, all subjects will be instructed about active PHE and The target&#xD;
      angle was set at 10 degrees to control the amount of hip extension using a goniometer. A 30&#xD;
      seconds rest period will be provided between each trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography assessment: the patient will be assessed in a sitting position and the&#xD;
      shoulder will be placed in internal rotation then the position will be maintained by a sling.&#xD;
      Two therapists are needed to assess humeral translation.&#xD;
