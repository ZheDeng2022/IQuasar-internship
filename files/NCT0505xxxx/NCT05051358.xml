  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective chart-review registry study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      profile, efficacy profile and cost-effectiveness of the various therapeutic endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS) procedures (for benign and malignant gastrointestinal disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the clinical and technical success rates of EUS-Guided interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To document the impact of therapeutic EUS procedures on the management of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal disorders including malignancies through cost effective analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare endoscopic interventions to non-endoscopic interventions for the same clinical&#xD;
           indications and evaluate safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our tertiary-care institution performs clinically-indicated therapeutic Endoscopic Ultrasound&#xD;
      (TEUS) guided interventions, including biliary and pancreatic drainage, for both malignant&#xD;
      and benign gastrointestinal indications in more than 2000 patients annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures such as biliary and/or pancreatic sphincterotomy, stents placement (metallic or&#xD;
      plastic) and removal for revision, cysts and pseudocysts drainage are conducted in patients&#xD;
      suffering from pancreatico-biliary disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and esophageal&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEUS procedures are less invasive approach than surgery. Moreover, they can be available to&#xD;
      patients who are ineligible for surgery or who have refused more aggressive surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They improve quality of life and extend survival duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is limited multi-center data on therapeutic endoscopy clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      standardized treatment algorithms in western populations. Due to continuing variations in&#xD;
      therapeutic EUS procedures, as well as introduction of some TEUS procedure accessories; it is&#xD;
      necessary to periodically evaluate the efficacy and safety of specific TEUS procedures and&#xD;
      accessories for several indications to check for improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of these clinical details would help us compare them to conventional treatment&#xD;
      modalities within our current facility and scope of practice; and consequently, help us&#xD;
      identify safe and cost-effective treatment techniques, develop treatment algorithms and&#xD;
      improve clinical management of patients at RWJMS and other tertiary-care centers.&#xD;
