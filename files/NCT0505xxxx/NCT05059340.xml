  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The side effects following post surgical neck dissection treatment for tumours in the head&#xD;
      and neck (HN) region are weakness of the shoulder and neck muscles, numbness and reduced&#xD;
      sensation around the neck and shoulder region and a general impact on the participant's&#xD;
      overall fitness. While survival has been emphasized as an important outcome, recovery of&#xD;
      treatment-related morbidity and return to pre-treatment quality of life (QOL) for&#xD;
      participants after cancer treatment is equally important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle functions to turn the head to the left or right. In&#xD;
      particular while performing neck dissections, SCM dissection is a common step. The side&#xD;
      effects of SCM dissection is a stiff neck or reduced neck movements. To objectively measure&#xD;
      the outcome of the SCM muscle function, it is necessary to determine what is the normal range&#xD;
      of motion in healthy subjects turning to the left and right to look at objects in a specific&#xD;
      location or Point-of gaze (POG) procedure, as well as the Electromyography (EMG) of the SCM&#xD;
      during the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this normative study, 20 healthy subjects will be recruited to perform this POG assessment&#xD;
      as well as EMG and Elastography (ETG) testing of the SCM on the left and right side. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. neck range of motion for flexion, side flexion and rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EMG activation patterns for SCM&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) muscle thickness &amp; stiffness (as determined by grey scale ultrasound (US) and ETG,&#xD;
      respectively) of the SCM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there will not be any significant differences of POG, EMG&#xD;
      and ETG measurements between the left and right side of the SCM in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 healthy subjects who are staff working in the SGH (Singapore General Hospital) campus,&#xD;
      will be recruited for the normative study. Subjects will be recruited through email&#xD;
      invitations to participate in the study. Those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be selected for testing. In order to ensure there are sufficient gender representation&#xD;
      in the normative data, the team will select 10 male and 10 female subjects. Consent will be&#xD;
      taken from the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have to undergo the following standard tests; Point of gaze (POG)&#xD;
      measurement, Electromyography (EMG) and Ultrasound Elastography (ETG) measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. POG or Point of gaze measurement: This is a non-invasive assessment tool to assess head&#xD;
           and neck movement via 3D motion analysis. Neck range of movement will be assessed using&#xD;
           a light source together with the 3D motion capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be seated in the middle of the room with reflective markers placed on&#xD;
           their head and shoulders. The participants will keep their gaze fixed on an object as&#xD;
           the starting position in the neutral position. A light source will appear either to the&#xD;
           left or right of the neutral position, and the subject will have to detect this light&#xD;
           source and indicate to the researcher when they have located the light source. The light&#xD;
           source is pre-set at either 60 or 90 degrees diagonally to the left and right of the&#xD;
           subjects. The sequence of the light locations is also pre-set for all subjects so that&#xD;
           all subjects follow the same sequence to turn either to the left or right, and if it is&#xD;
           located 60 or 90 degrees position. Subjects will turn in total, 6 times to the left and&#xD;
           6 times to the right to complete the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 3D motion analyser will capture the neck turning moment in 3 anatomical planes,&#xD;
           flexion-extension, lateral flexion, and rotation, relative to the thorax. Angular&#xD;
           velocity and acceleration will also be recorded during the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electromyography (EMG) of the SCM during POG testing will be recorded using electrodes&#xD;
           on the left and right SCM. The wireless EMG unit Cometa PICO, will be used to record the&#xD;
           EMG during POG assessment simultaneously during the movement. This data will be&#xD;
           correlated to the range of motion of the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound Elastography (ETG) measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stiffness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement will be performed using Supersonic Ultrasound Machine (Aixplorer; SuperSonic&#xD;
      Imagine, Aix-En-Provence, France) that is equipped with a L15-4 high resolution linear&#xD;
      transducer with predefined anatomical landmarks. These landmarks are: the height of the hyoid&#xD;
      bone (sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscle) and the acromial process for the middle&#xD;
      trapezius, the inside border of the rib to the inside edge of the muscle border (for the&#xD;
      serratus anterior), medial edge of the medial side of the spine of scapula (for the rhomboid&#xD;
      major). The whole SCM will be separated into 3 sections for the measurement of the stiffness&#xD;
      of the muscle - Proximal SCM, Mid SCM &amp; Distal SCM. For each section, 3 stiffness&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained. This will result in a total of 9 stiffness (elasticity)&#xD;
      measurements for each side of the SCM. The average (mean) reading of the 9 measurements will&#xD;
      be taken as the final muscle stiffness for analysis. Bilateral SCM will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thickness (Grey scale):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full length of the patient's SCM will be physically measured from the mastoid process to&#xD;
      the sternal notch. The mid length (measured from the Mastoid Process) will be marked on the&#xD;
      skin and scan will be performed at the marked level. The thickness of the SCM muscle will be&#xD;
      measured in the transverse and longitudinal planes at the mid-length of the SCM; and the mean&#xD;
      thickness score will be used for final analysis. Subjects are scanned in the supine position&#xD;
      with head tilted 15 degrees away from the scanned side. This will be performed on the&#xD;
      bilateral SCM of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All POG, EMG and ETG measurements are taken only once with no follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research data will be sent to the Trusted Third Party appointed by the institution for&#xD;
      data de-identification prior to data analysis.&#xD;
