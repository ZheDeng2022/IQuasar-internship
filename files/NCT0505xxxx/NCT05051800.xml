  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer patients and their parents are faced with significant stress at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, during treatment, and over the course of recovery. The stress of cancer and its&#xD;
      treatment can lead to significant emotional distress for many families. However, most&#xD;
      families do not have access to programs that offer support for coping with cancer-related&#xD;
      stress. The proposed work will address this gap by testing of the possible benefits of a&#xD;
      novel internet delivered program to support children with cancer and their parents in coping&#xD;
      with and communicating about a child's cancer. The research team includes experts from&#xD;
      Vanderbilt University and Nationwide Children's Hospital with experience in pediatric&#xD;
      oncology; stress, coping, and family communication in pediatric cancer; internet&#xD;
      interventions in pediatric populations; and family-focused interventions to build coping and&#xD;
      parenting skills. The study will test the effects of this program in 150 families of children&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed cancer on reducing emotional distress up to 12 months after&#xD;
      participation in the program. This project has the potential to lead to an evidence-based&#xD;
      program to improve quality of life and resilience in children with cancer and their parents&#xD;
      that can be easily and widely disseminated.&#xD;
