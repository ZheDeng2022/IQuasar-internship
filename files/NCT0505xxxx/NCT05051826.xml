  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance training has been widely used in various sports and is a common practice aimed at&#xD;
      improving competition performance, especially in swimming. Swimming performance is highly&#xD;
      dependent on muscle strength, especially short distances. Water or land resistance training&#xD;
      can improve the swimming performance, especially the swimming performance of 50 meters and&#xD;
      100 meters. Both type of training has their own strength and weakness. Hence, combining both&#xD;
      methods strength may enhance swimmer performance. In addition, competitive swimming consists&#xD;
      of different stages, namely start, clean swim, turn and finish. However, there is no&#xD;
      literature on the influence of resistance training on starting and turning.&#xD;

      Through experimental design and quantitative research methods. In this experiment, the&#xD;
      resistance training method of water combined with land was used to intervene the turning and&#xD;
      starting of young people, and the traditional strength training was compared to find out a&#xD;
      better training method. The experiment will use 12 weeks of resistance training to improve&#xD;
      the swimmer's turn and start intervention. The experiment consisted of four groups, 20 boys&#xD;
      and 20 girls in the experimental group and 20 boys and 20 girls in the control group. Compare&#xD;
      the differences between the two groups. Divided into discussion groups and general teaching&#xD;
      groups. Two of the most significant differences, this experiment aims to provide a&#xD;
      theoretical basis for improving the training methods of swimming, so that young swimmers can&#xD;
      get better swimming performance, especially on the start and turn.&#xD;
