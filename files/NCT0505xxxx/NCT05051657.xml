  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open label, acceptability study to evaluate PKU express plus in the dietary&#xD;
      management of 15 patients aged 3 years and above with PKU. The study sees patients transition&#xD;
      from their current protein substitute to at least one sachet of PKU express plus and then&#xD;
      enter a 28 day evaluation period whilst consuming PKU express plus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be assessed: adherence to prescribed dietary intakes,&#xD;
      palatability, usability, gastrointestinal tolerance, neophobia score, blood phenylalanine and&#xD;
      tyrosine levels, timeframe to transition and contribution of PKU express plus to overall&#xD;
      protein substitute intake over three months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective acceptability study of PKU express plus in 15 participants aged at&#xD;
      least three years of age for the dietary management of phenylketonuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a Transition Period where patients will build-up to at least one&#xD;
      sachet of PKU express plus per day. During the Transition Period, daily intake of PKU express&#xD;
      plus and the patient's other PS will be recorded, including the time taken to consume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transition Period will last a maximum of 6 weeks, after which the patient will enter a&#xD;
      28-day Evaluation Period. During the Evaluation Period, patients will continue to record&#xD;
      intakes, as well as GI tolerance and a final evaluation of the product's palatability and&#xD;
      usability. Some patients, likely adults, will not require a transition from their original&#xD;
      protein substitute to at least one sachet of PKU express plus. These patients can enter the&#xD;
      Evaluation Period directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the 4-week Evaluation Period is defined as the participant's End of Study.&#xD;
      Following this, participants will be followed up as per standard of care. Some of this&#xD;
      standard of care data may be relayed to the sponsor for a maximum of 26 weeks. This will last&#xD;
      for a maximum of 26 weeks and will involve the collection of routine phe and tyrosine levels,&#xD;
      as well as amount of PS prescribed and taken. Information will also be collected from&#xD;
      patients regarding the reasons for the success or indeed failure of transition to PKU express&#xD;
      plus. This data will come from routine clinical contact and will be recorded by the HCP,&#xD;
      rather than by the patient.&#xD;
