    <textblock>
      The investigators' goal is to perform an observational cohort study investigating the use of&#xD;
      oxygen reserve index (ORi) in patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery and one-lung&#xD;
      ventilation (OLV). For this purpose, ORi values are recorded and compared to the other&#xD;
      collected hemodynamical and oximeter parameters. The primary hemodynamic parameters include&#xD;
      heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), while; oximeter device-related parameters include&#xD;
      peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index (PI), and pleth variability index (PVI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' secondary goal is to investigate relationships between these hemodynamical&#xD;
      and oximeter parameters using statistical analysis methods.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to investigate the possible benefits of using the oxygen&#xD;
      reserve index (ORi) parameter during one-lung ventilation (OLV) and elective thoracic&#xD;
      operations. For this purpose, ORi values are compared to primary hemodynamical parameters of&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and Meanwhile, a device from Masimo Inc, USA,&#xD;
      provides oximeter-related parameters, including peripheral oxygen saturation, perfusion index&#xD;
      (PI), and pleth variability index (PVI). The secondary objective is to investigate possible&#xD;
      statistically significant correlations between these hemodynamical and oximeter parameters&#xD;
      using appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants are patients undergoing video-assisted thoracotomy surgical procedures&#xD;
      (VATS) or open thoracotomy for suspicion and possible lung tumor removal. The surgical&#xD;
      operation of either lobectomy, pneumonectomy, lung biopsy, or wedge resection is considered&#xD;
      during this procedure. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in another section&#xD;
      of the clinicaltrials.gov registration document. All patients in the study receive a similar&#xD;
      anesthetic management protocol. Premedication is not required in the study. After admitting a&#xD;
      patient to the operating theatre, pulse oximetry SpO2, electrocardiogram, and noninvasive&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring are established. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP),&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are measured at certain&#xD;
      time points. Anesthesia requires induction of anesthesia with intravenous doses of propofol&#xD;
      (Pofol, Fresenius Pharmaceutical, Turkey), 2 to 3 mg/kg, rocuronium (Esmeron, Organon&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, U.S.A.) at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg, and fentanyl (Janssen fentanyl, Janssen&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical, Belgium) at a dose of 2 to 3 mcg/kg. Tracheal intubation requires the use of&#xD;
      a left Robertshaw double-lumen tube. During anesthesia, one-lung ventilation (OLV) is&#xD;
      provided to all patients in addition to mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia maintenance&#xD;
      includes inhalational anesthetic of sevoflurane (Sevorane, Abbott Pharmaceutical, USA) at an&#xD;
      end-tidal concentration of 1 to 2% to provide a sufficient minimum alveolar concentration to&#xD;
      establish anesthesia and intravenous fentanyl boluses at a dose of 0.2 mcg/kg every hourly to&#xD;
      provide analgesia and to keep mean arterial blood pressure between 60 and 80 mmHg. In&#xD;
      addition to standard follow-up parameters, oxygen reserve index (ORi), perfusion index (PI),&#xD;
      pleth variability index (PVI) is monitored for each patient at certain time points. Hypoxemia&#xD;
      during OLV was defined as peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) value of less than 95% when the&#xD;
      inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2)value is equal to or greater than 60% on a pulse oximetry&#xD;
      device. Hemodynamic and oximeter data were continuously monitored. The parameters that are in&#xD;
      need of investigation include; MAP, SBP, DBP, HR, SpO2, PaO2, ORi, PI, and PVI values. These&#xD;
      data are monitored at thirteen different time points during the period of anesthesia&#xD;
      induction and maintenance of the surgery. The device used in this study is called the&#xD;
      Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter device for the measurement of ORi, PI, and PVI. A correlation&#xD;
      between these values was investigated on the continuous graphs. The duration of surgery,&#xD;
      anesthesia, OLV, and total 100% oxygen application time are recorded. Blood gas analysis was&#xD;
      provided at DL5 at a 5-minute time point and blood gas analysis was performed for prolonged&#xD;
      surgeries and for surgeries with high bleeding performance that required other analysis.&#xD;
      Routinely, patients are ventilated with 50% FiO2 (50% oxygen + 50% air mixture, 1&#xD;
      liter/minute fresh gas flow) after induction. The value of FiO2 rises depending on pulse&#xD;
      oximeter values between the values of 60% and 100% in order to keep SpO2 values greater than&#xD;
      94. The incidence of thromboembolic complications, arrhythmia, pneumonia, the duration of&#xD;
      hospital and intensive care unit stay is recorded.&#xD;
