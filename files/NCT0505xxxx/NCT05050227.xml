  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is disabling and affects one in five Veterans. VA's Primary Care-Mental health&#xD;
      Integration (PC-MHI) enables specialists to support medication treatment in primary care, but&#xD;
      timely and sufficient access to psychotherapy is unattainable despite Veteran preference for&#xD;
      psychotherapy. This study aims to close the gap in psychotherapy access for VA primary care&#xD;
      patients with depression by adapting and pilot testing PC-MHI collaborative care models to&#xD;
      improve uptake of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: VA's Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) is rooted in evidence-based&#xD;
      collaborative care models, where care managers, mental health specialists, and primary care&#xD;
      providers jointly treat depression in primary care. While PC-MHI enabled specialists to&#xD;
      support medication treatment in primary care, timely and sufficient access to psychotherapy&#xD;
      is unattainable. Alternative therapy modalities are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: Depression is disabling and affects one in five Veterans. Psychotherapy&#xD;
      is preferred by Veterans, but fraught with multilevel barriers (e.g., staff availability,&#xD;
      patient travel to clinic, limited clinic hours). Without enhancing existing PC-MHI models to&#xD;
      enable better primary care patient access to effective psychotherapies, Veteran engagement in&#xD;
      depression treatment is unlikely to improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This study aims to close the gap in psychotherapy access for VA primary care&#xD;
      patients with depression by adapting PC-MHI collaborative care models to improve uptake of&#xD;
      computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT). cCBT is accessible 24/7 via the internet&#xD;
      and has effectively treated depression in more than 30 trials. With modest specialist&#xD;
      support, it is non-inferior to face-to-face psychotherapy. PC-MHI can facilitate Veteran&#xD;
      uptake of cCBT, using an evidence-based collaborative care model to provide the follow-up&#xD;
      care management and mental health specialist back-up that characterizes the most effective&#xD;
      cCBT trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims/Methodology: To pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential&#xD;
      effects of cCBT-enhanced collaborative care on Veterans' depression symptoms and related&#xD;
      outcomes in VA Greater Los Aneles Healthcare System. A pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) will be conducted to examine feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects on&#xD;
      depression, patient activation, and health-related quality of life in VA primary care&#xD;
      patients with depression receiving either (1) cCBT-enhanced collaborative care (n=37) or (2)&#xD;
      usual care (n=37) in West Los Angeles VA, from baseline to 3-months (post-intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next Steps/Implementation: Adapting PC-MHI's collaborative care model to incorporate cCBT can&#xD;
      improve access to psychotherapy and engage the ~400,000 untreated Veterans with depression&#xD;
      who prefer psychotherapy, especially OIF/OEF/OND Veterans seeking care that is convenient.&#xD;
