  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cumulative risk of refractory ascites is in the order of 20% within five years of the&#xD;
      development of ascites. An elevated sinusoidal pressure is essential for the development of&#xD;
      ascites, as fluid accumulation does not develop at portal pressure gradient below 8 mm Hg,&#xD;
      and rising corrected sinusoidal pressure correlates with decreased 24-hour urinary excretion&#xD;
      of sodium.More recently, it has been hypothesised that bacterial translocation associated&#xD;
      with portal hypertension in cirrhosis and related pathogen-associated, molecular pattern&#xD;
      activated innate immune responses lead to systemic inflammation.This is associated with&#xD;
      vasodilatation as well as release of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen and nitrogen&#xD;
      species, contributing to organ dysfunction.This activates sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      stimulating reabsorption of sodium in proximal,distal tubules, loop of Henle and collecting&#xD;
      duct as well as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to sodium absorption from&#xD;
      distal tubule and collecting duct.[5]Renal sodium retention and eventual free water clearance&#xD;
      due to non-osmoticrelease of arginine-vasopressin and its action on V2 receptor in the&#xD;
      collectingduct underlie the fluid retention associated with oedema and ascites in&#xD;
      cirrhosis.The lowering of portal pressure using non selective beta blocker has also been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the development of ascites, refractory ascites and hepatorenal&#xD;
      syndrome.Furthermore, the effect of non slective beta blocker on intestinal permeability,&#xD;
      bacterial translocation and inflammatory response has been proposed to mitigate the risk of&#xD;
      developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.&#xD;

      AIM-To compare the safety and efficacy of addition of carvedilol to SMT (diuretics +/-&#xD;
      albumin) compared to SMT alone in the prevention of complicated ascites (refractory ascites,&#xD;
      AKI-HRS, SBP or severe hyponatremia) at 1year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patient of liver cirrhosis presenting with uncomplicated ascites and&#xD;
      without high risk esophageal varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prospective, randomized, single center open label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on the consecutive patients presenting with uncomplicated&#xD;
           ascites and low risk esophageal varices seen at the outpatient clinics/wards of&#xD;
           Department of Hepatology, ILBS, New Delhi from July 2021 to June 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: 2years from the date of ethics approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size with justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assuming that the complication rate in carvedilol group is 8% and placebo 30% so the&#xD;
           complication free rate of 92% and 70 % further assuming alpha -5%, power 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator need to enrol 108 cases in two groups further with 10% drop out rate it was&#xD;
           decided to enroll 120 cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomisation into two groups by block randomisation method,taking block size 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomized into two Arms A &amp; B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A will receive carvedilol plus standard medical therpy,Carvedilol: will be started&#xD;
           with initial dose of 3.125 mg BD then After 3 days, increase the dose to 6.25 mg BD,&#xD;
           Maximum dose would be 12.5 mg BD, the same shall be switch to Maximum tollrated dose if&#xD;
           SBP &gt;90, HR &gt;55.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B will receive standard medical therapy.SMT (as described) that is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade II ascites - Lasilactone (20/50) OD then Change after 1 week as per response,&#xD;
           monitor diuretic intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade III ascites will undergo large volume paracentesis, lasilactone (20/50) OD Both&#xD;
           groups will receive albumin as indicated (LT references as per protocol will be send for&#xD;
           eligible patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Diuretic intolerance -Na, K, urea, creatnine will be monitred first weekly then once&#xD;
           monthly then SOS as per need&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Carvedilol heart rate will be monitored first weekly then monthly then SOS as per&#xD;
           need&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose of carvedilol will be adjusted as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other treatments given: Alumbin infusion to both group, lasilactone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications / Organ failures (3m, 6m, 1y or detected during tele/online consult or on&#xD;
           opd basis&#xD;
