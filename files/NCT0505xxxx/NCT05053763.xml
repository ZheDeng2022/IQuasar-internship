      Remimazolam has shown promising results for sedation in colonoscopy . Alfentanil is widely&#xD;
      used in the analgesia of ERCP . The purpose of the study was to determine the 90% Effective&#xD;
      Dose of Remimazolam for Duodenoscopy Insertion During ERCP With Alfentanil 10µg/kg&#xD;

      1. Title:The 90% Effective Dose of Remimazolam for Duodenoscopy Insertion During ERCP With&#xD;
      Alfentanil 10µg/kg 2. Research center: Single center. 3. The population of the study: Age is&#xD;
      between 18 and 85 years; ASA I and II levels; Patients undergone elective ERCP surgery,&#xD;
      non-intubation patients; 4. Sample size:The sample size was decided based on that of prior&#xD;
      Literature.The study was carried out using a biased coin design up-and-down sequential&#xD;
      method, where the dose of remimazolam administered to each patient depended on the response&#xD;
      of the previous one with success/failure duodenoscopy insertion during ERCP are required for&#xD;
      reliable estimates. The first patient recruited received a dose of 0.2mg/kg, based on our&#xD;
      past experience.Subsequently, if a patient had a failure duodenoscopy insertion, the dose of&#xD;
      remimazolam was increased by 0.025mg/kg in the next subject. If a patient had a successful&#xD;
      duodenoscopy insertion the next subject was randomised to receive either a lower dose (with a&#xD;
      decrement of 0.025mg/kg), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same dose, with a&#xD;
      probability of 1-b = 0.89.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement was defined as difficult duodenoscopy insertion ,gross purposeful muscular movement,&#xD;
      coughing, vomiting, or laryngospasm occurring during or after insertion of duodenoscopy .No&#xD;
      movement was depicted when the reactions mentioned earlier were absent. If MOAA /S &gt; 1 point&#xD;
      and BIS &gt; 75 after 3 minutes of injection of remimazolam , the patient is also regarded as&#xD;
      failure, and remimazolam is given to deepen anesthesia and withdraw from the test.&#xD;

    <description>The study was carried out using a biased coin design up-and-down sequential method, where the dose of remimazolam administered to each patient depended on the response of the previous one with success/failure duodenoscopy insertion during ERCP are required for reliable estimates. The first patient was tested at 0.2mg/kg remimazolam (0.025mg/kg as a step size). Duodenoscopy insertion was conducted when MOAA/S≤1.The response of the patients to the duodenoscopy insertion during ERCP was categorized as either 'success (no movement)' or 'failure (movement). if a patient had a failure duodenoscopy insertion, the dose of remimazolam was increased by 0.025mg/kg in the next subject. If a patient had a successful duodenoscopy insertion the next subject was randomised to receive either a lower dose (with a decrement of 0.025mg/kg), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same dose, with a probability of 1-b = 0.89.</description>
