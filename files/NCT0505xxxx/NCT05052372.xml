  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancers are associated with genetic mutations that are present in the patient's&#xD;
      bladder or urothelium, the lining of the lower urinary tract. Fibroblast growth factor (FGFR)&#xD;
      alterations are present in approximately one in five patients with recurrent and refractory&#xD;
      bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect biomarker data from subjects receiving erdafitinib to further&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between treatment with erdafitinib and clinical response,&#xD;
      progression, and/or genetic alterations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect biomarker data from subjects receiving standard of&#xD;
      care erdafitinib to further investigate the relationship between treatment with erdafitinib&#xD;
      and clinical response, progression, and/or genetic alterations in cell free tumor DNA (cfDNA)&#xD;
      from blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, next generation sequencing of cfDNA isolated from blood and urine will be&#xD;
      performed by Resolution Bioscience. Blood-based cfDNA amplification and analysis is done by a&#xD;
      CLIA-approved assay and the results of which will thus be available to physicians and&#xD;
      patients. Urine-based cfDNA analysis from Resolution Bioscience is not yet approved and&#xD;
      results will only be communicated if an actionable finding is identified that is not present&#xD;
      on the blood-based test. Samples will be collected at the patients homes by a qualified&#xD;
      phlebotomist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      xCures may provide the treating physician and the subject the biomarker results from&#xD;
      blood-based cfDNA tests. Because the testing of urine DNA is experimental and done solely for&#xD;
      research, those results will not be shared unless there is an important finding known to be&#xD;
      relevant to the subject's medical care at the time of the study. The genetic tests are not&#xD;
      approved for bladder cancer, so the information generated from biomarker research studies is&#xD;
      preliminary in nature. Therefore, the significance and scientific validity of the results are&#xD;
      undetermined. xCures and/or Tyra may additionally share data with the treating physician and&#xD;
      researchers for the purposes of publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients co-enroll in an observational research study (XCELSIOR, NCT03793088) and consent to&#xD;
      provide xCures right of access to their full medical records under HIPAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient clinical data is structured and centralized by xCures in a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant&#xD;
      REDCap Cloud database in Case Report Forms (CRFs). The CRFs are a set of electronic forms for&#xD;
      each patient that provides a record of clinical data generated according to the protocol.&#xD;
      Data is abstracted directly from medical records generated in the standard practice of&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      xCures will request medical records directly from treating institutions and from other&#xD;
      providers (commercial next generation sequencing providers, for example) and will work with&#xD;
      treating physicians to ensure the completeness and accuracy of CRF content based on&#xD;
      electronic medical records.&#xD;
