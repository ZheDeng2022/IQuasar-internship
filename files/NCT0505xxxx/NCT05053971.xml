    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of entinostat and&#xD;
      ZEN003694 in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphoma that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (advanced) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Entinostat may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. ZEN003694 may&#xD;
      bind to certain proteins and inhibit tumor cell growth. This trial aims to see how well&#xD;
      entinostat and ZEN003694 work together in treating patients with advanced or refractory solid&#xD;
      tumor or lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694&#xD;
      (ZEN003694) and entinostat in combination in patients with advanced and refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors and lymphomas based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the combination of ZEN003694&#xD;
      and entinostat. (Phase I) II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ZEN003694 and&#xD;
      entinostat in advanced/progressive pancreatic cancer. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the safety profile of ZEN003694 and entinostat in advanced and refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors and lymphomas. (Phase I) II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) of ZEN003694 and entinostat in this&#xD;
      patient population. (Phase I) III. To describe the safety profile of ZEN003694 and entinostat&#xD;
      in advanced/progressive pancreatic cancer. (Phase II) IV. To determine the progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) of ZEN003694 and&#xD;
      entinostat in this patient population. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of ZEN003694 and entinostat therapy on apoptosis, as measured by an&#xD;
      apoptosis multiplex immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effect of ZEN003694 and entinostat therapy on c-MYC and YAP1 as measured by&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of ZEN003694 and entinostat therapy on tumor burden and gene&#xD;
      expression patterns as measured by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq)&#xD;
      on circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RUN-IN PHASE: Patients receive ZEN003694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) or entinostat PO once&#xD;
      per week (QW) during days -14 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2: Patients receive entinostat PO QW on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and ZEN003694 PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Statistical and bioinformatic data analysis for laboratory non-omics data and clinical data will utilize the following general strategies, as appropriate. For single time-point lab data, tests of hypotheses concerning within-group comparisons will be completed using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous parameters of interest, or McNemar's Chi-square test for categorical parameters of interest. Between-group comparisons will be assessed using either analysis of variance (ANOVA) with adjusted least squares means or Fisher's exact test, for continuous or categorical variables of interest, respectively. For count or binary multiple time-points or correlated data, tests of between-group comparisons will be completed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) statistical procedure for longitudinal data analysis with multiple observable vectors for the same subject.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of&#xD;
             starting treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of entinostat and ZEN003694 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and BET inhibitor (BETi)&#xD;
             agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and their male&#xD;
             partner must agree to use contraception from the time of the screening pregnancy test,&#xD;
             continuing for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completing&#xD;
             the study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be&#xD;
             willing to have serial biopsies. Tumor biopsies will be performed on the most&#xD;
             accessible biopsiable site of disease. All possible precautions to avoid complications&#xD;
             will be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed. If a&#xD;
             biopsy cannot be performed safely (e.g. there is no safely accessible biopsiable&#xD;
             tumour tissue) or biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for analysis, participation&#xD;
             is still allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had any anti-cancer therapy within 14 days (or 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of the investigational products&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received radiation therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             the investigational products&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a diagnosis of NK cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia, or stable&#xD;
             chronic grade 2 toxicities that do not overlap with presumed toxicities of entinostat&#xD;
             or ZEN003694&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known untreated or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases are&#xD;
             excluded. Patients with previously treated CNS metastasis may be included provided&#xD;
             that they have stable CNS disease for at least 4 weeks (confirmed by imaging) without&#xD;
             symptoms and are off corticosteroids (above physiologic dose) for that indication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant malabsorption or nausea and vomiting that would interfere&#xD;
             with oral therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bleeding diathesis or clinically significant bleeding within the prior 6&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to entinostat (e.g. medications that have a benzamide structure (tiapride,&#xD;
             remoxipride, clebopride) or ZEN003694&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 or substrates of CYP1A2 with narrow therapeutic windows are&#xD;
             ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and substrates of CYP1A2 must be&#xD;
             discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694. Because the lists&#xD;
             of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because entinostat is an HDACi and&#xD;
             ZEN003694 is a BETi with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with entinostat or ZEN003694, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued throughout the treatment period and for at least 28 days&#xD;
             following the last dose of study treatment if the mother is treated with entinostat or&#xD;
             ZEN003694&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with either of the following cardiac criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF)&#xD;
                  &gt; 450 msec by electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concomitant use of any agent known to cause corrected QT interval (QTc)&#xD;
                  prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of a cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator with a paced ventricular rhythm&#xD;
                  limiting ECG analysis.&#xD;

               -  History or evidence of current &gt;= Class II congestive heart failure as defined by&#xD;
                  New York Heart Association (NYHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina and myocardial&#xD;
                  infarction), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within the past 6 months. Subjects&#xD;
                  with a history of stent placement requiring ongoing antithrombotic therapy (e.g.&#xD;
                  clopidogrel, prasugrel) will not be permitted to enroll. Clinically significant&#xD;
                  cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy, or cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral Factor Xa inhibitors (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban&#xD;
             otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) and Factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran). Low&#xD;
             molecular weight heparin is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with radiation to &gt; 25% of the bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had a bone-targeted radionuclide within 6 weeks of the first dose of&#xD;
             ZEN003694&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received ZEN003694 or who have been treated with an HDAC&#xD;
             inhibitor or investigational BET inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery other than diagnostic surgery, dental surgery or stenting within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of ZEN003694&#xD;
