  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute type A aortic dissection is often accompanied by postoperative pulmonary complications,&#xD;
      the cause of which is not fully understood.Angiotensin II is an important component of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which has been suggested to be involved in the development of&#xD;
      aortic dissection and pulmonary inflammation.The purpose of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      role and mechanism of angiotensin II pathway in postoperative pulmonary complications after&#xD;
      acute type A aortic dissection, and to provide reference for clinical application&#xD;
