    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled exploratory study to evaluate efficacy of FB825 in adults with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD). The study will be conduct at one medical center in Taiwan. Approximately 20&#xD;
      subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD), who meet the criteria for study entry, will be enrolled&#xD;
      to the study. All eligible subjects will receive FB825, 5mg/kg, by 1 hour IV infusion on Day&#xD;
      1. Subjects will return to the study site on Days 15, 29 and 57 for the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation. Subjects who premature withdraw from the study will have an end of study (EOS)&#xD;
      visit within 7 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The subject has a physician confirmed diagnosis of chronic atopic dermatitis based on&#xD;
             3 year history of symptoms defined by the Eichenfield revised criteria of Hannifin and&#xD;
             Rajka and supported by positive allergen specific IgE (immunoglobulin E) at the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score 16 at the screening and baseline visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score 3 (5 point scale) at the screening and&#xD;
             baseline visits.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. History of inadequate response to a stable (1 month) regimen of topical&#xD;
             corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors as treatment for AD within 3 months before&#xD;
             the screening visit. (The regimen of topical corticosteroids means medium to high&#xD;
             potency, applied for at least 28 days or for the maximum duration recommended by&#xD;
             product prescribing information.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be applying stable doses of emollient provided for atopic dermatitis&#xD;
             twice daily for at least 7 days before the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use at least two forms of birth&#xD;
             control. One must be barrier protection (i.e., condom or female condom) and the other&#xD;
