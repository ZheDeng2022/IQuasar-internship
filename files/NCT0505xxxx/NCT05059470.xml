  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, phase 2 trial of adjuvant pembrolizumab after external&#xD;
      beam radiation to the primary tumor in patients with stage IVB (disease localized to the&#xD;
      neck) ATC. This drug trial will estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS) (from the&#xD;
      start of adjuvant pembrolizumab until locoregional progression, development of distant&#xD;
      metastatic disease, or death) in stage IVB ATC patients with gross disease, treated with&#xD;
      external beam radiation (+/- concomitant chemotherapy) followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      Patients will be patients enrolled from cohort 1 and 2 (cohort 1: &gt;51 Gy; cohort 2: &lt;50 Gy).&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS) (from the start of adjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab until locoregional progression, development of distant metastatic disease, or&#xD;
      death) in stage IVB ATC patients with gross disease, treated with external beam radiation&#xD;
      (+/- concomitant chemotherapy) followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab. Patients will be patients&#xD;
      enrolled from cohort 1 and 2 (cohort 1: &gt;51 Gy; cohort 2: &lt;50 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To estimate median overall survival in stage IVB ATC patients treated with external beam&#xD;
      radiation (+/- concurrent chemotherapy) followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by dose of external beam radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To estimate the median disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with stage IVB ATC treated&#xD;
      with surgery/external beam radiation/concomitant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (cohort 3).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male/female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;
             informed consent with Pathologic findings supporting the clinical impression of&#xD;
             anaplastic thyroid carcinoma will be enrolled in this study. Diagnosis may include&#xD;
             consistent with or suggestive of terminology associated with: anaplastic thyroid&#xD;
             carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, squamous carcinoma; carcinoma with spindled,&#xD;
             giant cell, or epithelial features; poorly differentiated carcinoma with pleomorphism,&#xD;
             extensive necrosis with tumor cells present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stage IVB disease (no convincing evidence of metastatic disease outside of the neck)&#xD;
             who have unresectable disease are eligible in groups 1 or 2. Previous excisional&#xD;
             biopsy is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Stage IVB disease (no convincing evidence of metastatic disease outside of the neck)&#xD;
             who have undergone complete resection of tumor (no convincing evidence of metastatic&#xD;
             disease in the neck) are eligible in group 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must have completed external beam radiation with or without concomitant&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy to participate in groups 1 and 2. Those who have completed&#xD;
             these treatment after surgical resection of primary tumor may participate in group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients may enroll only after completing radiation. Study drug may start from 2-6&#xD;
             weeks (+2 weeks) after radiation is completed and can only be started once radiation&#xD;
             and chemotherapy-related toxicities are grade 2 or less (with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia). If a subject is consented but AEs are not grade 2 or less by 8 weeks after&#xD;
             RT is completed, that subject is not eligible and should not start pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix&#xD;
             3), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;

             and refrain from donating sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with&#xD;
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX 40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the&#xD;
