    <textblock>
      This study was designed to investigate whether the temperament and character traits of young&#xD;
      men with idiopathic scoliosis differ from healthy individuals of the same age group and&#xD;

      All patients who applied to the orthopedics and traumatology department between July 2017 and&#xD;
      June 2018 for a medical board examination were evaluated by physical and radiological&#xD;
      examination. According to the Cobb method, individuals with a Cobb angle greater than 10°&#xD;
      were diagnosed with Idiopathic Scoliosis. In the same period, healthy individuals who applied&#xD;
      for the same examination and met the inclusion criteria were determined as the control group&#xD;
      by random sampling method. All participants were evaluated by a senior psychiatrist. Before&#xD;
      the interview, all subjects fully informed about the purpose and scope of the study. After&#xD;
      their permission was obtained the study and control groups completed a socio-demographic data&#xD;
      form consisting of questions about detailed personal and medical history and, the&#xD;
      participants were asked to fill in the TCI.&#xD;
