  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax), one of the five malaria species causing parasites, has&#xD;
      the widest geographical distribution, it is rare in sub-Saharan Africa due to the absence of&#xD;
      a red blood cell receptor (Duffy antigen) in black Africans. Duffy-negative individuals are,&#xD;
      for the most part, therefore refractory to P. vivax infection and the Duffy-negative&#xD;
      phenotype is found at highest frequencies in Africa, whereas it is relatively rare elsewhere.&#xD;
      P. vivax has however, been observed as single infections in up to 5% of Duffy-negative&#xD;
      febrile patients in one health facility in Dschang, a region of low malaria transmission in&#xD;
      Western highlands of Cameroon. Whereas in the littoral South West and Southern forest of&#xD;
      Cameroon characterised by high malaria transmission, areas, there are contrasting molecular&#xD;
      evidence of human P. vivax infection. While important, the significance is limited from an&#xD;
      epidemiological point of view, concerning the source, transmission, distribution range of P.&#xD;
      vivax. There is thus a challenge in the true estimation of malaria burden, as well as the&#xD;
      attributable parasite species in infections occurring in the low transmission areas of&#xD;
      Western Cameroon. As a consequence, our understanding of the local epidemiology of malaria in&#xD;
      Western Cameroon warrants formal investigation. The current proposal is a multi-centre&#xD;
      observational study. Its purpose is to characterise the malaria species composition and&#xD;
      particularly exposure and burden of P. vivax across malaria endemic settings in Cameroon. It&#xD;
      will use multiplex serological methods based on quantitative suspension array on finger-stick&#xD;
      blood samples collected from febrile patients of ages 1-100 during two malaria transmission&#xD;
      seasons in different eco-climatic regions in Cameroon.&#xD;

      Type of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal is a multi-centre observational study in different eco-climatic regions&#xD;
      in Cameroon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dschang health district(Low transmission, highland) , Maroua (Sahel, high transmission) and&#xD;
      Bertoua-Batouri (East region, forest, perennial transmission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a period of 36 months beginning from June, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each selected health facility, children 1 year and above, and adult of both gender will be&#xD;
      eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria: inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient must be febrile (temperature &gt;37.50 C or history of fever within 24 hours of&#xD;
           arrival to the hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient must be aged 1 year or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Both males and females alike&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The patient must be able to sign a consent/assent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient must be seeking care and be suspected of malaria infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient less than 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient not having fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient not being suspected of malaria infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligible patient who refuses consent to study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient withdraws consent before or during the start of study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient, who, for any reason, refuses that sensitive data should not be processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Recruitment strategies for the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a cross sectional study that will determine a point estimate of the&#xD;
      seroprevalence of parasite species, and in particular Plasmodium vivax in Cameroon. For this&#xD;
      reason, we calculated the sample size based on an estimate of Plasmodium vivax in febrile&#xD;
      patients as reported in a study in&#xD;
      2017((1)https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-017-1722-2), to get&#xD;
      the highest power to calculate the sample population size for use in our study. Using the&#xD;
      formula n = [DEFF*Np(1-p)]/ [(d2/Z21-α/2*(N-1)+p*(1-p)] in which DEFF=design effect=1, p&#xD;
      =Hypothesised percentage frequency of outcome factor in the population=25%, from above study,&#xD;
      d=confidence limit=5%, n=sample size, we calculated the for the study in three sites to be&#xD;
      867 or 300 per site, taking into consideration a refusal rate 4%. The software OpenEpi was&#xD;
      used or the calculations (http://www.openepi.com/SampleSize/SSPropor.htm).The primary outcome&#xD;
      is the spatial seroprevalence of Plasmodium vivax among febrile patients in the three&#xD;
      epidemiological facies in Cameroon. For entomological component, WHO methods for Human&#xD;
      landing catch (HLC) will be used to catch mosquitoes in 12-15 houses in each of four&#xD;
      neighbourhoods over the periods corresponding to the beginning of malaria transmission, the&#xD;
      peak malaria transmission and at the end of the malaria transmission season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) Sample collection procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each selected health facility, febrile individuals 1 year and above will be eligible for&#xD;
      biological sample collection. Volunteers who have provided written informed consent/assent&#xD;
      will have a finger prick sampling (approximately 500μl). The skin will be cleaned and&#xD;
      sterilised using an alcohol wipe. A sterile lancet will be used for the procedure. Blood&#xD;
      collected will then be divided for use between the desired assays. Haemostasis will be&#xD;
      achieved and a bandage placed on. This 500μL of blood will be used for a malaria smear (70&#xD;
      μL), RDT based on P. falciparum and PAN-lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) antigen (10 μL), and to&#xD;
      prepare four Dried Blood Spots (DBS, Whatman 903 Protein Saver) for immunological and&#xD;
      molecular assays (4 x 100 μL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six Plasmodium antigens will be used to screen patient samples: two P.f antigens (Merozoite&#xD;
      Surface Protein-1 19kD (MSP-1) and Apical Merozoite Antigen-1 (AMA-1), three P. vivax&#xD;
      antigens (PvMSP-1 and PvAMA-1, pvRBPII), one P. malariae (PmMSP-1) and one P. ovale (PoMSP-1)&#xD;
      selected on the basis of previous studies (20). Recombinant antigen will serve as a generic&#xD;
      protein to assess immunoglobulin G (IgG) non-specific binding. Antigens for other species of&#xD;
      malaria causing parasites are used in order to eliminate cross reacting sera and identify&#xD;
      co-infections from pure P. vivax infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All antigens will be coupled to magnetic beads (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX, USA) as per prior&#xD;
      studies (18) in ISGlobal, Spain. Coupled beads will be run with a panel of known malaria&#xD;
      seronegatives to assure minimal non-specific MFI signal would be given by beads used in&#xD;
      subsequent assays. The DBS elution will be assayed for total IgM and IgG antibodies using&#xD;
      bead-based innovative multiplex technology developed and published by the training host&#xD;
      institution(18) (ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain). Negative control samples and a dilution curve&#xD;
      of hyperimmune serum will be added to each assay plate to monitor any change in control&#xD;
      values over the course of the study. All staff working directly with patients will be&#xD;
      required to take safety measures such as vaccinating against hepatitis B, the use of COVID-19&#xD;
      barrier measures and distancing, as is practiced in the hospital or higher. In addition, all&#xD;
      study staff will undergo training in a workshop on all study procedures before&#xD;
      implementation. One module in the training package will be on biosafety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field data will be entered into a password-protected database designed for the study through&#xD;
      hand held tablets at each study site. Primary data collection tool such as paper&#xD;
      questionnaires will be stored in metal cupboards with access control maintained by the&#xD;
      principal investigator of the study. Geographical location will be collected, but in the&#xD;
      dataset, it will be perturbed as well, by replacing with other coordinates which will not&#xD;
      distort the utility of the geolocation data and at minimum that the exact location of study&#xD;
      participants is not discernable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be cleaned centrally by visual inspection for outliers. The primary study outcome&#xD;
      for this will be the seroprevalence of P. vivax in the enrolled population of febrile&#xD;
      patients in different geo-ecological regions of Cameroon. A cut-off for seropositivity will&#xD;
      be determined based on the mean of log MFI values plus three standard deviations of the&#xD;
      seronegative controls. Separate cut-off values will be generated for each of the studied&#xD;
      antigens. By so doing, participants will be classified as seropositive or seronegative&#xD;
      depending on whether their antibody levels lie above or below the cut-off values. The&#xD;
      seroprevalence will be calculated for each antigen, as the proportion of seropositive&#xD;
      individuals of the total study population, per study site, and overall. The estimates will be&#xD;
      determined together with their 95% confidence intervals. Antibody responses data will be&#xD;
      log10 transformed and then adjusted for age for subsequent spatial analysis. The Bayesian&#xD;
      analytical framework using several different tools such as geographical positioning system,&#xD;
      will be used to characterise the spatial seroprevalence across different ecologies using&#xD;
      individual and geographical covariates in the model. Secondary outcomes will be the&#xD;
      prevalence and spatial distribution of malaria by infecting species. We will use bivariate&#xD;
      analysis to test for association of potential risk factors with P. vivax exposure among study&#xD;
      participants. The spatial software SaTScan will be used to identify clusters of antibody&#xD;
      responses against each antigen. The spatial analysis will be run separately for each survey&#xD;
      and spatial autocorrelation of clusters for each of the two survey time points assessed using&#xD;
      Moran's I in ArcGIS software, as done previously (22). Age-adjusted antibody residuals from&#xD;
      the regression model will be used for this analysis. Risk factors for P. vivax infection will&#xD;
      be assessed using mixed effect logistic regression analysis with sampling site (health&#xD;
      facility) considered a random effect variable. The Microsoft Excel suite as well as the&#xD;
      latest version of STATA or R-package will be used as the statistical software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: potential risks, benefits, measures taken for data confidentiality&#xD;
      and respect for the privacy of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a minimal risk study that has an ethical clearance renewal from the IRB of the&#xD;
      Cameroon Baptist Convention health Services. This clearance will be renewed yearly until&#xD;
      close of study from the National Ethics Committee for Human Health Research (CNERSH). Before&#xD;
      any study related procedure starts, we will obtain written informed consent/assent from&#xD;
      participants, and from parents or guardians if children. Febrile volunteers already seeking&#xD;
      malaria care in health facilities will participate. A 0.5ml of blood sample obtained by&#xD;
      finger stick will be used. The same blood sample will be used for a peripheral smear, rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic test, microscopy and dried blood spots. Data gathered from participants will be&#xD;
      limited to their age, gender, malaria history, symptom status, and geolocation. Geolocation&#xD;
      data will be adjusted by displacing exact coordinates within 2-3 km in the final dataset as a&#xD;
      measure of participant security and data anonymisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures will be in place to ensure confidentiality of participants and data generated.&#xD;
      Malaria is a common childhood illness and does not carry any significant stigma associated&#xD;
      with it. No remuneration to participants will be made. To guarantee the privacy of patients,&#xD;
      data and biologic samples transported between countries and research sites will only use the&#xD;
      study ID and be de-identified to the users of the data. No identifiable information will be&#xD;
      transferred between countries. At database lock, only authorized study individuals will have&#xD;
      access to the computer account containing the database. Data entry clerks will have&#xD;
      individualised password-protected accounts during entry and cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all data analysis and testing of biological specimens will be done using de-identified&#xD;
      samples, the results of the analysis will only be presented and evaluated by the scientific&#xD;
      community in a de-identified manner. At the completion of all analyses and the end of the&#xD;
      study, all hard copy materials and the study key will be destroyed. This will follow local&#xD;
      regulations that state a maximum of 15 years for data and 10 years for biological materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will involve collection of personal data including age, gender, location,&#xD;
      clinical information including temperature, and information on the use of malaria preventive&#xD;
      measures such as availability and use of insecticide treated bed nets, previous episodes of&#xD;
      malaria etc. Data will be recorded in the hospital using electronic personal data assistants&#xD;
      directly, or in case of unavailability paper. If recorded on paper, the data will be&#xD;
      transcribed to electronic form and stored in a database designed for the study. To ensure the&#xD;
      quality of the data transcribed, the database will automatically generate a pop up in case an&#xD;
      improper data is input in the system. The applicant will verify on 10 % of all data collected&#xD;
      that they have been properly entered into the database. The data operator will access the&#xD;
      database through a secured user account created in the computer containing the database. The&#xD;
      password will be changed every six months by the principal investigator until the study comes&#xD;
      to an end. The full database will not be accessible to any other person apart from designated&#xD;
      study individuals. Data may be temporally stored in a password protected external hard drive.&#xD;
      The data stored in the hard drive will provide a backup in case there are problems with the&#xD;
      computer. The second reason will be to have the data when traveling. However, the data which&#xD;
      will be shared for education and training will be de-identified, and will be anonymised&#xD;
      dataset. In accordance with national law, the data will not be stored for more than 10 years,&#xD;
      and this will be included in the information sheet in the consent process. Study volunteers&#xD;
      will also be requested to provide consent for secondary use of their data or sample during&#xD;
      the consent process prior to joining the study. All study data will be destroyed on or before&#xD;
      10 years after the study ends. Paper data will be destroyed by shredding while electronic&#xD;
      data will be destroyed by permanent deletion in all electronic devices containing data from&#xD;
      the study. The rights of persons providing data in a clinical setting is covered by the code&#xD;
      of medical practice and enshrined in the Cameroon constitution, when they are considered&#xD;
      persons. The volunteers in this research will be adequately informed of the detailed study&#xD;
      procedures and the use of secondary data and biological specimen collected, their rights, the&#xD;
      protection of their privacy and confidentiality, their freedom to withdraw from the research&#xD;
      at any time without any prejudice whatsoever concerning routine care, any form of indemnity,&#xD;
      and telephone contacts of hospital doctor, the principal investigator of the study and the&#xD;
      mobile phone contact of the responsible officers at the ethical committee(s) that granted&#xD;
      clearance. The ethical committee requires that they be reached in case a study participant&#xD;
      feels his/her rights are being violated. In all information sheets (of which the participant&#xD;
      will have a copy), the mobile phone number of the responsible contact of the ethical&#xD;
      committee will be mentioned.&#xD;
