  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study trial to assess the effectiveness of the immune response stimulated by the&#xD;
      genetically engineered Bacillus subtilis which express and display Spike protein of the&#xD;
      SARS-COV2 on the spore coat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacillus subtilis is regarded as safe organism by The Food and Drug Administration and it is&#xD;
      presented in most food sources. Preliminary experiments have shown that the genetically&#xD;
      engineered Bacillus subtilis can express and display receptor binding domain of spike protein&#xD;
      of the SARS-COV2 on its spore coat, thus successfully induce the secretion of cytokines of&#xD;
      human cells in vitro. Previous experiments also successfully demonstrated that a increased&#xD;
      detection of neutralizing IgG and igM levels in mice after oral administrated with the&#xD;
      Bacillus subtilis. This suggests that the transgenic spores of Bacillus subtilis have&#xD;
      successfully activated the immune system, producing high-affinity neutralizing antibodies and&#xD;
      memory B cells. Furthermore, no adverse effects were shown in all the mices. The engineered&#xD;
      Bacillus subtilis will be further studied in a human trials through oral administration to&#xD;
      test its safety and the immune effect resulted in human bodys.&#xD;

    <description>Bacillus subtilis, a harmless intestinal commensal, has earned in recent years, great reputation as a vaccine production host and delivery vector with advantages such as low cost, safe for human consumption and straightforward administration. The technology team has succeeded engineering Bacillus subtilis with spore coat proteins resembling the proteins of the nucleus and spikes of coronal virus. This product could have a vaccine like activity within the intestinal environment.</description>
