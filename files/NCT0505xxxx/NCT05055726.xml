      This is a phase IV clinical study whose aim is to collect data on the feasibility of a&#xD;
      preventative/therapeutic approach of radiation-induced oral mucositis with benzydamine&#xD;
      oromucosal solution (mouthwash) in patients with Head and Neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzydamine mouthwash is considered the gold standard among anti-inflammatory agents in the&#xD;
      management of oral mucositis in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2014 mucositis guidelines recommended benzydamine mouthwash for the prevention of&#xD;
      radiation-induced oral mucositis among Head and Neck Cancer patients treated with moderate&#xD;
      doses of radiation therapy. The updated 2019 guidelines not only confirm the existing&#xD;
      guidelines proving new evidences, but also recommend to use benzydamine as preventative&#xD;
      treatment of radiation-induced Oromucositi among Head and Neck Cancer. patients treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy with/without systemic concurrent treatments and confirm benzydamine&#xD;
      mouthwash as the only anti-inflammatory agent with evidence in prevention of oral mucositis&#xD;
      to date.&#xD;

    <description>Benzydamine Hydrochloride 0.15% w/v oromucosal solution (mouthwash), Angelini Pharma S.p.A., is assigned to the patients for radiation-induced oromucositis.&#xD;
The patients take at home 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of concentrated or diluted (with water) mouthwash 2-3 times a day, but not more than 5 times a day, washing the mouth and throat for 20-30 seconds, according to the Investigator's indications and the local product's SmPC.&#xD;
In Hungary, the therapy should started with diluted product (15 ml of water + 15 ml of concentrated solution). After that, gargling can be continued with 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of concentrated mouthwash, generally 2-3 times a day, but not more than 5 times a day.&#xD;
In Poland, the solution is used 2 to 3 times daily; at a single time, it should be used approximately 15 ml of concentrated or diluted mouthwash with a small amount of water and wash the mouth and throat for 20 to 30 seconds.</description>
