  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women Veterans are the fastest growing segment of VA users. This dramatic growth has created&#xD;
      challenges for VA to ensure that appropriate services are available to meet women Veterans'&#xD;
      needs, and that they will want and be able to use those services. This program, EMPOWER QUERI&#xD;
      2.0, uses mixed methods to evaluate two strategies designed to support implementation and&#xD;
      sustainment of three preventive evidence-based practices for women Veterans. The&#xD;
      evidence-based practices address prevention of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and&#xD;
      perinatal depression, all of which are high-priority health conditions among women. The&#xD;
      investigators will implement these evidence-based practices in 20 VA facilities across four&#xD;
      regions; some of the facilities are rural, and some are low-performing in women's health. All&#xD;
      three evidence-based practices will be available virtually (e.g., online, by telephone or&#xD;
      telehealth) so that women can engage in them at their convenience. This virtual care approach&#xD;
      is of great importance to VA because it can increase access to care and thereby improve&#xD;
      Veterans' health outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women Veterans are the fastest-growing segment of users in the Veterans Health Administration&#xD;
      (VA). Their numbers are projected to increase by 73%, from 9.3% to 16.4%, between 2015 and&#xD;
      2043. Despite VA investment in improving care for women Veterans, gender disparities persist&#xD;
      in cardiovascular (CV) and diabetes risk factor control. Also, the rate of perinatal&#xD;
      depression among women Veterans is higher than that among civilian women, which is of&#xD;
      particular concern given the association between perinatal depression and suicidality.&#xD;
      Barriers to care for women Veterans include distance to VA care, rurality, competing work and&#xD;
      caregiving responsibilities, comorbid mental health issues, and harassment on VA grounds.&#xD;
      Improvements are still needed to increase women Veterans' access to and engagement in&#xD;
      convenient, safe, evidence-based, patient-centered care that achieves the VA &quot;lane of effort&quot;&#xD;
      of Veterans' &quot;lifelong health, well-being, and resilience.&quot; Since its inception in 2015, the&#xD;
      Enhancing Mental and Physical health of Women through Engagement and Retention (EMPOWER)&#xD;
      QUERI 1.0 team has focused on implementing gender-tailored care models for women Veteran&#xD;
      patients. In EMPOWER 1.0 studies, women expressed preferences for gender-specific (women&#xD;
      only) care and for virtual care options. Therefore, the EMPOWER 2.0 Impact Goal is to expand&#xD;
      access to virtual, evidence-based, preventive lifestyle and mental health services for women&#xD;
      Veterans with high-priority health conditions in rural and urban-isolation areas. To achieve&#xD;
      this impact goal, the investigators are conducting a Level 3 QUERI Program with three aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using two implementation strategies (Replicating Effective Practices [REP] and&#xD;
           Evidence-Based Quality Improvement [EBQI]), support implementation and sustainment of&#xD;
           three evidence-based practices (EBPs) focused on preventive lifestyle and mental health&#xD;
           care for women Veterans across 20 VA facilities (10 with REP, 10 with EBQI), several of&#xD;
           which are rural, low-performing in women's health care, and/or lead sites for high&#xD;
           reliability organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a mixed methods implementation evaluation using a cluster randomized type 3&#xD;
           hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial design. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
           effectiveness of REP and EBQI in terms of: (a) improved access to and rates of&#xD;
           engagement in virtual preventive lifestyle and mental health services and improved VA&#xD;
           performance metrics for virtual and telehealth care delivery and related clinical&#xD;
           outcomes for women Veterans; (b) progression along the Stages of Implementation&#xD;
           Completion; (c) adaptation, sensemaking, and experiences of EBP implementation among&#xD;
           multilevel stakeholders; and (d) cost and return on investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Generate implementation &quot;playbooks&quot; for program partners that are scalable and serve as&#xD;
           guidance for future implementation of a broader array of evidence-based women's health&#xD;
           programs and policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will implement three EBPs: 1) Virtual Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an&#xD;
      evidence-based lifestyle intervention emphasizing moderate weight loss, diet, and physical&#xD;
      activity that has been shown to prevent and/or delay progression to type 2 diabetes; 2)&#xD;
      Telephone Lifestyle Coaching Program (TLC), developed by one of the investigators' partners&#xD;
      (National Center for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion), which provides evidence-based&#xD;
      virtual (telephone-based), individual health coaching focused on wellness and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease prevention; and 3) Reach Out, stay Strong, Essentials (ROSE), an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention for prevention of perinatal depression that can be delivered via telehealth.&#xD;
      EMPOWER QUERI 2.0 will constitute a major milestone in achieving VA priorities of improving&#xD;
      access to care and Veterans' lifelong health, well-being, and resilience. This program will&#xD;
      not only enhance care for women Veterans across 20 VA sites, but also shed fundamental&#xD;
      insights on how best to sustain these improvements to inform broader dissemination across VA.&#xD;
