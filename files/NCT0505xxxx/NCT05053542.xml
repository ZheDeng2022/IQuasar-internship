  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidectomy is an common treatment for high-grade hemorrhoids. The necessity of&#xD;
      preoperative bowel preparation (PBP) in hemorrhoidectomy is inconclusive. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the benefit and safety of PBP in hemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidectomy is an effective treatment for high-grade hemorrhoids and is recommended in&#xD;
      patients with grade III-IV hemorrhoids. Common hemorrhoidectomy approaches include stapled&#xD;
      hemorrhoidopexy and conventional procedures, such as Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy and&#xD;
      Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy. Conventional techniques produce a lower recurrence rate,&#xD;
      whereas stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with fewer postoperative complications and&#xD;
      shorter recovery time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common complications after hemorrhoidectomy include urinary retention, pain, and delayed&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Surgical site infection is a rare complication after hemorrhoid excision.&#xD;
      Traditional opinions held that preoperative bowel preparation (PBP) reduces fecal mass and&#xD;
      bacterial count in the bowel lumen, minimizing the risk of infective and anastomotic&#xD;
      complications. However, a study that evaluated intramucosal bacterial count demonstrated that&#xD;
      PBP does not reduce the colon bacterial count. A randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating&#xD;
      the effect of PBP before colorectal surgery suggested that the procedure can be omitted.&#xD;
      However, another RCT with 79 participants revealed that bowel preparation before anorectal&#xD;
      surgery can result in less pain during the first postoperative defecation. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      with 36 studies concluded that PBP before elective colorectal surgery does not affect the&#xD;
      postoperative complication rate. On the contrary, the necessity of PBP before anorectal&#xD;
      surgeries remains unreported. The choice of whether PBP has to be performed is often the&#xD;
      surgeon's preference. It may be challenging for physicians to determine the appropriate&#xD;
      decision of PBP before hemorrhoidectomy to reduce postoperative complications while&#xD;
      minimizing patient discomfort.&#xD;
