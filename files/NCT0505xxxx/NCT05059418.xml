  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first part of this study is to optimize diagnostic criteria for BMS, i.e. not a clinical&#xD;
      trial, and will not be covered in this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part will compare topical treatment with clonazepam, capsaicin and placebo in a&#xD;
      n-of-1 study design regarding effects of pain, pain-related disability, somatosensory changes&#xD;
      in the trigeminal nerve and patient experience in patients with primary BMS or other oral&#xD;
      mucosal pain. The patients will be treated for two weeks with each drug, with a one-week&#xD;
      wash-out period in between. After the last washed-out period, the patients will be able to&#xD;
      chose the treatment that they prefer the most and continue with that treatment during 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      The clinical trial in the present study will investigate treatment effects on pain,&#xD;
      pain-related disability, jaw function and patients' experiences by topical treatment with&#xD;
      clonazepam or capsaicin in comparison with placebo in patients with BMS or other oral mucosal&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with primary BMS and 20 patients with other oral mucosal pain will be&#xD;
      included. The study will comprise a n-of-1-design where each participant will be it's own&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare topical treatment with clonazepam, capsaicin and placebo regarding&#xD;
      effects of pain, pain-related disability, somatosensory changes in the trigeminal nerve and&#xD;
      patient experience. primary outcome will be pain intensity and patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated for two weeks with each drug, with a one-week wash-out period in&#xD;
      between. After the last washed-out period, the patients will be able to chose the treatment&#xD;
      that they prefer the most and continue with that treatment during 6 months. After this 6&#xD;
      months, pain, pain-related disability, somatosensory changes in the trigeminal nerve and&#xD;
      patient experience will be assessed again.&#xD;
