  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tabula Rasa HealthCare (TRHC), d/b/a CareKinesis, is the first national pharmacy that&#xD;
      provides science-based medication risk identification and mitigation technologies and&#xD;
      services. CareKinesis utilizes medication decision support tools and pharmacists certified in&#xD;
      geriatrics to provide pharmacy services for various healthcare organizations including PACE&#xD;
      organizations (described above). Presently, CareKinesis services more than 35 PACE&#xD;
      organizations, including approximately 140 PACE sites, across the country. As a national PACE&#xD;
      pharmacy provider since 2011, CareKinesis focuses on improving medication regimens to reduce&#xD;
      medication-related risks while enhancing economic, clinical and humanistic outcomes.&#xD;
      Pharmacist-led clinical services and medication safety reviews are currently being offered to&#xD;
      PACE organizations under the direction of licensed healthcare prescribers by TRHC&#xD;
      (CareKinesis). Through mutual data-sharing agreements, patient data will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively for patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRHC via other programs such as the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Enhanced Medication&#xD;
      Therapy Management program with BlueCross BlueShield Northern Plain Alliance and ClearStone,&#xD;
      or via collaboration as third party with other health plans can have access to de-identified&#xD;
      patient's data. TRHC has also established an agreement with the Watson IBM database to&#xD;
      retrieve relevant patients' information for research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is a retrospective observational study which does not involve interaction&#xD;
      neither intervention with any subjects or their treatment. Using deidentified data, we plan&#xD;
      to collect information about every subject including but not limited to demographic&#xD;
      information (age, gender, race), drug claims, health outcomes and disease outcomes (using&#xD;
      ICD10 codes), and cost. Data will be collected from the time patient enrolled in PACE in&#xD;
      partnership with TRHC or from other health care plans working in collaboration with TRHC.&#xD;
      Subjects prescribed antiplatelet agents will be identified. ICD10 codes will be used to&#xD;
      determine disease conditions (type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, non-diabetic). Next, patients&#xD;
      prescribed clopidogrel will be identified from patients prescribed alternate anti-platelet&#xD;
      therapy (excluding aspirin). For each cohort, Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) outcomes,&#xD;
      hospitalization data relating to bleeding incidents, stent thrombosis, mortality due to&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality outcomes will be extracted from ICD10 codes&#xD;
      and health insurance data. Using the medication list, the medication risk score (MRSÂ®) and&#xD;
      cost data will be extracted and analyses will be conducted to address our study objectives.&#xD;
