  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term durability of response over a&#xD;
      24-week period following withdrawal of nemolizumab in participants with prurigo nodularis&#xD;
      (PN) who previously responded to treatment in the Long-term-Extension (LTE) study&#xD;
      RD.06.SPR.202699. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety of&#xD;
      nemolizumab compared to placebo over a 24-week period in subjects with PN who previously&#xD;
      responded to treatment in the LTE study.&#xD;

    <description>Pruritus NRS is a scale that will be used by the participants to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours. For maximum itch intensity: the scores are provided on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being 'worst itch imaginable'. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An NRS relating to sleep disturbance (SD NRS) will be completed by the participants to report the degree of their sleep loss related to PN. The SD NRS will ask for a unit score on an 11-point scale (0 to 10). The question asked will be: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;no sleep loss related to the symptoms of my skin disease (prurigo nodularis)&quot; and 10 being &quot;I did not sleep at all due to the symptoms of my skin disease (prurigo nodularis)&quot;, how would you rate your sleep last night?&quot;</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a validated 10-item questionnaire covering domains including symptoms/feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. The participant will rate each question ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) and score ranges from 0 to 30. A higher total score indicates a poorer quality of life (QoL).</description>

&#xD;
          2. Body weight less than (&lt;) 30 kg (kilogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receipt of prohibited medications, including rescue therapy, in the LTE study&#xD;

             study, or may interfere with study assessments (e.g., poor venous access or&#xD;
             needle-phobia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Planning or expected to have a major surgical procedure during the clinical study&#xD;
