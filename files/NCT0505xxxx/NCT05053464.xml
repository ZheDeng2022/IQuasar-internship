      A pilot survey for a Discrete Choice Experience to understand the strength of patient's&#xD;
      preferences for alternative models of care for fibromyalgia.&#xD;

      We will use the Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) method to elicit preferences for alternative&#xD;
      models of care for people with fibromyalgia. The DCE is a choice-based survey that quantifies&#xD;
      preferences for attributes (or features) of goods, services or policy interventions. It&#xD;
      assumes that any good or service (in this case models of care for fibromyalgia) can be&#xD;
      described by its attributes and the measure (or 'levels') of these attributes. Each&#xD;
      respondent faces a series of hypothetical scenarios (choice sets) composed of two or more&#xD;
      alternatives. In each choice set, respondents are asked to choose their preferred scenario.&#xD;
      The principle underlying a DCE is choices are made based on the features (or attributes) of&#xD;
      different actions. Therefore, a DCE enables researchers to gain insight into the relative&#xD;
      importance of each attribute, and the trade-offs between attributes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a survey of participants identified from a previous study about chronic&#xD;
      widespread pain (&quot;MAintaining MusculOskeleTal Health&quot; - MAmMOTH). As part of the MAmMOTH&#xD;
      study, a randomly selected sample of adults aged 25 years and over registered with&#xD;
      participating general practices in Scotland were mailed a screening questionnaire. All&#xD;
      individuals who returned the completed screening questionnaire and who met some criteria for&#xD;
      fibromyalgia and consented to be contacted for future health survey research were approached&#xD;
      for a further survey, the DEHLTA study. The DEHLTA survey questionnaire asked participants if&#xD;
      they had ever received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. From respondents to the DEHLTA study,&#xD;
      individuals who said they had a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and who consented to be contacted&#xD;
      for future studies will be eligible to participate in the current pilot study. We estimate&#xD;
      this will be approximately 80 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reporting a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the DEHLTA survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consenting to be contacted for future health survey research in the DEHLTA survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not reporting a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the DEHLTA survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not consenting to be contacted for future health survey research in the DEHLTA survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals will receive a one-off paper questionnaire (including an invitation&#xD;
      letter, a patient information sheet, and a prepaid, preaddressed envelope) and be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the current study. A reminder letter will be mailed two weeks later. Mailings&#xD;
      will be carried out by study staff at the University of Aberdeen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyse the feasibility of the model of data collection and quality of the&#xD;
      questionnaire responses by estimating response rate, questionnaire completion times, item&#xD;
      response and qualitative feedback on question items. In addition, we will assess frequencies&#xD;
      and associations in choice responses to examine the strength of preferences relating to&#xD;
      service provision in terms of the specified attributes (time to diagnosis, diagnosis&#xD;
      provider, treatment type, waiting time, and type of on-going help and support). The data&#xD;
      analysis conducted will inform the design of a larger study involving participants from a&#xD;
      national patient organisation.&#xD;
