  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complex multifactorial disease, mainly manifested by deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE events increase the length of&#xD;
      hospitalization and treatment costs and seriously affect the quality of life of patients, so&#xD;
      it is increasingly appreciated to identify high-risk patients with VTE and take preventive&#xD;
      measures. The Padua prediction score (PPS) and Caprini risk assessment model (RAM) are widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice as common risk assessment scales in medical and surgical&#xD;
      departments, respectively. And D-dimer levels have been considered as a well indicator to&#xD;
      rule out acute VTE. Previous epidemiological studies on VTE have found the risk of VTE is&#xD;
      significantly higher in hospitalized patients than in the general population and the&#xD;
      prophylaxis decisions vary among countries, hospitals and departments, indicating current&#xD;
      in-hospital VTE prevention strategies are far from optimal and it's imperative to&#xD;
      regionalized control of VTE. Therefore, a single-institution-based risk profile study of&#xD;
      in-hospital VTE patients is designed to explore current situation of VTE occurrence and&#xD;
      predictive efficacy of widely used risk assessment models as well as D-dimer in one of the&#xD;
      general hospitals in Beijing, China.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators recruited adult inpatients attending Tsinghua Chang Gung&#xD;
      Hospital in Beijing from June 2018 to April 2020, screened for patients with a hospital stay&#xD;
      over 3 days and new-onset of VTE during hospital stay, and identified the in-hospital VTE&#xD;
      patients after excluding patients who presented for DVT and/or PE. Similarly, negative&#xD;
      patients were selected by not having a VTE during hospital stay. The diagnosis of VTE was&#xD;
      confirmed as the occurrence of a critical value alert during hospitalization, which was&#xD;
      predefined as ultrasound/radiology report of DVT or/and PE. Data was collected from the TEACH&#xD;
      database of Beijing Tsinghua Chang Gung Hospital affiliated with Tsinghua University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients baseline characteristics were extracted from database. VTE risk assessment was&#xD;
      conducted with either Caprini risk assessment model (surgical patients) or Padua prediction&#xD;
      score (medical patients). The evaluation was started upon admission and regularly repeated&#xD;
      depending on the patient's condition. The last evaluation was conducted before discharge. The&#xD;
      D-dimer values during hospitalization were also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of in-hospital VTE, distributions of in-hospital VTE patients and the receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curves were analyzed.&#xD;
