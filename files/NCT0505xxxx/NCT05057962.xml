      We conducted a retrospective observational study of adult participants receiving only SOC&#xD;
      (dexamethasone 8 mg or its equivalent plus oxygen, HNFO or eventual IMV) versus participants&#xD;
      receiving SOC plus TCZ (8mg/kg as a single dose) as treatment for severe or critical SARS&#xD;
      CoV2 pneumonia. The inclusion date will be the date of admission, and follow up will conclude&#xD;
      at death or discharge (whichever occurs first) to describe clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      characteristics and outcome of adult participants receiving only standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      versus participants receiving SOC plus TCZ as treatment for severe or critical SARS CoV2&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

      Settings Emergency Department, General Ward and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Sanatorio&#xD;
      Finochietto in Buenos Aires City, Argentina. Sanatorio Finochietto is a third level health&#xD;
      care facility that provides health care services in prevalent clinical and surgical&#xD;
      pathologies. It has the formerly mentioned units; as well as a Maternity Ward and&#xD;
      complementary services (such as Laboratory, Radiology and Hemodynamics) and a total of 161&#xD;
      beds 30 of which are ICU beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Adult participants 18 years old and older receiving SOC plus TCZ versus only SOC&#xD;

      March 1st and August 31st 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group couldn't receive TCZ because they were out of therapeutic&#xD;
      window or had secondary infections suspicion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure variable is TCZ yes/no.&#xD;

      Data circuit Information will be collected from electronic records. Given that all severe&#xD;

      calculation won't be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis In the descriptive analysis, quantitative data are expressed as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation or median and interquartile range 25-75 (IQR) according to their&#xD;
      distribution. Data normality was evaluated using charts and Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test.&#xD;
      Qualitative data are expressed as absolute and relative frequency in percentage. For&#xD;
      comparison between groups, chi2 or Fisher test were used according to assumptions for&#xD;
      qualitative data and Wilcoxon for quantitative data according to their distribution. A&#xD;
      significance level of less than 0.05 was considered. R software version 4.0.3 was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations This investigation will be conducted under national and international&#xD;
      regulatory rules about human health investigations; and according to Ministry Resolutions,&#xD;
      Helsinki declaration and all its amendments and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines ICH E6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be processed with the utmost confidentiality and anonymously, with&#xD;
      restricted access only to authorized personnel and for study purposes only according to&#xD;
      current legislation of National Personal Data Protection Laws (Ley de Habeas data) and Law&#xD;
      26529/09.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be encoded using a numerical code randomly generated. This code will replace the&#xD;
      patient's name and last name. Identificatory data in database comprehensed in the 18&#xD;
      identifiers of HIPPA rules will be eliminated (A su vez se eliminar√°n los datos&#xD;
      identificatorios de la base de datos a analizar comprendido por los 18 identificadores&#xD;
      detallados por las normas HIPAA). Database will be saved in a computer and accessed with a&#xD;
      code and only by the principal investigator. After statistical analysis it will be&#xD;
      eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study and uses a secondary database, and constitutes a minimal risk&#xD;
      investigation; so according to CIOMS 2016 and Pauta 10, exception of informed consent for&#xD;
      participants is requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Secondary infections, death at discharge, WHO COVID 19 ordinal scale on Clinical&#xD;
      Improvement at 14 days from worsening or discharge (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financing Cost in administrative and human resources for the study will be assumed by&#xD;
      principal investigators. There will be no extraordinary costs for subjects nor health care&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
