    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called HMBD-001 (an anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody)&#xD;
      in patients with advanced HER3 positive solid tumours. The main aims are to find out the&#xD;
      maximum dose of HMBD-001 that can be given safely to patients alone and in combination with&#xD;
      other anti-cancer agents, more about the potential side effects of HMBD-001 and how these can&#xD;
      be treated and what happens to HMBD-001 inside the body and how it affects cancer cells.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HMBD-001 is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody, which works by targeting a protein&#xD;
      called HER3, that is found in high numbers in some types of cancers including those which&#xD;
      contain NRG1 gene fusions. By attaching itself to this protein it may then work to kill the&#xD;
      cancer cells or to stop them growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-human clinical trial which has two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a 'dose escalation' phase where small groups of patients will receive increasing&#xD;
      doses of HMBD-001 to find the safest dose which best targets cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Arm 1, patients will receive HMBD-001 on its own (as a single agent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Arm 2, patients will receive HMBD-001 given with other anti-cancer drugs (in&#xD;
           combination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a 'dose expansion' phase where larger groups of patients with specific cancer&#xD;
      types, known to have high levels of the protein HER3 or a confirmed NRG1 gene fusion will&#xD;
      receive the highest doses of HMBD-001 considered to be safe in Part A either alone as single&#xD;
      agent or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the clinical trial are to find out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The highest dose of HMBD-001 alone and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs that&#xD;
           can be given safely to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More about the potential side effects of HMBD-001 when given alone and in combination&#xD;
           with other anti-cancer agents and how they can be managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What happens to HMBD-001 inside the body and how it affects cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The potential anti-tumour activity of HMBD-001 as a single agent and in various&#xD;
           combination regimens in specific tumour types of HER3 expressing tumours or tumours with&#xD;
           NRG1 gene fusions.&#xD;
