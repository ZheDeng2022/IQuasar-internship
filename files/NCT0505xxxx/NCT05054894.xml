      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of albumin-infused plasmapheresis, using the&#xD;
      Fresenius Kabi 'Amicus' apheresis machine, among patients with age-related frailty&#xD;
      characterized by reduced physical, cognitive and immunological functioning. Secondarily, this&#xD;
      study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated plasmapheresis&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      As population aging continues to accelerate around the world, there is increasing recognition&#xD;
      of health burdens related to frailty. Age-related frailty indisputably reduces quality of&#xD;
      life for an aging-individual, as well as for caregiving individuals. To date, there is no&#xD;
      proven effective therapy or cure for age-related frailty. There is an urgent need to address&#xD;
      the burden of frailty with possible therapeutic solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One model of aging once proposed nine hallmarks of aging which fall into three categories: 1)&#xD;
      primary causes of cellular damage (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic&#xD;
      alterations, loss of proteostasis); 2) compensatory or antagonistic responses to damage&#xD;
      (e.g., deregulated nutrient sensing; mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence); and 3)&#xD;
      the integrative result of (1) and (2) that is considered responsible for functional decline&#xD;
      (e.g., stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication). In more recent reports,&#xD;
      frailty has been defined as a syndrome related to the fatigue of physiological systems; in&#xD;
      other words, it is &quot;a state of increased vulnerability to poor resolution of homeostasis&#xD;
      after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in many physiological&#xD;
      systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes homeostatic reserves until minor&#xD;
      stressor events trigger disproportionate changes in health status&quot;. This definition of&#xD;
      frailty as a syndrome whose incidence increases with aging is based on research that&#xD;
      highlights its relationship with various biological processes rather than chronological age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that an underlying mechanism leading to many frailty-related&#xD;
      neurological diseases is a gradual build up of certain molecules in patients' plasma.&#xD;
      Molecules such as auto-antibodies develop naturally over time in response to disease over a&#xD;
      patient's life span, but build up of these molecules has been linked to both central and&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinsons. Specifically,&#xD;
      beta-amyloid accumulation and toxic autoimmunity-related proteins have been used as markers&#xD;
      of aging-related neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). Considering this, a successful treatment for many neurological disorders&#xD;
      including those listed has been the process of Plasmapheresis. In Plasmapheresis, the process&#xD;
      is to extract some of a patient's blood, remove a percentage of the plasma in the blood, and&#xD;
      finally replace it with either 1) donor plasma, 2) albumin, or 3) a combination of saline&#xD;
      with albumin. This process ultimately dilutes the amount of harmful molecules. The American&#xD;
      Society for Apheresis (ASFA) has determined that Plasmapheresis is accepted as a Category 1&#xD;
      (or first-line therapy) for nervous system disorders that exhibit frailty symptoms such as:&#xD;
      Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre Syndrome), Chronic&#xD;
      Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested low serum hypoalbuminemia (albumin) is a significant risk factor for&#xD;
      frailty in elderly patients. Therefore, a possible treatment approach for age-related frailty&#xD;
      is to not only remove the build up of harmful molecules with plasmapheresis, but to replenish&#xD;
      serum albumin during reinfusion. A recent study demonstrated that utilizing albumin in&#xD;
      plasmapheresis decreased concentration of Amyloid-Beta plaque build up in cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid, as well as increased scores on cognitive, functional, and behavioral tests in elderly&#xD;
      patients with Alzheimer's Disease. The present study is therefore designed to assess clinical&#xD;
      benefit of plasmapheresis with albumin in patients with age related frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is being undertaken as an open-label study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of plasmapheresis as an intervention for patients with age-related frailty.&#xD;
      Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests that are appropriate for&#xD;
      repeated measures. The present study can be easily implemented because instruments have been&#xD;
      in routine clinical deployment providing for a high degree of availability and reliability.&#xD;
      Quality assurance is tightly controlled. The study population is sufficiently broad and the&#xD;
      conditions of interest are sufficiently prevalent so that recruitment of subjects is not a&#xD;
      limiting factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this protocol will be closely monitored and data will be used to determine&#xD;
      whether any significant safety issues exist when using plasmapheresis. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      noted whenever they occur but will be recorded at the time of the procedure and throughout&#xD;
      routine follow-ups, which will persist weekly throughout the duration of the active study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a thorough discussion to obtain informed consent. If the patient is&#xD;
      unable to provide consent due to cognitive decline, consent will be provided by a legally&#xD;
      authorized representative (LAR). Additional meetings with the physicians will further clarify&#xD;
      the nature of the study and the possible risks involved. The nature of this study does not&#xD;
      require randomization, but rather attempts to isolate adverse and advantageous events should&#xD;
      they occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients deemed appropriate candidates for plasmapheresis will be treated for a total of 6&#xD;
      sessions; 1 session per week or month - This time frame is dependent on the acuteness of the&#xD;
      patient's condition.. Each treatment will take roughly 1.5 hours to complete, depending on&#xD;
      the specific patient's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in this research study will be recruited through medical practice. There are no&#xD;
      enrollment restrictions based on race or ethnic origin. There are also no additional&#xD;
      benefits, risks, advantages, or disadvantages based on any race or ethnic origin. This study&#xD;
      will seek to enroll a total of 100 subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Following all necessary screening and consenting protocol, patients will be scheduled for the plasmapheresis procedure.&#xD;
Plasmapheresis&#xD;
On the days of the scheduled procedure, patients will undergo up to 1.5 hours of plasmapheresis treatment. Patients will be awake and situated in a relaxed position in a reclined chair. The plasmapheresis device to be used is the Fresenius Kabi 'Amicus', which is currently FDA approved for a variety of clinical conditions. In one treatment, roughly 60-70% of a patient's plasma can safely be replaced; by using six consecutive treatments, more of the patient's plasma (approaching 100%) will be replaced in an exponential fashion.</description>
