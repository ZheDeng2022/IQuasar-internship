  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, three-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      clinical effects of a nurse-led, very brief, preoperative mindfulness-based intervention for&#xD;
      hip and knee replacement patients will be investigated relative to an audio-recorded very&#xD;
      brief, preoperative mindfulness-based intervention delivered during the standard nurse&#xD;
      consult and a nurse-led preoperative pain psychoeducation intervention during the standard&#xD;
      nurse consult.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the 10 minute preoperative nurse visit</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most intense pain imaginable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Unpleasantness Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the 10 minute preoperative nurse visit</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 representing the most unpleasant pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Medication Desire Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the 10 minute preoperative nurse visit</time_frame>
    <description>Single Likert scale item ranging from 0-10, with 0 indicating no desire for pain medication and 10 representing a strong desire for pain medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Functioning Item Bank, v2.0</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 6 weeks prior to surgery and at the 6-week outpatient follow-up appointment</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS physical functioning computer assisted test draws from a bank of 123 items all scored on a 5 point Likert scale.&#xD;
T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A high score indicates better physical functioning.</description>

    <description>Nurses will read patients a brief (1 minute) scripted, introduction to mindfulness and then have them listen to a very brief (1 minute 30 second) guided mindfulness practice validated in our prior research to encourage focused attention on breath and body sensations and open monitoring and acceptance of discursive thoughts, negative emotions, and pain. Finally, patients will be given an audio recording of the mindful pain management technique for use any time.</description>
