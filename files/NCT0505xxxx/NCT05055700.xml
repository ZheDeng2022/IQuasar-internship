  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the effect of a culturally sensitive prenatal genetic testing (PGT) education&#xD;
      intervention delivered via a mobile application on pregnant women's perceptions, knowledge,&#xD;
      and uptake of PGT. Our working hypothesis, based on prior studies, is that pregnant women who&#xD;
      receive a culturally sensitive intervention to enhance their knowledge and understanding of&#xD;
      PGT will feel more confident in their decision-making regarding PGT.&#xD;
