      Breast cancer ranks first among the cancers seen in women in the world and in Turkey .&#xD;
      Physical and psychological symptoms may occur in breast cancer depending on the disease or&#xD;
      the treatment applied. These symptoms cause patients to be perceived as a life-threatening&#xD;
      disease and decrease their quality of life. This situation can create a crisis situation by&#xD;
      deeply affecting the physical, psychosocial, behavioral and spiritual aspects of patients. In&#xD;
      such a case, the patient can start using spiritual coping methods by turning to spirituality&#xD;
      while facing a painful illness. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer have difficulty in&#xD;
      finding the meaning and purpose of life, question their previous beliefs about life, and&#xD;
      their concerns about spirituality, both existential and religious, increase. Spiritual&#xD;
      dimensions, which are an important component of the patient's quality of life, are an&#xD;
      integral part of patient care. Spirituality is used as a means of coping with cancer by&#xD;
      providing inner strength, peace, comfort and integrity and can play an important role in&#xD;
      healing and having a good mood . Therefore, raising the spiritual well-being of women with&#xD;
      breast cancer may have a positive effect on coping with the symptoms of the disease and&#xD;
      treatment, thereby improving the quality of life. Studies have shown that patients with high&#xD;
      spiritual well-being have a higher quality of life. In a systematic review, it was found that&#xD;
      religion/spirituality is associated with pain and physical symptoms, and spiritual&#xD;
      self-evaluation contributes to psychological well-being, regardless of religion. In recent&#xD;
      studies with breast cancer patients, it has been determined that mindfulness therapy has a&#xD;
      positive effect on the quality of life of patients in addition to spirituality. Mindfulness&#xD;
      is a way of directing attention, coming from the eastern tradition of meditation. It can be&#xD;
      defined as an individual's focusing his attention on what is happening now in a&#xD;
      non-judgmental and accepting way. The concept of mindfulness has been used as a therapy&#xD;
      method in Western psychotherapy approaches for almost three decades. The concept of&#xD;
      mindfulness basically includes focusing on the moment and accepting emotions without judgment&#xD;
      . It allows the person to stay in the moment by focusing their attention. Staying in the&#xD;
      moment contributes to the well-being of mood by preventing the mind from focusing on the past&#xD;
      or the future and preoccupying the mind with various emotions Kabat-Zinn (2005), one of the&#xD;
      practitioners of conscious mindfulness therapy, stated that mindfulness is closely related to&#xD;
      the spiritual traditions of Far Eastern countries. Efforts to use Mindful Awareness to&#xD;
      improve psychological processes continue. No study has been found in the literature examining&#xD;
      the effect of mindfulness therapy on the spiritual well-being of patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
      However, there is a need for initiatives to increase spiritual well-being , which is known to&#xD;
      have a significant impact on quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction program applied to patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer on spiritual well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This study is a single center, pretest-posttest with control group controlled trial.&#xD;
      Participants will recruite in department of radiation oncology and oncology outpatient clinic&#xD;
      of a tertiary hospital in Malatya from October 15, 2021 to May 15, 2022. Permission for the&#xD;
      study was obtained from the ethics committee (E-41901325-050.99-14950). Written, fully&#xD;
      informed consent will obtain from all participants and all data will guaranteed to be&#xD;
      confidential. Participants has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. This study&#xD;
      will conduct in accordance with The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Sampling The investigators used the G*Power (Version 3.1.9.4) test to&#xD;
      determine the sample size. In the analysis performed as a priori, we referenced the Lim et&#xD;
      al. (2021) article. The investigators performed prior analyses based on t-tests (Means:&#xD;
      Difference between two independent means (two groups)). According to this, The investigators&#xD;
      determined that a total of 48 patients, including 24 patients in each of the groups with 0.05&#xD;
      error level, 95% power, and 1.07 effect size, should be included. Given the likelihood of&#xD;
      withdrawals, The investigators assigned 30 participants to each group, with a total of 60&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding The participants will assign randomly to the groups. The simple&#xD;
      full randomization method will use for group assignments. To determine the order of&#xD;
      application, the names of the study groups (mindfulness program group and control group) will&#xD;
      write on a piece of paper 30 times by the researcher, and the groups will select randomly by&#xD;
      drawing lots. It will not possible for the researcher collecting data to be blind. Data entry&#xD;
      will made by the author, who was not involved in data collection and had no conflict of&#xD;
      interest. Furthermore, data analysis will do independently by an experienced statistician who&#xD;
      was not involved in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection In data collection, the Socio-demographic Characteristics Form prepared by&#xD;
      the researchers in line with the literature to determine the sociodemographic characteristics&#xD;
      of the patients and the FACIT-SP (Functional Evaluation of the Treatment of Chronic&#xD;
      Diseases-Spiritual Well-being) scale will be used to determine the spiritual well-being of&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic Characteristics Form: This form, which was prepared by the researchers in&#xD;
      line with the literature, consists of 18 questions includes patients' age, gender, marital&#xD;
      status, education, employment status, occupation, presence of social security, income level,&#xD;
      number of children, time of diagnosis, time to start treatment, stage of the disease, the&#xD;
      presence of support in this disease, experiences that negatively affect thepatient, and&#xD;
      methods of coping with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACIT-Sp-Version 4: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being&#xD;
      Scala FACIT-Sp-Version 4; It is a combined version of FACIT-G consisting of 4 sub-dimensions,&#xD;
      27 items, for quality of life assessment and FACIT-Sp-12, consisting of 3 sub-dimensions and&#xD;
      12 items, for spiritual assessment. The scale consists of 4 subscales, namely Physical Status&#xD;
      (7 items), Social Life and Family Status (7 items), Emotional Status (6 items) and Activity&#xD;
      Status (7 items) and a total of 27 items (http://www.facit .org-website). The Turkish&#xD;
      validity and reliability study of the scale was carried out by Akt√ºrk.et al. (2017).&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha values were determined to be 0.87 for the FACIT-Sp: 0.78 for the meaning&#xD;
      subscale, 0.81 for the peace subscale, and 0.93 for the faith subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of the initiative Before starting the study, the Socio-demographic&#xD;
      Characteristics Form and the FACIT-SP (Functional Evaluation of the Treatment of Chronic&#xD;
      Diseases-Spiritual Well-being) scale will be applied to the patients included in the&#xD;
      mindfulness program group and control group in order to collect the pre-test data. After the&#xD;
      pre-test data are collected, groups of 10 people will be formed among the patients included&#xD;
      in the mindfulness program group. A mindfulness-based stress reduction program will be done&#xD;
      once a week for eight weeks and will take approximately 60-90 minutes. A plan will be made&#xD;
      with the patients for the day and time of the session. During this process, no application&#xD;
      will be made to the control group. Meetings will be held as an online session via Zoom Video&#xD;
      Communications. Post-test data will be collected from all patients after eight sessions. Each&#xD;
      of the patients participating in the eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program&#xD;
      will be retested 2 months after the program ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Research data will be evaluated with the SPSS 22 (Statistical Package&#xD;
      for Social Science) package program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution test will be used to&#xD;
      examine the normal distribution and Cronbach's alpha will be used for internal consistency.&#xD;
      In the evaluation of the data, number, percentage, mean, standard deviation and parametric&#xD;
      (t-test, analysis of variance) or nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis tests) tests&#xD;
      will be used according to the normal distribution of the data.&#xD;
