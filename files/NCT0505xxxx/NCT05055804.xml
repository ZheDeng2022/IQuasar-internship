    <textblock>
      This study is an investigational study of the ELG medical device to monitor glucose blood&#xD;
      level in diabetes mellitus Type 1 and 2 without blood samples in comparison to blood testing&#xD;
      methods.&quot;Investigational&quot; means the ELG medical device is subjected by the FDA (Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) for premarket testing requirements. The purpose of this study is to collect&#xD;
      data comparison values between ELG testing device to current blood testing methods.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Visit will last for up to 1-2 hours. This outcome will measure overnight fasting results.</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring precision and accuracy of ELG (glucose/A1C %) without blood samples, by performance evaluation to 3 different standard OTC fingerstick, A1C Now (or equivalent OTC brand) and NGSP-certified lab, using whole blood comparative tests with use of venous blood draw/fingersticks and NGSP-certified lab, and assess confidence limits to Bland-Altman plot, after overnight fasting for a minimum of 6 hours.</description>

    <measure>Standard OTC Glucose, A1C &amp; Laboratory Results in Comparison to ELG Device During Non-Fasting Event</measure>
    <time_frame>This visit will be measured within a 4 week time frame, following the 1st visit. This visit will last for up to 1-2 hours. This outcome will measure non-fasting results.</time_frame>

    <description>The effectiveness of ELG to standardized blood test methods (fingerstick) and comparison to AlcNOW + (or equivalence) and of laboratory test results.&#xD;
Human subject requirements during ELG study will not challenge diabetics or non-diabetics glycemic event. For example, diabetes type 1, the subject will not have to adjust their insulin or glucose. For type 2 diabetes, the subject will not have to adjust their oral hypoglycemic agent or glucose, as well.</description>
