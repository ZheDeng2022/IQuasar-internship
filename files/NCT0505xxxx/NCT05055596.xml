  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly comorbid among the 1.2 million persons living with HIV, with recent&#xD;
      prevalence estimates ranging from 55-67%. Needed are evidenced-based non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to improve chronic pain management and reduce the demand for opioids in the&#xD;
      United States. The proposed research will address this need by examining the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of Tai Chi as a mind-body intervention for chronic pain management in an HIV&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Persons living with HIV (PLWH) are at increased risk for chronic pain conditions, with&#xD;
      prevalence rates estimated to be between 55-67%. While acute pain is a life-sustaining&#xD;
      biological response to tissue damage or injury, chronic pain is a separate condition that&#xD;
      often causes significant physical and psychological suffering. Causes of chronic pain among&#xD;
      PLWH include disease progression, the impact of the virus on immune and nervous system&#xD;
      function, and medication side-effects. PLWH, like many other chronic pain patients, may be&#xD;
      prescribed opioid medications, which have not been found to be effective in managing&#xD;
      non-cancer related chronic pain. Additionally, the significant risk of dependence and&#xD;
      overdose far outweigh the potential benefit of opioid medications for chronic pain. Governing&#xD;
      bodies in medicine have called for non-pharmacological interventions to be considered&#xD;
      front-line treatment recommendations for chronic pain management. Mind-body interventions,&#xD;
      such as mindfulness, yoga, and Tai Chi, have been shown to be effective at reducing pain&#xD;
      symptoms and improving psychological outcomes for individuals with chronic pain.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, few studies have examined the use of mind-body interventions for chronic pain&#xD;
      management for PWLH, with even fewer using formative research to modify interventions to meet&#xD;
      the unique needs of this vulnerable population. The research plan proposed in this&#xD;
      application will address these gaps in the literature. This study will examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a mind-body intervention, Qigong/Tai Chi Easy, for chronic&#xD;
      pain management among PLWH. The researchers will recruit 40 individuals from the&#xD;
      Comprehensive HIV Program at Temple Health. Following informed consent, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to mind-body arm or health education control arm. Participants in both arms will&#xD;
      complete baseline assessment followed by a 10-week intervention. The mind-body intervention&#xD;
      group will meet weekly for 60-minute sessions and be provided with a video for at-home&#xD;
      practice. The health education group will also meet weekly for 60 minutes and be assigned&#xD;
      weekly homework related to the topics discussed in session. At the conclusion of the 10&#xD;
      weeks, participants will complete at post-intervention assessment. A 3-month follow up&#xD;
      assessment will also be completed. In addition to feasibility (i.e., recruitment rates,&#xD;
      retention) and acceptability (i.e., satisfaction ratings), the researchers will assess pain&#xD;
      symptoms (general and specific), perceived stress, depression, quality of life, and HIV&#xD;
      medication adherence. The researchers anticipate that the study will demonstrate feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability as evidenced by adequate enrollment, retention, and satisfaction. Findings&#xD;
      from the proposed study will be used to inform a future research grant with power to detect&#xD;
      efficacy of the mind-body intervention for chronic pain management.&#xD;
