  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy of extended cannabis&#xD;
      treatment to reduce patient exposure to prescription opioids through its use 1) as a&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesic treatment, and 2) as a therapy for reducing high-dose opioid use in&#xD;
      patients with chronic spine pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to elucidate the role of&#xD;
      extended oral cannabis treatment in the alleviation of chronic spine pain and reduction of&#xD;
      high-dose opioid use. This trial includes two study arms: Analgesia Arm and Reduction Arm.&#xD;
      The Analgesia Arm uses a within-subject crossover design to determine whether daily treatment&#xD;
      with an oral cannabis solution for 6 weeks significantly reduces spine pain compared to&#xD;
      placebo. The Reduction Arm uses a parallel design to determine whether daily treatment with&#xD;
      an oral cannabis solution for 13 weeks results in a greater reduction of pain and opioid&#xD;
      intake than placebo treatment. It will also assess the impact of extended cannabis treatment&#xD;
      on opioid craving and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in participants tapering their high-dose&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;
