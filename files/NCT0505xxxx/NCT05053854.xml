      This phase 1 dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      talazoparib in combination with 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy&#xD;
      (PRRT) in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET).&#xD;

      This phase 1, single arm, single centre study is designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of talazoparib in combination with 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 1 cycle of 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate alone followed by 3 cycles of&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate combined with 5 days of talazoparib.&#xD;
