  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas are an exceptionally rare form of cancer, collectively&#xD;
      accounting for only 1% of all malignancies diagnosed. Sarcomas often occur in the patients'&#xD;
      extremities and treatment typically involves limb salvage surgery with bone and/or muscle&#xD;
      resection. These surgeries often leave the patients with disfigurements, psychological&#xD;
      trauma, and functional disabilities. Perhaps, the most difficult and life-altering decision&#xD;
      that patients (and their parents) with primary bone sarcomas about the knee joint have to&#xD;
      make, involves choosing the type of surgical procedure that will provide them with the&#xD;
      outcome that meets their functional as well as aesthetic expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature, the quality of life for patients with osteosarcoma around the knee joint after&#xD;
      three different surgical procedures, that is, amputation, endoprosthetic reconstruction and&#xD;
      rotationplasty was evaluated. There was found that patients treated with rotationplasty&#xD;
      showed significantly higher functional scores compared to the two other groups of patients.&#xD;
      Also, researchers investigated the long-term quality of life after bone sarcoma surgery&#xD;
      around the knee joint and found that, despite the functional disability, survivors were busy&#xD;
      with work, study, relationships, and sometimes they have founded a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most published reports in the literature on assessment of gait in the lower-extremity sarcoma&#xD;
      survivors were focused on bone sarcoma patients after wide resection and endoprosthetic&#xD;
      reconstruction. To the knowledge of the investigator, there has been no published studies on&#xD;
      gait analysis after resection of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the lower extremity. The rare&#xD;
      and heterogeneous aspects of STS and the paucity of knowledge of movement strategies in these&#xD;
      patients hinder the development of effective rehabilitation protocols for recovering movement&#xD;
      after resection of STS in the lower limb.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas are an exceptionally rare form of cancer, collectively&#xD;
      accounting for only 1% of all malignancies diagnosed. There have been dramatic improvements&#xD;
      in the survival rate of sarcoma patients in the past 40 years owing to increasing&#xD;
      effectiveness of chemotherapy. This, along with developments in imaging techniques, have led&#xD;
      to earlier diagnosis and more accurate preoperative staging. It is estimated that there are&#xD;
      nearly 50,000 survivors of bone and soft tissue sarcomas in the United States. 70% of those&#xD;
      are younger than the age of 50 years. Whilst traditional treatment for bone tumors used to be&#xD;
      amputation, advances in surgical techniques have made limb-salvage procedures a valid&#xD;
      alternative method of treatment in 80-85% of patients with primary bone sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcomas often occur in the patients' extremities and treatment typically involves limb&#xD;
      salvage surgery with bone and/or muscle resection. These surgeries often leave the patients&#xD;
      with disfigurements, psychological trauma, and functional disabilities. Perhaps, the most&#xD;
      difficult and life-altering decision that patients (and their parents) with primary bone&#xD;
      sarcomas about the knee joint have to make, involves choosing the type of surgical procedure&#xD;
      that will provide them with the outcome that meets their functional as well as aesthetic&#xD;
      expectations. In literature, the quality of life for patients with osteosarcoma around the&#xD;
      knee joint after three different surgical procedures, that is, amputation, endoprosthetic&#xD;
      reconstruction and rotationplasty was evaluated. There was found that patients treated with&#xD;
      rotationplasty showed significantly higher functional scores compared to the two other groups&#xD;
      of patients. Also, researchers investigated the long-term quality of life after bone sarcoma&#xD;
      surgery around the knee joint and found that, despite the functional disability, survivors&#xD;
      were busy with work, study, relationships, and sometimes they have founded a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few reports available in the literature on the quality of life in sarcoma&#xD;
      survivors. It was found that elderly patients, retired patients, and those who live alone&#xD;
      need more intensive psychological care. Female patients were found to cope poorly with their&#xD;
      disease compared to male gender. It was also found that the physical status greatly&#xD;
      influences the overall outcome and quality of life in this group of patients. This stresses&#xD;
      the importance of enrolment in tailored rehabilitation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most published reports in the literature on assessment of gait in the lower-extremity sarcoma&#xD;
      survivors were focused on bone sarcoma patients after wide resection and endoprosthetic&#xD;
      reconstruction. In literature, the gait pattern after endoprosthetic replacement around the&#xD;
      knee joint was studied and found that, despite decreased walking velocity, stride length, and&#xD;
      stance phase of the operated limb, these patients still have a symmetrical gait. Also in&#xD;
      another report, an electromyographic assessment of gait after bone sarcoma surgery about the&#xD;
      knee showed prolonged activation of rectus femoris and hamstring muscles in the affected limb&#xD;
      compared to a control group. Other researchers found that limb-salvage patients often adopt a&#xD;
      &quot;stiff-legged&quot; gait pattern. These findings are of utmost importance for the development of&#xD;
      efficient rehabilitation programs for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the knowledge of the investigator, there has been no published studies on gait analysis&#xD;
      after resection of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the lower extremity. The rare and&#xD;
      heterogeneous aspects of STS and the paucity of knowledge of movement strategies in these&#xD;
      patients hinder the development of effective rehabilitation protocols for recovering movement&#xD;
      after resection of STS in the lower limb. Researchers investigated the knee extension&#xD;
      strength and postoperative functional outcome after quadriceps resection for soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma of the thigh. They found that knee extension strength decreased when the number of&#xD;
      resected quadriceps increased and this was associated with lower functional scores. They&#xD;
      concluded that good functional results can be expected if at least two quadriceps muscles are&#xD;
      preserved. However, no detailed assessment of gait in this group of patients has been&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
