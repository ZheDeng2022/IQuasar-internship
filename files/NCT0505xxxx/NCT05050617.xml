      STUDY: Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Predicting Adverse Outcomes in Emergency Department&#xD;
      Patients With Acute Pulmonary Embolism&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical outcomes associated with pulmonary embolism (PE) vary widely. In the United&#xD;
      States, most patients are admitted for inpatient therapy; however, there is evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that outpatient therapy may be safe in patients with non-massive PEs. Appropriate&#xD;
      outpatient treatment of patients with pulmonary emboli not only has the potential to increase&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, but also has the potential to significantly reduce cost of care without&#xD;
      compromising patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) is an externally validated prediction tool for&#xD;
      mortality associated with PE. The PESI consists of 11 clinical parameters that are routinely&#xD;
      available and stratifies patients into 5 risk categories, class I having the lowest risk of&#xD;
      short-term mortality and class V having the highest. The PESI does not rely on imaging&#xD;
      modalities to determine risk of adverse outcome within 30 days of initial PE diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting short-term adverse outcomes in PE is essential for proper disposition, namely&#xD;
      hospitalization of at-risk patients and discharge of those with low likelihood of&#xD;
      decompensation. Hariharan et al. evaluated the ability of PESI to predict short-term&#xD;
      deterioration (&lt;5 days) in patients with acute PE. The PESI demonstrated a sensitivity of 86%&#xD;
      (95% CI 73-93%) for predicting short-term adverse events. Approximately 14% of patients&#xD;
      deemed low-risk by PESI required short-term interventions. The authors concluded that risk&#xD;
      stratification with PESI warrants further optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research in South Korea has suggested combining CT findings of right ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction (RVD) with the PESI score improved predictive accuracy. Right heart strain may be&#xD;
      an independent prognostic factor of adverse outcomes in patients with acute PE, and may&#xD;
      enhance prognosis versus PESI score alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point-of-care (POC) echocardiography has been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool to detect&#xD;
      RVD. Several parameters can provide morphological, functional, and hemodynamic information&#xD;
      that are obtainable using a bedside study. These include tricuspid annular plane systolic&#xD;
      excursion (TAPSE) and 60/60 sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POC ultrasound (US) can be performed at the bedside by trained emergency physicians to assess&#xD;
      for these markers of RVD. The investigators hypothesize this will yield significant benefit&#xD;
      in risk stratifying individuals with acute PE and potentially influence disposition. This&#xD;
      study aims to assess the role of US-guided measures of RVD in predicting clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with acute PE, both in isolation and in conjunction with PESI scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the diagnostic performance of ultrasound-guided measures of RVD, specifically&#xD;
           TAPSE and the 60-60 sign, in predicting short term clinical outcomes in acute PE&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the diagnostic performance of combining ultrasound-guided measures of RVD&#xD;
           (TAPSE and 60-60 sign) and the PESI score in predicting short term adverse outcomes in&#xD;
           acute PE&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, prospective study of patients presenting to the ED and diagnosed&#xD;
      with acute PE by CT imaging. Screening for potential subjects will be conducted by ED staff&#xD;
      working clinically, as well as ultrasound/procedure emergency medicine residents and US&#xD;
      fellows/faculty on &quot;scanning shifts&quot;. Informed consent will be obtained by a member of the&#xD;
      study team prior to data collection or study procedures. A POC ultrasound will be performed&#xD;
      by an ED attending, fellow or resident under the supervision of an emergency physician&#xD;
      accredited in bedside echocardiography, which is considered standard of care. Data regarding&#xD;
      the initial presentation, components of the PESI score and POC ultrasound will be documented&#xD;
      at the bedside. Ultrasound images will be recorded via the usual ultrasound archival software&#xD;
      and undergo the standard QA process. ED residents/fellows/attendings participating in this&#xD;
      study will be trained on study protocols by accredited staff prior to participation in&#xD;
      consent, ultrasonography and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive telephone follow-up calls from the research team&#xD;
      at 7 (+/- 3) and 30 (+/- 5) days from the date of PE diagnosis. Questions will focus on&#xD;
      subsequent adverse outcomes, including development of recurrent PE/DVT, new cardiac&#xD;
      dysrhythmia, advanced cardiac life support, advanced respiratory support, need for pressor&#xD;
      support, need for thrombolysis, development of major bleeding, return to the ED, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional follow up data will be collected via review of the electronic medical record and&#xD;
      documented on a standardized data collection form after 30 days from initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Recruitment Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will include ED patients over the age of 18 who are identified as have an&#xD;
      acute pulmonary embolism on CT imaging. Patients will be seen initially by the treating&#xD;
      physician and receive the usual standard of care. If an acute PE is identified, the treating&#xD;
      physician will contact a member of the study team to assess eligibility, discuss the study&#xD;
      with the patient and obtain consent. The POC ultrasound may be performed by a physician&#xD;
      member of the study team or another credentialed emergency physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will receive standard treatment at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician and resident team. The patient's decision to participate in this study will not&#xD;
      directly affect their care in the ED. The treating physician and resident team will not&#xD;
      necessarily be blinded to the findings of the POC US as this may yield important clinical&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for inclusion in this study will occur in the Emergency Department as outlined&#xD;
      above. Informed consent will be given to eligible patients for review. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained prior to ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound images will be saved and&#xD;
      stored securely on the hospital server. Ultrasonographic findings and initial clinical data&#xD;
      will be recorded on a Bedside Standardized Data Collection Form during the exam. Follow up&#xD;
      clinical information from chart review and telephone calls will be recorded on a Follow Up&#xD;
      Standardized Data Collection Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be assigned a study ID number at the time of enrollment and a linking&#xD;
      document will be maintained. Once data collection is complete, forms will be de-identified by&#xD;
      the removal of the patient's name/MRN/FIN/identifying information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      All POC echocardiograms will be obtained utilizing 2.5-3.5 MHz transducers by a credentialed&#xD;
      physician sonographer during initial evaluation in the ED. Patients will be examined in the&#xD;
      supine or left lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAPSE serves as a quantitative measure of right heart dysfunction. TAPSE will be calculated&#xD;
      by obtaining a standard apical four chamber view with M-mode placed over the lateral&#xD;
      tricuspid annulus to measure the maximal excursion of the RV between the end of diastole to&#xD;
      the end of systole. Patients will be divided into high risk, moderate risk, and low risk&#xD;
      groups based on TAPSE measurements of &lt;16 mm, 16-20 mm, and &gt;20 mm respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60/60 sign is defined as both a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of &lt;60 mmHg and&#xD;
      pulmonary acceleration time (PAT) of &lt;60 msecs. In patients without chronic right heart&#xD;
      remodeling, PASP can be estimated using right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP). RVSP&#xD;
      calculation relies on both estimating the tricuspid gradient (TG) and the right atrial&#xD;
      pressure (RAP). Right atrial pressure in non-ventilated patients can be approximated using&#xD;
      central venous pressure. By placing the ultrasound probe in sagittal axis subxiphoid view,&#xD;
      the IVC size can be measured at 2 cm distal to the right atrium. A plethoric IVC with a large&#xD;
      diameter of &gt;2.1 cm with &lt;50% collapse with respiration estimates a RAP of 15 mmHg, which is&#xD;
      considered elevated. A diameter of &gt;2.1 cm with &gt;50% collapse or a diameter of &lt;2.1 cm with&#xD;
      &lt;50% collapse estimates a RAP of 8 mmHg, which is considered normal. A narrow IVC with a&#xD;
      diameter of &lt;2.1 cm and &gt;50% collapse with respiratory variation estimates a RAP of 3 mmHg.&#xD;
      (10) TG is measured using tricuspid regurgitation jet. While using standard apical 4 chamber&#xD;
      view, color flow will be applied across the tricuspid valve to identify regurgitation jet.&#xD;
      Continuous wave doppler will be applied in the middle of the jet. Peak blood flow (TRmax)&#xD;
      will be measured at the apex of the waveform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TG will then be calculated using the equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TG = 4 x (TRmax) 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      RVSP will be calculated using the equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RVSP = TG + RAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      An RVSP of &lt;60 mmHg suggests acute RV dysfunction whereas an RVSP of &gt;60 mmHg suggests&#xD;
      chronic RV dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAT refers to the amount of time it takes to reach peak pulmonic velocity. PAT will be&#xD;
      calculated using the basal short axis view with power Doppler aligned with blood flow through&#xD;
      the pulmonic valve with sweep speed increased to measure the time between the initial blood&#xD;
      flow to peak blood flow. A PAT of &lt;60 msecs indicates that the pulmonic velocity and pressure&#xD;
      peak very quickly, suggesting an acute cause of RV dysfunction. (4, 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis/Sample Size Calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be reported as means/medians with standard&#xD;
      deviations/interquartile ranges for continuous variables and proportions with percentages for&#xD;
      categorical variables. The diagnostic performance of PESI score, POC echocardiography and the&#xD;
      combination of PESI+POC echocardiography for predicting the primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be calculated, including sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and&#xD;
      negative/positive predictive values (NPV/PPV) with associated 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
      Interrater reliability for follow up data collection from the medical record will be assessed&#xD;
      via Cohen's Kappa. p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate approximately 30% of the enrolled acute PE population will&#xD;
      experience at least one component of the primary composite outcome. Setting a goal&#xD;
      sensitivity of 95% (+/- 5%) for the combined PESI+POC echocardiography prediction tool,&#xD;
      assuming alpha=0.05, beta=0.2 and allowing for an approximated 10% attrition rate, the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that 250 patients will be required to achieve adequate statistical&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Risk Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are minimal risks to patients participating in this study since ultrasound is&#xD;
      non-invasive and known to be safe. There is a slight risk of the participants' privacy or&#xD;
      confidentiality being breached. Standard precautions will be taken to ensure privacy and&#xD;
      confidentiality is maintained during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may receive clinical benefit from the additional information provided by POC&#xD;
      echocardiography; however, the disposition and treatment of patients enrolled in this study&#xD;
      will remain at the discretion of the primary attending and resident team. The results of the&#xD;
      ultrasound study will be made available to the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who decline to participate in the study will not have the quality of their treatment&#xD;
      affected in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research materials, records, confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research records will be stored in locked offices, filing cabinets, and computers using&#xD;
      passwords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will seek documented informed consent and HIPAA Authorization. Patients who decline&#xD;
      participation will continue their usual treatment course in the ED.&#xD;
