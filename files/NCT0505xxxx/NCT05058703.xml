  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for a culturally adapted screening tool to aid health care professionals or&#xD;
      clinicians screen for the presence of fall and balance issues associated with injuries in&#xD;
      saraiki population. Furthermore, while culturally adapting the scale is necessary, it is&#xD;
      important that changes do not alter the original intent, which requires it to be broad,&#xD;
      comprehensible and applicable to the entire population. As saraiki language is the most-used&#xD;
      language in the South Punjab, translating and adapting the ABC scale to the saraiki&#xD;
      population while accounting for its sociocultural characteristics is an important task. So, I&#xD;
      decided to conduct a tool translation and validation study. This study will help the&#xD;
      clinicians to assess their patient's confidence and balance easily through the saraiki&#xD;
      version of ABC scale in saraiki population and hence will help in timely management of the&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;

      The ABC scale is a 16-item questionnaire with 11-point subscales that assess the level of&#xD;
      confidence in performing a specific task without losing balance or becoming unsteady. Each&#xD;
      item score ranges from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (total confidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As cross-border and cross-cultural studies continue to increase, there is a greater need for&#xD;
      linguistic validation of tools across a variety of societies. Until now, no translation or&#xD;
      adaptation of the ABC scale has been made for the population with different languages in&#xD;
      Pakistan. In order to use questionnaires in areas with different languages and cultures,&#xD;
      translation into new languages of ABC scale, for identifying fall and balance issues is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;

Each item score ranges from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (total confidence) and the total score of the S-ABC is obtained by adding up the ratings (0-160) and then dividing by 16</description>

    <description>The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) is a multipurpose, generic, 12-item questionnaire developed from the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). The SF-12 generates a Physical Component Summary scale score (PCS-SF12) and a Mental Component Summary scale score (MCS-SF12). Several studies have reported its validity and reliability as a measure of health-related quality of life in different populations.</description>
