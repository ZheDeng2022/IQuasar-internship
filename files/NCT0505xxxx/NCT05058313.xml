  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal atrophy is common after menopause, with a significant negative effect on quality&#xD;
      of life. Large cohort studies have reported the prevalence of vaginal dryness to be between&#xD;
      27% and 55% and dyspareunia between 32% and 41%. Management of urogenital atrophy includes&#xD;
      lifestyle modification, nonhormonal treatments (vaginal lubricants or moisturizers, laser&#xD;
      treatments), as well as hormonal treatments. The disadvantages of the non-surgical methods&#xD;
      are average results, discontinuation, and frequent contraindications to hormonal&#xD;
      treatments.This has led to a strong interest in the development of non-invasive or minimally&#xD;
      invasive methods that are easy to implement, effective and durable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has been proposed as an alternative for the treatment of&#xD;
      genitourinary menopausal syndrome (GMS) and stress urinary incontinence. PBMT devices exert&#xD;
      their effect via non-thermal mechanisms. PBMT stimulates collagen and elastin synthesis in&#xD;
      the vaginal tissue, to support the urethrovaginal sphincter and urethra, and to promote&#xD;
      vasodilation in the vaginal and urethral submucosa. PHYSIOQUANTA has developed a vaginal&#xD;
      probe coupled with its innovative MILTA™ process synergistically combining NPCL (Nano-Pulsed&#xD;
      Cold Laser) laser emitters, infrared diodes and RGB (Red Green Blue) diodes, operating in a&#xD;
      magnetic tunnel. The MILTA acts deeper than LEDs, due to the diffusion of photons in soft&#xD;
      tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the study investigators aimed to evaluate the safety and performance of the&#xD;
      MILTA™ GYNECO vaginal probe in a pilot study of first use in women. This clinical study on&#xD;
      the MILTA vaginal probe is expected to result in its CE marking Class IIb DM.&#xD;
