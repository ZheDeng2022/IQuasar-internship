    <textblock>
      Approximately 100 patients undergoing oral surgery will be divided in 3 groups of musical&#xD;
      audition to control anxiety: baroque (N=35), classicism (N=35) and control group (N=30).&#xD;
      Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The trend towards greater humanization in all fields of medicine encourages the&#xD;
      implementation of non-pharmacological therapies in the management and control of pain and&#xD;
      anxiety in patients during dental treatments. Some studies estimate this level of anxiety in&#xD;
      up to 51% of patients, who would prefer to undergo some type of sedation during dental&#xD;
      treatment. This fear or anxiety may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence recommends the use of music in daily practice to reduce anxiety and even&#xD;
      pain. There are several studies comparing different musical styles. Some of them use a song&#xD;
      from the so-called &quot;classical music&quot;, but none have analyzed the possible benefits between&#xD;
      the different stages of this type of music, which spans several centuries of history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of the use of Baroque and Classical music&#xD;
      as non-pharmacological therapy on the control of the level of intraoperative anxiety and pain&#xD;
      experienced by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, subjected to dental extractions. and&#xD;
      implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study would be carried out on approximately 100 patients who need&#xD;
      tooth extractions and dental implant placement in private practice. The patients would be&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups: baroque music, classicism music and control group. The patients would&#xD;
      be correctly informed and would sign their consent to be part of the study. The music would&#xD;
      be played through wireless headphones placed on the patient and connected to their respective&#xD;
      music list according to the group to be studied. The parameters recorded during four&#xD;
      different moments of surgery would be: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and oxygen saturation. After the treatment, the patient will complete a visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) on their level of pain and anxiety experienced before and after the&#xD;
      treatment. For all of them, this surgery would be the first performed by the sole operator of&#xD;
      the study, to reduce other subjective criteria associated with the level of pain or anxiety.&#xD;
      Another operator would collect the data obtained.&#xD;
