    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to compare the effects of Blood flow Restriction training&#xD;
      vs. traditional exercises on knee pain , knee functional disability and on quadriceps&#xD;
      strength in patient with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease affecting the most commonly weight bearing joint.The&#xD;
      common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis (OA) causing structural changes in the joint. Age&#xD;
      is a common factor affecting the strength and muscle mass.Worldwide there is a drastic&#xD;
      increase of osteoarthritis in the older population. In the past 20 years the prevalence of&#xD;
      knee pain increased and reached up to 50% in the older population. The most common OA&#xD;
      affecting lower extremity is in the knee Joint.Majority of the people affected by knee OA are&#xD;
      the older population. Knee Joints being the most weight bearing joint affected in OA causing&#xD;
      pain , limiting function and mobility.Mobility and function may be affected in osteoarthritic&#xD;
      population usually experience pain and stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare the Effects of blood Flow restriction training&#xD;
      vs conventional treatment exercises on knee pain, functional disability and quadriceps&#xD;
      strengthening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to improve the muscular strength of lower limbs which are&#xD;
      being affected in a disease osteoarthritis in the adult population.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will be in supine position with knee extension and quadriceps are relaxed, examiner will measure the q angle with flexible inch tape and goniometer. The Q- angle is measured by extending a line through the center of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine and another line from the tibial tubercle through the center of the patella.</description>

    <description>During each exercise, only blood flow in the involved leg was restricted using an aneroid sphygmomanometer. Prior to exercise the cuff was placed on the most proximal portion of the limb and LOP was calculated in the body position that the blood flow restriction (BFR) stimulus would be applied. BFR pressure was set at 50% occlusion.Resistance applied for 1 minute (60 sec) with 30 % load of 1 repetition maximum. Subjects will receive treatment bilaterally.Participants will perform exercises 2 sets with 15 repetitions through 0 to 90 degrees.&#xD;
Secondly, Rest between sets (1 min) Therapist will help these positions to maintain Knee extension and Wall Squatting.&#xD;
The study includes interventional protocol of 6 weeks. Total sessions will be 12 and in each week there will 2 sessions with alternative days and follow up.</description>
