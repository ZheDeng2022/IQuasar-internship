  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single arm, phase I study designed to determine the safety and find&#xD;
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum dose level (MTD) of Belantamab Mafodotin in&#xD;
      patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. The study will have a dose-finding part&#xD;
      and a dose-expansion part. The maximum number of enrolled patients will be 30 with 18&#xD;
      patients for the dose-finding part and 12 patients for the dose-expansion part. Once we&#xD;
      determine the MTD or RP2D in the dose-finding part, we will enroll and treat 12 additional&#xD;
      patients at the MTD or RP2D in the expansion part. Efficacy will be assessed through the&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR) at the end of the study. With the limited number of patients for&#xD;
      the dose-expansion part, we will not have formal futility monitoring rule.&#xD;

      criteria. Progression free survival at 2 years, overall survival, duration of response,&#xD;
      safety and clinical benefit rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Studies: Evaluate correlative endpoints including immune, cellular and molecular&#xD;
      profiling, minimal residual disease, BCMA staining of bone marrow, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
