  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have showed that computerized cognitive training can improve cognitive&#xD;
      function in patients with MCI, but the effect of multimodal cognitive interventions on MCI&#xD;
      remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and safety of a digitally&#xD;
      based multidomain intervention in patients with MCI. In addition, a portion of cognitively&#xD;
      normal subjects and caregivers of patients with MCI will also be recruited as an exploratory&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome defined as cognitive decline greater than that&#xD;
      expected for an individual's age and education level but that does not interfere notably with&#xD;
      activities of daily life. It is a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. While&#xD;
      MCI patients may progress to dementia or revert to normal cognition, a large proportion of&#xD;
      MCI patients may remain clinically stable (i.e., evidencing neither progression nor&#xD;
      reversion) for their entire observed clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis of 41 MCI studies identified the annual progression rate to dementia from MCI&#xD;
      as 10% in clinical settings and 5% in community settings. This result suggests that the&#xD;
      annual MCI progression rate is low (5-10%) and a larger proportion of MCI patients do not&#xD;
      progress to dementia. A review article even reported that the incidence rate of MCI reversion&#xD;
      to be 30-50% compared to the MCI progression rate of 4-40% with 2-5 years follow-up. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 25 studies found an overall amnestic MCI reversion rate of approximately&#xD;
      24%. Common factors related to MCI reversion include genetics (i.e., fewer APOE ε4 alleles),&#xD;
      global functioning (i.e., lower scores on Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] Scale), subtype of&#xD;
      MCI (i.e., non-amnestic single domain), cognitive functioning (i.e., higher standard scores&#xD;
      on cognitive assessments), and neuroimaging (i.e., large hippocampal volumes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no pharmacological treatment that is approved for MCI. There is some&#xD;
      evidence that suggests non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive training and&#xD;
      physical exercise, may be beneficial for patients with MCI. Appropriate strategies to treat&#xD;
      MCI and prevent the progressive decline of cognitive functions are the periodic monitoring of&#xD;
      patients, providing lifestyle guidance, treating lifestyle-related diseases, and training on&#xD;
      cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, digital therapeutics (DTx) is defined as&#xD;
      &quot;evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs to&#xD;
      prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease, which can be used independently or&#xD;
      in concert with medications, devices, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health&#xD;
      outcomes&quot;. With the rising demand for innovative mental health solutions, also advances in&#xD;
      and the increasingly dominant role of mobile technology and artificial intelligence in modern&#xD;
      lives have broadened the role of DTx in healthcare. DTx has emerged as a new therapeutic&#xD;
      modality for the prevention, management, or treatment of chronic, behavior-modifiable&#xD;
      disease, which also allows clinicians to remotely collect real-time data from patients,&#xD;
      making subsequent clinic visits more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, DTx have largely targeted neurological and psychiatric conditions with significant&#xD;
      unmet needs that are challenging to manage with existing therapeutics in adults or&#xD;
      pediatrics, including substance use disorder (reSET®), opioid use disorder (reSET-O®),&#xD;
      chronic insomnia (SomrystTM), post-traumatic stress disorder (NightWareTM), and attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (EndeavorRxTM). Akin to biopharmaceuticals and medical&#xD;
      devices, DTx undergoes review and are cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and are either available over-the-counter or prescribed by physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTx for the treatment of MCI is under development and being studied, mostly targeted to&#xD;
      improve overall cognition or specific domains (such as learning and memory, attention, speed,&#xD;
      executive functioning), as well as daily living skills such as financial knowledge or driving&#xD;
      performance. A systematic review evaluating the effects of computerized cognitive training or&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions for individuals with MCI found that both general and&#xD;
      domain-specific cognitive training have led to improved cognition, primarily in memory, but&#xD;
      with some evidence that executive function may also be positively affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device is a DTx intended to be used in the treatment of MCI. It is based on&#xD;
      principles of cognitive stimulation which will be delivered in a sequence of modules of&#xD;
      patient education, physical training, and cognitive games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no pharmacological treatment that is approved for MCI. Novel,&#xD;
      cost-effective, and easy to implement/disseminate non-pharmacological interventions for MCI&#xD;
      could be helpful for the disease population given the unmet medical need. With a small sample&#xD;
      size, this study will investigate the preliminary effectiveness of the study device as well&#xD;
      as its safety for the treatment of MCI. In addition, a portion of cognitively normal subjects&#xD;
      and caregivers of patients with MCI will also be recruited as an exploratory cohort.&#xD;
