  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to generate expert consensus statements on the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis, definition, and management of EDS in patients with OSA who are adequately treated&#xD;
      with primary therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study will be performed using a modified Delphi process with an international expert panel&#xD;
      to generate recommendation statements related to the differential diagnosis and management of&#xD;
      patients with residual EDS in OSA (and relevant sub-topics) and to determine the level of&#xD;
      agreement for each statement from the panel as a whole. The following topics will be covered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EDS: definition, evaluation/assessment, and tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Definitions of residual EDS in patients with OSA treated with primary OSA therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Practical recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Management Consensus is achieved through iterative rounds of survey and revision to the&#xD;
           statements until a pre-determined level of agreement is met (80% agreement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: planning and evidence review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Series of planning sessions with co-chairs and faculty leads&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Literature is reviewed/summarized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial statements will be developed based on evidence Recommendation statements on EDS&#xD;
           in OSA will be formulated and rated according to level of agreement on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Survey to achieve consensus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey, based on the initial statements developed by faculty leads, will be developed to&#xD;
           allow for vetting by full faculty group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 3 rounds of review (2 remote and 1 live [virtual]) will be held to achieve&#xD;
           consensus on each topic of interest and finalize consensus statements&#xD;

    <description>The Delphi panel will include 10 international experts in sleep and respiratory medicine. Two panelists will serve as co-chairs and eight panelists will serve as section leads for the major topic areas throughout the process. A series of planning sessions will be conducted with the co-chairs and section leads prior to implementation of the survey.</description>
