  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that is being conducted in order to assess the efficacy of microneedling as a&#xD;
      stand-alone treatment for vitiligo. Vitiligo is an autoimmune depigmentation disease of the&#xD;
      skin that is characterized by the destruction of epidermal melanocytes by CD8+ T cells. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Vitiligo has been linked to autoimmunity, oxidative stress, and genetic&#xD;
      susceptibility.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microneedling is a minimally invasive technique developed for skin rejuvenation. In the&#xD;
      treatment for vitiligo, the procedure causes micro-inflammations on the epidermis and&#xD;
      enhances melanocytes and keratinocytes migration. This process leads to the stimulation and&#xD;
      repigmentation of vitiligo areas. Several topical therapies such as Tacrolimus and&#xD;
      5-Fluorouracilused in conjunction with microneedling have yielded favorable repigmentation&#xD;
      results. This study aims to evaluate the repigmentation rates of microneedled vitiligo&#xD;
      patches without any topical medications other than sunscreen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 8 -12 treatments over the course of 244 days, with subjects&#xD;
      receiving a treatment every 2 weeks.&#xD;
