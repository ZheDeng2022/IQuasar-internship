  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      he primary objective is to characterize the safety profile of UGN-201 in patients with&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma undergoing radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corresponding primary endpoint: Toxicity of concern (TOX) will be monitored until 30 days&#xD;
      after surgery or until the patient meets the surgery prevention or delay TOX definition&#xD;
      below, whichever comes first. A patient will be considered to have a TOX if any of the&#xD;
      following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any 30-day grade 3 or higher surgical complication at least possibly related to UGI-201&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any toxicity at least possibly related to the treatment that prevents surgery or delays&#xD;
           it more than 12 weeks from date of cystectomy decision with MDACC Urologist.&#xD;
           Missing/delayed surgery due to progression or withdrawal not related to toxicity will&#xD;
           not count as a TOX event. Rapid progression is not seen with UGN-201. For such a&#xD;
           patient, TOX monitoring will follow for 30 days after the administered dose of UGN-201.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death between the start of study and the 30-day post-surgical assessment will count if&#xD;
           it is toxic death at least possibly related to the UGN-201 or surgery. Deaths clearly&#xD;
           unrelated to treatment will not count as an event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded using CTCAE v5 and surgical complications will be recorded&#xD;
      using Clavien-Dindo classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of UGN-201 by pathologic T0 and ≤ pT1 rate (pathologic&#xD;
           down-staging) after neoadjuvant treatment with UGN-201, in patients with NMBIC and MIBC&#xD;
           undergoing radical cystectomy, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunological/biomarker changes in tumor tissues, peripheral blood, and&#xD;
           urine in response to UGN-201 treatment in patients with bladder cancer undergoing&#xD;
           radical cystectomy and to explore any potential association between these biomarker&#xD;
           measures and antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MIBC will be defined as having a response if their pathologic stage is pT1&#xD;
      stage or less. Patients with NMIBC will be defined as having a response if their pathologic&#xD;
      stage is pT0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunologic and other biomarker measures will be recorded by laboratory standards for each&#xD;
      measure.&#xD;

&#xD;
             10. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.2) must agree to use an&#xD;
             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2- Contraception, starting&#xD;
             with the first dose of study therapy through 30 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has ≥ cT3 and/or cN+ and/or cM+ urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, non-predominant&#xD;
