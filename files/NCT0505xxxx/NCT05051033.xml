  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial comparing mitral valve (MV)&#xD;
      transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) to surgical repair (1:1 ratio) in patients with&#xD;
      primary, degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR). The trial will be conducted in the U.S.,&#xD;
      Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, and is designed as a strategy trial. Thus, all&#xD;
      devices legally marketed for TEER of primary degenerative MR in a particular country are&#xD;
      eligible to be used in this trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of MV&#xD;
      TEER compared with surgical repair in patients with primary, degenerative MR. The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to analyze the relationship between the adequacy of MR correction at one-year post&#xD;
      randomization and longer-term clinical outcomes (death, heart failure hospitalizations/urgent&#xD;
      care visits, valve re-interventions, and quality of life). The tertiary aim of this trial is&#xD;
      to evaluate a range of patient-centered outcomes (quality of life, functional status, and&#xD;
      discharge location) of transcatheter edge-to-edge MV repair compared with MV surgical repair&#xD;
      in patients with primary, degenerative mitral regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population for this trial consists of adult patients with severe, primary&#xD;
      degenerative MR for whom the local heart team has verified that an indication for MV&#xD;
      intervention is present and for whom both transcatheter edge-to-edge and surgical repair&#xD;
      strategies are anatomically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the use of the commercial edge-to-edge mitral repair device in the U.S. is approved&#xD;
      only in patients considered to be at prohibitive risk of MV surgery by a heart team, use of&#xD;
      such devices in this trial is considered investigational by the FDA. As such, this trial will&#xD;
      be conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with qualifying MR, who decline randomization, will be offered the option of&#xD;
      enrollment in a parallel registry that captures their baseline risk profile and their&#xD;
      treatment strategy received. These patients will also be asked to fill out a brief decliner&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured over a period of 5 years. The estimated enrollment period is 36&#xD;
      months, and all patients will be followed for up to 10 years post randomization for&#xD;
      particular endpoints. Long-term follow-up will include leveraging administrative datasets&#xD;
      linked to clinical trial data.&#xD;

The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ- 5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

    <description>Patients who are randomized to the surgical arm will undergo mitral surgery. Mitral surgery will be conducted using general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. Mitral surgery may be performed via a sternotomy or a right thoracotomy approach with or without robotic assistance. Standard techniques commonly include a ring or band annuloplasty to correct and prevent annular dilatation; leaflet prolapse and redundancy may be corrected by leaflet resection techniques and / or chordal reconstruction.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with a commercially-approved edge-to-edge mitral repair device. Before using the investigational device, each patient will undergo baseline hemodynamic assessment. The steerable guide catheter (guide) is inserted into the femoral vein and advanced across the inter-atrial septum using image guided puncture. Fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance will be used to visualize the devices and assess the repair. The guide is positioned over the MV and the clip delivery system is inserted into the guide and positioned over the MV in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The delivery catheter is advanced until the clip emerges from the tip of the guide into the left atrium. The catheter is manipulated using the control handle until the clip is correctly oriented with respect to the line of coaptation of the mitral valve. The clip is opened, and advanced across the mitral valve into the left ventricle then pulled back to grasp the leaflets.</description>
