    <textblock>
      Study introduction: this is a multicenter, randomized controlled study of patients with&#xD;
      histopathologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not previously received&#xD;
      systematic treatment for HCC, all the patients are Chinese stage IIb/IIIa (BCLC stage B/C),&#xD;
      and have not developed extrahepatic metastases. Follow-up, data collection and analysis will&#xD;
      be performed for patients who meet the study inclusion criteria and will be treated with&#xD;
      lenvatinib plus toripalimab and TACE (on demand) or TACE alone, so as to compare the&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), ratio&#xD;
      of conversion resection, and safety between the two cohorts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group: patients with potentially resectable HCC who meet the study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be treated with lenvatinib in combination with toripalimab and TACE (on&#xD;
      demand). Tumor response will be regularly evaluated, data will be collected, and complete&#xD;
      surgical resection will be evaluated by an independent review committee, the conversion&#xD;
      resection rate will be calculated, and patient survival will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: patients with potentially resectable HCC who meet the study inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be treated with TACE. Tumor response will be regularly evaluated, data will be&#xD;
      collected, and complete surgical resection will be evaluated by an independent review&#xD;
      committee, the translational resection rate will be calculated, and patient survival will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of study treatment for each subject is expected to be 48 weeks, with&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation by the MDT after 2 TACE treatments to determine whether subjects meet the&#xD;
      surgical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter, randomized controlled study. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR). Historical data showed that the objective response rate of&#xD;
      patients in the TACE group was about 40%. The objective response rate of lenvatinib in&#xD;
      combination with toripalimab and TACE is expected to reach 60%. Using a two-sided Z test of&#xD;
      pooled variance, α is set to 0.05, power is set to 0.8, and patients will be assigned at a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. The required sample sizes are 98 (treatment group) and 98 (control group), and a&#xD;
      total of 220 subjects are planned to be prospectively observed, taking into account a dropout&#xD;
      rate of 10%.&#xD;
