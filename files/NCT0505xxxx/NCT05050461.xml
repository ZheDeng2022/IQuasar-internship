  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific immune response to SARS-CoV-2 includes a humoral response - specific IgM&#xD;
      appearing 5 days after the onset of symptoms while IgG appears after 14 days - and a T&#xD;
      lymphocyte component, with specific activated CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes (Dan JM et al.,&#xD;
      Science 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality from infection varies greatly depending on the age of the affected subjects and&#xD;
      their comorbidities including a history of cancer (Liang W et al, 2020). Among these cancers,&#xD;
      a history of malignant hemopathy in the 5 years preceding the onset of Covid-19 increases the&#xD;
      risk of death by a factor of 3 (OpenSAFELY collaborative 2020). Among them, lymphoid&#xD;
      hemopathies induce hypogammaglobulinemia and / or lymphopenia. These factors combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments promote the development of infections in affected&#xD;
      individuals. Among these, are the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, widely prescribed for&#xD;
      treating B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL). They induce a deep and lasting B-cell&#xD;
      lymphopenia, which can promote infections (Maschmeyer G et al, 2019). They reduce the&#xD;
      production of antibodies and the constitution of memory responses to a new pathogen or to a&#xD;
      vaccination. In addition, B lymphocytes likely have a key immunomodulatory role in the&#xD;
      control of viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a retrospective study in 89 patients with lymphoma and Covid-19 after the first&#xD;
      phase of the epidemic in different centers in the Île-de-France and eastern France regions&#xD;
      (Lamure S et al. , 2020). With a 6-month follow-up, we showed a pejorative prognostic impact&#xD;
      of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment on Covid-19-related mortality (Duléry et al,&#xD;
      2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination of these at-risk patients is therefore essential. A growing concern is how&#xD;
      patients with B-NHL who have been vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine are protected&#xD;
      against infection, depending on whether or not they have received anti-CD20 monoclonal drugs&#xD;
      and / or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the medium-term immunological evolution after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      patients with B-cell NHL is necessary in order to be able to adapt the therapeutic and&#xD;
      vaccine recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine how recent treatment (in the year before&#xD;
      vaccination) with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody modifies the immune response after&#xD;
      vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in adults with B-NHL compared to patients who have not&#xD;
      recently been exposed to this immunotherapy.&#xD;
