      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the blockage of the airway causes a person to stop&#xD;
      breathing involuntarily for 10 seconds or more throughout the night during sleep. Pediatric&#xD;
      OSA can be especially concerning and can have long-term effects. Researchers want to see how&#xD;
      a monitoring device called near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) compares with the traditional&#xD;
      techniques used in children s sleep studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about oxygen levels in the brain and limbs in children with and without sleep apnea&#xD;
      using a wearable, point-of-care biosensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 3-8 who have OSA and plan to receive treatment (OSA group) or who do not have&#xD;
      OSA (NORM group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records. If they have taken part&#xD;
      in other NIH studies, that data will be reviewed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the NORM group will have 1 overnight study visit. Those in the OSA group will&#xD;
      have 2 overnight study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will do an overnight sleep study. They will have a physical exam and medical&#xD;
      history. They will have a sleep study electroencephalography (EEG). For this, electrodes will&#xD;
      be placed on their head. They will wear a gauze cap to keep the electrodes in place. Two NIRS&#xD;
      probes made of a soft silicon will be placed on their forehead and arm. They will follow&#xD;
      their normal bedtime routine. Their parent will stay overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OSA group will have a second study visit 2 weeks to 12 months after they start treatment&#xD;
      for their sleep apnea. They will repeat the sleep study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will investigate the feasibility of near-infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS) for the monitoring of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (POSA). NIRS can provide a&#xD;
      direct examination of brain oxygen saturation that traditional sleep study measurements are&#xD;
      not able to capture and may be capable of better explaining health outcomes related to this&#xD;
      disease. The purpose of this study is to characterize a wearable, point-of-care NIRS device&#xD;
      that measures multiple physiological signals with a focus on cerebral and peripheral&#xD;
      oxygenation in children with obstructive sleep apnea and to establish the relationship&#xD;
      between traditionally measured parameters during sleep studies (polysomnography) and NIRS&#xD;
      technologies. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the Sleep and&#xD;
      Neurodevelopment Service at the NIH Clinical Center. Care will not be altered for any&#xD;
      patients and this study will be purely observational with no significant risk added to any&#xD;
      patient. We hypothesize that NIRS measurements of cerebral and peripheral tissue oxygenation&#xD;
      will correlate with respiratory flow and oxygen saturation measured with PSG. We further&#xD;
      hypothesize that treatment of POSA will lead to fewer and lower amplitude cerebral&#xD;
      desaturation events.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent: Parent/caregiver (legal guardian) can give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/caregiver must be able to stay overnight with child during sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged 3 to 8 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pediatric OSA is most commonly associated with ages 2-8. However, children under the age of&#xD;
        3 are more prone to complications with T &amp; A surgery and would be more susceptible to&#xD;
        issues with probe placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For NORM group: Children without OSA (AHI&lt;1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For OSA group: Children with OSA (AHI&gt;=5) who have agreed to undergo T&amp;A surgery or&#xD;
             receive CPAP therapy, are under the care of an outside provider, and agree to&#xD;
             follow-up between 2 weeks-12 months after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children of NICHD employees&#xD;
&#xD;

             dependency, or history of stroke or major neurologic insult. Taking any medications&#xD;
             that is known to change sleep parameters within 2 weeks of screening polysomnogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any head injuries or physical conditions that would affect probe signal and contact&#xD;
             including lacerations, hematomas, hirsutism, and bone disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
