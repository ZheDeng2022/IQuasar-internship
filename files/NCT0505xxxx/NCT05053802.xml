      Prospective, multi-center, phase II clinical trial. The study plans to enroll 146 patients&#xD;
      with multiple lung cancers. After signing the informed consent, they were screened to meet&#xD;
      the admission and discharge criteria, and received microwave ablation treatment.&#xD;
      Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscope-guided intrapulmonary microwave ablation or&#xD;
      percutaneous microwave ablation was selected according to the patient's wishes and the&#xD;
      evaluation of the surgeon. After the operation, they were randomized and the experimental&#xD;
      group accepted PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (microwave ablation combined with&#xD;
      Camrelizumab treatment does not exceed 16 cycles, or disease progression/worsening or&#xD;
      confirmed imaging disease progression, or withdrawal for any reason), the control group does&#xD;
      not After receiving any treatment, the two groups were followed up closely (36 months after&#xD;
      the last treatment, including safety follow-up and survival follow-up).&#xD;
