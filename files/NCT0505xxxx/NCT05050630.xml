  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, Phase II clinical study. Compared&#xD;
      with the literature data, objective response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CR) were&#xD;
      the primary endpoint, and 1-year and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 2-year&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) were the secondary endpoint. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      TR2-ICE sequential Tirelarizin, lenalidomide alone, or both maintenance therapy in the rescue&#xD;
      of patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B or high-grade B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients eligible for inclusion were treated with TR2-ICE, and the first efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation was conducted after the second course of treatment. If the patient can achieve&#xD;
      complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and disease stability (SD), the clinical&#xD;
      benefit is considered, and the TR2-ICE treatment regimen is continued. The second efficacy&#xD;
      assessment was performed after the 4th course of treatment. If patients achieved complete&#xD;
      response (CR) or partial response (PR) compared to baseline, the clinical treatment was&#xD;
      considered effective and the TR2-ICE treatment regimen was continued. After the completion of&#xD;
      six courses of induction chemotherapy, an end-of-course assessment was performed. Patients&#xD;
      with CR and PR can choose to undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      consolidation therapy, or lenalidomide or Tirelarizin monotherapy or both combination&#xD;
      maintenance therapy. If patients still had SD after four courses of treatment or PD at any&#xD;
      time during the study, they were dropped out of the study and given salvage therapy.&#xD;
