    <textblock>
      This study was conducted for clinical evaluation of the quality of different minimal-invasive&#xD;
      treatment modalities and combination treatments in esthetics improvement of mild to moderate&#xD;
      fluorosed teeth using two different evaluation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and sixty fluorosed teeth were included in this study. Prior to the&#xD;
      interventions, pre-operative photographs were taken as baseline records. After that teeth&#xD;
      were randomly allocated in eight treatment protocols with twenty teeth (n=20) included in&#xD;
      each protocol. Protocol one (P1) Opalescence™ boost™ PF 40%. Protocol two (P2) Opalustre™.&#xD;
      Protocol three (P3) MI-Paste Plus®. In protocol four (P4) teeth were treated with Opalustre™&#xD;
      followed by Opalescence™ boost™ PF 40%. In protocol five (P5) Opalescence™ boost™ PF 40% was&#xD;
      applied followed by MI-Paste Plus®, while in protocol six (P6) Opalustre™ was applied&#xD;
      followed by MI-Paste Plus®. Whereas protocol seven (P7) teeth were treated with Opalustre™&#xD;
      followed by Opalescence™ boost™ PF 40% and lastly MI-Paste Plus®. Protocol eight (P8)&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All teeth were evaluated immediately after treatment (T1), after 14 days (T2), after 3 months&#xD;
      (T3) and after 6 months (T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were rated for &quot;improvement in appearance&quot; and &quot;change in white/brown opaque areas&quot;&#xD;
      using VAS through two blinded evaluators by comparing photographs of each follow-up time&#xD;
      point with baseline. &quot;Patient satisfaction&quot;, &quot;tooth sensitivity&quot; and &quot;requirements for&#xD;
      further treatments&quot; were recorded by the participant.&#xD;

      This study was conducted for clinical evaluation of the quality of different minimal-invasive&#xD;
      treatment modalities and combination treatments in esthetics improvement of mild to moderate&#xD;
      fluorosed teeth using two different evaluation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials used in this study were Opalustre™ (microabrasion paste of 6.6% hydrochloric acid&#xD;
      and Silicon Carbide), Opalescence™ Boost™ PF 40% (in-office bleaching of 40% hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide) and MI-Paste Plus® (topical remineralizing tooth crème of casein phosphopeptide&#xD;
      amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and sixty fluorosed teeth were included in this study. Prior to the&#xD;
      interventions, pre-operative photographs were taken as baseline records. After that teeth&#xD;
      were randomly allocated in eight treatment protocols with twenty teeth (n=20) included in&#xD;

      followed by MI-Paste Plus®. Whereas protocol seven (P7) teeth were treated with Opalustre™&#xD;
      followed by Opalescence™ boost™ PF 40% and lastly MI-Paste Plus®. Protocol eight (P8)&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All teeth were evaluated immediately after treatment (T1), after 14 days (T2), after 3 months&#xD;
      (T3) and after 6 months (T4).&#xD;

      point with baseline. &quot;Patient satisfaction&quot;, &quot;tooth sensitivity&quot; and &quot;requirements for&#xD;
      further treatments&quot; were recorded by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected, checked, revised and organized in tables and figures using Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel 2016.Improvement in appearance, change in opacity, tooth sensitivity, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and requirement for further treatment were not normally distributed (p&lt;0.05*)&#xD;
      i.e. nonparametric data, accordingly, Freidman's test to differentiate between timepoints and&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis to compare between treatment protocols were applied at 0.05 level.&#xD;
