    <description>At the first face-to-face the subject will be trained on the app, and complete the OLSA. After 2 week home trial, the OLSA will be re-administered to see if the adjustments the subjects made using the MyPhonak Junior app impacted speech intelligibility, which would be shown by the OLSA score at the second face-to-face visit.</description>

    <description>It is a prospective study to investigate whether the MyPhonak Junior app can improve speech understanding in children with hearing aids, by evaluating the use of the volume, noise reduction and directional microphone using the MyPhonak Junior App.. The study is linked to randomized patient and test allocation carried out.&#xD;
Introduction to the MyPhonak Junior app. There are measurements of speech understanding of sentences Carried out in background noise with the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA). The language test is hard of hearing children and adolescents known from routine clinical practice. Various everyday situations / noise scenarios are played out. Questionnaire (E-HAK, also known from routine) and interview of the children regarding the use of the app in everyday life.</description>

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the effects on speech intelligibility of resulting from the changes that children and adolescents (aged 7 to 17 years) make to the volume control, directionality and noise reduction of the hearing of the hearing aids using the myPhonak app. First, in a controlled laboratory environment under the guidance of the principal investigator is tested. Then, using sound scenarios, the child is allowed to try out two programs with the aid of using the app and the volume control, respectively. After this, the speech comprehension of sentences in noise is tested in the individual programs using the Oldenburg Sentence Test (OLSA).</description>
